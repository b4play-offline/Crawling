41,"Concept-wise, it is alright. Only fun for the first couple of hours but then the game runs out of content. The levels are not difficult at all and they are mostly repetitive. What I dislike most is the fact that the music is dull. I guess the majority bought the game thanks to online streamers - making it look interesting with dramatic reactions; but when you finally acquire the game, it just sits in your library, forever. There are much better games out there for you and your friends."

141,"[h1]Reaching for Opportunities with Both of Their Hands![/h1]

Two pudgy humanoid figures have great difficulty in grasping objects, but great ease in making everyone laugh. Played in local coop splitscreen.

Hello everyone and welcome to another game review. Today we are taking a look at Human Fall Flat.

This game is a riot! and a very enjoyable coop/solo experience, I recommend NOT looking for tutorials as it makes the playthrough a lot more fun of a misadventure. That was the way me and my guest did in this playthrough. The puzzles are imaginative and use various aspects of physics (outlined in next section) that are simple to understand but hard to maneuver at times. This light hearted game was played with a gamepad and I would recommend using one for this.

[h1]First Time Playthrough: Fingerprints on a Trainwreck[/h1]

The game itself only told the players of how to move their arms and grab. No other dynamics therein. So of course naturally we decided to try and climb the train, which should've been a simple task. To our surprise we were met with hilarious difficulty in doing so! The controls are rib ticklingly awkward and climbing was harder than anticipated. We tried picking up and stacking rocks to jump on the train better and so many other platforming ideas. After dozens of minutes of this we finally climbed the train and into the next area with traincars. Only to fumble around for another 20 minutes trying to scramble, stack debris, fail, and clamber towards the bright green exit sign. It was an hour of laughs and terrible climbing, however after this point the game itself explains itself a bit more (but that's another topic).

[h1]Gameplay: A Physics Wonderland[/h1]

You can grab, break, climb, push, throw, jump, and whatever else you can come up with to get to the end of the level. In this level we carry debris and climb to reach our goals, but there was likely another solution present. Featuring dynamic physics and interactions with physical objects, you can solve each level YOUR way. With various maneuvers to get around obstacles there is always more than one way to solve it. Sometimes it's easier than you think! The physics are fun and the puzzles are clever and often come with a plethora of solutions or shortcuts. The physics are well implemented and are consistent throughout the game. Implementing new twists on the old gameplay as time goes on.

[h1]A Fun and Light Aesthetic[/h1]

The game itself has a witty and booming narrator telling you of ""Humans and how they reach out with both of their little hands"" etc. on top of that the animation is light-hearted and the ragdoll character models are quite silly as they go about their actions. Despite this silly and light hearted look the game itself is a solid array of physics sandbox puzzles. The graphics are not intricate but well modeled and well done.

[h1]So Much to Do and yet there's more?[/h1]

Me and my guest completed the main game in a little over 8 hours in total without tutorials. It was a blast!. Even after that there is still an array of bonus levels and player created workshop levels to explore.

[h1]Overall Review: Keep it Short[/h1]

This game is a 5/5 star coop/single player puzzle experience, if you don't look up tutorials and figure them out yourself. I purchased it on sale for 7USD and think it is even worth the full 20 dollar price tag. An incredibly fun physics sandbox puzzler with a lighthearted feel, and even better with friends. Worth adding to your collection and will give you numerous hours of fun and is a thoroughly enjoyable time for all involved. Don't forget to follow for more game reviews and whatever else I might be posting!"

143,"silly funny little man doing the big floppy doo daas all the time

145,"A fun game with challenging puzzles, creative character skins, and plenty of levels. May cause some lag on certain computers, but you can still play it well. Plus, if you ever get bored of the main game, there's always the steam workshop to add more levels and such. Overall, great game, and I recommend it."

168,"I really really really want to like this game and recommend it. Unfortunately, according to the Discussion board, there is a major issue that has been unresolved for years now: the camera.

Some players are calling it ""camera shake,"" I found it to feel more like an issue with the camera autocenter, but whatever it is, it is nauseating. Unfortunately, I can't play for longer than a couple minutes before I have to stop because the camera makes me feel ill and there is no option to adjust or mute this feature.

After doing a search through the Discussion threads it appears as though this has been a complaint as far back as Sept 1, 2017, so it doesn't appear as though the Devs have any intention on fixing this issue.

If they fixed this issue I would highly recommend this game. It's a bit frustrating, but if you just think of it as a drunk simulator, it's a blast. The maps are bigger than I expected and the way you traverse to the end is completely up to your imagination (though there's clearly an intended method, I found myself ""swing climbing"" my way past quite a few sections just to see if I could - you can).

With the nauseating camera, and the Dev's apparent disinterest in fixing it, I have to give this game a 3/10; if they were to fix it, I could see this being a solid 9/10.

Cheers."

257,"Just buy it and enjoy.
I finally start to learn how interesting this game is. Official levels are so well designed that there is always some cheat path that leads you directly to the end via wall climbing or super jumping. But if you really want to dig deeper into the game and try to get all the achievements, you will start to appreciate how puzzles are put up together. It urges you to think outside the box, [spoiler]to break glass with rubber boats, to break a wall with wooden box or just another stone, to step on the tip of a tree or to step on a rolling ball[/spoiler]. And there are more paths for you to explore. 
It also provides players easy ways to make your own map. While crafting their game with unity engine provided by others, some of them might grow to be excellent game makers in the future. And I love how the community of Human Fall Flat to keep on creating to inject vim and vigor to the game to this date."

263,"This game is by far one of the most fun games I've ever played.  It's so much fun with friends or just random people you can find in different lobbies! Also, the workshop levels are very fun too. I'm looking forward to more developer-made levels and can't wait for more!! If there's one thing I would have to not like about this game, it's the lack of crossplay. :)"

But after some time, you will only want to come back if there's new content. There's been quite a few map releases recently, all from the community, and there's what the steam workshop has to deliver,  but it can get old, and almost like you're forcing yourself to play.

Lost story short, I don't think this game is worth $20 USD. $15 is an upper limit. But when you have the game, it's fun."

This game and its generous modding community has provided so much heartfelt fun. This game is widely popular in china it looks like and they do a pretty good job of making some crazy levels for this game (Although be sure to test some of the maps before you bring them to your friends!). Playing this by yourself might be a little dull or frustrating, but if you got a good 3-8 people then this game is an absolute blast."

299,Fun at the beginning but became tedious and repetitive after about an hour. The map and puzzle variety was good but ultimately felt like being asked to do household chores while overly intoxicated. Camera angles could use some work. I wouldn't recommend this to those who like games with the responsive and tight controls in traditional platformers.

329,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing . I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."
330,Fix the camera so when I move it doesnt center the camera
331,"very fun, some minor bugs, but fun"
332,"It´s really fun, if you play with friends..sometimes a bit tricky!"

335,"easy to play, no mods needed to make the experience better. I like how the characters waddle"
336,"ohuklno'n,lkk,kk,,  kjjnkjhb"
337,"I can't stress enough how fun this game is with even just one friend. It is super hilarious and the physics and puzzles of the game make it so much more interesting in comparison to other games.

It also makes a really good game to play as a couple, which is an added bonus that this game provides.

You solve puzzles, do parkour, and figure out your way through each level - some more enjoyable than others, but it is all personal preference. Sometimes there are tools or machines to play with, or tons of jumping to do, or you might even get stuck on a level like I did on my first time playing.

Super enjoyable game to go for the achievements in as well."
338,good game

My balls are covered with ash and every time they are whipped out in the middle of a fortnite game, I end up breathing in the ash and dying. However, I have created a solution. It is called Human Fall Flat. This game slowly eats away at the ash on my balls. My balls have never looked better. I have been running from the police for about 12 years and they're getting a little bit angry. They even furrowed their brows! Boy, are they pissed."

506,"they are unwilling or unable to fix the camera.
the camera is linked to the physics model head system which bobs and sways with every character step or motion. this makes the game intolerable for more than a few minutes and causes motion sickness and head aches... otherwise it would be one of the best games ever made imo.

582,"Alright. This game is very amazing. For me, its even nostalgic. Like 4 or 5 years ago I played split screen with my friend and I've been hooked. I ended up getting the game on my PS4 and then one day i got the PC version. Enough about me, here's the real review.

Human: Fall Flat is extremely fun and challenging at some points. I love the way that if you don't wanna do something, just do some parkour and get over it. The game is not linear at all,  and while the levels usually contain one pretty obvious path, you can also find other things that are usually shortcuts, like the zip line in Castle. The puzzle solving is also good. The physics make everything the perfect amount of challenging. With friends, this game is 10 times more fun. (and easy) Some maps especially on workshop actually REQUIRE you to have more than one person unless you wanna parkour, like the part after the pole swing in castle. It's also alot funnier. Seeing my friend jump to try and get to me and just falling to his death was the best thing ever. A big reccomendation of mine would be get a friend and yourself in a parkour map and then have one friend always grabbing the others back with one arm. It's very challenging but with enough coordination it's very possible and very fun.

Graphics: 8/10(not realistic but good style)
Gameplay: 17/10
Puzzles: 7/10
Animations: 4/10 (there is just walk and jump and they are funny)
Fun with friends: 20/10

607,"Human fall flat is a challenging puzzle game which enhances your cerebrum's ability to solve formidable enigmas.
 It requires you to guide the falling object on its path through as few obstacles and gaps as possible, while keeping the object away from walls and other objects that may prevent it from reaching the goal or could cause damage to you or the object itself! The objective of this game is simple: it must reach the goal within 30 seconds in order for the next level to be unlocked and the game can continue without being reset back to the beginning again!

Features :
* Simple yet engaging gameplay with addictive gameplay loop
* Multiple levels each one more challenging than the previous one
* Over 20 unique falling objects to find out in the game
* Different game modes like time attack mode and survival mode
* Collect special powers by collecting stars along the way
* Amazing soundtrack composed by award winning composer Andrew Aversa
* Various difficulty options available

627,"There is 4 achivements you cannot obtain whatsoever because the devs forgot to release the map for them. The least you could've done is REMOVE the achivements for the completionists out there. Anyway, I had fun completing achivements, and wetting a bed in a river. Yes, it is also an achivement."
628,one of the games ever
629,hours of entertainment
630,This is the best sandbox for laughter I've used on steam. Every time I've played I've actually laughed so hard I cried a little bit
631,"as a bisexual, i love being a human and falling"
632,I love violently throwing my friends off of cliffs
633,Cyberbullying Simulator
634,"it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
"
635,"Only get this game if you can convince your friends to play with you. I dropped 20 dollars on it and only have 2 hours of game time, but despite that I think it's a fun group experience. I just wish my friends and I weren't so good at games because we finished it faster than I would have liked. Probably best to wait for a sale I think, $20 might be a bit overpriced."
636, funny puzzle game to play with friends
637,make sure you have friends
638,This is one of my favorite games to play with friends

652,Its like if portal and gang beasts had a sane child.
653,i like human because i am human because human is being human and human is being good human and not  bad human so when say i no want be human think of  human fall flat because human fall flat is very human
654,"it good 
"
655,yes
656,"i am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.





100% original"
657,Amazing and fun
658,"This game isn't a good buy if you were planning on buying it for multiplayer. You regularly get kicked out of lobbies (and there are few) or there is bad server lag.

Co-op with someone you know is the only way."
659,its fun. even more fun with friends
660,"I'll never understand the appeal of this game.

Frustrating to play, gives me a headache after 10 minutes. Kids don't think much of it either.

I wouldn't advise buying it."
661,"it's a little laggy but still fun to play and there adding new levels all the time and you can play with friends.
speaking of playing with friends, it's a little Erie and scary (kinda like the backrooms) when you play alone.
overall great game! i think you should try it!"
662,the singleplayer isn't fun
663,"an easy top 10 game, has the great physics of falling and not suffering a broken bone so you can enjoy the high heights and breezing sky on your way down to the concrete floor."
664,"I like the idea of the game and the puzzles and game mechanics seem fun. After playing a few levels though, the combination of the avatar's movement and the camera movement left me feeling nauseous. I have played many many games over many many years and never had this kind of an issue. Shame but it's a no."
665,it good get now
666,mantap
667,Humans falls when falling flat for the game human fall flat.
668,play this game co-op. its so fun to play with friends and goof around. one of the funniest games ive played.
669,"Can be bought as a nice gift, game doesn't ask for much just for a true friendship."
670,yes but i fell down the stairs
671,vjseuhhsadsjadnwaunsdmnnashdwukahsdnaw
672,funly game
673,SUPER fun to play with friends because of how goofy most of the game is played
674,good
675,motherfucker does NOT fall flat
676,"Good game fr fr no cap skull emoji ^ 4, this game be bussin fr fr, Big W"
677,Really fun to play around with physics. The game has tons of fun levels and a never ending supply of new ones from the marketplace. The game can be fun alone but it has the most value with friends and other players. you will probably end up laughing for the entire playtime.
678,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.
"
679,"It is a really fun game with semi-easy controls. My one complaint is that whenever I try to use a controller the right arm bugs out, so its not exactly controller-supported like it claims."
680,Great Game
681,"You Fall Flat, And Your Human, Also Ragdoll Psychis Are Funneh"
682,A goofy game
683,"Although the lack of graphical polish could be seen as a flaw in the game, I really can’t think of a person who wouldn’t enjoy this game on some level. If you’re a fan of puzzle platforming or physical comedy, grab Human: Fall Flat right now."
684,"good game
"
685,Perfect chill game to play with friends from time to time - and still getting new levels frequently!
686,very smooth game. very fun game. definitely gets boring after a while but i still like it
687,I have like 50 hours on this game and I have like so much fun every single time I load the game. Its a really good game and its just like gang beasts. But better....

6/10 clickbait"
694,Good Game
695,Bobuk Fall Flat
696,what ever joke i say here is gonna fall flat
697,"do not buy this.. steam charts state that the monthly average peak is 2k players. yet there is at max 1 lobby with 5/8 players 3 lobbies with 2 players and the rest are 1 player. but thats not even the worst part. when you join a game it will be 1 of 2 things. you will either get disconnected or kicked within less than a minute of being in their and cant rejoin. or it is a childrens server with nothing going on but them standing in the center of the map typing angrily away at one another. and those children servers usually blare music so loud that even with the volume on 2 it still sounds like its blowing out your headphones. idk. the one game i got in, and was able to stay in, was the absolute funniest thing i have ever witnessed. but out of my 1 hour and 45 minutes that is the ONLY funny/fun/worth while experience that happened. sad deal. i was really excited about this game. **sad clown noises**"
698,yes
699,"This is an absolutely amazing game. Definitely recommend.
Little clay people getting flung about, need I say more? I don't, but I will.
I've played this game through, and then through again. Doesn't matter if I know how to solve most levels by heart at this point, you can still find ways to cause mayhem and get into shenanigans. Then there's achievement hunting, and there's a lot of them. Some hard and others simple, but all a pleasing challenge. If you're on the fence about this game, first of all, how? But secondly, just get it. You won't be disappointed. As long as you like physic-based games with wonky characters, that is. Grabbing things may get a little tedious or finicky now and then, but that hasn't stopped me yet."
700,Great two player game. Cooperation makes it challenging in new ways.
701,Too few humans falling flat

2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water

2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

851,"The game is awesome and fun, but has controller issues, it's a bummer we can't map the controller in game.
It won't recognize the Switch pro controller, doesn't matter what configuration I set on Steam, Logitec F710 works but I can only move using the digital pad, analog stick doesn't work. 
It seems this has been happening for a long time, I've seen a lot of people complaining about it in different forums.
PLEASE SOLVE THESE CONTROLER ISSUES!!!"

869,"Simply no: not my kind of game,- for those who like puzzle and controller- or keyboardacrobatics and like to train a virtual bud spencer become a tightrope-acrobat it might be enjoyable.... first minutes and hours i tried sometimes with a giggle but with time its just annoying and little guy completely not following the given orders.
Feels like hard work to me, where i like my games to be detention.
And finally i am sick of games in which achievements dont work: I achieved at least 5 times  ""smooth moves"" and rang that damn bell but no achievements show up. 
Even the counter for the achievement ""die 100times"" doesnt count anymore..."

876,"Way more fun than I expected. I don't think I'd play this by myself, buy get even one buddy in there with you and it's a blast! Puzzles are hard enough that you actually have to think about it, but not so hard that I threw my controller through my monitor either. 

Physics are simple and hilarious!"

1028,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

1044,"i am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

1059,"its a really good game, tho i would suggest doing multiplayer"
1060,Human fall flat is legit one of my favorite games ever and there are some reasons for that. Human fall flat might just be the dumbest game ive ever played (not to be offensive or anything) but im saying its dumb in a good way so thats what makes Human fall flat so unique with its levels customization weird ragdoll physics and much more.... So to finish off Human fall flat is a solid 10/10
1061,"Humans fall flat. That's the game. It's just a goofy physics game where you solve puzzles with friends, and there are no flaws. If you ever wanted to play gang beasts but instead of fighting you just hang out, this is your game."
1062,I didn't know how much fun this game was until I played it myself. it was fun watching YouTube videos but playing it with friends it much much fun. it is important to play it with friends though because the hilarity come from doing goofy stuff together. I don't want to play this alone so now I am waiting for the next opportunity and am still waiting :(

1121,absolutely adore this game great controls fun amount of stress and great sense of accomplishment after beating a level
1122,There is so much!! stop to look aT THE FLAB
1123,"This could be a really fun game, but I don't like the wobbly guy that you really can't control.  Puzzles are fun enough without trying to make them impossible when you know what you need to do.  No logic on the movements that I can see.  The camera angle is impossible.  You want to hold something up while looking straight ahead to see what's in front of you can you can't do both, you have to just remember where to walk by rote.  Sometime when you make an error, you can get out of it, other times, you might as well restart the level from the most recent checkpoint.  Even then, the control make you do different mistakes to restart again.  Bottom line, figuring out the puzzles is fun, but controlling your player isn't.  Games should be relaxing, this one is not."

1169,Got into a fight with a dog that wouldn’t stop touching me.  Climbed walls like I was in Cliff Hanger. Solved some puzzles.  Laughed endlessly at how silly the characters walk and interact. Became obsessed with achievements. Highly recommend 10/10.
1170,What started to be something really innocent ended up in drama and a restraining order. Nice game though...
1171,really funny but play it with friends.
1172,"Funniest game, hella crazy between friends and y'all prolly need smart friends if you decided to play it without google's walkthrough

100/10 break friendship"
1173,Human Fall Flat is a very silly game. You play as a goofy little guy who wobbles and trips. This game is very fun to play by yourself and even better with friends. There's many achievements and secrets to find. 10/10

1193,"I tried playing this game when it first came out and I really struggled with the controls and clearly wasn't in the mood to persevere.

6 years later and I see it as recommended for Steam Deck and figured I would give it another go.

The controls are super frustrating, which is both its downfall and it's charm. Once I was suitably practiced, i was running around like a drunk toddler trying to solve a series of puzzles that take advantage of its physics engine.

There were many situations of saying 'no, surely that can't expect me to do that!' and equally several problems I solved in uncovential/creative manners that looking back, robbed me the opportunity of solving them in the way intended, but gave a different sense of satisfaction in cheating the system.

This game is not for the easily frustrated, but is an excellent example of a puzzle platformer. It does work well on the steam deck although does have a habit of crashing when you finish each level."

1208,"Extremely goofy and relaxing. The puzzles require you to look around and think about it for a second, and the climbing is simple. However, you're most likely going to be trying to drag your friends into the void in the meantime."
1209,hi
1210,FUN!
1211,i recommend this game to others since its very fun and funny and i can say that proudly since i was laughing continuously while watching my sibling play it and respawn many times :) its very fun and a little tedious but i havent raged at it like there is some interest going on there that keeps me from getting mad or its just really funny how youre character does anything even walking
1212,Good and simple fun with friends. Making goofy characters doing goofy things will always be fun. New levels every few months is a treat and the workshop is filled with extra content.

1296,humans do fall flat
1297,best game ever
1298,"I guess I don't see what's so great about this game. I actually like my platformers to have decent controls, so this one was downright infuriating for me to play. I genuinely couldn't take more than what I played already; everything was just so delayed. Maybe I'll give it another go someday, but all of my platforming instincts were screaming in pain playing this."
1299,game keren kek titit
1300,it isnt very good on mac. The controls are really unsensitive and the pause screen opens 5% of the time when trying to actually open it. It might just be the computer I am on but this game lags a ton.

1314,"Awesome game! For context: I play in single player, keyboard and mouse controls, usually for 20-30 minutes per session. The controls take a while to get into, but that is actually part of the game.
A tip regarding key mapping: The game does not allow to map the Alt key (which I use instead of the S in the WASD configuration). As a workarounf, I use the Keyboard Manager of Microsoft's PowerToys to map the Alt key to S (you have to switch on/off before/after a game)."

1368,"Makes this aging man feel like a little kid again playing with his playskool or tonka toys. But this time, actually within the worlds I imagined back then. 

You can play this on your own and have some fun with it.  But if you can play this with a group of friends or family it truly shines.  The levels are imaginative and provide plenty of opportunity for fun and crazy moments.  The puzzles to progress are usually simple, but very satisfying thanks to the game mechanics. The purposely awkward physics let you solve things creatively and intuitively and are a blast once you get used to them.  

This is some of the most pure fun I've had with a game in a while.  Fully recommend picking this up if you have people to play with. If you only play on your own, I'd say say just gauge it by your own interest in the game."

This is a game with wacky physics, its fun but not for every person

[h1]Whats missing[/h1]
The game is super short, i believe that there should be more levels, since there are not a lot.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]
This game has a workshop even doe its a good addition there are not many creators

[h1]story[/h1]
There is no story

[h1]Friends[/h1]
This is game is a must play with friends, without it its boring

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I think its worth buying, but only play with friends since without the game is boring

[h1]Tips[/h1]
Complete the game 100% the game is super enjoyable, it doesnt take 54 hours(i have 54 because i actively speedrun the game). But its just wonderful! Nice job nobrakegames and curvegames"

1478,always a bit of a challenge and they have been adding more and more maps. if you own a switch i would recommend getting this game on that as the port is great and i mean if you dont own a steam deck thats the only way to play it on the go. even better with friends as it opens up new possibilities to complete the missions.
1479,"Had this game purchased by my ex to play it with her and my cousin, never thought I'd actually play it outside of that triangle, I found myself playing it alone and with my cousin alone after a year of not playing it

My personal opinion on the good things

- The games unbelievably entertaining with and without friends
- The achievements were quite fun to hunt
- The physics are somewhat hilarious 

Things I find bad about the game

- The game can be quite annoying at times when it comes to the physics
- The game can become quite repetitive, but the game does have quite a lot of levels with quite a lot of achievements so it does sort of counter-act the repetitiveness
So if you're into wacky physics, semi aggravating and overall entertaining games, I highly recommend this game

Hope this helps! <3"

1485,"Multiplayer is a blast.

Singleplayer is torment."
1486,fun game i always come back to play more
1487,i love this game because it includes teamwork and a lot of fun challenges. I recommend it if you love challenges and playing with family & friends. And new updates come out as well so you can really get bored of human fall flat. i have laughed so much because of this game. its so fun and entertaining.
1488,much fun very physics
1489,good
1490,its fun
1491,"With how popular Human Fall Flat is, content has been somewhat limited until recent. New maps release every so often, about a few months in between each other. Luckily the devs are generous enough to add these new maps for free so not too much to complain about there. Otherwise this is one of the best physics puzzle based games you can play with all your friends and family."

1507,such a good game
1508,Very fun game to do to shenanigans with friends. The Workshop is a nice addition.
1509,"I originally bought this game to play with my boyfriend when we were long distance. Back then, it was incredibly fun to play and explore together. Eventually my brothers bought the game and now we all play together whenever new levels are released. The game itself is incredibly fun and sometimes aggravating (in a good way). The levels challenge your ability to maneuver and present fresh mechanics in almost every single one. If you're thinking about buying the game, wait for it to go on sale during events (like the summer sale and winter)."

Whether your playing for the achievements, having fun with friends, or just want to challenge yourself with puzzles, the game tries its best to make your experience pleasant. My friends and I have explored every part of this game and had some laughs here and there with its funny physics. With updates bringing in new maps every few months, I still come back to this game to enjoy it."

1676,"Funny and entertaining game. Especially with friends in co-op. There are lot of community based levels as well, which also very good."
1677,thank you for the inspiration
1678,"fun game, especially with friends :)"
1679,Its a very fun game its worth buying its funny and fun especially with friends.
1680,"Some simple, good humored fun. Really take the game at any pace you like. Go into the levels without foreknowledge for the highest level of enjoyment. These puzzles have a wide range of difficulty but can be accomplished by anyone who knows their right hand from their left. From casual to hardcore i would recommend this game to anyone.

Another shining example of how a game doesnt need ground breaking cutting edge graphics to be good. And honestly having next-gen graphics would actually hurt this game. The simplicity is quite appealing and i can best describe it as ""Just enough"". The bouncy potato-sack character you control can be goofy at times, especially if trying to cross a gap on a thin pipe, but also results in some quite entertaining ragdoll circumstances when getting pushed, dropped, or thrown into things. As a plus, you get to add certain props and paint your character to some degree, adding even more appeal.

The developers have a great array of ~20 official maps and the community has done well to add even more in the Steam Workshop, just know the quality may vary heavily on that creator's attention to detail. The devs also seem to add a new map twice a year or so. The music is also oddly satisfying and a little motivating, nothing to dance to its just a pleasant experience that helps set a lighthearted puzzle-solving atmosphere. The game does not hold your hand either, which is often attributed to lazy game design, but here, after a short tutorial, the game will expect you to make your own decisions and figure it out on your own, especially nice as there is often more than one way of solving the problem. Once a new puzzle element introduced, like say the batteries, they introduce it in a primitive and digestible form, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the concept and apply it to the more complicated puzzle down the line

I got hooked onto the game by watching Michael and Gavin with The Achievement Hunters on YT play it, but later found Markiplier's videos to also be funny, aside from Mark's general attitude to do anything but the objective, which is both funny and frustrating.

I feel like I could play this game with anyone, I even convinced my father to play the construction site level with me. I didnt even care i did all the levels already, it was just fun to play with someone who hadn't yet."

1831,Very successful game design. Great fun game!
1832,Funny ragdoll
1833,very good
1834,"This game tells me that: In this world, apart from psychological failure, there is actually no failure. As long as it is not a complete failure, you will definitely win. And for the indomitable, there is no such thing as failure.
And it's also full of fun, and I like playing with my friends best. You can spoof them (as long as you're not afraid of being beaten), and you can build friendships with each other.
(So I recommend this game and will support this game forever : )"
1835,loved this game. bob so cute
1836,funne
1837,too good to be true. Pat fusty and benjamin yes
1838,fun and alot of levels
1839,Its so good bro like i smack people's booty checks
1840,"Great game, 7 years on and the Devs are still adding new content. I've bought about 10 copies for friends because it's just that good."
1841,"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this game yet; it's awesome! It's literally the perfect game to play with friends (though still fun soliloquy), and was exactly what I was looking for! It is so fun to figure out the puzzles and complete the levels, and they add new ones every few months, which is really awesome! The levels they add are made by the community who post in the Workshop and participate in the competitions. And if you get bored of what's already there and can't wait for a new map, get your butt over to the workshop and download some more maps and characters. Knowing that No Brakes really cares about the community and interacts with it really feels good. If you're looking through reviews to decide whether or not to get the game, look no further, and just get it!"
1842,it is good
1843,"Fantastic physics based, puzzle, plat-former, party game. Incredibly fun with friends! Every time I've played it my face always hurts from smiling and laughing the entire time. 10/10 experience"
1844,amazing you literally dont need anything else this is all i ever needed in life i love it i want to eat it and shit it out it's so good
1845,A game about toddlers trying to solve complex puzzles with limbs made out of rubber.
1846,"A friend brought this game for me a couple of years ago as a gift so me and a few of our friends could get together and play for some nonsensical fun, We enjoyed playing this. Now the developers have gone out of their way to stab a small group of users in the back. Biggest middle finger I have ever seen. Your reasoning for this was because you want to provide new content for Windows and Mac Users. Personally This is a Pis* poor excuse IMO.

Sort your sh*t out developers!!!! absolute disgrace of a company

If you are on Windows or Mac then yes I can recommend this as a fun Party game but if you are a Linux user then you are out of luck unless you can work some voodoo magic and sell your soul to the devil just to be able to enjoy a fun time with your friends then good luck."
1847,its very good
1848,honestly just a fun game that updates every now and then

1859,"My human did fall flat. A lot. 
This game was crazy fun with my friend, but tbh, after level 6, got kind of repetitive and boring. We found ways to climb around the walls and skip rooms. 
Sure the controls are quirky, but they can be frustrating as hell sometimes.
7.5/10"

1882,qwerdftgzhuji
1883,"The game has a sort of ragdoll-like physics for your character's movements, yet you can still control your character.  The game is sort of wacky yet is hilarious (especially with friends).  The puzzles can be quite challenging and many have secret paths you can take if you are up for the challenge.  All in all, it's a quite fun puzzle game."

1891,Pure fun with friends
1892,"Out of all the games I've played, none could be more entertaining than this game. Definitely a game for a whole group of friends to play together. You'll make lifelong memories."
1893,"I can carry my friends all the time so its really fun, My friend verm isnt very happy when I carry him though but we enjoy this game together, it brings us closer and makes our friendship stronger. Would recommend to everyone if u have friends 10/10"
1894,
1895,"amazingly fun to play through again and again but the ""tricky"" achievement is broken. I have met the requirements half a dozen times and it just doesnt work."
1896,these 372 hours were the best 372 hours of my life play this game RIGHT NOW!
1897,nice silly game to play with friends
1898,its gud
1899,good game
1900,A silly game to play with friends or by yourself. Ragdoll physics are great. Cool mechanics with using your hands to solve puzzles. Get more hours with community maps from the workshop. This game still gets updates with FREE maps to get even more hours.
1901,"I do not write reviews for video games, but this one is quite special. I have replayed this game a dozen times, and each time I revisit the cold depths of Human: Fall Flat's oceans, I feel a sense of revamped adventure that I can't describe, and no other game can pull out of me. Experience this game in its entirety, every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it.

1941,It is wacky in the good way!
1942,among
1943,"The game itself is not what attracts me to this. While a fun puzzle game, with funny game mechanics, what truly makes this game so special is how incredible it is with friends - you can basically mess around in any way you want, and it gives this game so much more replayability, because while each puzzle will remain the same, the actual experience will be different every time."

1989,You fall flat
1990,"An easy-to-play, hard-to-master physics game that will most likely make you laugh. Better with friends!"
1991,have fun
1992,"The game isn't bad per say nor is it buggy its just two ideas that don't mix very well and I started to realize this very early on. I know I don't have much time on the game but the game gets really boring after you put it down and again this is two funny and clever ideas that don't mix very well not the devs fault. really it all comes down to preference if you like slower par-core like games this is for you but if you don't well I think you'll like gang beasts more similar movement but instead you are fighting which makes a world of difference in my opinion. so I personally don't recommend it, you still might like it."
1993,yes
1994,"Attempting to play this game with my girlfriend has been extremely frustrating and helpless. I have tried a thousand different ways to connect multiple different controllers (I.E xbox 1 controller, ps4 controller, and nintendo switch pro controllers) via both bluetooth and connecting through usb. None of which have worked however. When I do connect one controller and add it as the second player, it negates to ability to use mouse and keyboard. So frustrating! I literally don't know what to do at this point. I have tried looking up youtube videos on how to do it and it just won't work. This is either a glitch or this game just isn't able to be played splitscreen. Developers, any thoughts??"

2024,"The logic of the puzzles is fine and interesting, but manipulating the character is so fiddly and imprecise that it cause me constant frustration at having to repeat actions over and over multiple times. I quickly regretted that I purchased this game."
2025,"This game is absolutely not worth the money, even Mario Games with their clumsy mechanics have better controls than this. Also, it's either sticking your arms upwards and being blinder than a mole or jumping and sticking just an inch close to the top of the platform, while you perform greater artistic moves than any circus member just to fail over again. I'd rather play Dark Souls naked, with bare fists, Calamity Ring for Double Damage and on NG+7 than to mentally scar myself over and over again and questioning if I'm completely disabled both physically and mentally because of this excuse of a game. #Körperklaus"

2059,This is easily my favorite game. I highly recommend it.
2060,"Wonderful physics puzzler. Already pretty worth it for the basic levels that come with it, but the free extra levels they've been adding are the real gems here- creative, refreshing, vibrant and just overall lovely. As long as you don't mind the physics being a little wonky (sometimes something might mess up the puzzle even without you making any mistakes) you're good. And because the game has pretty lenient checkpoints, I was rarely upset playing this."
2061,Fun when you and your friend suffering together
2062,Nothing better than a 6 hour human fall flat gaming session with friends playing custom Chinese workshop maps not understanding anything because it's all in Chinese but still enjoying it because they're really well made

-Can't lose and kick players who arent on my server who keep sticking and have their ways with me.
Should also be an option to have a see-through character just so you can aim better
Otherwise it's a fun game with nice puzzles - I love that it's not just gravity physics but things also like being able to bend things aswell. Can't say if it's fun or infuriating when youre in the middle of the puzzle and someone decides to try solving it in their own way"

2092,very good
2093,"Underrated game. Get it, play alone or with your friends. It'll be a lot more fun with friends but it's fairly fun to solve the puzzles on your own. And as of 2022, 5 years after its release, it's still being updated with new content and maps that you don't have to pay for. Kudos to the devs!"
2094,is good game

2107,"After 3 years of trying to find a game me and my kid can play together that just works without hoop jumping BS, we found this one. Multiplayer JUST WORKS! search for friends from the multiplayer menu in game, join friend, BOOM Loading... THANK YOU to the absolute Legend that thought joining friends should be streamlined."
2108,nice
2109,"Full of bugs and definitely not worth full price.

It took me and my friends about an hour to get in a game together. It kept spawning me into a different level.. or off of the map... 

After we were able to play it wasn't a bad physics based puzzle game. I do not recommend."

2113,FUN
2114,funni ragdoll
2115,Wonky controls and lots of social interaction if you can ramp up a few friends to play with. Fun puzzles and more wonky controls. This game is the gaming equivalent of eating tacos. It's impossible to play it multiplayer without socializing. Loads of fun!!

2155,"Human Fall Flat drew me in from the beginning. Completing all of the game's puzzles is difficult yet entertaining, and each one may be solved in a variety of ways. Each level is distinct and amusing in its own way, and there are no repeats. Overall, it's a pleasant game, but it can be irritating at times. While Human Fall Flat is best played with a friend, it can also be played alone (though it is much more difficult). It surely doesn't ""fell flat"" (sorry, I had to). 8.3/10."

2197,"The ultimate 3d wobbly parkour game! It contains lots of fun parkour, physic based and puzzle-filled levels that can be played from just 1 player to 12 BILLION! Okay, I lied. But it can be played with a TRUCKLOAD of people at once. If your up for a brain challenge, then play this game! If you like parkour and platforming, then play this game! And if you like ragdoll physics, then play this game! And if you like all of those, THEN WHY HAVEN'T YOU GOTTEN THIS GAME YET? The only flaw is the paint option in the customization. When you try to paint something on your character, it does this thing where it paints in a random place as well! If you have played this and have used the paint in customization, you might know what I'm talking about. Other than that it is the perfect platforming game and I recommend it to people who like parkour, puzzles, and ragdoll physics."

2241,"Fun silly game great, great for couch play.  However don't play it that much since it only supports 2 players offline and online play drags because nobody communicates.  Really would make a world of difference if you could play with 4-6 people shared screen like Gangbeast."
2242,"For me its excellent co op puzzle game, 20 levels build in game + hundrets of workshop levels (only 30-40% are somewhat playable and 20-30% of it is good. But it still gives you many additional hours) and of course annoying each other is all that I need from this. Price is not bad too but remember that if you dont want to play singleplayer (which is possible but I dont recomend it bc it gives away some of experience of thinking in group) or play localy, your friend must buy this game too. So If you have some one to play and dont mind to use your brain sometimes, its definitive must have to your library. If you dont have anyone to play online, you can always play local on 1 computer as for example party game.  And if local play still isn't an option, solo gaming can still give you a few hours of good puzzle gameplay.

For all the people I have played with I have noticed the increase of bad servers, hosting, and lag. But the worst bit, if the server host lags, your game freezes so you can't even leave."

"
2296,"It's good but I think that it would benefit from a bit of a make over. It should look like red dead 2 and should play like half life 2. Apart from that, the game is great."
2297,"do you like funny ragdolls?
do you like clear levels in new ways?
do you like play with friends

well then this game is for you."
2298,"This is one of the most shi*tiest, most chaotic, and crackhead inducing games I have ever feasted my eyes upon let alone play! Would I ever recommend this game? Hell no! Not in a million years, I would rather accept my ticket to hell (and I know I am goin to hell) than play this game ever again! This game was in no means a bad time if I am to be completely fair and honest, however, I would never go back to play any of the levels over again nor would I play player made levels because if they are anything as bad as the canonical levels then I know the player made games are HELL!!! Only play this game with friends and even then expect to have a time... good or bad? Well that is up to you... Some of the levels were complete and utter bull shit and frustrating for zero reason! I can't stress this enough, just don't buy this game unless you are into games like getting over it! :|"
2299,This game THIS GAME IS AN AMAZING GAME. Provided you like janky 3D platformer games and is still getting updates to this very day. It also has tons of workshop content to explore for hours. Pick it up on sale for less than $10 and enjoy. Bonus points in you drag anywhere from 1-7 friends with you. The main campaign is somewhere from 8-10 hours and I guarantee you will laugh atleast once. Also not some solutions have more than one way to solve them so dont be discouraged if you have to brute force it sometimes. Overall Solid 9/10 game
2300,Delightful silly fun.  Best played with a few friends.
2301,"fall flat

2302,"Controls take a lot of getting used to, and are frustrating at first. Jumping puzzles can be frustrating even after playing for hours. But calm, relaxing puzzles with a good soundtrack and lots of fan-made content. And they add ""official"" levels with achievements every 6 months or so to make my pointless achievement-addicted butt keep coming back..."

2344,"So many fun nights spent with the 8 of us wiggling around...  The platforming is imprecise, which only adds to the game's hilarity.  Seriously, get 8 people around and this is one of the funniest games you will ever play!  There's also a competent character creator for decorating your little human guy and you can really inject some personality into it.  One of our friends was able to accurately recreate 2B from Nier: Automata, even with panties on the underside.  You can imagine how many laughs we've had about it!

If you have any friends, for the love of god buy this game.  Easily worth 20 bucks though it regularly goes on sale for 8 dollars too."
2345,İndirimde alınabilir. Güzel bir parkur oyunu. Resmi haritaların daha fazla olmasını isterdim. Arkadaşlarınızla çok keyifli oluyor. Tavsiye ederim. Mekanikler başta farklı geliyor ama alışıyorsunuz merak etmeyin. Düşük sistem dostu sayılır.

2417,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

2444,Descent game to play with a friend if you don't have anything else to do. Buy it on sale otherwise it isn't really worth it because nothing really happens. You'll have a small period playing this game and won't probably never touch it again. Almost everything else on the store is more fun lmao
2445,The best for playing 2gether w/ your friends
2446,Great game!  but I hate the part when I drowned 47 times in the boat part 👎👎
2447,It's shuuuuper fun to play with friends!

very good lore and great gameplay 
i love slaying dragons in this game :D

2449,good geam
2450,fun puzzle sloving game
2451,"This game is good with all of the quality but its trash. Why? Because the controls in the game never fit your own controlling on your keyboard. When you press jump it jumps too lately then how you want it to be while doing parkour, the character is TOO wobbly even when you change your screen view, when your by a cliff you fall automatically. There is a tutorial in how to climb in this game in the map mountain. It tells you how to jump, grab, pull and climb but when doing harder maps, while climbing your character is just stuck there. ??!! So how tf am I suppose to climb now? While grabbing the character's arms and legs, it gets tangled by itself and never comes out easily. There are so many more stressful things in control. But the artist's quality and everything about the entertainment is a fine group of it. I got it when it was on sale, for 7.00 dollars it's worth it but for 20.00? Please don't."
2452,Definetly worth the price
2453,"play this game with friends
so you have some companion to suffer together"

2468,"This is a really fun game to play with friends, there are many paths you can take on the levels and you have the freedom to mess around however you would like. Whether you want to play the game as it is meant to be played, or play hide 'n' seek, it is a really fun game to play!"
2469,h
2470,It's really fun to play with friends and family. (It's even more fun when you get the Hooman mod)
2471,AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY MA RANAA
2472,"Incredible game to play with my fiance. It was mildly infuriating, but overall an absolute pleasure to play. Would highly recommend to play co-op for some good laughs!"
2473,"Pro: it looks very very funny (you're piloting a kind of rubber humanoid) and the first few levels are fun and playable. Running around with your weird floppy rubbery friends is hilarious. 
Con: this is an ergonomic nightmare if you have even the slightest limitation on your hand use or coordination. After the first few levels some of the jumps become incredibly hard and I hit the limitation of my frustration tolerance pretty hard."
2474,"Very fun game, love playing it with friends.

2502,I love falling flat on my face
2503,Fun puzzle game that a friend gifted me. I do not think it is worth the sale price since it is very lacking in levels unless you plan on exploring every polygon of the level. I did not even take solving the levels seriously and am already half way through in 10 hours (1 i afkd). Maybe worth about 5 USD or 6 CAD.
2504,"fun game, I've played on console before and having access to all the community created maps make the replay-ability worth it.
always new maps and things to try out. 4.5\5

also be aware to play this your controller needs to be plugged into your PC, or else the grab buttons don't work properly."

2519,this game is fucking good

2596,"do not play this game without your friends

2597,"movement takes a bit to get used to, controller is required basically 

community has a lot of levels so there's basically infinite playtime"
2598,ITS FUN WITH FRIENDS
2599,my friend WB made me play this
2600,"Because of this game, I lost 150 pounds of weight, finally went out and touched some grass, went to the gym, and got a girlfriend. Thank you HFF"
2601,"Surprisingly A Lot More Fun Than I Thought It Would Be... Thought I Would Play This For A Few Hours And Then Get Board Of It, But I Actually Want To Keep Playing...  Online Multiplayer And Co-op Split Screen Are Very Good As Well... Would Recommend 8/10 Would Like To See More Levels And More Character Customisation..."
2602,Very epic gamer game
2603,Amazing and funny game! played for 2 - 3 years and never got bored! NOT EVEN ONCE.
2604,.
2605,Wow! A great game with great physics!
2606,좋음
2607,add sex update

2609,"Very good, get steam version for custom map's... You have to subcribe to them then you go to subscrbed maps."
2610,It's a legendary game.
2611,goooood
2612,Had very unforgettable memories playing it with my girl friend. We found some unusual yet funny ways to go pass some levels. It's a pity not having recorded the process.
2613,it gets boring
2614,"stupd gme
"
2615,I bought this game just to play with my gilrfriend but splitscreen won't work on the controller. Can this game developer even code!?
2616,Cool.
2617,I grabbed a lot of butts
2618,its just a cool ragdoll game for people that love obbies and puzzles
2619,"E
"

"
2621,"""Everything changed when the asian tribe attacked"""
2622,"i fucking hate the physics and thats why this game is godlike
"
2623,"The whole ragdoll mechanic can be quite funny at times but honestly when can be quite frustrating at times due to the difficulty of controlling the player to perform certain actions to fulfil a puzzle requirement. For example, when attempting to lift up the wooden plank in the aztec level can result in the camera angle changing rapidly which is really distracting. It would definitely be fun with friends as you would probably overlook these issues over enjoying their company, but for solo plays, the ragdoll mechanics can be annoying for levels which requires a lot of interactions with objects. This game is a 7/10 for me on good days, and a 3/10 for me on bad days."
2624,"I play with my son and this is some of the most fun gaming we have together.  There's something about dangling off the edge of a cliff and pulling the other person up that just never gets old.

There are so many workshop levels out there, too.  Most are high quality and feel as good as the original levels in the game.

Just good vibes with goofy physics fun.  Controls are clunky at first, but if you bother to watch the in-game tutorials you'll be Tarzan."
2625,I do recomend
2626,uh fun yass play it
2627,naice
2628,"I really love game like once you start playing you can't stop playing, I just wish for people who play the game on PS4 or Xbox they could some how play levels that other people have made because it is only like that on PC. They can make levels and then have them be posted on all platforms."
2629,"oh heck yeah
"
2630,"Shitty game, shitty controls, shitty levels, everything is shitty."
2631,An amazing game to play with friends!
2632,"Playing human fall flat with a friend makes it so much easier since you can cheese a lot of missions. But playing it alone makes it boring since this game is very minimalistic and it becomes repetitive after some time. Not worth 20eu though, buy it on sale."
2633,This game is fun but it's slow in loading.
2634,cool
2635,flat on the ground
2636,amazing game. wish there's more map

2647,"My girlfriend told me that she would never pay for games such as this one, as she believed that it cost too much and that she would not play games such as this in the long run. However, I decided to buy it for her out of my pocket - AND SHE WAS OBSESSED. I tell you. Wait till' there is sale and buy this game. I got so much pussy that day and you will too! If you don't have a girlfriend, you will have one, one day once you buy this game."
2648,"quite fun, especially with friends."
2649,Good game but very laggy for my low end pc but otherwise best game every played
2650,Amazing and funny game. Can't even count how many times we just bursted laughing with my friends while playing. 100% recommend.
2651,I've wanted to play it since it came out but thought it wouldn't be fun solo. Surprisingly though it truly is fun whether solo or not
2652,i love playing the game you shuld instaalit
2653,Fun and very entartaining! recomended for group
2654,epic
2655,"not fun after the first few hours, i played almost all the maps, i couldnt find any fun out of it."
2656,Yes.
2657,"verry good
"
2658,good
2659,"This game is ...(drum roll please) GREAT!!!! It is so fun it is almost addicting. The achievements can be a little overwhelming (if you think 99 is a lot and you are planing on getting TF2, 520 achievements are waiting for you).  I definitely recommend getting this game.  If you end up getting human fall flat, then have fun and good luck!           P.S. it is eraser with 2 or more players"

2681,"Einzigartiges Spiel!

Macht Spaß alleine, aber noch viel mehr mit Freunden. Außerdem SEHR positiv ist die Tatsache, das ständig neuer Content kommt. Die schwierige Steuerung lässt sich meistern und das Spiel bietet eine Menge Möglichkeiten, mit der eigenen Lösung ans Ziel zu kommen. Speedruns sind auch recht interessant!

Einer meiner Lieblingsspiele, immer mal wieder reinschauen und ein bisschen gamen, das isses!

2688,"Awesome low price game to play wit da bois, the custom maps just make so much better too"
2689,some of the map can be played single player but that's not how the game is meant to be played. if you have friends to solve puzzle with then this is the right game for you.
2690,10/10
2691,This is such a cool game but if you have a low end device like me in order to play it smoothly on a low end device you have to lower the quality of the graphics

2693,Very good
2694,"Great puzzle/physics 3d platformer. Good solo, and also fun with a buddy (often levels are easier with two players).  Easy to pick up and put down, levels take about an hour and auto-checkpoints are reached every 5-10 minutes. No story to get in the way, just get from the entrance to the exit of each level."

2701,"I did all of the achievements,  and it never got boring once, truly a great game."
2702,"I used to have this game on switch, and I think it works better there. A controller is a necessity here, and even still I feel like there is less lag on the Switch than on the PC version. Maybe it's just me, but multiplayer was really slow on the PC version.

Overall, I remember it being GOOD on the Switch but now I can't stomach the PC version."

2714,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
2715,"This is a very stupid game, but because of this it’s also fun, with friends it’s the most fun to run around and ruin your friends for their rages, the controls are like you are a potato, the body is very flexible and awkward, but this is the charm of it games.
I advise everyone, my rating is 7/10"

2728,"A fun and clunky game to play alone or with friends.
Create or choose your own skin and tackle various maps with each their own challenges

Three third of the early levels were designed with the idea of it being single-player levels, with the introduction of multiplayer the earlier levels became much easier. Nevertheless they're all still fun to play.

The Steam Workshop allows for you to download any new unique map and tackle player made levels."
2729,good game but they should add new levels every month
2730,"Best game ever
"
2731,"Horror game too scary for me.

The flomping, the thomping and all the stomping is too loud.

I like how I can ride the dinosaurs, but why they attack me?

The building system is okey, however I feel they need to buff the thatch structures.
Perhaps stray away from the TEK stuff and add more primeval creatures.

Other than that it's okey.

2741,very fun game. many fun custom levels. great with friends
2742,good game
2743,You fall....a lot. If you aint got friends the game loses a bit of the chaos factor. They need to add a *Knock out* feature where you can knock out other players so they dont grab you and stick themselves to the floor.
2744,you fall thats the point of the game
2745,Very cool game to play with your friends!
2746,"Love the sloopy mechanics (its funny and cute at the same time), variety of custom maps & skins."
2747,fall
2748,"This game is truly one of a kind,  (I am Bread and every other ragdoll game sorta like this is what got me to enjoy these types of games)  Although this game has a few issues i think need to be addressed:

PROS:

Goofy fun with friends guranteed 

Has one of the best steam workshops 

Great base game levels (and workshop levels too!)

Skin making is surprisingly decent, very finicky and if you save your current changes more and more, the skin gets a noticeable ugly greenish hue.. The devs will have to improve the skin making feature for Human: Fall Flat 2.

Multiplayer in this game is really fun

Puzzles can usually be great to solve

Visuals for some levels (especially the game's version of City) are stunning

Pretty OK soundtrack (Red rocks main theme slaps hard in my opinion)

This game has tons of replayability and will get you hooked, I mean look at my hours to see why!

Great suit presets, but they've should of added an way to flip the hood up on the hazmat suit one, or generally a hood hatwear
_________________________________

CONS:

Controls can be a bit of a hassle to figure out

Little to no lore, only piece of lore to take from this is that the player character you control, Bob and the world you play in is a figment of Bob's imagination.

Horrible amount of toxic lowlife losers / kids usually run amuck (despite the game being generally aimed towards kids)

People can weaponize the grabbing mechanics by pinning you onto a wall with almost no way out (you can use Load Checkpoint or a mod to combat this) 

Devs did a really scummy move by pulling linux support. This game cannot be played on linux, sorry for any linux users looking into this game.

Other players will likely boot you out of their match for no reason without giving you a chance to speak whatsoever (although i'm assuming the reason they do this is to play with friends..)

Kick button is a very known abused feature for online play 

Single player for this game is pretty boring and dull to play through, that it's almost like this game was built for multiplayer and multiplayer alone

Community for HFF is pretty debatable after playing for how many hours on this game, hardly any interaction outside the discord server or in-game.

Extra dreams until Red Rock and the upcoming level Tower have normally been copy and pastes of workshop levels which made extra dreams somewhat lacking in the originality department, Although I do understand they want to give a chance for workshop creators to have their level in the game, I generally would like to see more original levels more akin to Red Rock, like maybe a Space level or something along the lines of goofy horror.
______________________________________________________

Otherwise, This game is a solid 7/10, 

I recommend to play this game with friends, it makes your experience a whole lot fun and more enjoyable!"

2786,I appreciate this game managed to portray my body proportions perfectly.
2787,"Human: Fall Flat is a pure action comedy puzzle game, in which the modification of the first two words is more important. It's like ""I am Bread"", but it's fresher in style and more exquisite in the polishing of the mechanism. It is also a work that doubles the fun of cooperation. If someone around you plays with you, you shouldn't miss it."

You will never get bored! Why? Because with the basic levels, there also community levels, yeeeaah! And it is so cute to have different skins from the workshop. So cool! 

Bubu, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Flexus711/] @Flexus [/url] ? Thank you for the funny time with this game. You made it even more funnier! I like to grab your head and be like ""wiggle, wiggle, wiggle"".

Game dev philosophy seems to be ""let's make the least fun game possible so that players can only get enjoyment from feeling like they're cheating, so we'll put in lots of stupid ways to skip the main paths."" I think I just can't stand the imprecision of the physics/controls, they make it so that any amount of difficulty in the game is reduced to pure pain. Fun enough when it's easy I guess."

2930,"A game with platforming that sometimes requires pixel perfect precision yet has the wonkiest character physics where, after climbing up a ledge, it will stumble forward unless you wildly jump backwards to adjust it. This becomes an issue with small platforms where there isn't a lot of wiggle room to faff about in this manner. Grabbing on to things is inconsistent and thus unsatisfying."

2970,it is wobbly and good and you could customize and paint your human only on computer

2978,"I've played this game for hours and days on end with friends, so I bought it myself. I've got to say that this is one of the best and most fun games you can play with friends, and even if you have no one to play it with, there are online lobbies in which you can play with other random people. I've even made friends from random lobbies. This is a really fun game that you can complete in any way you want if you put your imagination to use. It rewards exploration and you can find huge skips for levels, climb on top of places you shouldn't be and traverse half the level, something I find very cool in games."

3072,10/10 soundtrack
3073,I just like playing as Gachi characters and dry humping one another. 10/10 gayest game I've played
3074,"The levels are beautifully designed, the graphics is nice, and I appreciate how physics work in this game. I reckon that it would be such a pleasure to explore the levels and to find alternate solutions to the puzzles, if the character were easier to control. However, the janky control just turns exciting adventure into frustrating gameplay and stops me from playing any further than several levels. This is a deal-breaker considering that the game is a physics platformer. What a shame! Maybe playing with friends would make the control less unbearable, but I certainly will not recommend it as a single player game."
3075,One of the best games ever. Very fun especially with Community Maps. Get the Shrek character from the Steam Workshop for better gameplay
3076,I like this because it is so much fun!

3139,"[h1]How to Make Fettuccine Alfredo[/h1]

Alright boys and girls today i have you here an absolutely Fantastic Fettuccine Alfredo recipe, that even Grandma Betty would approve, Alright lets get to it.

Homemade Fettuccine may have a few steps, but each step is EASY – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal. The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy Fettuccine recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish.

TIPS FOR MAKING PERFECT FETTUCCINE ALFREDO:
1. Start by bringing water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt to the water to season the pasta. Once it is boiling, add pasta and cook according to package instructions.

2. Saute the garlic and butter together until softened -- about 1 to 2 minutes.

3. Add heavy cream and let simmer over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes to thicken. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth.

4. Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.

5. Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.

6. Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.

Ingredients

▢1 lb Fettuccine Pasta
▢6 Tablespoons Butter
▢1 Garlic Clove (minced)
▢1½ cups Heavy Cream
▢1/4 teaspoon Salt
▢1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese
▢1/4 teaspoon Pepper
▢2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional)

Instructions
1. In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions.

2. In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.

3. Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.

4. Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.
Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.

5. Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.

Recipe Notes
▢Use real parmesan cheese, which is refrigerated.

▢If you like it to be more ""saucy"", you may use less than 1 lb. of fettuccine pasta. 

▢Leftover pasta water may be used to thin out pasta sauce. Do not take a bath with it."

3161,"rofl wat is dis trash game? drunken alcoholic simulator? in the description it said it was a light-hearted platformer but clearly can hear the salt in my frens voice when play dis gaem? my 50 year old fren called wayn losing yeers off his lyf from the stress of trying 2 put a sstick between a moving platform andd trying 2 put wires in some battery bc the controls r so difficult since ur character is drunk on bourbon the entire time wtf?

plus why this gaem is connection not client side? brothers u guys hav not experienced tilt if u do not play this game with ur overseas frens around the world its literal like those motion control balancing games that is based off momentum to move a ball from a to b holy hell cant deal with the 300 m/s delay that make u cant perform simple jumps and u when u try to go left and u press left it doesnt go left so u end up holding it longer bc its human nature but it registers that u held left for 5 seconds so it moves u hella left and by the time u correct it by going right u repeat the same mistake so u can visualise how its exactly like those motion control momentum games with a ball 

the puzzles were kind of fun but need a hint button bc our group too dumb tbh and we had to google for a solution to one of the puzzle problems]

3270,"While I enjoy the simple art style of the game, it's simplicity is it's only strength. 

Whether it's due to my computer, or the online feature itself being horribly janky, all my movement was delayed, and sometimes my character would disobey anything I did. Slow camera movements and constant frame drops also didn't help, even when setting graphics to super low the performance slowly fell apart the further me and my friends played.

3279,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush."

3417,"A 3D platformer where you solve physics based puzzles with friends.

+ Puzzles Have Multiple Solutions
+ Ragdoll Physics Can Lead To Funny Moments
+ Challenging Puzzles

- Many Softlock States
- More Puzzles Than Platforming
- Many Red Herrings

Human: Fall Flat mainly advertises itself as a platforming and physics game. Yet, I found myself spending more time trying to solve the puzzles required to progress, rather than doing any platforming. My complaints aren't with the difficulty of the puzzles, but rather, the tediousness of them. It is way too easy to softlock a puzzle, which can only be resolved by resetting to the last checkpoint. It also doesn't help that many puzzles tend to have red herrings that look like obvious solutions but only ends up wasting time and causing frustration.

Conclusion: Should be marketed as more of a co-op puzzle game than anything else - which isn't bad in and of itself - but definitely not going to be my first choice in the category of casual light-hearted party games. Would recommend only if you enjoy co-op puzzle solving.

3512,"It is really fun for a group of friends to play casually! Would highly recommend for those groups who might get frustrated on survival or real time strategy games, because this is still puzzle, so takes thought and strategy, but not nearly as fast paced and demanding, so its easier for players to slowly settle in at their own pace."

3529,"Human fall flat starts of an entertaining game. You and friends work together to solve puzzles while being a blobish like creature. However after completing the main set of games I found it to be not as enjoyable. Yes, there are many extra community creations, however these do not seem to be as fulfilling due to their glitches and often shorten in length. In conclusion i believe that this game could be greatly improved simply by the addition of more maps."

It freezes and when I can finally get out and try to get back in it is validating. I wait for it to finish and when it is done it immediately starts to validate again. Finally am able to get back in and we start the process all over again. Very frustrating."

He's a much better platformer than I, but he could always either help me get through the level, or worst case, get through by himself so I could respawn by him. Many levels seem to have more than one solution. That's neat."

3785,"Its a perfect game but because of my computer i cant play it well but i do have for Nintendo switch and that's how I've got my opinions.
The game is great and if your clever enough you can find ways to skip parts of the level which makes you want to see how many skips you can find. The costumes are cleverly made and look great! the only difference about the Nintendo switch version and the PC version is the PC version has more levels but I'm suspecting there coming in future updates (hopefully)  also you can paint on your character to give them a personalized look."

3859,"Very entertaining and amusing, especially with friends."
3860,The game is very glitchy. It keeps freezing my mouse plus I always end up in a different level than my friends. This is the only game that does that for me.

3863,"Human Fall Flat is well and truly a favourite of mine. The goofy waddles of the characters, the way they interact with each other, the ridiculous positions you end up in is sure to drum up a few laughs. The puzzles are varied and challenging - and even with only a few buttons to press, you still have to master a few basic techniques to get around. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a giggle at the expense of your friends as they go for that leap, miss, fall off the map, and land in a heap while trying to stop yourself getting dragged down to a similar fate by someone else's sticky paws. The instructional videos, lobbies, and 'the fountain', all add to the humour."

3929,"played this game too much on ps4, bought it on pc and never play it :)"
3930,"Human: Fall Flat is one of the many descendants of QWOP, which is to say that its a game with intentionally clumsy controls, whose challenge (and humor) comes from attempting to get your sack-of-potatoes, physics-driven person to overcome basic video game challenges.

I played it in co-op, and it was a delight; it’s the sort of low-stakes playspace that many people needed early in the pandemic, but it also has genuinely good puzzle design; not too difficult, but requiring some experimentation. Most levels had multiple ways to reach their goals, and unlike Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, this is a game that *wants* you to succeed, and even my limited platforming skills were enough to make it through the levels. Delightfully, the developer now pays community members to make new levels, and there’s a great variety of places to explore."
3931,"Human's Fall Flat imbues it's avatars with the same body control of someone undergoing anesthesia with the confidence of an almost drunk frat bro. You're arms and legs don't do what you want them to but if you try again maybe it'll work out. You dont need to push a button with a hand if a head'll work. You don't need to take the stairs if you can spider-man-monkey-swing up a wall. 
Keep pushing. Don't mind the 1,000s of discarded bodies that must lay below the clouds from humans that...fell flat. Don't look back as the ground crumbles behind you or monuments fall. 

The game has fantastic themes and builds a world on a foundation of hardly organized chaos and the character creation makes poorly painted play dough men look great. To beat it, failures are assured but it's humans industry that leads to our victory. Our resilience, our ingenuity, our repurposing of materials, our willingness to push on despite the impossibilities is what the human spirit HFF captures. Humans Fall Flat definitely did not, fall flat."
3932,This is a slapstick puzzle game that should only be experienced with friends. Highly recommended. Also you can customize your outfits. I made Thing from Adams Family and Will Smith controlled by a brain alien from Men in Black. Both were hilariously hideous.

3938,Fun game to play with a small group of friends although it is pretty annoying at times
3939,My advice: find another game to torture yourself with.

4001,"My girlfriend and I have recently been playing this together, the game is very fun especially when you can help each other out and often save one another. The puzzles and platforming are very fun and occasionally quite challenging. Only issue I can think of is that levels can often be cheesed with a second person, but this also leaves many possibilities towards completing sections of the level. Ultimately a very good game with good replay value thanks to the workshop."
4002,Nice physics in game!
4003,This is an absolutely amazing game to play. Many ways to complete the same levels based on your creativity and most of all this game helps you to relieve off your stress. Definitely a good game to play with friends but can also be played with randoms as all of them mostly keep of laughing all the time.

4088,"This is a really janky, goofy puzzle game that's a lot of fun to play with other people. My little brother and I have had a blast playing this co-op. I was really lucky to get this in a bundle back in 2017 for $1 knowing basically nothing about it, but I'd say this game is well worth the asking price of $20 and also frequently goes on sale, so you'll most likely be able to get it for well below that. Besides that, the game is updated with new levels fairly regularly; there were about 8 or 9 levels when I first bought it, and now there are 19, the most recent being added just a few days ago as of this review. And if that's not enough, this game also has Steam Workshop support, so you can add user created skins and levels for even more content to mess around with. Overall, this is one of the most fun local split screen (and online) co-op games on Steam and is worth every penny."
4089,Mnogo gotina igra
4090,this is a really fun game but it is much better on pc as consoles don't get updated as often.

4103,I haven't played it to long but it's brought a lot of laughs with it.  It's definitely better playing with others.
4104,"Yes, would definitely recommend, completed all maps and got all achievements with friends, we've moved onto workshop maps and is still fun and refreshing.

10/10
Wish there were more clothing options for character customisation though."
4105,Great game to play with friends. And from time to time you can reinstall and play some newly release levels.
4106,"Best game on steam, hands down."
4107,good game
4108,This game is brilliant. It can be laggy at some times or react slow but it's hilarious to watch your friends and yourself wobble around as you solve puzzles that require you to think big and stretch far.

4126,"Great game! Only problem - if you're a linux user and you want to play with windows users, be careful, because it won't let you play together. However linux singleplayer works just fine, and probably if two linux users want to play together, they can. There are probably some solutions to this, but I'm just warning you. /home/klemen/Slike/Zaslonska slika 2021-11-27 20-03-52.png"
4127,Human: Fall Flat is a humorous arcade game with interesting mechanics and pleasant music. Lots of different maps and riddle. A great game to play with friends.

I recommend to y'all!"

The controls take a while to get your head around, but i have come to love them and its probably the best way you could play this sort of game as well. Good on the devs, keep it up. Thanks."

4180,"In the game, a humnan falls aflat"
4181,kk
4182,"Human: Fall Flat is best to play with friends or group of people. Fun to play and will exercise your sleeping brain cells as you have to analyze stuff to solve things. I kept on laughing while playing this game as the characters look like drunk people without direction. XD

Some achievements are easy to get by just doing stuff on the lobby if you're after collecting achievements. They are adding maps as time goes by as well. Hopefully they'll keep on adding new ones as once you finish everything there's nothing much to do anymore.

Overall good value for the price and fun game for those who likes solving puzzles and playing with a group."
4183,The puzzles are amazing and a bit frustrating. But the end surely compensates for it all. The physics is pretty funny. A superb game overall.
4184,"Human Fall Flat is a good game to play if you like using your brain to solve puzzles as this game is all based around that,it can get a bit glitchy but the developers normally fix any that get reported to them.This is overall a good game to play with your friends as it can also require teamwork to get through the levels."
4185,great game for chilling with friends
4186,"I wish there were more levels, but workshop solves that problem easily. The game is enjoyable alone, or with friends."
4187,Best game to have fun with friends.
4188,Very Fun!!!

4194,Funneh xD
4195,"Pretty fun with friends. I enjoy looking for ways to cheese the levels, or skip puzzles for no reason. Would recommend if you are looking for a fun game to goof off with friends in without purpose for a little while."
4196,Funny game haha.
4197,"                        This is a great game for physics, rule-breaking, obstacle courses, building and so on.
                                                                                      
                                                                               Pros:
                               1. You can do WHATEVER you want to inside the levels. (Courses)
                               2. Want to skip a level by climbing a wall? Sure! Free of charge!
                                                            3. Very customizable skins
                                                                    4.  Level creator!
                                                                      5. Multiplayer
                                                         6. Contoller and Xbox compatible
            
                                                                               Cons:
                                                    1. Not entirely sure if there's cross platform
                                                                2. Hard to draw on skins
                                                  3. Still haven't figured out how to make a level
                                                         4. Kind of hard to get used to controlls
                                   5. Unless you're an expierenced player, climbing walls are diffucult
                           6. If you have started a level then switch levels, you have to restart the other level.

                                             Hope you think this is helpful! Thanks for reading!
                                                                      #HumanFallFlat
                                                       P.S. I don't know how hashtags work."

I don't need to say anymore, Just play the game."
4225,This game is so stupid fun. It's delightful.
4226,very fun with friends
4227,"This game is one of my favourite to play. It is simple yet incredibly fun! The biggest secret  to enjoy it at its maximum: you need a friend to play with...or many friends. You can just finish the level, you can roleplay, you can laugh about the game physics... or just troll your friends (and they you). The human you play with can be personalized by the player or a community created skin can be applied . The game can be played by people that are not that skilled in computer games - so you can enjoy it with your partner  who is not  that much into gaming or your child.  As a con I want to mention that there are not that many levels that come with the game. BUT the community is very active and creative and there are some great levels made by it."
4228,The fact that the devs keep putting out more free content is really really cool. Best played with 1-2 friends

And when that fun runs out, you can extend it by bringing in a friend and drawing silly things on your goofball character. If you dont play it then buy it now"

4285,Throughout Covid this game came out with updates and brought me back to pick up some people and mess around on some new maps. Intentionally awkward controls that you get used to and new and experimental ways they try to drive you forward with the games mechanics and how you interact with the environment.
4286,cool game :D
4287,frunk
4288,good game to play with your friends
4289,"After playing this game with several of my friends, completing every level, and getting every achievement, I can gladly say that this is the best coop game I've ever had the pleasure of playing.

The fact that so many levels have been created and added after the fact makes this game a gift that keeps on giving."

4449,FUN VERY FUN kinda glitchy also funny LOL
4450,"Incredibly entertaining for a small group of friends. Every level is unique and the same puzzle mechanic never repeats twice. There is lots of fun to be had with this game and if you grab it on a discount it's a literal steal for how much content you receive. It also gets updated quite frequently and the workshop ensures that you will never run out of things to do.

However it's a crime, that the soundtrack is not available on streaming platforms."
4451,"Fun mind game, could get challenging at some points but good game overall. The game is done after you finish all the levels though, so you can either replay them or move on and find another game to waste your time on."

Its a really creative game concept, but I can't recommend it if it's not playable."

4508,"Great family game our family has enjoyed since it came out in 2016.  My daughter and I play this game together periodically via the Steam Link on our family room TV.  It's a game that really makes you think, and it's perfect for spending time together over the holidays.  The game is most fun when you're playing cooperatively via the split screen.  It's relaxing to watch others play it too.  We've played and finished all the levels, including many of the extra levels they've come out with over the past few years.  I'm excited to see they've added the lumber level.  We'll have to try it soon.  I honestly would be happy to pay more money periodically for more levels."

Even though it has settings to prevent non friends from joining they are either A:too ignorant to use the feature B:the servers just have a crappy connection or C:they are just kicking you and refuse to turn ""friends only"" on."

4549,"Definitely recommend for a group of friends to play with together as the game utilizes team work! friends can work together in the most dumb way possible or just have fun and parkour or throw each other off the cliff!

They  also have a decent amount of maps, they are also rich in content and is really fun. Different skins available for your Avatar and the best part is you can customize it by drawing and or using the webcam to add a photo of your face in it!

Would like to see more Skins, maps and new features available tho! and maybe even an increase of player limit from 8 to 10 or 12."

Characters walk clumsily which makes me laugh while playing. 
Puzzles in this game are not too difficult, I don't have too spend too much time to think how to clear the map.
Maps are fascinating, like the City and the Laboratory, the stunning view of these map makes me shocked.
Many items in the map can be interacted, I love the part using an axe to cut down a tree and break a door.
There are so many things I can do at lobby maps, I hope there will be more and more maps I can play.
I enjoy spending my time playing Human: Fall Flat with my friends!"

"
4573,"The game is great, no bugs or glitches but my problem is that when you're in multiplayer, once a person reached a certain checkpoint others can just jump off the map and spawn to the latest checkpoint. Same problem with finishing the game, you only need 1 person to reach the exit to finish the game, Kind of unfair tbh

But overall, Love the game and highly recommend if you're playing with friends or relatives"

4603,"Controls definitely take some  getting used to, you lurch around like a drunken monkey and it can make some tasks that use motor skills extremely frustrating, but it was a pretty fun game to play with a friend. Sort of reminiscent of gang beasts with throwing each other to mutual deaths frequently. Lots of different ways to either cheese or complete puzzles as intended."

4610,Fun puzzle game. I really liked the goofiness of the movements. I played local coop with my son. The levels are not that hard to figure out for a grown up but it was challenging for my son. Online play was also fun. The only downside is that the whole game is rather short but they are adding new levels I hear.

The levels are fun and creative and each puzzle usually has several ways of solving them, some more conventional than others. The control takes some getting used to, but the silly flailing and falling is really not that annoying when you can just laugh at the ridiculousness if it all.

And to top it all off, the devs are constantly adding new levels, FOR FREE, you can't really ask for more, definitly worth every cent!"
4756,"So far the most successful Lithuanian Indie game, having sold more than 30 million copies and is tied for 19 place with games like Witcher 3 and Modern Warfare that were made by big companies. The game itself is very fun and challenging.

4757,"Quality of the game had really decreased with last updates. Used to be fun, but last levels are very raw, textures disappear, climbing doesn't work, game freezes and there is a huge delay in input. Game engine was updated and become worse. Maybe worth playing original levels and that's all."
4758,really a awsome game.if it is in a sale then go for it.

You too can:
Be human!
Solve puzzles!
Push buttons!
Drive!
Fall on your face!
Bash your head with lumber!
Get crushed by boulders!
Tumble off the very earth itself!
Push your friends off the very earth itself!
Have them land on you and horribly deform you!
Wander like a lost child!
Actually get lost!
Think you found the way and just get yourself stuck!
Punch the wall in RAGE!!
Punch the wall in the game too!!
Facepalm when you see how clear the right way to go was!
Try to make an awesome player but end up with an Eldritch Horror!
And, just flop around like a drunken bag of goo!

Good game to goof off with friends or family!
Highly recommend it."

my game was laggy when i started out, but lowering some of the video quality fixed it entirely. so hilarious and so worth the money.
personally, for my playing style, i find it more fun to do with friends, but you can play by yourself easily as well!"
4777,"[h1] Human Fall Flat - English and spanish [/h1]

ENG: Human Fall Flat is a game that looks easy because of the graphics but it is not. You have to think about how to do things and if you don't succeed you do it by climbing like spiderman.
It's a lot of fun alone but with friends it's much more fun like most games.

ESP: Human Fall Flat es un juego que parece facil por los graficos pero no lo es. Tienes que pensar como hacer las cosas y si no te sale lo haces trepando como spiderman.
Es muy divertido solo pero con amigos es mucho mas divertido como la mayoria de los juegos."
4778,yes
4779,really fun with friends
4780,Fun to play and worth to buy during sale.

4784,Fun multiplayer game
4785,monke
4786,ssssd
4787,it's pretty good
4788,I would say this is an awesome game to play with friends and family. It can get a bit frustrating at times but I recommend it and all the laughs that come with it.
4789,overwhelmingly thick ass
4790,Good game- Fun but yet can get angry at it very much approve.
4791,yes!!
4792,Very good
4793,its good

4795,very fun to explore the possibilities of every map and finding interesting ways to move around. would recommend
4796,it is very funny
4797,"can get challenging, but its perfect to play with friends while contemplating the true identity of the antichrist"
4798,good time with friends
4799,da
4800,It's good
4801,Dumb fun with friends is always a good time.
4802,Human Fall Flat and Gang Beasts make my day
4803,"the game is a good source of friendship and can be fun in single player or co-op, therefore, you should totally get the game now"
4804,really fun game to play with your friends (if you have any) also you can play each level in many ways 10/10
4805,Very funny game
4806,"verry goood

4807,best with friends

4811,one of the best casual multiplayer games for your non-games friends
4812,"I really enjoy games i can play with friends, that actually give me a kick out of the game! It's an older title but its a great game for low hardware."
4813,"its not not
"
4814,if you have friend
4815,game
4816,"The game is very fun to play, Also with friends you can do alot of funny stuff, I personally like how the characters there move and the dumb stuff you can do"
4817,"This game is a mixed bag, for one I see it as a boring, generic joke game that could be made by a Youtuber, and for the other I see a game that has a lot of replayability due to constant updates and maps being added in, not to mention the community maps as well. 
It's a 50/50, but I do see it as an overall good game, but you should probably wait for a sale honestly, this is not the type of game you would spend hours on.
And this game is incredibly boring in single-player, just play with friends. If you don't have any friends, just burn your credit card instead of buying this game, it'll be more entertaining."
4818,throw your friends off cliffs! get thrown off cliffs by your friends!
4819,Silly fun.
4820,this game is just manual labor but you don't get paid
4821,fun

4943,"This game could be summed up in one word. Hilarious.

I played this game with a few friends. The aim of the game is relatively simple. Simply get to the end of the level whilst solving some (simple) puzzles along the way. How you accomplish the aim is where the fun is! The gameplay is brilliant, the physics are frustratingly challenging, the graphics suit the style of game and the level design is awesome.

If you need a fun game to play with a few friends that will kill a few hours, look no further!"
4944,"Very good game especially with a friend or two, we were laughing constantly and it was very fun! the physics are great and it was just a really good experience personally."

4981,"This game is pure joy. The physics engine makes interacting with the world a delight.  The way you grab onto ledges and pull yourself up never gets old, though admittedly takes some practice at first.  Once you learn the mechanics however, the game feels amazing.  The puzzles are creative and levels are varied. There is loads of content and hours upon hours of fun to be had in its multiple levels, dlc etc.  Playing 2P co-op is even more fun and this game is family friendly.  Highly recommend.  It is easily one of the most memorable games I’ve played recently."

5009,"Good game, but beware.

Devs/Publisher pulled a really nasty move and silently removed Linux support.

Not only removing it, but entirely breaking it by walling off Linux users to play with Win/OSX users due to version checks.
Could be fixed if the Linux depot would be deleted, but that is apparently too hard.

Now to play again with other platforms, Linux users have to force Steam to download the Windows version and use Proton."

5068,"Un jeu très drôle avec ses amis et très intéressant en solo (avec les succès).
D'une part le jeu en multijoueur est plutôt amusant, les interactions avec les autres joueurs sont fun et certains niveaux ont même d'autres façons d'être fait en fonction du nombres de personnes (ce qui augmente la rejouabilité de certains niveaux). En plus, depuis la mise à jour des hubs, on peut avoir des hubs personnalisé ce qui permet ainsi de s'amuser même sans lancer de niveau. D'ailleurs en parlant du workshop, le contenu est encore plus riche grâce à l'ajout de nouveau niveau de la communauté ou encore de skin pour votre personnage. 

Les éditeurs rajoutent même leurs propres niveaux qui ont tous leur propre mécanique ce qui est vraiment agréable à refaire car aucun niveau ne se ressemble avec un autre.

Le jeu à tout de même quelques défauts, il manque peut être des indices à certains moments du jeu si jamais on est bloqué. Les contrôles du personnage sont aussi assez casse-gueule même si c'est aussi l'un des points forts que le personnage ait une attitude de ragdoll. De plus certains niveaux sont un peu trop ouvert ce qui permet d'éviter des énigmes (un peu dommage bien que ce problème est reglé dans les niveaux les plus récents.) Par exemple, dans le niveau de l'eau on peut facilement esquiver une moitié du niveau rien qu'en utilisant le yacht, ou dans le niveau de la centrale où la plupart des murs sont grimpables sur le côté et donc esquivable. 

Finalement est un jeu simple sans prise de tête ou tout type de gameplay est parfait. Un curieux pourra trouver plein de succès ou de secrets. Quelqu'un qui veut s'amuser peut trouver son bonheur dans le gameplay en lui même. Et quelqu'un qui souhaite tout faire pourra s'amuser à chercher toutes les possibilités dans chaque niveau ! 

10/10 Masterpiece franchement"
5069,This game is good for joking with friends and it is a good game if you are interested in speedrunning.

5118,very fun game. lots of cursing and name calling. fun with friends
5119,"This game is actually pretty fun.

I'm not some 3000 hour loser reviewing this game, i literally have 4+ hours 

The game is a puzzle game with a decent amount of levels. The levels get more difficult and thought provoking as you move through the stages. The boat level is a pain in the ass, if you buy the game i recommend a tutorial for it. The boat level is like the 4th level."
5120,pog
5121,"Everything is good except there are a lot of bugs. The new lab level is very buggy especially the launchpad room, some achievements often wont pop either. The ""clockwork"" achievement has a weird order you have to do things in, and the ""Tricky"" achievement is only luck, as when you complete it the normal way there is a good chance the achievement will not appear."
5122,"
YES! FALL GOOD!"
5123,This game is very fun.Highly Recommend this to everyone

"
5135,"It's a fun and silly game, I've been playing it with my younger cousin and I've gotten headaches from laughing too much. It may appear like a low effort game, but there was some care and passion put into this."
5136,pee
5137,i used to play this game with my friends every day and we would have great times now they both dont talk to me
5138,I dont know if this is a glitch but the game is not showing up in my library also i keep logging in on my apple id and it says game not found.

5140,"great funny well liked hahahahahahaha

5160,Fun but best played with friends.
5161,one of the most fun and unique physics games out there. just fun and silly.
5162,"Its a nice game that makes fun, but if you cant grab or pull something its absolutly trash and dont make funy anymore. So pls change something on it! Its cancer if you try to climb but fails so often that you want to commit suicide or you want to speedrun it and cant go over a little gab or something like this.
So its a nice game, but its trash with this grab technique..."
5163,Seriously need a controller. its a great game! lots of laughs! my friend and I play drunk! :)
5164,"Cool, fun game. A must have experience with friends."

5182,"This game makes me laugh every time I open it. Has a few issues here and there, but overall a lovely game."
5183,its a bit laggy but I would recommend this game because its really fun to play with friends and if your a puzzle person this is the game for you
5184,"[Story] : N/A

[Soundtrack/Music] : N/A
[Audio Design] : 6/10
[Visuals/Graphics] : 6/10
[Difficulty] : 2/10
[Overall] : 7/10

A very fun game for messing around and doing the dumbest things with your friends while also trying to solve fairly easy puzzles. It's a nice experience to have with a group of people."
5185,This Game is funny to fool around with it makes you think outside the box and it's super fun :)
5186,"This game is wildly overrated.
I was expecting a game in which you have to fight the laws of physics to solve puzzles. Alas, this is in fact a game in which you have to fight terrible controls and a motion sickness inducing camera to solve puzzles.

There certainly are some good ideas, but they are just overshadowed by the poor execution. What a disappointment."
5187,NO
5188,10/10 would throw my friends off a cliff again
5189,that time i got reincarnated as a flat faller
5190,haha funny man go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
5191,"fun game no DLC content besides music. Get 100% of the game when you buy it, sick."
5192,fun with friends

5198,super fun
5199,Human faller platt
5200,This game is reallly fun
5201,e
5202,yes
5203,this game is dumb. camera angles make it hard 2 see when u hold objects. no playerbase. hardly even fun
5204,I enjoyed waddlin my little peg legs around as I made my character look as ridiculous as motherfucking possible :D
5205,Very good
5206,
5207,"Fun game to play with friends but can get dizzy if playing over an hour. Many things to do, solve and just laugh about."
5208,it fun
5209,This game is very fun.
5210,The definition of insanity.
5211,Fabulous Mind game!!Now a days people are playing stress games like pubg. Try this atleast once and you'll never forget to play this kind of games.
5212,boing boing
5213,relax and die
5214,my friend told me to get this game we played but now we are no longer on speaking terms bad game.
5215,Loved playing it with my friends! So So fun to play. Lots of levels and you can even play workshop maps made by individuals if that's not enough. its just so much value for money
5216,".
"
5217,"I recommend this game those who always alone and lost their lovable person just like me
You can find random friendly teammate which i got many of them. This game doesn't have rank, micro-transaction or hacker. I was play ml went my buddy alive but i don't know this game is way better than that but i don't get the chance to play with my buddy anymore. Thank You Nico, Tomato and Yuki,"
5218,It's a really good game^^ I recommendation this game play with friends it's really fun! I hope there will be a new chapter again so I can play this game!
5219,"This is so much fun with friends i almost died for laughing so i recommend to you the: Human Fall Flat!
"
5220,Y
5221,game hay bo ich
5222,its fun
5223,YES
5224,"Beutiful, now i just need friends :)"
5225,best game for play with friends
5226,Meh
5227,very good
5228,"This game lets you grab ur friends' ass, recommend"
5229,"This game somehow straddles the line between ""I want to rip my hair out"" and ""honestly just a great time."" The physics are wonky, there are hefty level skips for those adventurous enough to find them, and the human's dumb little rag-doll body has made me lose it more than once. The wonky physics can be a bit of a double-edged sword if you're trying to do something specific, but, otherwise, it's beautiful and hilarious.

TLDR: Great game made even better when played with friends."
5230,little big planet number 1 game
5231,it's so funny but glitchy
5232,"The premise of this game is pretty simple - you play a wobbly small being who can grab things and lift, pull, and push them (or themselves) and use these abilities to make your way through a series of levels each bearing a series of physics puzzles.

But beneath the one-dimensional premise is a pretty fun game with a good difficulty curve, bolstered by player-made content like custom levels and made even better by its multiplayer. While there’s not much more to it than that, it does what it wants to do very well, and is very much recommended on that basis.
"
5233,good goofy game but made me mad when goofy went too far
5234,this game is quite fun
5235,"The amount of times I've said ""grab my butt"" in this game speaks to its quality.
Despite the name these humans are not flat, they are dummy thick.
Ass grabbing, pelvic thrusting and ball clenching have never been better since I discovered this game.
So very hot having full control of my hands to explore the bodies of my friend especially my best friend PINGSLAYER.
10/10 RECOMMENDED FOR THE PRICE IT OFFERS , PURE FUN
AND U WILL NEVER BE DEPRESSED IN YOUR LIFE WHILE PLAYING THIS"
5236,this game makes friendship and also destroyed friendship at the same times

Although their music is not long, it adds a nice touch in the game. The developers continue to add new maps and puzzles. Throw everything into the void! (even your ;) friends ) 9/10"

5344,"Accurate controls and an enjoyable premise, 10/10 am playing again."
5345,"The controls are way more annoying and clunky than I expected. This game relies on having friends to share and alleviate the frustrating controls rather than actually being fun on its own. There is a distinction between controls which are bad and difficult to master; and this is to me, is the former. Also, this game really lacks polish. I would not consider this to be a complete game."

Absolutely fantastic if you play with friends, possibly very boring if you play alone. I was laughing so hard I had to mute my microphone. Games allows both local and online multiplayer simultaneously with easy drop in and out, no need to restart a level or anything.

I am impressed by how controllable the game is even with rag doll-like physics. You can easily (after a few minutes of practice) figure out how to point your arms where you want them and grab what you want. Pulling yourself up, grabbing hold of others, carrying objects, etc all is easily managed and controlled. The levels quickly build up in complexity and offer ample playgrounds to climb on and explore.

Definitely worth playing if you have a good gaming group."
5357,"Fun with friends, Human Fall Flat has rag doll physics that makes this game so fun with friends. Are you trying to solve a puzzle? Welp, get ready to be dragged off into the void by your friends! Sabotage your friends! Or work together! It's up to you! The steam workshop for character models and maps gives you more hours of fun not including the official levels and models that are built into the game. My main complaint is that the game can be pretty boring and frustrating is if you can't figure out a puzzle so you're just stuck there falling into the void while your friend drags you away but also I don't know if 19.99 is really worth it, I got this game when it went on sale for 6.99.

5410,"The split screen multiplayer with my 7 year old son is one the best experiences I have had in 30 years of gaming. 
It's basically a 3d open world puzzle game. The puzzles get more difficult as you progress through the levels, but the level are so well designed that we can work them out together, and they require coordination and teamwork to solve. The controls are deliberately tricky, which leads to some hilarious fails. This would normally be annoying, but they are intuitive enough that you blame your execution rather than the controls.
It's quite simply brilliant.
I haven't tried playing it on my own and it's too difficult for my 4 year old.
Highly recommended for gaming dads looking to share a game with their kids."

5480,"THIS GAME SAVED MY LIFE.

I am 28

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

5558,"With or without friends, this game is worth it. It's a goofy, floppy, messed up physics sim and puzzle game. It takes some skill to master control of your character - especially each arm, which you control individually with each mouse button and mouse clicks - but once you get the hang of it, you can do things that will make gameplay much easier (like scaling walls vertically or horizontally). While the graphics are a bit Gumby-esque, they're charming, and there are definitely some ""wow, look at that"" moments. The music is also relaxing and there are no enemies to fight, making this a really chill puzzle/exploration game.

When playing with friends, there are many possibilities - you can grab each other and toss each other off cliffs, or help each other up cliffs, or throw things at each other, or drive cars and sail boats together. Solving difficult puzzles and getting through difficult obstacles together is really rewarding. Flopping around together is also funny, in general. Since you can gave up to 8 people in a lobby, this is a great group game. It doesn't require tons of skill, so anyone can enjoy it. If you need skill to have fun, then you can work on mastering character control.

There are lots of official maps and countless player-made maps to explore. Some player-made maps are bad, but there are also great ones out there. A quick Google search for some good maps will give you tons of options. Once in a while a new official map is released, and holiday-themed maps come around during appropriate times of the year. I haven't tried making a map myself, but I imagine that for those interested, that's another fun thing this game offers.

If you like character customization, you can also customize your little dough guy. This includes putting custom images on its skin. There are no items that you collect in the game, though. You complete each map for the sake of completing the map, not to collect any items.

8/10, I take 2 points away because I wish there were many more official maps, and the game errs on the goofier side and I know that won't appeal to everyone. Also there's this annoying mouse takeover that happens when you first open the game. You have to alt-tab into the game to get back control of your mouse. Idk why it happens but the fix is easy enough. Other than that I haven't had many issues with bugs."

And when that fun runs out, you can extend it by bringing in a friend and drawing silly things on your goofball character. If you don’t play it, watch someone play it."

Your movement options doesn't improve, but the level does and introduce new mechanics and each level feel really unique and has its perks. The game can be pretty fun solo, but the multiplayer is the key selling point of this game. 10/10 Would recommend."

5592,"This is a very clever  puzzle platformer that is not that too mechanically intensive. It's a great relaxing game to play with friends, and my favorite aspect to the game is that there are multiple ways to clear platforming challenges. The movement to the game is quirky, and the dynamic soundtrack to the game is pretty good. Both things really add to the charm of this game.

It's fun to play by yourself, but I think this game has more enjoyment when you play with friends. In addition to the relaxing aspect of this game, there is some room to flex your mechanical skill at this game if that type of stuff is your thing. The game is ripe for speed running."

fun with friends, fun solo, i got all achievements, played all the maps and a lot of workshop too,
The climbing and puzzles are a lot of fun, the character costumization is hilarious and great, and if youre a GAMER (dont tell the devs) you can climb in ways you arent supposed to and get a lot of speed and get some speedrunning and sequencebreaking fun :D

I have never had this much fun laughing, raging, and having soooo much fun with my friends before, I really wished I paid the full price and it would still be underpriced... This game is beyond priceless. When I completely finish this game with all it has, I will never forget it.... It will always have a special place in my heart. I'd like to thank the dev's, you are so amazing and Thank You soooo so much for creating this amazing work of art that me and my friends can enjoy!

Buy this game you won't regret it."

5643,:(
5644,"When I first played this game, I hated it. Put it back on the steam shelf and left it there for several years. Later, a friend wanted to try out the multiplayer update. I was a bit hesitant, but had nothing better to do, so I gave it a try.

I'm glad I did.

It wasn't what I had originally expected, and not everyone is going to like this game. It is supposed to feel clunky, but in the game's clunkyness, you can pull off incredible feats. The graphics are minimalistic, and beautiful in their own way. The developers definitely have gotten better at the design of them over time as well.

is it for everyone? Absolutely not. Is it a fantastic, casual game? Absolutely. You can get at least 20 good hours out of this with the workshop support. There are some amazing modders  out there that put together creative and rewarding levels.

I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did the second time around."

5757,very funny game i recommend it
5758,"Didn't like the game, Environments were fun to explore but that was about it. Game mechanics were frustrating, the physics felt like they were ported over from a 1980's action movie. I had difficulty getting things into place to solve puzzles because there were objects moving around that shouldn't have been moving at all, i.e. getting a board to sit on top of a log but having the log move around as though the ground was covered in butter and water. The jumping in this game feels like they nerfed it, hard. Some of the objects had weight properties that didn't make much sense to me, how is the pointed end of an object heavier than the blunt end? Shouldn't the blunt end be heavier, seeing as how it has more mass than the tip? There's no reference for the tips and tricks you find in the game either, I have to go back to the mountain level to remind myself how to climb again....... I can't change the controls either.

Frustrating gameplay, awkward physics, lack of a reference for either basic or advanced tips and tricks (apart from the basic controls), and inability of players to change controls. Not recommended"
5759,This game is really good if you have friends or at least someone to play with. I played this a lot with my cousin and we had a lot of fun grabbing each other and doing annoying stuff. 10/10
5760,awsome game :D
5761,"many many hours of gameplay, it's really fun to do co-op with friends both online and with split-screen. Online Co-op doesn't require the your friends to own the game. well worth the money"
5762,Excellent!
5763,I liked this game because I enJoyed it
5764,why do I keep falling
5765,Roblox
5766,This game is a trip. Almost aids but close enough to where its just cancer. I went and ground through the whole thing to get all the achievements and I have never wanted to throw myself off a building more. 12/10 game. Best played with the idiots that are your friends because the only thing better than using one brain cell to beat this game is sharing one brain cell with four people to beat this game.

i HIGHLY recommend this game to others
oh and i can't wait for future updates"
5803,A very immersive experience that really puts the game in the hand of the player. You can follow the intended route but every level has cheeses and shortcuts much like how the Portal series would let you shortcut if you know how to properly use the physics of the game to your advantage. This makes it possible to skip huge sections and enter territory you might not have imagined was available to you at first.
5804,Sometimes downright annoying but you just keep coming back to solve the puzzles.

5827,"Get Friends. Be Sussy. Poggers,

For a more serious review, though, I do genuinely enjoy this game. I first played on PS4, and I eventually forced myself to uninstall it because it really pissed me off, and I make an effort to not play games that make me unreasonably angry (Sorry, Dark Souls). Anyway, the puzzles were normally fun, and I started playing here on Steam with friends, and their miserable frustration keeps mine at bay, especially with my previous experience allowing me to guide them more. I only wish that server stability was less reliant on the host's connection and more on a general connect to a central server because lagginess and get real bad, and a platform-puzzler like this really can't handle even slight lag moments."

5830,"[h1] Really fun 10/10 [/h1]

Probably one of the best purchases I've made on Steam. This game is one of the most fun games to play with your friends or even alone, it has quite a few levels that have different themes. After you beat all of them you can try and complete all the achievements which was definitely fun for me or you can play a lot of levels made by the community in the community workshop. It was a lot of fun playing this game and I look forward to any new levels that will release in the future so I can play them with my friend. I don't think you'll regret buying this game if you already like what you see from the game-play videos and pictures :)"

Each level is unique and silly in its own way and they're never repetitive. In whole it's a pretty relaxing game, but can be quite frustrating at times. While Human Fall Flat is definitely best to play with a friend, it still delivers as a solo adventure (it's much harder though)."

I am impressed by how controllable the game is even with rag doll-like physics. You can easily (after a few minutes of practice) figure out how to point your arms where you want them and grab what you want. Pulling yourself up, grabbing hold of others, carrying objects, etc all is easily managed and controlled. The levels quickly build up in complexity and offer ample playgrounds to climb on and explore. 

Definitely worth playing if you have a good gaming group."

5906,I have never laughed during a game as much as when I play this game with my friends.  Your mileage may vary.  I recommend not having boring friends and actively trying to sabotage each other's efforts.

5976,"Surprisingly No Workshop support.  So once you've played the standard maps one time through.. then you've basically seen all there is to see.  There is no replay value as replaying a map would just be turning the same knobs and switches again.

No Linux Support

You cannot play it alone as most puzzles require teamwork.

So you Better have friends to play this with or you will see, ""Kicked from the server."", everytime you join ANY server.  I did have a few friends I played this with, but after an hour it becomes very repetitive.  Slow walking.  Slow grabbing.  Slow switch turning.  The whole game is, ""Turn switch there and turn switch here"".  That's the whole game."

The ragdoll physics and the inability to fully control our character leads to a lot of silliness."

Long time ago me and my cousin decided to play this , at 1st I wasn't rlly havin fun but then , combination of just chillin mixed with incredible stupidity , lead to a very enjoyable time ^^.
Game doesn't have any good graphics or music , but the engine is rlly wacky. The game itself doesn't have a bigger meaning , it's just a pretty cool parkour game.
I suggest to play with a pal or a group , cuz solo .... it doesn't rlly have much sense playing it :v.Just game is most fun when u play it like a total moron with a mate or 2.
I still wanna replay it some day just to check it out what's changed.

6052,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."
6053,this game is such a pain in the ass but still a nice game overall
6054,it is a fun game to play with friends
6055,have
6056,"Great fun, hilarious game as long as nobody intentionally messes with other players.
Thankfully the lobby leader can kick such players easily (hint: V to show player names)."
6057,yes
6058,It got boring very quickly and the movement is bad. This game gave me extreme anger issues from the climbing.
6059,lmao these idiots fall flat
6060,"Starting a lobby with a bunch of friends is never going to end with everyone working together, and thats a damn good thing. I've never played such a chaotic co-op experience, and I'll never forget it. I return every new level they release."

6066,"Extremely amusing, has us laughing our butts off constantly. Definitely consider it as a fun co-op. Never fails to put smiles on our faces and get us giggling.

The graphics aren't amazing, but the animations are ridiculously funny and the simple gameplay mechanic is hilarious. The levels are basic looking but fun to figure out and vary in their difficulty. Enjoyable teamwork opportunities. 

There may only be 15-20 hours of content here. Replay value is probably limited, and after such a long development I'd have expected two or three times as many levels. That is really the only negative I can think to mention. If you have a buddy, need a laugh, and see it on sale under $10, I really don't think you can go wrong with this joyful nonsense."

Human Fall Flat is a super interesting and enjoyable game to play with friends. It's super fun when you play with friends or a group of people, however you might feel a bit bored if you play alone. But overall, as a game, it is enjoyable and fun and this game is worth the price."

6164,"Love this game! :)
It's fun to play with friends! :)"
6165,"The game, as it is, can be fun. But the controls are so fucking difficult it ruins the fun of the entire game. Its a good laugh one or two gaming sessions, but the puzzles can get extremely stressful due to the controls. Its not a game you can play everyday. Its a pop fun which u play, laugh and then regret buying (personal experience)."
6166,"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE PLAYED IN A WHILE , ITS GREAT AND I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY IT"
6167,"(NOTE) Even though I am criticizing the devs and the game, I still highly recommend to play this game on your free time with friends. It can be both very fun and surprising.

Having owned the game since Feb 15th 2018, it's safe to say that the devs are not putting as much effort into maps as they would their previous maps. Before the special dreams, each map had incredibly hidden secrets that rewarded players who would go to find it. Puzzles in maps were actually difficult and some took time and care to do. Now playing the newer special dreams, many of these maps are incredibly dull with zero to no achievable secrets in them. There are a good amount of easter eggs, like the little character dolls you can find in the City map, but there are no more special nooks and crannies you can go into to find a shortcut/ new part of the map. I just completed the Forest and Laboratory map with a friend who has also played it since 2018 and even though the new maps were unique, there were almost zero hidden aspects of it and it seems that the devs have 'dumbed' down the maps to make it much easier/user friendly. It sucks to see the maps really fall apart from the original ones and I'll still be coming back with a friend every so often to try out the new ones."
6168,"All of my yes! Great game, amazing maps, and so many fun models to pick and create! Not to mention you can find even more amazing creations in the workshop! 
I enjoy playing this so much with my friends as we run around like nut-jobs, tormenting one another while figuring out how to get through a level.
5 out of 5 stars!"

6174,"This is now one of my favorite game on Steam. The biggest attraction is the workshop levels which means you have loads of game time. I already have 160 hours and most games last 1/4 of that time. I have died many times and love that I don't have to start the level all over again, except for some levels in the workshop that do not have checkpoints. I rank this game 10/10"

6186,"It's great. It was a blast when I first got it and played with a group, and it's still a lot of fun when I regularly hop on with my 9 year old sister and/or nephew. The movement and platforming is satisfying enough and has a surprisingly high skill ceiling. The developers still occasionally add new levels, and there are some great levels to be found on the Workshop. I never really play online with randoms, so I can't really comment on that aspect. Overall, dope."

6238,"TL;DR you should get this game especially if other friends of yours have it

The price for the game feels a bit pricy, but if you think about it, it's worth it as there is lots to do in Fall Flat!!
Regarding difficulty, the game gets difficult from [spoiler] the boat level onward [/spoiler], and I personally needed to watch a walkthrough to understand some of the levels; however if you like to figure out puzzles on your own then you should definetely give this a shot!! It feels really good once you've figured out the puzzles yourself :)
The multiplayer aspect of the game is also really good !! Although the game is fun, even when playing singleplayer, it's always a blast to play with friends !! And the workshop complements it perfectly!! There are so many lobbies or levels that are okay played alone, but lots and lots of fun with friends !!

Honestly, if you have the money for it, this game is worth a shot
It's lots of fun and it's a perfect game to play on a game night!!! :P"

6284,"First off, I've played this game a fair amount offline (up to the water level); so keep that in mind. As well as the fact that I understand this game was developed by 1 (!) person. In some ways this is kind of amazing what 1 person did, but I still can't really recommend this game. I remember back when I played Little Big Planet and thought the controls were ""a little"" floaty. My goodness! LBP is absolutely polished to perfection compared to this game! It has some of the most infuriating platforming/mechanics in any game I've played. There's a reason I stopped playing at the water level.

my 59 hours on this speak for themselves, buy it

p.s. dont be a completionist, as one i can say that the frustration is real"
6334,Creative
6335,It's fun to play with friends. Have many kinds and types of theme and mode to play.
6336,"Story/Plot:
Pledge: Extra Credit is an adults only dating/sim visual novel similar to other fare offered on Steam. Needless to say, expect a lot of nudity and sexual situations, especially early on. What makes this different is the protagonist is a woman where most of the others are men.

You are Melissa, a 'Senior Sister' in charge of a sorority in your last month of college. The game quickly establishes Melissa as a spoiled brat. It is due to this behavior her parents drop financial support, making Melissa stand on her own feet.

So you have thirty days to manage your grades, sorority and relationships. As plots go, the plot holes are huge but most people who get this game aren't looking for realism.

Melissa does start out with a boyfriend, but you there are a few other people you can romance, female and male both. This is an aspect I definitely liked; while the boyfriend is shoe-horned in a couple of scenes, you are perfectly fine to ignore him otherwise.

As you can guess, this game focuses more on the sex than some of the story, but I will admit that there were elements I thought were quite nice, especially after you get past some of the expect fanservice.

Visuals:
As with other games like this, the art is done with a program similar to Poser. I will admit, I'm not the biggest fan of this style. The characters seem to have a plastic sheen as if they were Barbie dolls. The other problem is once you play other games using it, you will feel deja-vu as you know you saw that character model elsewhere.

However, the program also gives devs a chance to customize rooms/scenes/etc. to a much greater degree than might be possible. The other thing is the dev's weren't lazy for trying to make different scenes, though I couldn't help but notice mispellings/grammar mistakes. Nothing outrageous, but common enough I took notice.

Gameplay:
This game has mechanics many other dating sims have. There is a visual novel portion where you can often make choices. I'm actually glad to say that these choices can have affect as it is possible to get a different ending with multiple playthroughs.

The other part of this game is simple stat management. Besides earning money, you also study to raise grades while also managing your Looks and Sexpression. Raising these to other amounts can help unlock other activities to earn more money, get really intimate with another, etc.

The relationships are also handled by raising stats. As you can guess, raising the stat makes that character like you more. Once a certain threshold is reached, other activities open up.

If this seems a bit grindy, it is. However, I've seen games that took this to extremes.

Sound/Music:
The game does have music and it serves its function, Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be a large amount of tracks, so it becomes old fast. I found myself turning down the volume to listen to something else in the background.

Difficulty:
Overall, having played a lot of this genre, i found this game rather easy. It might be daunting for first time players, but it is rather forgiving in how you can earn money, regain energy, etc.

What is a good touch, finding different endings actually allows you to unlock a game+ mode. Rewards vary from extra money, higher stats, relationship points, etc. This is good for people who want to replay, but don't want to go through the grind.

Extras/Achievements:
As mentioned above, this game has a Game+ mode when starting over. It also has an image gallery for scenes you unlock.

However, this game doesn't have any Steam Achievements. It is a shame because some of the endings and things in game seem like it would be a natural fit to tie achievements to.

Recommendation:
So would I recommend this game? I give it a hesitant yes, but as long as you know what you are getting. This definitely fits a niche crowd.

Obviously, many people who get this game are in it for the sex. However, I definitely would have liked to see a little more story as well. There were moments where the writer actually had me enjoying the scene before it shifted to the sex.

I also thought the asking price of $10.99 US is just a little high. I admit, that extra $0.99 might have just seemed a little weird. So, for the budget conscious, I would suggest waiting for a sale.

I also admit to a personal bias. Games of this sort, made with the art program, tend to only have male protagonists, so having a female one is good. Having lesbian relationships available, and not just a single one at that, was a deciding factor.

So while my review had elements I would like to see the dev improve in future games, I do think they have a chance of making interesting games with more than sex as the draw."

6484,"Great game and loads of fun to mess around on with your mates, I've got the game on another platform with over 200 hours and I can't say I'll be getting bored of it anytime soon- and on top of that the steam workshop hugely extends the content in this game. Has to be at least one of my favourite games!"

6507,"Recommending this game only based on co-op experience. I can only imagine the painful chore that it would be playing this alone. My experience was especifically playing it with my 5 yo daughter; she loves the game cause of a youtuber brat, but of course the game can be tuff for a 5 yo, even tho she already plays, decently, other (very few) games I allow her to play.
I hated the game more than I loved it, cause of my position as the one doing all the advancement in the game, buuut, there where times when the game clicked with me and my daughter, and she would discover solutions and alternatives on her own, that actually helped me, helped us move on, while she had crazy, laugh out loud reactions to all the whacky antics and funny stuff going on with the physics. That alone made me change my attitude towards the game.
I´m really sorry if this review doesn´t help you decide if you shoud get Huma Fall Flat or not, but if you´re wondering if you should play with your kids, the answer is yes, at least 3 to 4 levels, maybe they´ll discover something, that makes it worth it."
6508,"This is a friend experience type of game. Sure you can do every level solo but the fun comes from messing around with people. You can join random lobbies but it is just not the same as playing with people you know. The game has ragdoll physics, so you character bounces around and sways weirdly. You control your left and right hand to grab objects, hook onto ledges and throw your friends off the map. You maneuver the maps with the slowest form of parkour possible and solve puzzles that are usually pretty straight forward. Some of the maps are very well designed and are pretty cool to explore. And there is a map maker so you can make your own maps. There are thousands of user created levels in the workshop so you have endless content. It is definitely a fantastic party game and a must have for your library."

6534,"Fun alone or with friends. The puzzles are engaging and the achievements make for additional fun challenges. The game itself is very goofy with easy-to-learn controls. There are a lot of levels. Each one has a checkpoint progression system that leads to an exit. Even though your goal is to reach the exit it simultaneously works as a sandbox level if you're looking to just mess around with friends. My favorite part of this game is that you can play however you want. If you found a way to skip a section the game won't stop you. Puzzles can be solved in different ways, some of which the developers did not intend. You can even skip entire levels if you find the right ways to do it. That's what makes this game so fun."

6545,nabi
6546,"9/10 Such a good game, I've played a ton of workshop maps and always come back for the new maps they add"
6547,"I've spent almost 100 hours on a game that has probably 10 or 15 hours worth of content. I've played through every level and every extra dream, I've even played through dozens of levels available on the Steam workshop and have every achievement in the game. The controls don't always work, there's a handful of glitches, and it doesn't take a long time to play through the main levels. It can become confusing on what you're supposed to do in certain sections and puzzles can be annoying when doing them in single player. 
Anyway, I highly recommend this game as long as you have some friends to play with. The game has a lot of charm and every level is very aesthetically pleasing. It would definitely take a couple playthroughs to cover all the content in each of the main levels. I love playing this game with friends. It's fun to mess around and laugh at all the quirks in this game. I recommend."

6608,"Infuriating! You simultaneously battle to solve a puzzle and your character to do what it's supposed to do. Sure the wobbly walk and all that looks bit funny, but when it comes in your way to proceed, makes you miss a jump or something few times in a row, just rather kill me in real life.

"
6609,"A fun toy where goals are achieved in different ways using physics in practice.
At first, the game is a bit difficult to manage (a gamepad is recommended).
The air is saturated with freedom of choice, I want to study everything around and make assumptions
- And what if you apply the principle of the lever and climb through the lattice?!
- Can sit in a catapult instead of the core, and fly over the castle wall?!
Cars, carts, levers-you can interact with all this, even pull up a friend hanging on the edge of a cliff, transfer an object, etc
It's a lot of fun to play with a friend, we even competed for speed, in addition to cooperative passing.
A short passage is compensated by a non-linear passage of locations.
A great project that will only get better with the appearance of the workshop!"

What none of them mentioned is that the soundtrack for this game is absolutely incredible; and the fact that almost every video on this delightfully silly game has it muted is disgraceful.

As for the game itself, I can't praise it enough.  It's great fun, simple, and goofy at times.  The puzzles are fun and engaging most of the time, and there are often multiple solutions - after all, getting past the puzzle can be as fun as actually solving it!"

6664,Human: Fall Flat is a very chaotic and fun game to play with your friends! Although aren't much levels there are lots of creative creators that make custom levels which you can find in the workshop. Since there are lots of custom levels in the workshop you always have levels you can play with your friends. Despite some bugs in the game it is a wonderful game and I would 100% recommend it.
6665,good
6666,"Fun physics, unique character customization, and creative maps."

The platforming is painful because turning makes fall no matter how much control you have if the platform is kind of small, a ton of the puzzles are tedious and irritating to do because the character has no joints, if you have no friends to play with it just is boring and movement is slow and sluggish. The soundtrack isn't very good and the gameplay makes you want to boil so I just don't recommend it."

I am obsessed with ragdoll games. They bring literal tears to my eyes and make me do the wheeze-laugh. Playing this solo is so-so, but I would highly recommend either having someone with you watching you play, OR, playing with friends.

I played this with a friend and it was the most fun I've had in a long time.

Buy this if you:
-Love ragdoll games
-Enjoy puzzle games/a challenge
-Enjoy silly (albeit frustrating) experiences that make you laugh
-Enjoy coop stuff that requires communication
-Are relatively patient (it can be surprisingly difficult)
-Enjoys different maps and having multiple paths to take on each map

Then this is for you!
My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lot of replayability. Once you figure out a puzzle, going back to redo stuff isn't as fun. But still doable.

Worth every penny. Medicine for the soul if you love to laugh.

6700,"Human Fall Flat bills itself as a puzzle platformer with super janky physics. But it's not. It's a semi-open puzzle platformer with a fairly intuitive physics systems. There's a short learning curve to learn that your hands grab where you look, but after that it's on to you to go out in the world and solve some puzzles. Each puzzle has multiple right ways to do them and all can be completed in single player. If you bring more people, you get more options in how to tackle a puzzle. The game doesn't tell you much, so it's on you to figure out how to solve your way around or break straight through a puzzle. Sometimes, having more people makes it harder as your silly humans get in each others' way. The original levels are fantastic and are perfectly sized. The bonus levels tend to be a little short and are more open and less puzzle. Still, every level (except maybe Aztec) was really fun. I say this as a person who is very bad a platformers.

If you have at least one friend to play with, it's worth getting. The more the merrier."

6738,"good

6739,"I really like this game to pass some time and hang out with friends whle you play.

This is an excelent game to play on multiplayer, is very fun and you can pass a lot of time playing it without being bored (specially if you are trying the achievments). 

Something I like a lot about this game is the Character Customisation options, that are almost ilimited, since you can paint your character, which makes the multiplayer interactions more fun. I recommend it as a game to play with friends, for this is, in my opinion, what makes this game truly fun and one of my favorite multiplayer games."

6790,"its pretty Pog SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH am i right...no seriously am i?
"
6791,This game is a precision platformer. The player characters will jump anywhere from 0.1 to 0.3 seconds after you push the jump key. The player characters will walk/run anywhere from 0.2 to 0.4 seconds after you push the joystick. I really don't understand what the devs were thinking.

6798,"After an hour of playing, I realized that every lvl. can be finished by climbing and swinging along the walls instead of solving puzzles. So I challenged myself. I played both ways and it’s great. I definitely recommend it for one or more players."
6799,Fun to play with friends

6807,Only playable with friends.
6808,Very fun game to play with a friend. It stimulates your mind to try to find and use resources in the game in order to pass the level. The only thing I disliked was that there wasn't much music.
6809,"Game is about human beans that try to achieve greatness with other beans, so human beans gather together to complete tasks to finish main task to fulfill beans happiness"

6812,"Most of my hours come from Xbox Game Pass.... I probably have about 30 or 40 hours in this game at the time of review. 

Let me tell you. I have never come closer to passing out from laughing then I have playing this game. We have a group of 3-5 people and we all have pretty good chemistry between us we have a diverse range of gaming skill between us which helps add to the antics. 

There is no single defining moment of exactly what makes this game so much fun. If your just going in to be goal oriented it may not be as enjoyable, but if you have some good friends who ever so often try to throw you off a cliff, or pull you back over the ledge of success you will find many fun filled moments. Many of times have one of us gone AFK to use the washroom or whatever only to come back to our dangling body being held by another as we look into the eternal abyss and contemplate our relationships. I can't count the number of times I have been at the edge of a cliff or jump only be grabbed mid air and pulled into nothingness or to have made the jump only for my friends to pile on my hanging body and use me as a step ladder to climb their way to victory. We are a pretty tight group so we often will help out our friends that are struggling with certain obstacles or objectives in this game as well and its not only rewarding for the players helping but adds some fun for the player struggling as well. We have had some pretty crazy moments helping people make the course and having fun instead of just falling and spawning in the new area. 

One such incident happened last night that involved, Almost naked Borrat, Robert Paul Champagne, Hommie G and a golf club trying to pull Ron Weasley over a golf cart onto a ridge... .It was a moment of hilarity and triumph. 

Now, when I say I have almost passed out from laughing at the shenanigans and antics we have had in this game, there has been several times of epic laughter among us but one such time I had to physically force myself to stop laughing audibly so I could breath but I could not stop my face muscles from making the face I make when I laugh so my face was stuck in the laughing position like the Joker while I was trying to focus on breathing it was incredible to say the least.  

We played all the normal levels on Xbox Game Pass then this went on sale for 6 dollars on the summer sale, and I would easily buy this game for 20 dollars for the amount of fun I and my friends have had. With all the workshop content available this game easily has a good long shelf life for you and your group. This is a must have for people of good sense. 

Grab some drinks (if that's your thing), grab some smoke (if that's your thing) and grab your closest most dearest friends and throw them off a cliff or better yet dangle them by their foot off the edge so that just as they sit down and you can hear their headset rattle you drop them into the void."
6813,mmm human
6814,big brain time
6815,yes
6816,Great game
6817,Very good game
6818,This game is a blast with friends. 10/10 would grab a friend and throw both of us down into the abiss
6819,"Not worth the full price, but very fun with friends"
6820,"Alcohol is the mother of all evil. 
Driving a drunken fella to his death most of the time.

6830,Great game but I seem to have a searing pain in my right testicle so im going to go get that checked
6831,"you dont really ""play"" this game you kind of just fumble around in it. it'd be charming if there were more levels."

6864,"Interesting puzzles, and funny floppy characters!

But once the novelty of the floppy characters wears off, you are left trying to solve puzzles while constantly contending with poor character control. 

This game is certainly much more fun to play with family and friends (we bought multiples copies so we can play together). But the game can only hold our attention for a few stages at a time."

6890,for coop one of the best out there.

6927,"Feeling motion sick when I play this game.
It is fun and there are a lot of puzzle but I cannot play it just because I feel like vomiting when i play this game.
Other than that it is good game."
6928,"This game is such a comfort game to me.  I've played through every level a couple of times each, including the bonus levels, by myself and with friends.  I've gone on achievement hunting missions to get all the achievements in the level (I've gotten all 96 achievements as of right now), and I've gone on just goofing around runs with my friends.  It's always a hillarious time with others, and when I play by myself it's super relaxing for me.  I love all the puzzles and my favorite part is that there is no one way to do anything.  You can finish the level by going through the directed route, or go some completely different way (like climbing the entire side of the map to get to the exit point xD).  Every run is a different experience and that makes it so much fun.
 10/10 would recommend."
6929,this game is shit
6930,its a really fun game to play with friends

6940,"2 days ago I tried to solve the problem, the problem is that the game did not start throwing an error about unity. I read all the videos and forms, I tested all the variants twice and it didn't work out. (My computer is not old). As far as I’m not shopping for games wasn’t a problem at all. When I bought this game, I damaged my nerves and how much time.

Error:
UnityPlayer.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005) in module UnityPlayer.dll at 0023:60e95251."
6941,"Funny game, especially when playing with the team :D"
6942,its very nice game to play whit your friends .
6943,"Fun with friends, though it needs a lot more content for sure. The workshop is all kinda weird and not many contribute sane levels ^_^"
6944,"Wanna have a total piss about and have a giggle at the same time Human: Fall Flat is right mess about with no hassle involved, however, there's only so much fuel in it's proverbial tank but it will get you there."
6945,"Played it for 3 hours and I absolutely love it the paint tool is awesome I did make a few mistake with the backfaced but that was fixed in a press of a button so yeah Chrismas money, money in general, or birthday money buy it while it’s on sale!"

6947,"A really cute and funny game to play. With friends or even alone, I think it'll be a fun game for those who like whacky physics and puzzles as well. 10/10 would recommend."

6949,If you are Sober or Drunk and are bored with some friends that arent entirely okay in their mind then this is the perfect game for you!
6950,my friends keep grabbing my butt so i cant finish the map

6954,Amazing gut chop game
6955,cool
6956,THIS GAME IS SO FUN ASF
6957,"Could be fun with friends, but alone it is simply  infuriating. Failures become nothing but setbacks, rather than something you can laugh about. Paths occasionally way too unclear, and you have the chance to get sent back to the start with 1 wrong move. Again, maybe something you could laugh about with a friend, and just get back up there laughing along the way, but in singleplayer it's just infuriating."
6958,"Pretty fun game wish massive community content to play. Some achievements are quite annoying to unlock.
Do reconsider if you are buying this mainly for multiplayer co-op, because you will face enormous input lag that makes the game almost unplayable."
6959,ini game sangat membikin kita menjadi pintar dan  game ini kalau dimaen pada malam hari saya paling pintar
6960,Very good game
6961,it fun
6962,"Husband's Opinion: This game is really freaking funny, guys. As you can see, we only got 0.6 hrs in this game (about +-35 mins), however this game did not take long to make us burst into laughter. Only 15 minutes spent in the world, as the remainder was spent to model our characters (my wife took the longest time, obviously, hehe). The character's movement were really funny to begin with. Can't wait to continue our journey together soon.

p.s. Or is it I'm the one who is funny? Just kidding, guys. Just get this game, guys and experience the fun.

Wife's Opinion: Emmm no comment. As I was being forced by my husband to play this game. However, I have time to peek a glance onto this game and it is quite interesting since we can choose our own characteristic and also customize to your own taste. Preferably to those who like to makeover themselves! The most important is you enjoy and have fun especially during this pandemic!

Will update more later, as we progress into the game."

"
6989,"This is an AMAZING game. It's just so much fun to play all the different levels and beat them by solving puzzles, doing parkour, etc. It's certainly the most fun when you play with multiple people. It gets better when you play subscribed levels (If they're actually good). Is it perfect though? Absolutely not. This game can glitch often and can get pretty clunky at times. Sometimes when you grab, it won't let you, and I found the leg-stuck-in-butt glitch very annoying. But at the end of the day, it's an awesome game."
6990,"It's a great game! it does have a few small bugs and some achievements are more difficult then they should have to be, but generally it's a one of a kind and is a must have for anyone's steam collection."
6991,lol
6992,this game is so much fun especilly cuz the new forest map and how it kinda makes me feel like im playing minecraft cuz the music and all the trees like a forest and so much stuff i would defintly recommend buying this game its so awesome straight!!!
6993,"Always losing connection to people you play with, even if that person is in the same room with solid internet."
6994,"Great game!
- Simple but fun mechanics for climbing and platforming
- Great base levels with puzzles and parkour, often with the option to skip sections with trickier alternate routes
- A heap of workshop content to keep you and friends playing with maps and character customisation"
6995,amazing

- You can throw your friends off the edge of the map
Cons:
- Your friends can throw you off the edge of the map"

I want to commend the developers for some surreal landscapes and neat little puzzles, but the controls are so irritating that at no point do you feel fulfilled or satisfied, even when you solve a puzzle or discover a new world. In a word, ""disappointing."""

You play as a humanoid lump and have to use your body to manipulate the environment to pass through. Your friends you play with are essential to completing these objectives. The best part of Human: Fall Flat is the ways the game lets you use it to have fun shenanigans on the way to completing each map. You and your friends could play normally, making use of each other to finish puzzles, or, as I like to play it, mess around and barely play the objective due to how much you keep fooling around like mischievous children. There is a boatload of fun to be had in this game."
7020,This is good but if have you have no friends like me it's boring but it good if you have friends
7021,as a human i identify with the game characters struggles to overcome the many obstacles in their lives
7022,"what can i say, i played it for like 4 hours and i like it, but its not so fun with random people you should try it with your friends"
7023,"A fun physics-based puzzle game that's so much better with others. Half my fun isn't even actually completing the game's puzzles, it's from messing about with friends or random players. For me, the puzzles are the side activity, the main attraction is this dumb playground with people acting dumb but with tools. I spent what felt like a 2 hour game with a full 8-player lobby and all it was was a giant wrestling match to see who would get shoved into a catapult. I swear, this game provides dumb playground fun like no other and I absolutely love it for this. While I would recommend getting this with some friends, it's also great playing in public lobbies."

7105,"Have you dreamt about new keyboard? Have you dreamt about new monitor? Have you dreamt about new mouse? I hope so, because you surely gonna destroy your actuall staff trying to beat this game. Try not to get beaten though, it is fun(-eral) after all. 
 
In [i]People: Autumn Apartment[/i] you (and your friends if you have one) have a very important role to make a safe journey from start to end... which never really comes... by controlling customisable character with some coordination disfunction that causes him to move his hands and head always the same way. Terrible disease but you still gonna call it Photoshop.

Fasten your seatbelts because No Break Games didn't finish there! Your poor protagonist cannot actually die which extends his perpetual torment to [b]infinity[/b]... and if you have this misfortune to be [strike]achievement w***e[/strike] completionist then beg for mercy or don't even start... with every new update, with every new map comes new Steam achievements! You shan't have them all, sorry little lost soul. This game is only for hardcore players with their nerves from steel, keyboard from obsidian, mouse from adamantium and monitor from hardened titanium as I might had mentioned it before. 

Feeling afraid? Feeling weak? That's good symptoms, maybe there is still hope for you... or maybe you are already broken. Nevertheless play and have (questionable) fun!"

7116,"I think you should play this game if you love puzzle/physics based games, and have a few friends to play with (if you don't, don't buy it). The puzzles and physics work really well together when you're playing with friends and has a lot of fun to be had. There are usually many ways to finish a level and it always eases you into the way to figure it out really well, though, many levels that have a gimmick don't use it ever again even though there were many possibilities for it to be used. At the end of the day this is a really good game and is an incredibly fun experience."

7135,"While I was in the group of people that were ticked off about the silent cut of Linux support as a Linux gamer, that wasn't all that broke the game for me. I put three hours into this, hoping for a good experience.

First, it was off to a bad start because I had to remove my install of the Linux depot, which saddened me because I had not heard the news at the time. While I get the appeal of this game as a party game with ragdoll physics and the such, the controls were awful. Aiming with either a controller or mouse was a challenge in of itself, and the way to climb around was awkward. It felt like someone took Grow Home and swapped B.U.D. with Interactive Buddy.

I would've liked to see the game done a bit differently in the controls scheme, and have the physics a bit more manageable to get across the world. I didn't find player movement to be intuitive or convenient as it was slow and too bouncy or constantly getting tripped up by the rubble. Camera bob as well didn't really help the case."

7199,"Human Fall Flat is autism heaven. It offers a variety of physics based puzzles and platforming, in which if you cooperate, can be very fun. But incase you really just dont feel like cooperating, you can always climb out of it or take a shortcut. Human Fall Flat surprises me at how satisfying it is: from breaking glass, to driving a truckload of coal safely without failing once, to swinging on conveyor belts with one hand on the belt and one hand holding a power brick, to riding boats down rivers, scaling up from a small wee raft to a giant cargo ship; this game is extremely satisfying. At first you will become a little annoyed over the flimsy wacky controls, but you get used to it fast, as it really fits the game.

I personally think this is one of my most favourite physics based games I've ever played so far. Sure, theres Garry's Mod, but, can you ride wrecking balls, fire catapults and drive boats without the extremely precise Gravity and Physics Gun? Garry's Mod Physics are too precise, which is why completing a puzzle in this game is so satisfying and the two arms mechanic makes you feel as if you have more control. Having 2 arms makes up for the flimsy movement, because you can carry 2 objects at once, have one hand on a lever and one on a wheel, carry a power brick in one hand and a wire in another, etc. In Garry's Mod you don't really have 2 usable hands.

I've always enjoyed the idea of having 2 Physics based arms and hands, like in Little Big Planet, where you could grab onto things or Citizen Burger DIsorder, an old game, which unfortunately has discontinued. But in general, I think this is probably one of the best sandbox physics type games I've played, due to the 2 arms mechanic. Its just so pleasing to be able to grab onto a hook, jump off and swing. It really makes you feel like you have all the control in this world, and that nothing can stop you and your arms. Except for Aztec. Aztec can piss off your arms a bit.

Human Fall Flat is just such an amazing game, there are no real objectives (aside from, well, getting to the end), no limitations, no invisible walls, handholding or linear paths. Human Fall Flat puts you into its world and allows you to make your own solutions up if you want to. You don't always have to follow whats required, but I almost always find myself wanting to, just because of how cool the levels are.

Power Plant is one of the best, in my opinion. It has a nice combination of Electricity Puzzles, Vehicle driving and Fueling. Aswell as the Boat level, which is amazingly fun. The first few levels in the game will be short, but once you get to Castle, oh boy, you'll be hooked. I cannot stress this enough, the levels in this game are just so well designed and they almost always leave me wanting more! More broken windows! More catapults! More swinging! More boats! More vehicle driving!!! Gimme moooree!!

The only thing that really annoys me is whenever I don't understand how to start a level, I try to make my own solution as to how to navigate it, which annoys me because climbing vertical walls can be very hard, and if anything I make myself realise that skipping a bunch of areas just makes me miss out on the experience.

If you're looking for a fun Physics Based Sandbox Puzzle Platformer, this game is definitely worth it. Buy it immediately. I absolutely adore this game, from its character customisation, to its levels, its physics, its workshop (which allows you to make characters and share them for others to enjoy, and custom maps and stuff aswell, which is amazing, honestly, thank you devs so much for custom levels, this game really needs it, I haven't beaten the game yet, but when I do, I am gonna play a ton of custom levels.)

This game's humor is also amazing, it doesn't even have to say anything, all the comedy comes from you, yourself, experiencing the game. I suppose its kind of slapstick, but you will be left a bit disappointed when you realise theres only about 2 ways to die after stepping in fire hazards.

anyways, Obama says: Buy the game, buy it  n o w."
7200,"Funny game, specailly if you play it co-op with a friend. The beginning is funnier because you are still learning how to move. In the middle of the game, there are some levels that are long and a bit difficult (e.g. the water lavel) but I liked the puzzle desing overall."

7288,Great game to play with friends. I really enjoy the funny physics and the best part is when you fall off the world you paradoxically plummet down right near where you fell.

7301,"This game is great, the platforming and puzzles all work together to form a solid game. Would recommend."
7302,"I really like games about rag dolls and physics, which is why I also have Octodad and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, and this game really captures that. You flop around, and try to complete task while doing so. I also love the customization, it's really fun. I have nothing negative to say about this game. I would suggest buying it, it's for sure worth the money."

7314,"This is such a entertaining game. It is a perfect game with friends paired with the unique controls, there will be many unforgettable memories shared among the many simplistic yet intriguing maps. For achievement hunters, like myself, the game is a real treat, having many achievements that are not impossible, but still feel rewarding when acquired, with the perfect balance of quality and quantity. I will continue to play this with friends in the future.

7400,Really fun game to play with your friends! When you are done with the levels provided by the game you can play levels from the workshop and you can make your own levels if you want. I definitely recommend this game!
7401,"Human falls?

Human falls!"
7402,ok
7403,"With friends? Yes, I really recommend this.
Alone? No way.

This game thrives on being played with friends. Without friends it's just a wonky physics tech demo with a few bits and bobs attached. Seriously, it's not fun to play alone.

Universal complaint might be that the physics don't really work like you might expect. Three people trying to pull two people up is impossible for some reason. In one level it might take two people to move something, but in another level you can effortlessly pick something twice that size up with one arm.

Another thing: If you're a full lobby it might be hard to coordinate and get everyone to be a part of the puzzles. Personally I've found the moments where you just goof around the most enjoyable."

The goofy physics may seem frustrating but after a little practice they're not so flimsy it's impossible and not so simple it's boring. Good, bouncy and wobbly physics.

7549,Tek başınıza oynarsanız fazla sarmaz. Ne kadar çok arkadaşınızla oynarsanız o kadar eğlenirsiniz. Gayet basit bir fizik-puzzle oyunu.
7550,"""Human: Fall Flat"" is a well-done, fun game.  It's especially fun when played co-op (watching your friends thrash around is hilarious).  My complaints about it are minor:

- Even though the game is predicated on moving floppy bodies around with loose controls, many of the optional paths, areas or Achievements need fairly tight control.  In general, though, because of the ensuing hilarity, this is fine.

- The ability to climb walls would be nice.  From what I've read, this was removed from the game for being overpowered.  Looking at a lot of the speedrun videos on YouTube, I've got to agree with that.  But, having the ability to just use our chins or something to edge us up that last inch or two of a slightly botched jump would be great.

- I don't know if this was a generic connection issue or something with the game, but in co-op, we experienced quite a few momentary freezes.  It's more than a stutter.  The game appears to just stop for 5 or so seconds at a time.  Unfortunately, when it happens, things are still  happening in the game and when things un-freeze, you can find yourself in a less than stellar situation.

And that's pretty much it.  Just a few minor issues with a great game.  It took me 46.7 hours to complete it with 100% Achievements (though that was with a lot of repeat co-op play -- a more focused approach would be significantly faster).  So, it's worth it even at its list price of nearly $20 (though it historically goes on sale for between $6 and $7.50 quite often).  Recommended."

I played a little bit of this game, and it's HILARIOUS. Just the way your little buddy wakes around make my day, his little legs and booty it's just to much :)) Also works with your friends to solve puzzle is much easier and you can cheat the system one way or another.

The first night I played, it was with my friend James, and to be honest, we played for 8 hours straight, until the early morning birds were chirping outside my window. There's something mystical and dreamlike about being inside these worlds. There's nothing crazy and mind blowing in terms of what you're literally doing in the game, but it has a way of keeping you entertained for hours. Messing around with the physics and trying to find ""secret"" areas is fun enough. Enjoy!"

7804,"This is one of those games that you can lose several hours playing repeatedly with friends. With the inclusion of Steam Workshop, you'll definitely have many hours of fun even after completing the base game.

Human: Fall Flat is just a co-op puzzle solving game that is done through physics. What's great about it is most puzzles have more than one way of solving them, and I believe that's what makes this game great. Say, you might find climbing easier but I found critical thinking easier and we both ended up completing the same puzzle. That's the beauty of this game. Give it a try if you're a puzzle enthusiast or simply love playing silly games with your friends."

We practically went through the main storyline (5 out of 8 levels), having spent 5 hours on it (provided that we are experienced and not stupid players). if you know what to do, then in principle you can spend a maximum of 2 hours walking, but neither I nor my friend knew) we strained the convolutions of the brain and did it) next maps from the workshop)"

7876,Pretty good but gets boring alone
7877,"A fun game nonetheless, but it is still lacking a lot.

Playing this game, you are introduced to silly physics, wonky controls, and a unique style of gameplay that is formed into a puzzle-style genre. You must get to the end of the level navigating with your character, and clearing way of obstacles. The control system in this game (that allows for grabbing, climbing, pushing, and pulling) is very fun to mess around with and provides a good challenge for completing the parts of the game. However, that is really the only fun part about this game.

Unfortunately, this game does not hold much ""replayability"", and frankly becomes repetitive and boring after the first few levels, which there are not very many of. One of the bright sides about this issue is that there a a multitude of community made mods and maps, but nonetheless they all fall victim to the same issues the base game has.

It helps to play with friends (albeit you will spend most of the time messing around and trying to pull each other into the void in the map), but I still feel like this game simply cannot satisfy enough, especially for the price that is charged regularly ($20 USD). It is a very quick play through, and the achievements are easy. Once you complete this game, you will find it difficult to come back and go through it again."

8000,This is a fun ragdoll multiplayer that is fun with friends.
8001,nobody in my family says i have a gaming problem when i play this. they often think something else.
8002,This game is very good if you play with your friends.
8003,"This game can be summed up with one sentence, ""Difficult, but in the end, you end up feeling like it was so worth it."""
8004,"Funny Game 

i love it"
8005,"If you're looking for a game to play with a friend(s), this game is a must buy. The game itself is not much but can be gateway to one of the best gaming experiences of one's gaming history. 

To start off, the core of the game itself is extremely bland. The puzzles are incredibly mediocre and some even feel as If the solution isn't a logical one. The platforming and climbing mechanics are incredibly hard to initially use (especially when not the host of an online lobby)but once mastered is fun to mess around with but can become a redundant and unfulfilling solution to most puzzles. Overall, this game is not recommended  to anyone who wants to play this alone or with a random acquaintance.

On the other hand, if you have a friend who you know would just want to spend some time messing around in this game with you, it's absolutely a perfect experience. Unlike most other multiplayer games, this game has absolutely no competition(except the ones you make yourselves) against other players due to it being a sandbox. Due to the nature of sandbox games, the focus of the coop is completely based on having a great time with a friend(s); just pure fun and joy.

Though the multiplayer is an absolute blast, it does have a few issues. Having a stable internet connection on all ends is required for all of the guest players of a lobby to be able to platform without delay. This internet problem is also an issue if the host is disconnected mid game as there are no checkpoints to skip to in each level. Another problem is the lack of quality levels, in which there are a only a few base levels that come with the game which is easily fixed with steam workshop; though steam workshop does an amazing job at providing new levels, once all quality levels are reaped of their worth, finding good levels that does not have foreign music bopping over it is hard to come across. 

Prior to fully playing all of the fan made levels, the steam workshop is filled with low quality Chinese levels, it does an amazing job at providing with more content as these fan made levels can be show to have an intense amount of love and passion put into them which just overall enhances the experience for everyone. In conclusion, the deciding factor of purchasing this game shouldn't be based on the quality of the game itself, but who you have to play this with; as personally, the amount of fondness I have for this game due to the memories of all the fun time I had playing this is worth more than any currency."

8020,"This is a pretty good one, I was into the physics games way back when since I found that type of stuff funny. This game is really a puzzle game at hearth though, with some really solid maps to boot. A few more basic ones, only meant for one run through sort of as a tutorial. The rest is pretty good though, no ""halt your life just to play"" content, but some solid stuff that is much more enjoyed with friends, even if they're crowded around your screen or just watching you play through a stream, it's fun to figure out each level with your friends. overall 3.5/5, nothing to sneeze at but not triple A type stuff. If you have the extra money, go for it. If not, hold of for another game maybe. It's up to you and your playstyle."

8049,"I enjoyed playing Human Fall Flat, However I don't think it is worth 20 dollars.
The silly physics are fun and actually work. I like how it has SILLY physics, not BROKEN physics, for example: fall guys has broken physics. 
This game is pretty much only fun if you play it with your friends. If your friends don't own it or don't plan on buying it, it's not worth it. It's super fun to be in a discord call with friends goofing around even if they are pissing you off. The game is pretty bare bones, and I think that's why it works so well as a fun multiplayer game. 
There is also a pretty funny character creator where you can upload your own face as an image.
It's a fun game
this is a negative review because almost everytime I try to launch the game, it causes my cursor to freeze in the middle of the screen and there is seemingly no way to fix it other than to mess with the settings of the game

Score: 5/7"

8066,I had such a blast playing this with my friend. The wonky physics can be a little challenging but also hilarious.I'm a gamer and she hasn't done much gaming ever. It took us some time to find a game to interest us both and this one was a good pace and difficulty for us both. Some puzzles were frustrating and tedious but in the end my friend and I walk away saying that it was a blast. In addition I laughed so hard that my jaw and stomach hurt.  All in all I highly recommend it as a game to play with friends just keep in mind you may need to have some patience to get through some parts.

8153,"Human: Fall Flat is a really cool physics sandbox/puzzle game that is worth at least one play. Mechanics? Very nice! Playerbase? existant! Workshop support? Yep, it's there. That is why I am leaving a negative review.

Human: Fall Flat on Steam was supposed to be the best version. I can draw on my playermodel, which was something I could not do on Switch, and always liked about the pc version. It's Human with nice customization, and I'm leaving a negative review? Yep.

The server lag is such a shame. The delay is extremely noticeable. That is something Human has about always dealt with. But man, this workshop support. It is allowing people to download mods and then host in the server browser. Well then use mod filters? No, there are none. If I join, Steam will FORCE download the mods contained. If I leave the server Steam will continue to force download the content. I cannot pause it until I leave game. It is extremely frustrating. My opinion may not be shared by many, but I hate mods for the most part. Just let Human be Human.

Human: Fall Flat on Steam was frankly disappointing.

Do I NOT recommend this game? Not necessarily. If you have no desire to play online, then go for it. If you do want to play online and don't mind frequent, forced downloading and potentially laggy servers, go for it."

also to the people complaining about linux support removal, linux users can just use proton and run the game fine.

although one thing, i did get this game on sale, and i feel like it would be more worth it waiting for a sale yourself, as i dont think its really worth 15$ USD.

however it is a very amazing game and its way more addicting than what you would expect"
8158,"Wanna act like the stupidest being known to mankind? This game is for you.
There's a lot of things you can do in this game, specially in the main levels where there's more than just 1 way to get through them, which adds a lot of replayability either by yourself or with friends."

8252,Its fun but the multiplayer latency is bad
8253,"this is a very fun game, i want others to play and to see how fun it is!"
8254,Its Vary Entertaining. Once You've played all the maps tho its hard to find no maps that are interesting enough to play but when you do its worth it. even if your replaying a map that you already played its still fun to do!
8255,NICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
8256,its very fun
8257,This game is hilarious when you play with friends and family! I personally like to throw the other person off the edge. I would rate this 5 stars if I could!
8258,yes
8259,it's a fun game that challenges your brain
8260,"In my spare time, I like to... I like to take... erm, old crates, y'know, and... I like to paint... buses. Yes, mmm, I paint buses out of the wooden crates. Very good buses. There are now these vegan [vee-gan] sausage rolls. Have you perhaps had a vegan [vee-gan] sausage roll? Quite good."

8265,best game!!!!!
8266,ever wanted to see what life was like through the eyes of your handicapped child. now u can understand what they experience everyday. it's great.
8267,This game WILL make you rage at some point if you have anger issues like me.  Walking Controls are probably the hardest in any game.
8268,chu chu chuuu >^<
8269,"Normal gameplay is trying to solve puzzles to get through the levels, teaming up with friends and combining your big brains to make it through together.

Speedrun gameplay is ditching your friends entirely and scaling walls for the sole purpose of avoiding nearly every puzzle in the game, and I think jumping on an axe to gain MAXIMUM HEIGHT in one level.

Either way, you can have whatever custom character you want, and ragdolling in this game is some of the most fun I've ever had in any game, so worth the buy, especially with friends."
8270,It's so much fun to play with friends and I definitely recommend it!
8271,good shit
8272,omg its soo good i would reccomend this all the time i love it (:
8273,I have had the best fun streaming this with my grandson as my co-op partner.  I love everything about it and we have had my viewers in fits of laughter many times while they watch us (me) failing miserably in so many funny and unforeseen ways.
8274,"Great game, and there are so many maps you can download! 100% suggest this game :D"
8275,very good
8276,"really amazing

8277,relly good if you like rageing allso it has sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many levels like local subscribed levels normal and much more play plz plz plz plz plz
8278,One of the best funny and enjoyable multiplayer game to play with friends. The best thing with this game is 'Workshop Items'.
8279,Good
8280,"It starts off as a quite interesting thing with kind of some story-ish thing. Switches, ideas. Breakable stuff. Mechanics. Then the whole game fades out into a much more basic, ""prehistoric"" gameplay where you play with rocks and sticks while before you played with mechanisms, switches and technology. After some time you get to a boating level where you can get completely lost and frustrated to hell by the controls of the rowboat and especially the raft where you have to push it to go... I am sorry about all this, because it started out as a nice little game but went into a ""let's just have some more random levels where the player can mess around"". Because of this I cannot recommend it."
8281,I like how you can play by yourself or work with others! Its a very strategized and well thought out game!
8282,This is super fun when you play when with friends
8283,yes
8284,"this game is for everyone, the one whose a nerd, the one whose dumb, the one that likes to sit around, the one who likes to play completly wrong and make everyone made while doing it"

8298,is good
8299,"very interesting game, mechanics are brilliant .. not really any negatives i can honestly say the negatives i have found hasn't effected the game in the slightest, but many more hours off fun too be had, much love developers. i cant see many people disliking this game if their are those rare people they haven't gave it enough time."
8300,very funny game ;)
8301,"Transport, transport tresa eurosport"
8302,Lots of fun when playing with a friend and solve puzzle together 👾
8303,is good yea
8304,ok ok proton with this game on ubuntu works great and plays just like windows :)
8305,I fell flat
8306,good game
8307,"Human Fall Flat is a bizarre, but brilliant game. It's plethora of challenges lead you around surreal worlds devoid of practical arrangements, focusing more on mechanistic experiences. Almost everything crafted into the worlds is interactable, and primed for exploration. The environments, (as well as the customisation/workshop), are some of the things that really make this game  shine. The game is like a playground. 8 player ""coop"" is hilarious. But it's not just the multiplayer that's fun; if you like collecting in-game achievements this game has a colourful set too."
8308,meh
8309,OMG!!!!! GAME SO EPICAL GOOOOOD!!!!!
8310,"Fun game with silly physics mechanics! Making your own map for the workshop is pretty easy, too! A lot of laughs when playing maps with friends :)"

8326,good
8327,funy
8328,"Very frustrating at times, but ultimately fun and hilarious. Has a Portal vibe to it, but don't expect there to be accurate physics. Precise control is not achievable, but that's the fun... barreling through the level like a bull in a china shop. By yourself some of the situations can be difficult to figure out, but playing with others allows some off the wall cheese to happen... enjoy."
8329,omg
8330,"Me and my friends are so bad it had me wondering if the game shouldn't be named ""Bot Fall Flat"""
8331,good fun game to mess around with your freind

8333,.
8334,"I love this game, i know some people complain about the controls but if anything that adds to the fun for me and you end up laughing at how terribly your doing. some of the puzzles require a bit of thinking but very satisfying when you work it out. Played for over 20 hours so far across PC and PS4 with more to come now my nephew is addicted too!"
8335,"Well playing it alone is boring 
But if u got some company it is fun but after 1-3h ul get bored is it worth ur money well 50-50"

8342,"its good

8343,"For everyone. who likes to play a game which is challenging, contains riddles, requires skill, supports custom maps and gives you constantly fits of laughter, it is the right game for you.

I recommend to play it in multiplayer. You will definitely have a good time."

Movement feels janky the first 10 minutes or so, but smoothens out after that. Most important hint/mechanic; If you grab a ledge with both hands and then pull your mouse/camera down, the ""human"" will pull himself up onto said ledge! :)"

8414,Good Game.
8415,yes
8416,"I think the game is on an interesting path.  I would like to see more development of this game.  However, I find game modes where there is no objective or goal a waste of time and it makes me want to quit do to boredom.  I do like the game modes where you have to co-op with each other in order to get through the levels fun the most.  I think jumping needs to be improved.  I think this game has high potential to be better than Fallguys.  The game modes also needs rewards of any kind to keep the player invested.  A battlepass, or experience points and a chance to earn new costumes would be great.  Overall rating right now I would give it a 5/10.  That might be harsh but the game is still in development.  No way the game will last long in the state it's in now.  I really find the concept to be fun and innovative.  Please improve the jumping and grabbing mechanics.  Other than that the game deffinately going in a good direction, but still needs work."

very fun game all the custom steam workshop levels are terrible and u will hate it and love it at the same time

give it a try you might hate yourself afterwards but who cares?
in this world of ours that matters less than a few moments of pure unfiltered happiness, messing around with boxes and throwing your friends off if cliffs (if u have any) if not u can join in on urself with a keyboard and a controller to fill in that sad sad void of yours you call a heart

this review took a weird turn just play the game its fun im gonna go get some sleep"

8439,"My friends and I have so many problems with this game. Our internet is great, yet its always telling us ""Connection lost"" when we try to accept invites. Getting into the game is difficult, but once we get in, the game starts wiggin out after 30 minutes of playing. In my experience, my character starts moving entirely in slow motion; and there's nothing I can do to fix it. I'll exit out, but them I'm met with the same ""Connection lost"" screen. Is there anyway I can fix this? This game is really fun, and I want to make more content with it; but its making it really difficult to do so."
8440,Fun fun fun
8441,human the fall the flat
8442,"it is so bad i hope you read this before you buy the game

8443,"Need friends to play i, boring af otherwise. POGCHAMP LOL. Funny af"
8444,"It always feels a bit disingenuous when a review starts with “I really wanted to like this game, I really do – but…” and yet here I am having to start my review precisely like that. Because Human: Fall flat starts out with a premise that I really like and would love to see handled well, only to let me down by drowning out the more interesting aspects with its ill-conceived use of clumsy-on-purpose and hard-to-control avatar movements as a source of cheap, gimmicky humor. Some people have held puns to be the lowest form of humor, but in my view this dubious distinction is clearly reserved for slapstick, which is precisely what you end up with in this game. Which is a shame, because it detracts greatly from its far more interesting aspects as a physics-based puzzler that provides you with a set of playgrounds for fiddling around with force, momentum, gravity and other basic concepts that we all wish we had learnt to understand better in science class. Oh, how I wish that the game had leaned more heavily into this side of its subject matter, rather than letting it play second fiddle to the “cavalcade of pratfalls”/”LMFAO, look at those clumsy ragdoll avatars” element. But alas, it does not. 
To ponder questions like “wait, how does a rudder work, actually?” and “what’s the best angle if I want to use this beam to break this screen?” is the real attraction of this game, but instead the focus is moved to “aaargh… this little ragdoll dudette is impossible to move around with precision!” Which is a pity in my estimation, although it seems to have an appeal of its own to a different audience. Which is fair enough, even if I’m not too happy about it. 

Although I’m unhappy with parts of this game, I still don’t want to give it a thumbs-down rating for being a different game than what I’d ideally like it to be (ie., I would have liked it to be more of a playground for familiarizing oneself with basic physics concepts through concrete tasks and puzzles, whereas the game leans more into being a source of cheap humor through clumsy and frustrating controls. While I’m unhappy about the direction it has chosen, it doesn’t seem fair to actually give it a bad rating for being a different game than what I’d want it to be). 

Positives:
+ the developers are extremely conscientious and diligent in the way they follow up their game with new levels (and additional achievements for them, not least – an oft-neglected element by those who like to uphold the pious pretense of not really caring that much about the cheevies), which is probably the main reason I’m giving them a thumbs-up verdict despite my misgivings (for the same reason, this is why I have nominated H:FF for Steam’s “Labor of Love” award at least once if not more)
+ The basic concept is great. There is definitely a niche for a physics-based puzzle platformer like this, even if the game’s current iteration leaves room for improvement.

Negatives:
- while the clumsy controls are a feature rather than a bug, I still find them a huge annoyance and a distraction from the more promising and interesting aspects of the game. As it works right now, one is often uncertain if the attempted action fails because one has failed to understand the physics involved, or simply because the avatar is too hard to control properly. Not good. I know some players think this is funny (and bully for them, I guess), but I am certainly not laughing. 
- I get the feeling that it’s made primarily with multiplayer in mind, which is not really ideal to me. If I want to be social, I do it IRL, whereas games are supposed to be me-time as far as I am concerned. But once again, this falls into the category of “me being unhappy that the game is a different game than I would have preferred,” and thus there are limits to how loudly I would feel justified in complaining about it."

If you have any sort of issues with finger or wrist joints, just don't even bother looking at this page. This game is not for you, and they do not give a sh*t about you, either. 

P.s. for other games I hate, watch some Lumps Plays on the YouTubes."
8470,So poggers
8471,"Usually most party games are funny as first but quickly lose their funny factor; However, Human Fall Flat has definitely kept its flavor even after hours. I find myself checking the updates everyday in hopes of a new set of achievements/levels sometimes even checking twitter to see what the devs have been up to. The level design is extremely well done allowing for some difficulty, the ability to play around with levels, and has plenty of playground points as well. Of course like every game there is the one map that may not be as good as the rest and the tedious design of water cannot be ignored."

PLEASE add an option to STOP UNNECESSARY WORKSHOP CONTENT DOWNLOADS, and an option to see the players' names on their back or chest, so to be able differentiate them from other humans without cosmetics.

The game downloads unnecessary workshop content in the background every time I browse online games/lobbies/servers. I have a decent connection for online gaming but these background downloads make it unplayable online."

8596,"I love this game. It puts your brain to the test while still having a silly artstyle. There are a lot of times where the game really makes you have to think outside the box and tests how smart you are. The level design is great. One of the best parts of the level design is when you get to a part that looks like you need to think outside the box, but it's actually very simple. Only complaint I have is the soundtrack, it could be better, but it's alright."

8745,"fun game with mates, would be a lot more fun if you were all drunk playing it as its a great laugh as it is."
8746,The whole free multiplayer with freinds ended which is a shame and shows the greed of the developers would not recomend solo and there is input lag in online play so. were no strangers to love you know the rules and so do i.
8747,!
8748,GAME GOOD
8749,Sometimes the online lags which can be annoying. Otherwise cool concept that got executed very well as a puzzle game that is made to be cheated. 10/10

8755,"HOLY MOLEY ON TOAST this is the best laugh and fun i've had in a hot minute. Did a remote play together just fine and had an absolute blast. The puzzles were witty and fun, but not too hard that you couldn't just take a step back and go like 'ohhh wait a minute...' and plug along the levels."
8756,"Little bean boys jump around, grab things awkwardly, and fall over. Complete many puzzles and test your knowledge of basic physics for seemingly no reason. Highly recommend playing with a friend, as it increases the laugh count by 6x and the fun factor by an amount"

8910,"It was a fucking zoo, rotting in spew
Caged, a bird, bruised black and blue
Cried “I gotta get out of this place”
I heard a voice “only one way”
It was Ben, it’d been years
Saved him from the three musketeers
Man I was happy to see his face
""I owe you one, I'll help you out of this maze""
“Approach the devil, with venomous grace
Tell him you’ll fuck with the human race
He may let you out, as a Ghost, a pawn
To scare the shit out of who you want
If you serve time, do despicable crimes
The devil might let you into heaven in time
Lines right there for you to plead, say a prayer
Get on your knees”"
8911,"Really really fun game to play with a couple of friends. Highly recommend this. Yes, the controls are a real pain in the *** but this makes it even more funny. I guess I've never laughed this much while playing any other game."

8935,If you think you'll like the movement in this game you'll probably love the game. It's all about solving semi-interesting puzzles using extremely janky movement mechanics. I loved it. Beware any workshop levels with Mandarin titles.

9089,"I played this game with my brother (we're both adults) and we spent 30 minutes trying to throw each other off the edge laughing hysterically.

I brought this game and a couple controllers over to a friend's party (pre-COVID) and everyone laughed hysterically as 20+ 21+ somethings tried to navigate the human fall flat world while (ever so slightly ;) inebriated. 

Probably 2 of my top 15 memories from the last 3 years are in this game. A game that costs $15. If you have the opportunity to play this with fun people you will not regret it. 

TLDR: 10/10 would play drunk again."

9091,its very goog
9092,"This game pissed me off, so I invited my friend over to play local Co-op.  He got pissed off too.  The physics are hilariously frustrating.   You'll find yourself swearing at the screen, yet playing for hours with some friends.  I bought this game because of the local Co-op, so buy it if you want to keep local Co-op a thing like me.  You ability to beat the levels is only determined by your creativity.  I'd value this game at twenty dollars, and please guys, keep local Co-op a thing."

9191,gud.
9192,"Really great game! It's a puzzle game, kinda like Portal but with ragdoll physics and- of course- no portals. The levels get harder and harder but I like that. Anyway I love this game and I hope you buy it too! Once I bought this I had no regrets!"
9193,"An amazing floppy physics puzzle game, where you can beat levels the unintended way or just fool around in the level with dumpsters or boats or anything else. You can play it with friends and get the challenging achievements. The only negative thing I have to say about this amazing game is that the physics are sometimes a little too floppy. Other than that, this game is amazing. Great job, Curve Digital."

It's one of those really fun casual games to just jump into and start playing every now and then. A good time passer, and definitely better with friends trying to toss you off cliffs. The original levels they added will always be my favorite (through aztec) - and are always worth a replay IMO. Worth the money and time."

9246,"It's fun platforming for the most part, however I have a small case of PTSD because of a certain map in this game..."
9247,KHELO
9248,"It is just laugh after laugh for a couple hours at a time.  Once you finish all the maps you might not go back to it for a while, but it is absolutely hilarious if played with a couple friends for a few hours.  Way more than a hollywood movie.  Definitely recommend."

9273,too much boring game for single player
9274,HGUYF
9275,Fun game with friends
9276,its a very fun puzzle game but i have found 2 major problems whoever hosts the lobby gets next to no lag runs like a dream unless the lobby is maxed which ill come back to in a second if your not hosting and theres more then just you and the host it has a very noticeable delay and if you have a maxed out lobby its unplayable normal player and host i have found a way around it which is if you want like 4 people to play in one lobby host included have 2 players own the game and they remote play with one player each it makes it waaayy better. and the second major problem which kinda isnt major i guess depending on what kind of person you are but the puzzles are quite easy its like a puzzle game that unless you don't have basic cognitive function you know exactly what to do the difficulty comes from the skill of actually doing it for example there is a level basically 100% just plugging wires into walls and powering stuff to open other stuff and to life something you need to grab with both left and right mouse button (which i recommend you play on keyboard and mouse its far far easier then controller) and then move the camera so your looking into the air (its the same way you can pull yourself up ledges but you look down instead) i found you cant really see what your doing some times but the ports you plug wires into has like a magnetism to the end of the wires so its not so bad at times but there is a few times its made simple tasks slightly tedious but its like only 10% of the time so i can look past it. conclusion game very fun and 100 times better with friends
9277,It's very nice and creative

9292,"Jump that gap; place this there; take that out; and puzzle done. Its great and one of the most fun games if played with a group of others. The amount of community maps and cool puzzles you can complete is epic and sometimes the physics in the game are hilarious. The game can be frustrating sometimes when trying to push/pull or place an object or if your friends ruin the puzzle. And I love this.
8/10"
9293,idk how many times I've raged in this game? it is pretty easy... but i think my year went through pretty fast because of this game... once you play with friends it is gonna get fun but very challenging :3

9304,"The one thing that made this game fun was the ability to play online. Yet trying to do so nowadays gives you a Unity error and closes the game with no way to actually report it.

It's a shame cause the game used to be fun, doesn't look like it stands the test of time anymore.

Until they can fix this I'm gonna have to leave a negative review in place for now."
9305,"New levels require you have two players just to play them. Pretty lame when every level up to that point could be done alone. Otherwise pretty good game

9362,"It's very fun, perfect for just fooling around with friends. It can be a bit rough at least with the controls but for what it's worth it is really good. The steam workshop levels that you can find add a lot of value to this game, the free updates are a major plus as well. I highly recommend this game if you want to just have some silly shenanigans with your buddies."
9363,As solo  this game is lame. Only if you have party 3+ this game become more intersting.  Some steam achivements you won't get no matter how you try. You should better delepos your game without bugs with getting achivement. And because of this attitude I won't recommend this game

9400,"Human Fall Flat is a very fun, positive, and adventurous game that is full of fun easter eggs and achievements! I would 100% recommend this to anyone!"
9401,This game is fun unless you have no friends.
9402,"After completing all achievements. The game's hilarious, fun, frustrating, and rewarding. Solid 7/10

-Cons-
- The core mechanic is grabbing with your hands, very frustrating when hands don't grab when they should. Very bad for climbing/parkour. This railroads players into doing puzzles. You can climb, but large swings make your hands not stick to surfaces when they should. This was incredibly frustrating. -1 from review.
- After 100% Achievements there's no replay value. The game can get boring, oh look another puzzle to open a door or unlock a tunnel.. If there was a race mode, vs mode, or some type of player competition it would maybe have replay value. Having only a main campaign and idle lobbies -2 from review

-Pros-
- Awesome Co-Op Game
- Hilarious with friends
- Nice Art style / Graphics
- Good Multiplayer connection
- Optimized well, it runs on my crap PC
- Great Value
- Free DLC Developers aren't greedy."

9417,"Human: Fall Flat is a very fun puzzle game with unique features and physics! The game really makes you think, and there is some challenge to be had with the parkour. It's very fun with friends. I recommend this to anyone who likes parkour, puzzles, and a bit of wackiness. There is much fun to be had in this game, it's a bit frustrating at first but once you get the hang of it, it's a blast!"

This game is just so much fun, especially with friends. The mechanics are wonky on purpose which makes it funnier, and the character customisations is also neat.

Also the fact that it has a steam workshop is a HUGE THING. You can find tons of models and maps in there so there is unlimited content for it.

9505,Fun game meet new people
9506,"The movie started with a very intense ""Batman"" like opening. This movie showed promise the first twenty minutes and even though nothing made sense, there was still hope that it would all be tied together and all make sense. Unfortunately, hope was lost quickly and the plot disappeared into a endless past-future alternate reality abyss and never came back. This movie lacked depth and seemed pretentious from Nolan. A truly intellectual ""flex"" that surely he had no idea what was going on either. If there was one good thing from Covid is- very few people have had to sit through this disaster of a movie.


It's better with friends though. 9/10 well worth the $6 I paid for it."
9507,I came in big roosters ass
9508,"nice game
"
9509,"The game Is outstanding, with a minimum of AMD Radeon HD 5570 graphics card, This can run on Windows XP and up. But the game crashes everytime I play multiplayer. Which Is a problem, If anybody could solve that It would be appreciated. But I recommend this game to EVERYONE!"

9535,"This is a general for Human Fall Flat. I have it on Nintendo Switch, Mobile, and Steam. The reason I have it on all these platform is because of how fun it is! This game offers about 5 hours of gameplay, but there is so much replay value. This game is amazing for multiplayer, and it also supports split screen multiplayer. All in all, this is a great game. 

Pros: 
-Splitscreen and Online multiplayer
-Lots of replay value
-Challenging Puzzles
-Active workshop content
Cons:
-No cross-platform multiplayer
-Lag can get very bad while playing online
-Controller lag occurs a lot in online mode (for example, you could press the button to raise your hand, and your hand would raise a second after)


Thank you to the devs for this great game. :>"
9536,"This is an amazing puzzle platformer, all of the levels are unique and fun to explore. Great by yourself, even better with friends."
9537,"awesome team based gameplay the puzzles are very enjoyable, the mechanics are simple and the level design is filled with variety you have many choices on how to traverse throughout the world."
9538,"Pros:
- The game is fun with friends
- A game for a few hours
- Updated game
Cons:
- If you play it alone, the game is too difficult
- Some bugs"

9544,Good Game I Have Some Good Memories With It But I Don't Like It To Much But i Think You Should Try It
9545,Loads of fun. Play with some friends and try to get the achievements when done with all the maps.
9546,C
9547,Lots of common sense and common knowledge
9548,"Graphics
Graphics are decent,but they dont really matter too much,your grandmas pc from 2001 could probably run this in low settings

Gameplay
haha funy white man go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,fun with friends,has A LOT of maps which is awesome,wacky physics and drunk baby controls

Replayability

Very replayable since there is alot of maps but it gets boring after some time

Price

Great price,if you really want it go for it now but you should wait for a sale,i bought it for 6 dollars on sale but its worth the 14dollars if you want it

Overall
Ok graphics,wacky gameplay,variety of maps
Overall it is a pretty wacky game you can play alone or with friends
if you want to buy it then go for it"

9585,"If you want first hand experience with this game, it's best to try it out with friends. Single player is really good but multiplayer is better considering not only it'll be quicker and easier in some cases, but also it makes the experience more engaging and ambitious. There's slight input lag but you most likely won't even notice it, other than that it's a really good game for what it is. I'm glad a lot of people are discovering this game for themselves more than ever."

This game need accurate timing to finish a job, so delay is deadly bad.

Add ping of lobby pls, so then at least players can choose a fast room."

9679,"There are too many “younger” people that bother the player the majority of the game. Every time I join a server, I ask them to say something just to make sure there are no bots. The physics feel like a new coder developed it and are very dizzy. The camera follows directly behind you, and that is pretty hard to control when it is a “platformer.” But you can find some cool people on it that are not an eight years old. Still, during the first 15 minutes of the game, I refunded it."

[b]Review[/b]:
Great entertainment value in co-operative mode [b]WITH FRIENDS[/b]!
Grouping with random people will lend random results.
As a single player experience it still has some merit, due to the puzzle elements, but it'll be significantly less funny.

At the time of writing this, I've seen three levels, loaded with interesting ideas. It's evident, though, that the level designers were rather going by dry technical placement of obstacles than creative playfulness. A witty playground with multiple creative options leading to the goal, would have been more rewarding than the mostly linear level progression I have seen so far. There were occasional alternative approaches, but they never seemed intentional. I'd call it a missed opportunity for greatness...but the game is still quite amazing...[u]and[/u]...I haven't seen every level, yet. 

The amount of gameplay elements is surprising (e.g. I didn't expect much interaction with water), but at the same time I cannot suppress disappointment by the lack of any AI entities. I hope the developers are working on a sequel that provides a more dynamic world to interact with. 
Something to reward exploration (and advanced climbing skills), like a loot system, would also be welcome."

9798,"I enjoyed playing it with my friends, and dragging them out of the void. This was funny. Also the levels, I am quite satisfied with. They can be very puzzling. How ever, I dislike there are so little of them. And some of them, like water, cannot be completed if you do something wrong. Like rowing in the boat, then falling into the water, and losing the boat. I loved this game for about 4 or 5 hours, then it started to lose its charm. But still, very well made. The wobbliness of your Character was fun. Learning how to climb was also very satisfying. I loved playing this co-op, but single player wasn't as fun."

Всю игру можно абсолютно [strike]объективно[/strike] субъективно оценить оказиями, которые с тобой скорее всего произойдут. 

[u]В этой игре, ты, практически точно:[/u]

Захочешь взападло сбросить братишку с обрыва
Будешь дико флексить с братишками
Случайно засунешь себе руку в ухо, а ногу - в задницу...
Побьешь в очередной раз рекорд Дарвина
Пролезешь там, где тебе пролезать не следовало
Выругаешься, потому что сраная рука не липнет
Заорешь от смеха, когда увидешь какую херню сотворил твой братишка
Поставишь какой-то угарный скин из мастерской


[u]В этой игре, ты, скорее всего, но не факт:[/u]

Застрянешь ну в какой-то просто диковинной заднице
Случайно заспидранишь
Будешь тупить, пока товарищи все сделают
Все сделаешь, пока товарищи тупят
Раскачиваясь залезешь куда-то как человек-паук
Охренеешь, получив ачивку
Охренеешь, не получив ачивку

[u]В этой игре, ты, маловероятно, но всё же:[/u]

Не сможешь омыслить как люди раскачиваясь залезают на колесо
Скатишься с горы на трех лыжах с двумя мужиками спиной вперед
Почувствуешь на себе метрический тензор и силу искривлённого пространства-времени

[u]И наконец, в этой игре, ты, совершенно точно не:[/u]

Захочешь выбить все ачивки.

9860,"Human: Fall Flat is a derpy game with a lot of character. It's funny, wonky, and great as hell with friends or strangers.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
If you like physics based games, please get it. It's a mix of platforming and puzzle solving. The price is fair, and it's a lot of fun.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]✔️ Positive[/b]
[b]🔵 Neutral[/b]
[b]❌ Negative[/b]

✔️ There are a bunch of levels to pick from. You get thrown into them, and you have to find the exit to proceed to the next one. Along the way there are obstacles for you to overcome by platforming or solving puzzles. You can walk around, jump, and there are 2 buttons that control your arms. You can raise them to grab platforms and climb up. You can move objects, push and pull, etc...
You can even complete maps in non-intended ways just for the hell of it. There are even vehicles you can drive.

✔️ You can customize you character with a lot of in-game skins. You can make pretty much whatever you can think of.

✔️ Steam workshop for even more skins and maps for you to play.

✔️ Co-Op with random people or with friends.

❌ Sometimes your character doesn't grab onto things. It's punishing especially during platforming. Thankfully the game has checkpoints, so you won't lose a lot of progress. 

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
The difficulty arises from the puzzles you have to solve and how fast your brain can process what you have to do.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The game uses a low poly aesthetic with flat colors. I personally enjoy it. It's nothing special, but it gets the job done. The game runs fine as well.

[h1]Length and Replay Value[/h1]
The game gets updated fairly regularly, so it's hard to give an exact timeframe. Early levels will probably not take you long to complete. Late levels can take upwards to 1 hour, since some of the puzzles are hard to solve at first sight. A lot of levels have secrets hiding around, and if you want to find them, you will have to work for it. Since workshop maps exist, replay value is fairly high. Achievements are also a thing.

[h1]Navigation and Level Design[/h1]
Early levels are fairly straighforward. They teach you the gameplay basics and how some mechanics work. Most puzzles usually have more than one way of being completed. Experimentation is key.

[h1]Sound and Music[/h1]
Sound design is probably the weakest part of the game. It works, and there is not that much to work with, but most sounds feel bland. Music is ambient and it's okay.

[h1]Story[/h1]
As far as I know, there is none. 

[h1]Problems[/h1]
⚠️ Because it is a physics based game, it's not rare to get stuck inside physics based objects. Ragdolls and model stretching are also fairly common.

[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]
If you just want to play something fun to pass the time, give this a try. It's not a serious game (unless you make it serious) and it's a great time all around. The price is fair in my opinion, especially since the game gets updated regularly with more levels."

9920,i pissed myself
9921,this game is really fun I love playing it with my friends but there is one problem with this game and you are playing by yourself and you want to do all the things you need to do on a level without using cheats and stuff then at one point it will be imposible for you to complete but if you want to keep going you will have to cheat to get to the next area. apart from that i think Human Fall Flat is a great game there is also another thing and that is the Power Plant level you can do lots of cheats like use the black pole that you spawn on as i bridge to get yourself across the big gap after the one where you first use wires

[b]Human: Fall Flat is my opinion one of best game to play with friends and relax. 
In this game you have to solve a lot of problems to continue.
I spend a lot of time in this game and I still like to play it.

➕[list] [*]You can run this game, even if you have low pc.
             [*]A lot of maps.
             [*]Arbitrary customization of the character.
➖

10024,"Honestly such a great game to play solo or with friends! I've had hours of fun figuring out the puzzles and having funny shenanigans with my friends by pushing them off cliffs and getting stuck in obstacles. Even though I finished the main game when there were about 5 or 6 levels (Aztec being the last) a while ago. Human Fall Flat still manages to come out with new and cool content. I've especially liked the snow and city levels, and loved the ability to use drones to somewhat fly.

I use a controller to play, and the controls are relatively easily to maneuver. I really like the mechanics of this game, and it's similar to Gang Beasts (But alot better!) if you've ever played that. Once you get familiar with grabbing and climbing it's easier to navigate around the different maps. The levels are a decent size and difficulty, it's always taken me and my friends a good hour or two to complete a level. The rag doll characters are quite funny in the way they move and you can customize your character. 

You can create your own levels in workshop, host private or public games, join games with other people if you don't want to complete levels solo and catapult your way to victory! Would defo recommend getting it, as it's always a game I keep coming back to every now and then."

10033,"The game is a platformer where you play a blob like character. The game can be very challenging if you play on your own, but it becomes a lot better if you play it with someone else. Once you are done with the official levels you can download a lot more from the workshop so there is fun to be had even after you beat all the levels. But the reason I can't recommend the game is because they silently dropped Linux support. If they would have explained why and deleted the depot so steam would download the proton version I would respect their decision."

10070,"Easily one of the most fun co-op games on steam. Game is fairly short and doesn't offer any replay value though. The workshop levels are SO BAD. Felt like they took 20mins to create and 30 seconds for me to figure out. If they were to ever add more maps as DLC i'd be very interested in purchasing them.

Not sure if it's a game I would play solo. Half the fun is making ruining the experience of your co-player. Pure salt mine of a game with how many ways you can screw over your fellow players. 10/10 would recommend. The more players you have the better!"

lag can make this game feel unplayable if you have a bad connection tho (if ur internet is bad u might have less fun playing online coop) 
the official maps are all really amazing, definitely worth the money based on that alone
also has a lot of community-made maps ranging from terrible to great
check out the workshop u can make urself look like lil peep

10101,"Love this game. its great fun and a nice wholesome game to play with friends. I can't even count the number of laughs I have had playing this game with my friends who live in another town. 

The game supports both keyboard and controller (I prefer using an Xbox controller for it) but allows for split screen, remote play together and if your friend owns the game you can just play normally together with each having their own screen. That said I have played it in both scenarios and while each player having their own copy works best, remote play together works just fine with me on my Xbox Controller and my friend using their keyboard

Over all very happy with this game"

Human: Fall Flat really makes you feel like Spiderman, the swinging elements feel a bit forced and the combat just really isnt on par with other games using the Spiderman branding. with all the praise ive given this game so far, i think its time to say some cons. Sex With Stalin really makes you feel like Spiderman, the swinging elements feel a bit forced and the combat just really isnt on par with other games using the Spiderman branding. ok, now its time to give my review score, i'd give it a modest 10/10 BABYYYYY the game really makes you FEEL like batman."

10177,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
10178,"there are games, and there are ''games''

and for sure, this is one of those ''games'' honestly this game never dissapointed me for having a good laugh, till i nearly killed myself of laughter, the graphics are as basic as it gets, but does not make it look hidious, the gameplay, simple platforming to the finnish, the controls are relatively easy, but hard to master, experiment with absolutely everything in the map, and get rewarded for breaking the rules, but where this game shines the most is the multiplayer, OH BOY

you can play with up to 8 players online and it is ecstatic to say the least, and very chaotic too...the others won't help you, at all!! you have a big chance of getting yeeted in the void

but overall i recommend it for 9/10 because of the fun"

10215,"I never expected to witness the event that changed humanity when I bought this game. It was a cold summer night filled with the aroma of the petunias lodged into the the ground, just like a celestial caretaker took the time to put them there, and paid attention to every detail. To say it was beautiful was an understatement. I was holding his hand, no matter how uncomfortable it seemed, it made me feel at home. Steve was always there for me, ever since I met him. Then it happened. When we were on a cosy alley right behind a high school full of hopes and dreams just like the air around us, a black, Nigerian naked meth addict came rushing towards me with a stick he found when he was searching for meth in a forest in rural Albania with his half blind cousin named Alfredo. I fell in a deep ditch and held on only to Steve. He was having trouble holding me and I felt sweat dripping from my moustache. His face, without any expression as always, looked at me, his eyes, more blue than ever. I was slipping away. I saw a little tear in his square eye. Then I fell. I fell on my back and broke my neck, hearing the meth addict shouting curses in latin to my husband. As I faded into eternity, the last thing I heared was Steve's soft voice, calmly telling me: ''It will be okay my Fuhrer. there are no Jews in heaven, only big booty hot ass bitches and a lot of coke to do of people's dicks. Now rest my sexy boy, for I shall continue your noble quest of genocide and wild gaming, you better believe it. ''

10295,super fun
10296,"Honestly not a good game. It seems like it would be fun somehow at first glance, but it absolutely isn't. The controls are intentionally infuriating, you have much much less control than Octodad and that game is waaay more fun. Like I can't imagine what type of person would even enjoy this game with the optimal number of teammates, all in voicechat and also having a good time, because otherwise you are better off watching paint dry for how exhilarating this game was."
10297,"Very fun to play with friends. There do needs to be a set of instructions though because some people do not understand what to do in each stage until I tell them about it. It's common sense, but not all people get it."
10298,
10299,"Really fun. Makes you feel accomplished when you can speedrun. Its fun as the glitches and exploits aren't too overpowered, but give a different aspect to the game

10301,"I typically am not a fan of puzzle games, but playing this was genuinely a breath of fresh air.
I loved the mechanics, the easter eggs, and the level design all the way through.
Difficult enough to be a challenge. Silly enough to stay entertaining.

The only issues I found were:
There's a lot of latency for whoever is not hosting the game. 
And, some achievements were a little buggy (granted, you're likely not going into this game strictly for achievements).

Honestly, a 10/10 from me, dog.
"
10302,"A very fun game to play with friends. Interesting puzzles and good to achievement hunt. The game runs fairly smoothly, though with a small amount hitching in multiplayer sometimes (alongside the occasional abysmal input lag from online play), some of the achievement detection does not function consistently either, particularly the more obscure ones.
I also really like the OST, very atmospheric and sound-design which sounds amazing on a good audio setup.
Would definitely recommend to friends for the incredibly expressive faceless dough people."
10303,"I fell on my face, and then i had every achievement in the game. Then i didn't, then i did, then i didn't."
10304,A brilliant game to play with friends - endless fun!

10315,"Human: Fall Flat, 
or as my brother and I call it; 

DRUNK BABY SIMULATOR

This game is simple yet wonderful. One of the funniest games I've ever played with friends. Since my original purchase the devs have continued to add fun content which is always a great sign when it comes to these indie games on Steam. Single-player is still a fun puzzle game but the true entertainment value is in the co-op play. 
You will not be disappointed."
10316,"this is a fun and ez game out some times in the game yea it is not
but out the start it is"
10317,i love it its fun
10318,"While at first I thought this was going to be a stupid & simple puzzle game, it turned out super enjoyable! I got quite a few laughs during my experience, at some parts laughing so hard whilst playing with a friend that we both had to take a break in order to get our breaths back."

10338,this game is fjcking halarious im dying def check out with your friends its super funny to mess around while still getting through the puzzles
10339,"Human Fall Flat is pretty solid, I'd say. It's got all the funny ragdoll physics, good level design that works with those physics, and features a game like this could ask for. The price is perfect, and although a friend gifted this too me thankfully, I'd say its worth the price. And it has a nice feature in that you can download and create your own skins for your character."

Anyways this is the perfect game if you have a friend next to you, and you're bored in class.

First minute trying to solve the map
Seconds later trying to drag each other over the edge."

The mechanics are really funny and the way the levels are created allow for some pretty hilarious mess-ups. This game is fun with online people, and even more fun with a lot of friends on a call or something.

I highly recommend this game!

My rating for this game: 9.3/10"
10396,Goofy game that is an absolute ball to play with your friends. The community levels are a bit meh and the game becomes considerably less fun when you finish with the stock levels but other than that its very fun.

Hello yes. This is a very fun game that uses physics in a creative and intuitive way. It can be very difficult, but only if you make it that way for yourself.

The gameplay isn't simple as it looks like. It's just another level. Great graphics, nice music and unpredictable gameplay. Better with friends but if you'll play alone, it's fine. Firstly I suggested this to my friend and we played together but now it's only me bc everyone already gave up Lmao. If you're looking for an ez game, I'd say you're on the wrong page but if you're looking for a patience test and a challenge, this is highly recommended.

10558,good
10559,u can throw your friends out of the map
10560,"This game is worth playing, especially if you have a couple friends to play with. I think the levels can be completed alone, but they're a lot simpler to solve with multiple people. Each puzzle (if it can be called that) has a solution, and many have multiple ways to be solved. The ""puzzles"" are sets of obstacles that require some clever and not-so-obvious solutions.

The Christmas lobby that they recently released has no business being as fun or expansive as it is. My friends and I spent an hour in that lobby after finishing a level, and the amount of screwing around you can do is mind-boggling for a lobby that is meant to be where you wait while your party gets situated. Incredible kudos to the devs for that.

One gripe is the Aztec level felt unsolvable. One method to solving puzzles can be to cheese it, by swinging a bit here and there, jumping and inching yourself, etc. By and large, my friends and I avoided this method, but the Aztec level has a few places where it seems the only solution is to cheese it. We spent 45 minutes on a single section until we admitted defeat and looked up some walkthroughs online. We were pissed when everything we read turned out to have to cheese it. It's also the only puzzle that we couldn't figure out how someone could solo it.

Apart from that, this is a great, atypical party game that actually requires some thinking. Its blobby physics are superficially similar to Gang Beasts, but after switching between the games during the same evening, you realize that they require a very different set of skills. More jelly problem-solving, and less jelly headbutting."

10587,"Fun, simple, and hilarious to play with friends. Bought on winter sale, and at 6 hrs I've definitely already gotten my money's worth and then some. And those stupid little jiggly bodies! :)"
10588,"So funny in co-op. The maps are creative and inventive, making gameplay highly varied. The only predefined goal for a HFF map is that the player must get to the exit. How you get there and what you'll encounter on the way could be anything. Solving all kinds of physics puzzles to get from A to B in HFF never feels tedious like other puzzle games do after a while. The one thing dragging it down is the intentionally derpy, sluggish movement that can get highly frustrating and even stressful at times.

I suspect the game uses Unity, because fullscreen isn't exclusive fullscreen, it's a borderless window which breaks g-sync. Yes you can temporarily enable windowed mode for g-sync in the nvidia drivers and disable it again after playing this game, but it's a pain, and windowed g-sync always microstutters. You can't avoid changing settings before playing even if you use v-sync with input lag as then you'll have to set the fixed refresh you want, and switch it back when you're done. It's a pain and I've pointed out this exact same technical flaw in several game reviews now. It's been going on for years too. Bring back exclusive fullscreen mode and make gaming great again. 

At least for this particular game, using v-sync isn't detrimental to the in-game experience because it's slow paced and casual, and easy on the GPU. Therefore it's easy to hit your v-sync cap all the time to keep it running smoothly, if your graphics card isn't a potato.

Devs, here's a hint: Vulkan has exclusive fullscreen that works flawlessly with g-sync."

"
10598,"Not the game for me. I wanted to try something new with my friends and this was no where as fun as the trailers they advertise. Anyone in your game has the ability to fly through levels and leave you stuck or not fully enjoying the puzzles as you'd like. Some times the moment is very dull, and you spend more time waiting on your team mates then actually playing the game."

I recommend getting this game on steam instead on xbox game pass for PC because if you play this game on game pass for pc there is no support for community made maps, lobbies and skins, without those things (especially the maps) this game is not that fun after a while."

10650,"The developers do not seem to have tested how well this game works in the single player mode, as some puzzles are almost impossible without the aid of other people. This is compounded by the game's janky controls. I understand that they wanted for characters to move in a wacky fashion, but this works too well. The movement actively gets in the way of completing objectives. There are many things this game does right, but it's just not worth getting."

That being said, I played with friends who just wanted to kill each other during the game...

Also it should be noted that the game really is designed for single player play, a lot of the puzzles are easily cheesed if you have more players, so if you want to enjoy the challenge, play it on your own before inviting others to the [arty."

10733,"Could only play it for ~40 min before becoming intensely motion sick. The camera is tied to the wobbly physics based animation of the character which means the camera is always moving randomly and beyond your control.
There is a smoothing setting, but it doesn’t really address the core issue and did nothing for me.

Buyer beware; especially if you have a history of motion sickness."

10854,"I enjoyed playing with my partner, messing around with ragdoll physics and puzzles, but the fun does end a little sooner than I'd like. 14 hours is not bad for a game, it just felt like this one could've had one more map, maybe."

10909,very cheesy.....
10910,a great game for rui- making friendships
10911,"Human: Fall Flat is definitely a game that can be recommended to everyone. Pretty nice music, well-designed levels that you can both finish alone or with your friends on both local and online cooperative mode. Unfortunately game is pretty short, but that shouldn't be a problem, because developers enrich the game content with updates and new levels, so the game is getting more and more content which makes it longer to play. The Steam workshop and community of this game is pretty good as well, so if you will finish the game, you can always download some new levels from there. 
I would highly recommend that game to you and your friends, it's one of the most fun cooperative games for sure!"
10912,Fall guys the funny
10913,pretty good game for chilling with friends

10983,"Such a fun game. It could be fun by yourself, but it is on a whole other level with friends. The custom maps that people make are awesome and some of the puzzles are legitimately difficult, but so satisfying to solve. It's just really relaxing to play with some good music and good friends"

11006,"Is it fun to play? definetely, if you fancy solving puzzle with your friends
Is it repetitive? sometimes, but hey what can you expect from that price
Is it confusing? I mean, this is a PUZZLE game
IS it worth it? For me, yes.

8/10"
11007,More games need to be made with over 4 players in mind. It’s great and fun and the story under the surface is surprisingly deep in a very soulslike way.
11008,This game lets you know how toxic your friends can get.
11009,much fun would play again
11010,Fun to play with friends and there's endless content after the main levels if you look on the Steam Workshop
11011,Fun to do with friends or if you just want to play something casually
11012,There is drones. yes sir.

11017,p
11018,"Really fun game to play with friends.. It's so stupidly funny to go through the maps with a wobbly character, I legit cried while laughing a bunch of times while pleying this

Levels are fun and challenging. At this time, there are 15 levels + 4 extras, but you can get more in the workshop

Definitely worth the price"
11019,Had too much fun
11020,"If you enjoy solving physics-based puzzles at a first-grade level of complexity so you can feel like you're clever for a moment, this game will scratch that itch. The controls are unusual, but they make more sense once you figure them out.

Beware all who get motion-sickness from videogames. This game will wreck your stomach in 5-10 minutes the first few times you play, and send you to bed with an intense headache and soreness in your elbows. It took me about ten hours of playtime (in very small doses) to adjust, but the game is a lot of fun, it's worth the suffering."
11021,"Aight
"
11022,fun game...
11023,"This game is weird. 
More accurately: The controls are weird.
And that's the charm of it. The little guy you move around can barely walk. You control each one of his arms separately and try to hold on to things. The camera movement (i.e. what he looks at) is also really important. 
Frankly, this game is probably a lot more entertaining if you just watch someone else struggle with the controls. Luckily, remote play is an option. I can recommend it, as I find the concept and aesthetics pleasing. There are few moments of frustration and the multiplayer option is definitely where it shines."
11024,good game
11025,"Good game, definitely something to do when you're bored."
11026,ahhhhhhhhh
11027,"ummm its fun
"
11028,violate people
11029,"It's so much fun! My sister and I started playing because Overwatch on Blizzard was becoming more of"" been there, done that"" sort of scene. The first night we played, we laughed so hard from how wobbly our bodies were and getting the hang of walking. What's even better is that there are MORE levels available and all you gotta do is subscribe to it to play. I'd pick Human: Fall Flat over Overwatch any day! :) Awesome game!"
11030,u get to beat ppl up lmfao
11031,play the fun ass game
11032,I laughed so hard playing this game it was a blast. The way the characters move and flop around is hilarious! I laughed so hard I started to cry. Warning: the doors like to grab people mostly the arms or heads (Its funny when it happens) I strongly recommend this game if you want to have a fun time. This was the best use of 15 dollars.
11033,A ton of fun.

11055,I would recommend this game for all players... it doesn't take much graphics to run. there are alot of great costomisaton and levels for you to play in game and you get get new levels from the workshop with more if not the same level of quality as the ones in game. and the ragdolls are amazing.
11056,"  juego culiao malo
"
11057,"The idea of the game is great and I had high hopes. The clumsiness of the players is supposed to be funny, but it ends up being very frustrating. Doing something simple like walking in a straight line is nearly impossible and most of the game is struggling to do basic things, rather than trying to solve the actual puzzles."

11107,This game is for casual and chill.
11108,Better when you play with friends. We even play hide and seek and it was really fun. It always makes me laugh when you can grab and drag someone around. I think it will be even more fun if you play with more than 2 players.
11109,white people cooler than black and game  is full of white people

11117,"Fun little game with friends, kills some hours of endless laughter"
11118,"I recommend getting this game.
Human Fall Flat has features like:
Making an avatar, painting it how you like on certain parts of the outfit.
Playing the levels with people from where-ever,
Jumping off into the void because you want to quit the level. (Never will work, just press Esc or the start button for controllers.)
- 
Anyways, its fun, you can flop around and complete levels and you have complete control where your hands & legs are at all times.
-
Levels: Mainly should be done on Multiplayer, 
Levels like Carry, Mansion, Train or mountain seem possible and are without the help of another person.
Other levels like Boat, Dark, (Blah blah blah, the rest of the levels.) Are harder and should probably be completed with friends, for the golf level, its your opinion if you want to play with yourself or friends, as I recommend playing most the levels with others.
-
Why you think its impossible to enter a public game that somebody else started:
Simple answer, Relates to me in my game.
Its not impossible, and no they didn't just lock it. (I mean they may have...)
But simply, It's because your not pressing enter. 💭💭 why is that? No clue.
-
Why should you play this game?
Because I wrote this review telling you about all the cool features (I mean, why not try it, its so cool!)

Thanks for reading my review!"

11132,Puzzle game for masochists in that it allows you to make your life as hard as possible since it let's you complete levels in the painstaking unintentional ways.

11134,<3 it!!!
11135,yes

11137,"Good game, very nice coop."
11138,Epic.
11139,"Not a bad game, just easily to get bored of"
11140,Most fun I've had with friends for a very long time..
11141,Game is fun to mess around with with friends. Glad the developers are still putting some love into this game. It is always cool to come back and see that they added something new to the game. Workshop maps and skins make the game even better than it is on it's own. Highly suggest for co-op play with friends 2 or more.
11142,"I want to be able to recommend this game - I really do. But I can't. The concept of it is incredibly fun: physics-based hijinks with friends and complete strangers, using absurdly customizable play-doh people to solve puzzles and traverse obstacles. And when it works as it should, it's great. But the problem is that it hardly ever does, at least in multiplayer. There is a single-player mode where you can go through all of the levels, but it's incredibly lacklustre with no cooperation, as the game clearly intends. So going to multiplayer....the servers are complete and utter garbage. I can count multiple instances where I've thought to myself, ""I'd like to play a game of HFF right now,"" but then don't because I know that navigating the servers is going to be a complete nightmare. I have, quite literally, sat in the lobby, trying different games and exiting them almost immediately because of the horrendous lag, for 30 minutes at a time. My current playtime is six hours - I'd say about a third of that is trying to find a decent server. When you can find a game that doesn't have too much lag and fun players, it's a GREAT experience. It's just that those experiences are incredibly hard to find. If the serves are ever improved, I would genuinely be more than happy to come back to this game. As it stands right now, though...I spent about $5 on this game. In its current state, I wouldn't go a penny higher."
11143,It's A Really Fun And Hilarious Game To Play If You Like Games Such As Gang Beasts You Will Definitely Like This
11144,"Play it with friends. If you don't have friends, it is worth getting some only to play this game."

11185,"With my experience on both PC and Xbox, I can say that HFF is a very fun game. The sandbox mechanics can make for some fun, and the level design can be exploited easily. Its much more enjoyable with friends, but you can still have fun on your own."

11188,its really fun and a cool game to make friends! a lot of the time when my siblings are annoying me i play this and it makes me so much happier because the way they walk its kinda like waddling and its really funny.id really recommend it  because its really fun and all of the levels are great.

11220,"Throw away any thoughts of ragdoll games being cheap, low effort and basic. This game is far from it.

The game requires a good level of skill in control (though even for people new to controls like this it's fairly easy to pick up). Not only is skill required, but also thought. There are likely multiple ways to complete a lot of the levels and even with the clearest option a good level of planning and thought is required. Despite this, the game is great at identifying when you may need a hint, yet hints aren't forced upon you. It's up to you whether you (literally) pick them up.

The game has great attention to detail, with even interactions such as hitting glass causing it to break, despite not being necessary in the slightest. Everything that you would think can be interacted with can be. (And don't forget the side adventures such as the cave on the mountain level - it's not needed but it's a good screenshot opportunity and can get you an achievements depending on what you do in the cave).

And finally, the soundtrack and narration. It is beautiful. That's all that needs to be said about that.

In conclusion, this is a very well-made game and very impressive for the money. As a bonus it even runs well on my basic spec laptop (and according to the developers even Windows XP...). 10/10 buy this game. You won't regret it."
11221,"It's a great game. At first the only problem I had was frames, but that's not the games fault. ""Human Fall Flat"" is great to play with friends, as well with family. It's very funny and I think just about anyone who plays it will enjoy it. There are a select few levels, but if those get boring you can always go to the community workshop. From there you can install new levels that other people make. Hope everyone has a great time playing"
11222,it is really fun even with 1 friend. and the music is really taking you to places...

11229,"Nothing short of absolutely hilarious. It's one of the most simple ideas - but brilliantly executed games I've played; which just goes to show that graphics and story lines aren't everything to make a really good game. It's a game full of character. I have no problem replaying this over and over and still enjoy it as much as i did on first play and finding new creative ways to complete the objective (and of course more bone crunching landings when spawning- never gets old!). Keep up the excellent work and continue releasing new levels please..... to the end of time preferably!. And for the record, I wouldn't hesitate to buy any DLC or sequel in the future!."

11257,"If you want to play a remarkably clever game that tries to hide just how clever it is then this is your game.

Bigger than that, if you want to play a game with your friends and you all have a great sense of humour, this game will have you all rolling around laughing continuously.  If drink is involved, there will be points where you have to stop playing for a moment because you're all laughing so much and have become useless.

Add the Steam Workshop into the equation (first time in over a decade I've been enthused to look at the Workshop) there's loads there to add levels to the game and make your characters even funnier.

There is not another casual co-op game that is as fun as this.  I can't ever imagine that there will be."

I would recommend playing this with friends rather than to play it by yourself because it gets boring easily when you play alone.

11341,"First few hours were full of giggles at the funny movement of the models. I really enjoyed learning how to play and the game offers multiple ways to solve each level, as well as little things here and there to explore. I like the soundtrack, but sometimes it cuts out while playing. Play with your friends for more fun :D
Add-on Edit: At times my friends complained about the jumping mechanic (pressing SPACE BAR) not working when they press it causing some frustration, but overall the whole game has been enjoyable. Don't forget to try the other levels under 'extra dreams'."

11357,amazing game
11358,really fun puzzle game that both my sons seem to love.
11359,seriously the most fun i had in a video game in a long long time. (goes double if you play with friends- you will not stop laughing)
11360,"Early on, I got a kick out of the drunken movements of the characters.  It added a little difficulty to the game and was funny to watch, especially with friends.  However, later, it's clear that the game is more about making intentionally crap controls than making good puzzles.  Solving the puzzle is the fun part for me... So what I DON'T want after I know what I need to do is struggle for 30 minutes to do it.  Great example is if you stop walking, and just want to spin your character and camera around, your character will walk in the last direction you had been traveling, and frequently causing you to mess up.  You can walk in a straight line doing nothing more than spin the camera.  Intentional design to mess with you... Or, my guy drops stuff, for no reason, at a critical point, and I have to start a task over again."

They introduced work shop support and  have been dropping new levels for free for awhile now. I couldnt recommend this game more as long as you have atleast 1 friend to play with."

11405,Grab yourself a friend and play this game. It may not keep your attention for hundreds of hours but its still worth it. The game features a lot of physics based puzzles with the greatest challenge being the controll of the character. All puzzles have clearly intended solutions but also hacky and borderline buggy workarounds (which isnt a bad thing but rather keeps you from getting hardstuck and having to look up solutions). There is also workshop support with user made levels which always is a great thing.

11423,"I would consider giving this a good review, but due to buggy achievements and frustrating game mechanics, that are driven by unpredictability of the physics engine, I cannot recommend this. It's fun coop (everything's fun with friends though),  but for people that are going for game completion , this is very unrewarding experience, where you have to rely on lady luck so your hands would twist the right way."

11529,"One of the best co-op games I've played! Fun with friends and solo! Each stage can be done with your own pace, you can even skip some of the parts with your own creative ways! Tired with some of the levels? Play other stages created by other people in the workshop! Tired of playing alone? Go online and play with randoms! Join at the official discord and make friends with other people!"

11541,good for trolling with your friends.
11542,"This is a great game to play with a few friends. You get to ragdoll around and be silly, working together to solve puzzles. Great for two players, and still fun with three, but there's not always unique tasks needing to be done in parallel (which isn't a bad thing, it actually allows for more freedom, just don't expect everyone to be helpful 100% of the time with more players). Can't speak to the single player experience, but I imagine it would be rather more difficult. The new levels every now and then keep things interesting. 10/10, would fly through the air again. :)"

A super gorgeous game, absolutely funny to play with friends, great levels and a unique game play style. It’s super cool that there are still coming new levels and achievements for the game from time to time. Some levels are hard to master but in the end awesome. I had a great time with this game and my friends. I can only recommend it.

11653,"[h1]Quite challenging but a lot of fun[/h1]
This game is really challenging when you first try on it. You need to get familiar with the operations and control the guy. And the thing I never succeed is climbing the wall (so difficult after trying hundreds of time. QAQ)  

Besides, it’s great fun to play with friends online. I still remember someone kicking my ass and then falling off the cliff (so annoying errrrrr...but still funny ha ha).

Overall, I [b]highly recommend[/b] this game."

11680,Play with your bae. Super Fun and lovely
11681,"Honestly, it was down to this game and the monster prom games as to whether I'd give it labor of love. But you can only choose one and Monster Prom 2 has the story rich down. Human Fall Flat is a game that I lovingly played with one of my best friends and after we figured out how to climb, it was one of the best games I ever played. It's a game that was designed so that you could beat every level with only one person. However it's more fun and better with friends(but steam won't let me give it that award). It's also one of the few games with local and online coop. Over time they have added some new levels as well as small labors of love like all the tutorial controls on the right side of the pause screen. It's the small things as well as the big that make this my pick for labor of love. Also the levels where it's not about beating a level but having fun with friends on an endless level is cool too."
11682,Still my favourite game to this day!

This game checks a lot of boxes so if you want to have some laughs and chill while playing give it a try. 
It´s one of the very few games that I´ve bought on various platforms, that says something. 
So if you´re looking for a new hidden gem among the vast ocean of games offered on steam you might be surprised.
Hope you all have fun with this game! Games are fun no matter what platform you´re playing on so keep playing.

It's very simple at first, but it continues to give you new tools to play with and is completely chaotic in the most chaotic way with friends. It really had to be played with friends, and when the game really shines. This game is the ultimate example of the phrase not to judge a book by its cover.
It doesn't look like much, but this game offers so much with its extraordinary gameplay that it's hard to explain how much fun it is. It is one of the very rare games that makes me cry from laughing."

11846,"No other game has kept me wheezing on the floor for such a long period of time due to the sheer comical value of its physics engine alone.  Speedrun it with a couple of good friends and you'll be entertained for hours.  By the end, you'll either have realized that the real human fall flat was the constant stream of cacophonous laughter that you'll experience as a result of playing it, or you'll never want to speak to your so-called ""friends"" ever again.

TLDR; If your game is THIS broken, just call it a mechanic and reap the profits."

11861,"I met a friend in this game and all I really want to do is play it with them. I extremely recommend this game if you are a fan of silly physics and platforming. Not only that, but there's community levels and brings a Roblox-like aspect to the game. Go ahead and buy this game when you can as I'm sure you will have hours of fun with it."
11862,hurts my abs
11863,"Wow, the amount of fun I've had with my friends is incredible, and the fact it is still receiving updates is amazing!

11872,"Every time I play this game I can't stop laughing. It gives me so much fun! The movement of the characters is just so funny to look at. And the levels are not too hard, so even someone like me; who has been living on the last living brain cell, is able to finish the levels and even get some achievements while playing. 

A fun, family friendly game where you can throw your friends off the maps. 10/10"
11873,good
11874,maybe yes
11875,"If you love crazy ragdoll physics and playing with friends, this is the game."
11876,"excelent game, with a bunch of replay value, great with friends, the maps are excelent and the game keeps having really good updates"
11877,"This game is sort of stressful BUT other than that, if you allow mods / new skins its so cool! No joke you should play it B) I also think its easier on PC"
11878,It was fun hehe bonk!
11879,"It's silly, stupid and fun. You look goofy and it's hilarious.
Worth it with friends!"

11886,"Just go for it, you won't regret, you can play as Riccardo Milos - what are you waiting for?"
11887,"one of my friends is a bitch in this game, but good game overall"
11888,"It honestly is a really funny game, but its better to play it with someone else and not alone. You can in Steam workshop even subscribe to more skins and levels. 
I just can recommend it. Its funny and lovely. You can have so much fun ~ Just lean back, relax and don't take the game to serious ~"
11889,can be ruin your friendships :d
11890,I died of laughing
11891,"Very fun puzzle game. Plays well with friends, but you can get away with not doing a lot of stuff if you play with friends. Still plays very well, and I would always suggest playing it with a couple buddies, but from my understanding none of the levels are designed for more than 1 person in mind. Has a workshop that keeps the game alive and adds many hours to the game. Nothing but fun :)"

Then, on your way home, stumbling, someone says ""its time to do a puzzle platformer!"" Thats this game. Its great, it funny, its challenging... 

BUT. 

If, you're like me, and you get motion sick easily, you cannot play this game. I tried. I really, really tried. I literally JUST pulled my head out the toilet because I made the mistake of eating a snack just before this game. Your character and POV bobs and sways SO MUCH that I threw up due to trying to power through what is otherwise an awesome game. I wish I could play it. But its not worth puking."
11931,this game includes fun puzzles for singleplayer gameplay or multiplayer gameplay. they release new levels every half-year-ish and most levels have mulltiple endings + secrets so you can play through them a few times over.

If you have friends that own the game then the game is actually enjoyable and fun. So my finale statement is don't get this game to play solo or with random people because you will regret it a bunch."

Human: Fall Flat is a wonderfully wonky physics-platformer puzzler with blob-like characters and amazing mechanics. It's very fun to play by yourself or with friends. Gets frequent updates, so new content is added and the player-base doesn't get bored. The worlds are also very big, and you can play with a single thing for half an hour without getting bored. Reccomended."

11996,Fun game with friends
11997,"This is an entertaining puzzle game with an excellent variety of puzzles and challenges and it's a lot of fun to play around with various elements in the different levels and just goof off. It's got a fantastic visual style and unique environments to play through, many really interesting and exciting mechanics and puzzles, and it runs very well, with no major bugs or performance issues encountered. Additionally, the game has great replayability with many shortcuts to be found, unique achievements to be collected, and workshop support with many neat levels to try out. The developers are also frequently running workshop level contests where the winner gets a cash prize and their level is added to the game in a free update, which is awesome, because the developer, the workshop level creator, and the players all win.

The only caveat of this game is that the controls can be a little bit difficult to learn and use, which gives it a pretty high difficulty curve. Some of the puzzles are fairly challenging, and almost everyone I played this game with struggled through at least some of the puzzles, occasionally getting quite frustrated. Despite this, our experience with the game has been almost entirely positive, so I'd still highly recommend picking up this game, especially if you've got friends you can play it with."

What I like about this game is that there are tasks that you need to do (instead of wandering around as to completing tasks are not important) and that there’s no limited time frame for you to complete your task. As for some other games that I tried before which is very similar to this, their controls are rather sensitive which made the game less enjoyable. So, overall I’d say this is a pretty impressive game to play with, especially with a bunch of friends."

12046,"Hilarious game.  I was playing with my 7 year old, and even though it was a bit too complicated for her, the game is very forgiving.  If I progress further, she could just fall and respawn in the next area without having to do some of the puzzles or platforming herself (the coordination to do a platform + jump + climb is a bit too much for her tiny hands on the Xbox 360 controllers we use).  I know I'm only 2 hours in at the time of writing, but I just wanted to give kudos to No Brakes for such a unique experience!

Human Fall Flat is a puzzle adventure developed by No Brakes Games.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

You play Bob, the main character in Human: Fall Flat. Bob is a completely white person by default, but you can design it yourself. You can change his headgear, clothing and the colors of each. Whenever you fall down in the level, you fall from the sky back to the last checkpoint. Hence the name of the game ""Human: Fall Flat"" and the whole thing runs completely without a loading screen.

As an example, you have control of your two arms. With ZR you raise your right arm, with ZL your left. Whether you raise your arm down, in the middle or up, it depends on the direction in which you are looking with the camera. For example, if you want to pick up a stick, you have to look down with the camera and grab it with one or two arms. Should you stretch your two arms up, run towards a ledge and jump with the A key, then Bob will climb it. You can also play dead with the X button, but that doesn't do much good. It should be noted that the controls feel as if the character had drunk a few beers too many the night before. This gives the game a little more difficulty and the movements feel like no other game. It can rarely be frustrating, but on the whole it's a nice addition. Several tutorials teach you new functions. The skills are even taught with English language output and German subtitles.

Because the game has a physics engine, many different puzzles can be found. In a puzzle you first have to climb up a castle wall, use it to get to the other side of a wall and then open a door in the wall. This allows you to push a wagon through which you can then climb and jump onto the roof of a house to advance in the level. I was also able to find different solutions. They don't differ too much, but it's nice that the physics and developers allow multiple solutions. The puzzles are based on different areas. For example there is a castle, an ancient temple and a villa. As a result, the game contains a lot of variety and does not get stuck on one topic. Because the worlds have different themes, the puzzles are also adapted to these. For example, in the castle level there is a catapult that you have to shoot with. The length of the levels is different. You can do the first in a few minutes, while I spent a good hour on the last level. The game offers you a total playing time of 3 to 5 hours.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ charming mix of physics puzzles and area exploration
+ deliberately slow control of the main character in certain areas
+ largely convincing physics
+ well thought-out control concept
+ Achievements and trading cards

[h1] Contra [/h1]

- Variation in motor puzzles is quickly exhausted
- sometimes annoying clipping problems

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Human Fall Flat has become a personable, physics-based puzzler who gets the most out of entertainment.


[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]

Human Fall Flat ist ein Puzzle-Abenteuer, welches von No Brakes Games entwickelt wurde. 

[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]

Ihr spielt Bob, der Hauptcharakter von Human: Fall Flat. Bob ist standardmäßig ein komplett weißer Mensch, den ihr aber selber gestalten könnt. Ihr könnt seine Kopfbedeckung, die Kleidung und jeweils die Farben davon ändern. Immer, wenn ihr im Level herunterfallt, dann fallt ihr vom Himmel zurück zum letzten Checkpoint. Daher kommt wohl der Name vom Spiel ""Human: Fall Flat"" und das Ganze läuft komplett ohne Ladebildschirm ab.

Ihr habt als Beispiel die Kontrolle über eure beiden Arme. Mit ZR hebt ihr euren rechten Arm, mit ZL den linken. Ob ihr den Arm nach unten, mittig oder nach oben hebt, das hängt davon ab, in welche Richtung ihr mit der Kamera schaut. Wenn ihr zum Beispiel einen Stock aufheben wollt, dann müsst ihr mit der Kamera nach unten gucken und mit einem oder zwei Armen zugreifen. Solltet ihr eure beiden Arme nach oben strecken, auf einen Vorsprung zulaufen und mit der A-Taste springen, dann klettert Bob diesen hoch. Außerdem könnt ihr euch mit der X-Taste totstellen, was aber nicht viel bringt. Angemerkt sei, dass die Steuerung sich so anfühlt, als hätte der Charakter paar Bier zu viel am Vorabend getrunken. Dies verleiht dem Spiel etwas mehr Schwierigkeit und die Bewegungen fühlen sich so an, wie in keinem anderen Spiel. Es kann selten frustrieren, aber im Großen und Ganzen ist es eine schöne Bereicherung. Mehrere Tutorials bringen euch neue Funktionen bei. Dabei werden die Fähigkeiten sogar mit einer englischen Sprachausgabe und deutschen Untertiteln beigebracht.

Dadurch, dass das Spiel eine Physikengine bietet, lassen sich viele verschiedene Rätsel auffinden. So müsst ihr in einem Rätsel zuerst auf eine Burgmauer hochklettern, über diese auf die andere Seite einer Wand gelangen und dann eine Türe in der Wand öffnen. Dadurch könnt ihr einen Wagen durchschieben, auf den ihr anschließend klettern und auf ein Hausdach springen könnt, um im Level weiter zu kommen. Auch konnte ich verschiedene Lösungswege feststellen. Sie unterscheiden sich zwar nicht allzu stark, aber es ist nett, dass die Physik und die Entwickler mehrere Lösungen zulassen. Die Rätsel sind dabei an verschiedenen Gegenden angelehnt. Es gibt zum Beispiel eine Burg, einen antiken Tempel und eine Villa. Dadurch enthält das Spiel viel Abwechslung und bleibt nicht an einer Thematik hängen. Weil die Welten unterschiedliche Thematiken besitzen, sind die Rätsel auch an diese angepasst. So gibt es beispielsweise im Burg-Level ein Katapult, mit dem man schießen muss. Die Länge der Level ist dabei unterschiedlich. Das erste schafft man in wenigen Minuten, während ich im letzten Level eine gute Stunde dran saß. Das Spiel bietet dir insgesamt eine Spielzeit von 3 bis 5 Stunden.

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ charmante Mischung aus Physikrätseln und Gebietserkundung
+ bewusst träge Steuerung der Hauptfigur in bestimmten Bereichen
+ weitgehend überzeugende Physik
+ durchdachtes Steuerungskonzept
+ Errungenschaften und Trading Cards

[h1] Kontra [/h1]

- Variation bei motorischen Rätseln ist schnell erschöpft
- mitunter störende Clipping- Probleme

[h1] Fazit [/h1]

Human Fall Flat ist ein Sympathischer physikbasierter Puzzler geworden, welcher das Maximum an Unterhaltung herausholt."

12082,"This game is AMAZING! Every few months they put out a new map, and I've put in easily 50hr+ on this game on my Nintendo Switch. When I saw it was on sale on steam and also had released a new map I decided to show my appreciation by buying on Steam as well.

Each map is very well thought out and includes very well thought out puzzles and challenges. We had a lot of fun going through each map, and they are LONG maps. Granted, the first 15 minutes or so is just throwing your friends off the cliff and laughing till your sides hurt.

The game does hit some weir physics/graphics glitches, for instance, wires getting stuck in objects if you drive a cart over a wire or on a few occasions our characters got stuck. While these are slight annoyances, it doesn't take away from the game as a whole and I'm always excited to see a new map.

To the developer, I absolutely would be willing to PAY for additional map packs. It just makes it all that much more awesome that you're including so many for free."

12085,Fun. Good to play with friends. Need to use brain. You`ll have lots of laughs
12086,"I honestly want to give this game a neutral rating if possible. The game itself is fun and hilarious. Coop is also fun and hilarious. The amount of user created maps on steam's workshop alone gives the game huge replayability. 

But there are a few major problems. The first being server stability. I know for a fact that my internet connection of ~200Mbps download/40Mbps upload speeds shouldn't cause lag for me or other players. However, every single game I host results in lag for other players. This seriously pisses me off because I always test my connection and speed right after with no issues. Which obviously means there's something wrong with the servers itself. The second problem are the 8 year old trolls who automatically kick you upon joining their public games. This wouldn't be so bad if there were more people playing but there aren't. Steamdb always says there are thousands of players online but everytime I go online, I count less than 30 open rooms, with an average of 2 person per room. The third is forced workshop content downloads. When you scroll through the list of open rooms in the lobby, if you come across a room using workshop content, the game will FORCE you to download it. You can't stop/pause/cancel the download either, so be prepared to use up a lot of hard disk space if you want to play online. And finally, the fourth problem is the game uses up a shit ton of resources if you let it run in the background. All you have to do is pull up your task manager while the game is running and you'll see it eating up 100% of your GPU.

So while the game is fun, and you might enjoy it the few times you can truly experience coop, I can't fully recommend it. Especially when they ignore such glaring issues and seem to have abandoned game development."

12146,"Human Fall Flat has a special place in my heart. They've added map after map after map all for free, no paid dlc unless you want to support the devs and buy the soundtrack. 

I love this game very very much. The customization allows you to be incredibly creative, I've seen really cool skins and I've seen horrendous, disgusting skins with folds of fat and grease. 

There's a lack of invisible walls, allowing you to just skip every puzzle in every level, and it's definitely intentional because its really easy in most cases. 

Thank you for making a really fun game and thank you for continuing to support it. :)"

12181,"Cool game. It's especially fun if you play it with other people. I wouldn't say that it's a game in which you'll spend hundreds of hours, as it might get a bit dull, however I think that the time you do end up spending, will be high quality. One of the best things I've found about this game is that there's not just one way to go to the next level, rather you're able to think of your own solutions, no matter how absurd they are. I really recommend it to those people who will be playing it with others, however if you're going to be playing it alone, it can be pretty fun as well."

12186,"I usually used to finish most of the games I start in one-sitting or within the same month-or-two. But when I started this game in October 2019, after I came back from Kerala (where I had bought it on Humble and activated the key via mobile), I played a few levels, and then stopped after I got stuck. I never touched it again until February 2020, where again I played 1 more level and uninstalled it. I hadn't yet tried the multiplayer mode, so in May 2020, I installed it again to try multiplayer since my internet was finally good again, and I was surprised to find out that online levels were the same as single-player and this game is much more fun with friends messing around and not to be taken seriously or beat the entire thing on single player.

So I hopped on a pre-existing online lobby and they were playing a level which I was stuck in (Castle), and I realized it was designed in such a way that you could either do it alone with some extra steps (to still support single-player only players), or you could have 2-3 people helping to accomplish a common task, [i](in this case it was the stone-platform lever/lift that was powered by another person rotating a giant hamster wheel in the Castle map)[/i].

In some phases you did better than your friends and in other phases, they might perform better, so it instills a sense of competitiveness as well to one-up each other on solving the next puzzle/obstacle faster.

But playing with random people online in my region who didn't communicate with me because they've already played and mastered the level, wasn't much fun, so I moved to single-player again to try to finish the 'Water' map, which I failed, so once again I uninstalled it.

Then on July 2020, I was on a achievement hunting expedition, to try to get 100% achievement completion rate on as many games as possible, so after finishing some games I bought from the Summer 2020 sale, I came back to Human: Fall Flat once again, and with the help of some video-guides, I ran the game for 1 week and got all the achievements (including playing the game from start to finish all over again in one sitting). While doing that, I realized that most obstacles can be avoided so easily [b]by climbing any surface by swinging from left to right while sticking one arm at a time to scale upwards by an inch.[/b] And you can keep doing that indefinitely to climb as high as you want (much like the climbing in Breath of the Wild, but without any stamina restrictions).

This game is also the prime example of a Steam Workshop coal mine (just like Cities Skylines and PC Building Simulator), which has a very vast community of creators who make tons of custom skins, maps, etc and provide an infinite supply of content. (Side note: Many of them are trash, that's how Steam Workshop is, but there are plenty of well-designed maps made by people excluding Gotcha and Prince as well...)

New Official maps with achievements are released every now and then for free, instead of making it a paid DLC, and these maps are from the contests they host with prize money to whoever submits a well-designed or visually stunning map.

However, the game screams [b]amatuer[/b], with it's non-existent art style similar to Clustertruck, lack of good SSAO or depth of field, and almost no lighting or reflections even for a Unity Engine game.

Spoiler:[spoiler] This was the prequel to Fall Guys. Humans will turn into Beans in the future and we will all be Takeshi's Castle warriors.[/spoiler]"

No direction to what to do for the most part, jumping is so fucked up I have no idea how to describe it. I seriously don't recommend unless you like lots of frustrating deaths. 2 stars!"

12274,"Probably the most pure fun I had while playing a game. It's so simple at first, but keeps giving new tools to play with, and with friends it's completely chaotic in the most erractic way. It's really meant to be played with friends and that's when the game trully shine. This game is the biggest example about the expression to not judge a book by it's cover.
It does not look like much, but this game gives so much with it's extraordinary gameplay that it's hard to explain how fun it is. One of the very rare game that made me cried from laughing too hard.
Ps: I have no idea how fun this game is by playing it alone, never tried. But from what I experienced, interaction with other players is what makes it so damn funny.

Edit : oh wow I never expected so much positive reactions from my little review. I'll take the chance to add a few more useful informations.

- The gameplay seems very messy at first because it takes a bit of time to get used to it, but you can really be precise once you master it. LOTS of variety in the levels. Climbing, puzzles, jumping, breaking, driving, swiming.
- The music is surprisingly very good despite being a small game.
- You will not hear it a lot, but there is a narrator that is pretty good too in the early levels.
- You like achievements? There are many achievements to get by exploring the maps, some are quite challenging!
- Yes I plan to play it a lot more, I'm far from getting bored of it.

New edit : I played it more since last time and tried more things, so here are a few other things to expect as well :

- There are more mechanism that I was expecting. It seems like almost all base maps introduce new tools to play with. Different vehicles to control, from a small boat to giant liner, truck, crane etc.
- Example of new interaction : Electricity related puzzles.
- All levels can be completed differently. You can ""cheese"" them and it's fun to do as well as beating them like how it is intended.
- The game is regularly updated. Since I got the game, the game was updated several times with new waiting room and new levels, as well as some ""official"" skins.
- You can download a crazy amount of fan made maps. Some are almost as good as the base game, they are simply not featuring achievements. Some are completely bizzare and unique. Memorable exemple that I remember : A star wars arena with laser saber, and a level where you could watch some old real cartoons like we were in cinema. Completely unexpected."

12310,"Human Fall Flat
The Game does too
Human Fall Flat is a Physics based puzzle game where you control both arms separately of a blob like character…
You look around with the light stick, move with the left, press buttons, pull items, and platform to progress through this 3 and a half hour long game…
And if you fall or die you fall or respawn right where you were which is nice... no having to repeat puzzles or re throw switches or pull items…
The first few levels here are pretty short and my actual preferred levels…
These levels really just introduce the mechanics and physics of the game, and slowly teaches you new moves like how to climb…
And the length was perfect...
It was satisfying completing these levels and then from the castle onward, the game just becomes a chore…
There are some pretty neat physics puzzles here, none will give you much trouble in terms of figuring it out…
and if you do run into trouble you can look for a remote to give you a clue..
the challenge here is in the executing your solution…
the physics feel as you’d expect them too…
but there are definitely frustrating moments especially when it comes to climbing or trying to reach higher ledges…
No story here,
There isn’t really much to this game other than moving awkwardly through environmental puzzles..
And I enjoyed most of my time with it...
But the final 2 levels were like pulling teeth...
I was just over the game by then as the levels get larger as you go and they drag on for what feels like forever…
Human Fall Flat would’ve been a great experience with a bunch of short levels stacked on top of each other..
But overall suffers from final stretch pacing problems...

12338,"If youre reading this and you believe that since i don't have 100 hours on this game my review doesn't really count or something, think again, this game is short, but it's probably one of the most enjoyable games i've ever played, no grind, just you with friends having fun. if it goes on sale for 10 bucks or below i heavily suggest getting this game, of course you can buy at full price but i've seen it go on sale a lot, so just play the waiting game a little and you'll save a couple bucks and have lots of fun."

12346,"Love playing this in split screen, and lots of great free levels on the workshop !"
12347,ITS GOOD
12348,Grab yourself a friend and play this game. It may not keep your attention for thousands of hours but its still worth it. The game features a lot of physics based puzzles with the greatest challenge being the controll of the character. All puzzles have clearly intended solutions but also hacky and borderline buggy workarounds (which isnt a bad thing but rather keeps you from getting hardstuck and having to look up solutions). There is also workshop support with user made levels which always is a great thing.

12384,"Played this for hours to the point of my fingers cramping and hands sweating. It's a funny and great game to play with your friends to goof around or work together to solve the levels. The levels are very fun to play and I love how much you can explore and interact with everything in all the maps while getting achievements, where it becomes times consuming."

Cons: sometimes you can accidentally end up on the next level without completing all of the previous level. This happens because you end up at the portal without knowing and fall through.

12507,very fun but stop grabbing me
12508,fun
12509,"Tilt the camera to to lift or lower your arms.

I missed that in the tutorial, but it's key to really getting places in the game. Once you've gotten that, the first few levels will roll along with silly, derpy fun. It does have a spirit of the ""Simulator"" games (I like to believe Human Simulator was the working title) but there is a certain method to it all once you get the hang of it. And getting the hang of it doesn't take as long as you'd think. Puzzles get tougher and less able to ""cheese"" near the end, and if they get to be too much there's always loads of Workshop content and extra levels being added.

Better with friends- kinda. It's certainly more fun, though it can take the challenge out of some puzzles designed for single-player. If one person makes it, the other can just bail, fall off the end where they are and get teleported to the next checkpoint. A bit unsatisfying at times, but on the whole still recommended.

I should note I have the Switch port too, and the framerate is downright awful on Switch. If you're going to get it, get it here. Steam Workshop alone makes it worth it."

12523,"Through the first few levels, I was ready to give this game a negative review. It felt like the premise was ""walking around and solving simple tasks, but awkward"". It's only as you get to the later levels that the game comes into its own. What earned my recommendation was the openness of the levels: the game doesn't force you into a single solution; there are lots of different, creative ways to go through a level."
12524,"Very fun and exciting game, needs some attention from developers to keep updating it"
12525,I really like puzzle so that's why i like this.

12529,"Do you love parkour? Do you love puzzles? Do you love 3D ragdoll games? This game is for you! Yeah, you! I think this game is awesome. I love it. You can download other players' maps and play on them. I would advise you to play this Steam game. You might want to ask a parent (for young people), or buy it yourself (for older people). Also if youre a young person, there is a couple of swearing on the multiplayer servers. So if you are young, I dont think you should play on multiplayer servers."

The other half is actually solving the puzzles. Breaking things with rocks and catapulting are especially fun. And I love that it's completely cooperative; if someone gets to the next checkpoint and the others are struggling, they can just fall off the world to spawn at checkpoint. It's a great wholesome game to play with friends and family. I highly recommend it."

12631,"I don't understand why people give bad rates for such a fun game. It is by far one of the most fun games to play with friends sitting on your couch.

Pros:
- very addictive gameplay = 9/10
- very fun and complex ""puzzles"" = 8/10
- high difficulty = 8/10
- great fun for multiplayer = 10/10

Cons:
- not the most pleasing graphics 4/10
- controls sometimes feel awkward 5/10
- sometimes frustrating 4/10
- full potential only when played with friends 5/10

Verdict:
With this game you get something that you really should enjoy with friends on your couch. Grab a drink or two, make some popcorn and enjoy the ride. You will struggle with the diffuculty sometimes but the more you play the more you get used to the kinda meh controls.
All in all a very solid port and a very addictive gameplay. Lots of fun! = 8/10"
12632,"Great game, a bit laggy for me. If you have a great computer, its a great game."
12633,it's been a delightful follow up to playing Overcooked and other light but goofy games with a friend of mine while we are in social isolation from one another :) So cute and lots of good fun.

12635,"Great game, bought it when summer sale this year.
Playing with my 5 year old daughter, she is never bored of this game. Unlimited custom level to play.
Recommended it to my friends, full of laughter from start to finish.

The official level is good and have more characteristic than the custom level, but it's a bit short. Good for the developer to keep updating new level."

12656,A fun physics game. I enjoy this game with my son. For a child friendly game this is one I can actually tolerate playing for extended periods of time. Unlike most kid games that make me bonkers with bordem.
12657,"This game is just a goofy fun time. Puzzles that are just the right level of difficulty (for the most part), a charming art style, and a relaxing soundtrack. The dev made levels are all great and there are a TON of community made levels beyond that, giving this game a technically limitless lifespan. It really is the complete package and I never have a bad time whenever I play it...with the exception of a few frustrating community made levels lol."
12658,"It's a fun, funny game great for co-op. The only issue is it gets frustrating during longer play sessions due to the imprecise controls."

12677,This is funny with a group of people of even just playing in your lounge room with the kids watching and having a laugh. I especially like that the developers have put so much effort into enabling the community to develop maps and have them included in the official game. Excellent replayability.

I prefer to play it with friends because it seems more fun. But if you prefer to play it alone, thats also a really nice experience. The Levels are lovely made and the optional narration is really enjoying while gameplay.

I recommand it to give it at least a try.

I would say, this is one of those games that you would not get tired of solving.
When you are tired, just let your character wobble through and you'll find yourself re-energized again.

Never stayed too long to solve puzzles except the ones in this game.
Plus, you get to dress your character  too XD
Should definitely check this one out."

12905,"Human: Fall Flat is a brilliant game, and one of my very favorite small/indie games.

It is completely original and unique in its controls and approach of using clunky physics to create interesting puzzles. Add multiplayer on top of it and it becomes even more hilarious.

Not only this, but the game has been supported with new content and levels for free for multiple years after release.

It's one of those games that remind us what games can be, and that I will always remember fondly."

13016,good game i love it.
13017,"This game is fun for the first 2 or 3 hours, really fun in fact. Obviously this is with friends, as I doubt a single person bought this game without the intent of playing with friends. Even with friends, after the first 2 or 3 hours the game gets agonizingly boring. You can easily cheat and shortcut past every level, which there aren't nearly enough of. The controls in this game are painful, and not in the mental sense. After a few minutes you can already start to feel your hands totally shutting down. I have tried for hours and hours to have the fun that I 100% expected to find in this game. I went in to this game with a very open mind, the possibility of this game being awful hadn't even crossed my mind when booting it up. My friends and I even tried playing with mods because we assumed anybody could make a better map than the devs of this game. There are a decent amount of mods, but even the best ones have the same issues the overall game has. Don't buy this game, it will waste your time."

13026,"This game has a lot of potential...but it just doesn't deliver.  I only spent about an hour, and maybe half of that was -attempting- to play multiplayer.  I say attempting because...two games I joined and was almost immediately kicked, two more had a solid half second to a second of latency.  I managed to play one for a few minutes, and it was neat...but the puzzles were all skippable, or you could get past them without doing the thing.  

Refunded."

I have a friend I've known for many years and our interests ended up being pretty different in many ways including our choices in games, but we can both agree that Human Fall Flat is a blast.

13194,"Heads up!  There is a rare bug that makes the game unplayable.  I just reached the last level of Aztec and my character will no longer hold onto items with both hands.  Their right hand alone grabs fine and the left hand alone grabs fine.  But when I use both hands, the character lets go after a few moments, this makes climbing ledges impossible and playing the game is impossible.  I tried to find a fix for the issue, I replaced my mouse (the other one died, rip mouse) and when that didn't work, I tried to rebind my keys.  However, since looking around is bound to the mouse, I needed to rebind to keys near my left hand, shift and caps lock keys are not options for rebinding.   I guess the next step is to buy a controller and play with that.  When I looked at community discussions and bug reports, a fair number of people have had the same issue and there is no fix.  

I wouldn't know if there were any cats, the game is unplayable.

(Edit: missed the 'n' in wouldn't)"
13195,One of my favorite games so far. It has lots of pros and no cons. The game is super fun and really makes you feel the joy. Buy it [b] -on sale if you can- [/b]and enjoy. It will worth your time.

13201,I think Its Really Funny And Diservs A Like!
13202,"This game is fun, although I am so bad at platforming that the only reason I can complete any level at all is that I only play with 4 friends and we just kind of YOLO everything and eventually overcome the obstacles.  I like the thinking puzzles, but loath the ones that require reflexes.

The only main gripe I have with the game is sometimes your character will just literally not grip, even though you're holding down the button. I don't know if this is intentional or a bug, but it's the only annoying thing that I can think of off the top of my head. The game is also still getting updates even 4 years after release."

the workshop has some very fun and creative content and for that alone this game deserves your time."

Where to begin.... where to begin...

I absolutely adore this game, it's endless hours of content, ragdoll like mechanics and a awesome physics engine that has had me in stitches with the crazy things that you can do with it.

I've had countless hours of enjoyment with friends in the game and it's highly recommended that you bring a friend or several to enjoy the fun with you as well.

The music is relaxing and in tune with each level.

Couldn't ask for a better coop friendly game <3

** even if i do have to keep coming back to 100% it... but i love it <3

13343,"One of the best funny games with friends. I recommend if you want an online game with funny moments with friends that requires teamwork to pass the steps, be sure to buy this game. Steps that the game updates after a while and brings newer maps, you can download workshop maps and try them."

13351,"This game is very interesting... It would be better if I only had friends to join and play with instead of trolls. Trust me, there is a lot of them that join servers and mess with people. But other then that, I love the game. And I love how funny it can get. I laughed so hard at times, I almost pissed my pants. True story. This game is full of comedy and is quite funny. A group of us grabbed onto each other and tried to throw all of us off the cliff. I don't know why, but it was quite funny to watch all of us fight over who is throwing who over the cliff."

13371,it much fun.
13372,So Cool! Especially Workshop levels^^
13373,this is the first game I bought on steam and its amazing
13374,"Typical | TimePass | fun with Friends | Controller is a must |
Hopefully these words are enough.
I did enjoy the games during a short period of time.. then got bored.."
13375,it good
13376,it funny and good
13377,"Great game, the levels provided are fun and allow for creative problem solving... additionally its a fun and completely different game with others. The workshop content allows for the creation of many other levels and you can assume where that takes the game."
13378,"A fun to play puzzle game where you won't stop falling  and you can troll your friends dragging them down with you. Think outside the box and solve the challenging puzzles while bursting into laughs

+ Many customization.
+ Different ways to solve a puzzle.
+ Fun
+ Interesting maps
+ Good Gameplay

- Short, but you can download more maps at the workshop"
13379,"An idiotic puzzle game that will make you laugh and hurt your cheeks. Jam solo or with up to 8 friends and have an unforgettable time. This unity made game is a masterpiece of its kind. Being a puzzle game it accomplishes a good balance between easy and hard mode spectrum. Any age group can enjoy this short game, even on an outdated rig. The game provides 14 unique maps with different puzzles and art style.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The gameplay is all clumsy, the controls don't seem as though they would work, but weirdly enough for this game they do. Your wobbly character is on a floating level and tries to pass the hurdles without failing. Some of the time, the game wants you to think out of the box, but sometimes there are direct solutions. The game mechanics work in the co-ordination of camera and hands. You raise your hands to grab, pick, or climb over an object. The up or down camera movement determines whether you want to pick an object or climb up your lower body. Spam jumping is quite fun and looks hilarious. As the levels have checkpoints, you can pretty much recover from any mistake. If you are playing with a friend, only one player needs to reach the checkpoint to make everyone spawn from the same spot.

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
The graphics are not realistic nor too janky. They have a unique clay-ish art style, also known as a solid mesh which is perfectly molded by the designer. You won’t find any incomplete areas on the map. Unity equals all the elements in your design, making sure every element feels like they belong in your design. Initial maps can look somewhat basic, but as the game progresses, the quality increases. The lighting is done cleverly; even if you are passing through a tunnel, your vision will be clear.

[h1]Main Pros and Cons:[/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Low system requirements
    [*]Lobby up to 8 players
    [*]Light hearted fun
    [*]Playable by all ages
    [*]Wide variety of character skins in steam workshop
    [*]Music/Sound fits the game
    [*]If you get skilled enough you can learn new shortcuts 
    
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Short in walkthrough length 
    [*]Can feel stressful to certain group
    [*]Feels repetitive as the game progresses
[/list]

 [h1] Miscellaneous Information:[/h1]

[b]How you start-[/b]
Your character Bob falls from the sky onto a dreamscape. His appearance is all-white with a baseball cap. You can either paint him manually, select pre-made demo characters, or add from the workshop. Then the game proceeds to teach about controls using narration and video tutorials.

[b]Levels-[/b]
The game offers 12 main and 2 newly added maps, also termed as “dreams”. Along with them, there are 2 gorgeous lobby maps to roam around till your friend is connected or is AFK. Every dream/level has a certain theme like water, factory, ice which contains puzzles accordingly. The average time needed to complete a map can be around 30-40mins, but it can increase with each level increment.

[b]Steam workshop-[/b]
Surprisingly, the steam workshop is immensely filled with character models counting the numbers up to 240,000. You can choose any character from anime to Hollywood movie to dinosaurs to occupation to animals. There are a lot of level designs submitted too, and those numbers are increasing fast due to the popularity of the level editor.

 [b]Level editing competitions-[/b]
As the game is encouraging people to create some maps for the game through their level builder tutorials, there have been competitions hosted with a prize pool of $10,000. This interaction with the community is highly appreciated, and the winning maps are later on added to “extra dreams”. The factory map was a result of these competitions and is highly liked by the players.

[h1]Honest Rating:[/h1]
After completing the game multiple times, we can conclude that the game has potential, and a lot of things can be enhanced by time. But according to the price and unique concept, this game is worth a try. The game provides laughter, which is all we need these days.

13396,She pretty noice. Greato with friendos if you have them c:
13397,Super fun game :)
13398,"This game is awesome! You can play it by yourself, or you can play with friends for a whole other experience. It has many levels with many things to do in the levels. The physics are both horrible and amazing at the same time. Sure, it can make some people rage, but that's the FUN part. Even if there's parts where you lose literally all your progress, there are still funny ways that this could happen. You could catapult yourself into space and fall into the never-ending void. If that's not FUN, I don't know what is! Honestly though, it's a really fun game and I would definitely recommend buying it."
13399,Adorable puzzle game.

13407,"Fun game, the rag doll physics at worse can be a bit frustrating but the hilarity makes up for it. I enjoyed the game solo but it is more enjoyable with a friend. The game concept is charming and overall it was an enjoyable experience. I don't think the game was long enough though. I think some new official level packs as dlc would be good for this game."
13408,i gifted like 30 friends this game. buy it!!!
13409,"FUN AF 
100/10 would keep playing"
13410,It takes 55 to 60 days for beans too mature
13411,"Yet another waste of time and money. Due to lack of better judgement, I paid 9 bucks for this game which I am never getting back. Friends literally begged me to buy the game and told me it was fun even tho I was sceptical. Turned out I was right! It was a total disaster of a game. Never trusting my friends again. 6/ 10 game, buy at your own risk. You are better off getting a Mcspicy upsize......"

13458," On a scale of 1-10, 9/10. Amazing game. The game's physics makes it a great game, the levels are fun and some of the the puzzles made me so confused. My friend is always like ""Can we play Human Fall Flat?"" or ""Can we play that game?"" when i'm playing a different game. I move in my game and he is like ""Can we play now?"" I'm so glad the game has multiplayer because it makes the game a lot more fun, like when you go AFK and they throw you off the map, or just have fun with multiplayer.

13568,"This is a rather lovely physics/platform game, with some rather novel twists.  There's not much hand-holding (pun unintentional!) in working out what to do, which I rather like.  I've not quite finished it yet (I think I've completed 11 levels), but it's been really enjoyable, so far.  The gameplay consists of looking around to see what sort of environment you're in, and investigating things you can move, then scratching your head for a bit to work out how to solve the immediate problem.  Usually, the problems are fairly straightforward in understanding what to do, but actually doing it is somewhat more challenging!  I'm thoroughly enjoying it!"

13720,Highly Recommended game
13721,very good and funny game
13722,"I played through the entirety of Human: Fall Flat with two of my friends. It's not a hugely fantastic game, but it was really amusing for the time that we played it.

Pros:
The mid to late game puzzles were really interesting and held our attention, and we had a hilarious amount of fun on anything that involved parkour. Some of them really effectively utilized teamwork, and while there is always a way of solving a puzzle solo, we found really creative ways of completing puzzles quicker as a group in unconventional ways. That added a lot of value to the game and made it feel more creative.

The difficulty of controlling your character is actually kind of fun, and the bumbling nature of the characters means that there is a kind of high potential for game mastery. It is hard to move well, and if you manage to learn how, you can find surprising ways of completing levels that were surely not intended by the developers.

Customization options for characters are extensive if you are into that, and you can share your character designs with other people.

Cons:
The replayability is pretty poor - once you have beaten all of the puzzles, unless you want to try doing it solo or in a crazy way that you hadn't seen before, you basically know the conclusion of each map and how to reach it, and getting there is just a wrote habit.

While it is one of the game's appealing features, the difficulty controlling your character will frustrate some people. Your avatar is terribly difficult to maneuver, and while that is hilarious and funny when you're in a good mood with good company, it will grate on you if you can't laugh it off.

In conclusion, I rate Human: Fall Flat a 3/5: an average to above average game. If the price is low for it and it's on sale, this is a funny puzzle game and is great for a laugh with friends. I wouldn't recommend it as a staple game, but it's worth the price when you consider how many hours of entertainment you can get out of it for its cost."

13729,YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS GAME!!!!
13730,"It's a great physics game that is charming and silly at the same time. I honestly don't see how people could not recommend it. The levels that the devs and the community have made are colorful and creative which is always a good thing. Though the levels are fairly linear that doesn't mean you can't try for different ways of getting through the level, which is a good thing to have when the game consists of a very orderly point A to B set up. I applaud the devs and hope they either make a H:FF2 or expand on what they have for this game."

13732,it is a very fun game i play with my brother all the time
13733,i have like 350 hrs on xbox and so i bought it here and finished it in less than 2 hours xd it really good and they care about theyre community bc the do competitions of map making and the workshop is the best part of the Human Fall Flat experience .

13772,"Highly recommend. Very worth the price and very, very fun. Some acheivements are hard to get so it is a great game to get a challenge. Recently got the speedrun achievment and learnt that there are also loads of ways to complete a level."
13773,There's not a mixed review option but I do really like this game. The problem is the Input Delay with multiplayer. I've played with friends inside my house and they had horrible input delay. The Dev's really need to fix this. But if you ignore Input Delay this game is extremely fun now that they produce maps more often.

The only thing I didn't like is the camera movement, I understand why it's implemented like this but I found myself starring super close to a wall or the floor without seeing my character a lot of the times.
This game is really fun with friends. Better if you go in blind or if the people that know the levels don't say much, since figuring out the puzzle and seeing the struggle is half the fun."
13813,muy fresco
13814,yes
13815,"Overall pretty decent game. A few flaws including my friend just skipping the map and completing it instantly. I was appalled when I saw my friend equip a Derek Chauvin skin from the Steam Workshop, and then he began to scream, ""Get on the ground and let me put my boot on your neck!"" Now I'm not political or anything, but in light of recent events, I find that disgusting. 6/10."

It is so much fun to fool around a bit and complete the levels the way you couldn't even think of in the first place.

There are many great levels by default + Steam workshop, which is a huge bonus.

Get this immediately and have some great time with your friend(s)."

13875,good
13876,"Fun Game, get challenging at times, but still worth a try"
13877,It's fun for about 5 minutes at a time until the physics of the game just STOP working.  It's really sad to see a physics based puzzle game just end up like this where the solutions to the puzzles rely solely on the engine not breaking and making it impossible.  Specifically the game has issues with player-made leavers where you put a stick into something and turn it or use the stick to hold something in place.  That often times just completely breaks and doesn't work.  You're better off just skipping those worlds entirely.

13894,"i wouldn't recommend this game if you saw a youtuber or twitch streamer playing this game. The game gets very repetitive and boring over time, all of the levels are poorly made. My main reason for disliking this game is its shown and marketed as a ragdoll game, when really it is a puzzle type game so if you are looking for a boring repetitive, bad made puzzle game with bad controls and camera angling, then human fall flat is the game for you."
13895,it is fun
13896,"If you are getting this game because a youtuber advertised it, don't get it. this game is boring and repetative with every level.

For example, lets take Carry.
The point of Carry is in the level's name: it shows the player(s) thats they can carry things
One way you could beat the level is by putting the provided boxes on the buttons to open the doors
OR
You could jump off the edge at the start, making sure you grab the wall as close to the end as possible, jump around the wall to the other side, then climbing over the wall after, the going on top of the wall after that, and jumping to the final platform.
I could keep going for (almost) every level, showing that this games mechanics and design make it a great platformer game for those who like to play games their own way, even if its not the dev intended way"

I've played 52 hours of this game when i am writing this revew and i'll say that it is worth the money if you'r willing to do the same thing twice or wanna go trought a few minuted of looking for a costem map.

14038,"Grade: 7,5/10
Human Fall Flat is one of the games that must need rewarded for their originality. You have to solve puzzle maps according to the realistic game physics. First times it can be complicated to complete levels, especially without help. Although, this game is supposed to challenge and puzzle your brain, so you must be sure before you buy it.
There's a discreet number of levels and optimal (almost infinite) personalizations of your character right away.
You will laugh a lot, if you play Human Fall Flat with your friends: I suggest you to try this mode, it's the best!
What about the other two game modalities? 
▪the Single-player mode is set in standard maps, personally I wouldn't play this mode in the long term 'cause the game becomes repetitive and boring alone;
▪then you can join other unknown players, but (personal experience) often some errors or crash occur, other participants 
sometimes expel you or you just lag for the whole match.
Here is why playing with friends is the best way to face this game, in my opinion.
I'd like to see in this game a public session with more than 8 players, where you have different challenges, like a battle royale game. But lots of troubles might occur, first of all the lag. 
To sum up, I certainly recognise this game is unique and funny, but not long lasting."

14046,"this game is a really fun game! Me and my brother play every day! it's so funny we end up playing till really late.  Its a great game I think you should get this game, I think it's worth the money."
14047,"I imagine if Aliens were real that their experience was probably individualized to some random drunk guy in the woods.  They then sat around explaining how people walked and the difficulties they had travelling any sort of distance.  The aliens then decided to make a simulation of what they assume human life must be like.  That is this game.

The default levels are really good, set up for speed-running, short-cuts, teamwork or the lack of.  It's great fun by yourself, but it becomes a fantastic experience with 2-3 additional friends.  This is a game I play a lot with my daughter, and one of our favorites.  Many workshop levels are a lot of fun, and more are added all of the time."
14048,its a classic
14049,"Human Fall Flat is a fun little physics based game, and a clever allegory of human nature and mankind as a whole. I shall set this review in two parts to make a it a bit more digestible. 

[Gameplay] 
Absolutely dumb fun. The gameplay is fairly simple, move your player character around by working with the games physics to perform actions varying from menial tasks to overcoming colossal obstacles. It's simple, genius formula for endless replayability and surprisingly varied gameplay. You can't really predict what will come after, and that's part of what I love about this game. Overall, solid experience. I will say, it is a much better played with a friend. So buy it, grab a buddy or two, have fun! 

Pros: 
-Simple but fun gameplay 
-Great replayablity 
-Really good level design 
-Workshop content available 

Cons: 
-Singleplayer experience is enjoyable, but best played with friends 

[Hidden Story] 
There really isn't much of a conventional story present in Human Fall Flat. But what there is some substance behind this fun little game. All throughout the game, you the human, are constantly failing but eventually succeeding in overcoming countless obstacles in your way using whatever is available to you. You will deviate new ways to overcome the present challenge. You will try new things. You will become frustrated. But regardless, you will continue to strive until you reach the end. 

In the words of the narrator; ""Humans, they will run into ever door they encounter. They will push every button they see. They will reach high, bend low to achieve their goals. And grab opportunities with both their hands. Yet they can't fly, and never will."". This game highlights the inherit fallibility of being human, but regardless of the fact we will never be perfect we struggle all the same until we reach our goals.

Bottomline- Humans are not perfect, but it's in our very nature to achieve great things and overcome the impossible. The same inherit nature and curiosity that led us to circumnavigate the globe, that led us to industrialize the world, that led us to building the first airplane, that led us to put a man on the bloody Moon! And although we will never fly, in the sense we will never be perfect, that fact shall never deter us from getting back up after we fall flat on our face. 

Thanks for reading!"

14065,"Okay, so after 18 hours of this game and smashing out all but 3 of my remaining achievements I can tell you that dark is the worst level, the Christmas achievements are done in a multiplayer lobby (you can change the lobby style to Christmas then press Esc) and that getting your hand stuck behind your head is frustratingly solved by looking up pirouetting while grabbing with said stuck arm. 

Despite my frustration at the moment, it’s a bloody good game, replay ability of levels was surprising due to there being more than one rout to most puzzles (IN ALL BUT DARK). Multiplayer is always a blast, be it with your mates or random. Has workshop support you can pick and choose levels beyond the ones provided even customisable character models.

Worth the money spent and more."

14090,"I would in no way recommend this if you're searching for a good singe-player game, because that's not what you're going to get.

What you will get if you play this with a couple of friends is a chaotic level-based sandbox. All the default levels you get are made to be played more than 1 or 2 times. It's so fun to mess around in these levels with friends. There are different ways to beat a portion or the level and this is why I've played every default level around 4-5 times by now. You can skip portions and the levels get a lot more fun if you start to evade the objective of a portion and just mess around. 

In my time playing this game I encountered a lot of glitches and bugs, all of these glitches/bugs were really funny and added to the experience. One time we could just jump infinite amounts of time, the physics are just non-existent and some mechanics can be abused (like grabbing a boat and just pushing the boat forward while you're in it, not using the peddles)

I would say that this is a must-have for people who want a sandbox game to enjoy with friends."

If you have no idea what this game is, do not underestimate it. I assure you, once you launch it for the first time, you will instantly understand the capabilities of Human: Fall Flat. You will know the sheer power in which this game holds.

14220,"Among one of the worst puzzle games I have ever had the displeasure of playing.
The game lacks any sense of direction or clear goal.

You spend the entire time in the game wondering ""Where am I supposed to go?"" and ""What am I supposed to do"". Even when you are actually completing what might be puzzles you will ask yourself the questions ""Was that how I was supposed to solve that puzzle"", or ""Am I even progressing?""

The game starts out with some humorous tutorials with great voice acting and writing, but as of the second level, it is all gone and you are left to stumble through this mess of a game without any feedback of how well you are doing, or if you are even going in the right direction."

14225,"If I am being honest, I bought this game as a joke. But when I finally went and sat down to play it, I fell in love. This game is an amazing time. It is quite fun to replay, because it is similar to games like Breath of the Wild, in the way that there are many different ways to solve the same puzzle. This game has quite a lot of replay value, plus, it has been updated frequently with brand new stages, for free. I would really recommend this to someone who wants to play a 3d platformer, or is someone just wants a fun game to play with another person. Either way, this game is a lot of fun."

Give this game a go, it's definitely worth the money.

Endless map possibilities (puzzling, climbing, adventure, etc.).

Great with friends or a group.

Playing alone is boring because there are no real ""quests"" or ways to record your progression for completing maps, or unlocking anything.

14370,Yeet Your Friends: The Game
14371,"i scanned my character and made me, love this game"
14372,"[h1] First Impressions [/h1] 
Human Fall Flat (HFF) was a very popular game on YouTube. I saw people floundering and flopping around, seemingly struggling with the controls to make the doughy characters move the way they wanted. It's not a game I was going out of my way to get, though I was curious how it actually handled, so when it came up in a bundle, I went for it. I played HFF with a friend when they visited me, and though I wouldn't say it was a complete blast, it was more fun than I might have thought otherwise. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2175614418
[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
The best way I can describe HFF is to call it a platformer with puzzles and obstacles you have to navigate around. In other games, you'd make use of a double-jump, and very quickly get past anything this game has to offer. However, the only things at your disposal are short jumps, pulling yourself up onto ledges, and interacting with levers, steering wheels, and other simple tools. You'll use these abilities, in spite of the at times clunky controls, in order to knock down barriers, open doors, and get to elevated areas so you can progress to the next stage. 


[h1] Controls [/h1] 
It'd be easy to dismiss the controls in this game as bad, but they actually work “well.” For instance, I usually found it easy to climb up ledges, as you lift your hands over your head, jump up so they'll latch onto the platform, and pull your view down so you pull yourself up. The bigger difficulty came from picking things up off the ground, as getting your hands at the right angle can be hard to do. The controls are part of the obstacle and fun of this game, though I'd be lying if I said they never frustrated me. Another big issue was with the camera, as your character would get in the way of you trying to see where your hands were going, or as you try to move an object into the right location. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2175613650
[h1] Story [/h1] 
At the beginning and end, you'll read a few messages from radios you pick up, but that's as far as the story goes for HFF. I think they could have added more here, and emphasized the humor of the game, but it's fine without a plot. As you come across different stages and situations, there are some background elements that hint at what's going on, but they're really just obstacles to overcome. 


[h1] Graphics [/h1] 
The graphics are pretty good for HFF. Objects that make up the environment and items you can interact with are 3 dimensional, and as you make contact, have a sense of gravity and physics. I think the art style has a pleasant softness to it, and has good color schemes for the variety of settings. For instance, the ice stage has trees and other background elements to contrast against the white snow. Plus, snow falls from the sky. You're also able to customize your character with different costumes, with many skins available in the mod community. 


[h1] Sound Design [/h1] 
When going out of my way to listen to the music in HFF, it's surprisingly somber sounding. I didn't necessarily expect goofy sound effects or carnival music, but the soundtrack would be suitable for a story-rich, dramatic game. It really comes off as incongruent, because the gameplay is too silly, yet the music is very good. There are sound effects, such as when you crash into the ground and use machines, but it's somewhat limited in range. Everything seemed to fit well enough though. 


[h1] Pros [/h1] 
🌟 You can play the entire game by yourself, but it's much more fun if you play with others. I don't know what it'd be like, but it claims you can play with a total of 8 people. 
🌟 There are a reasonable number of checkpoints scattered throughout each stage, and if you're playing with others, only one person needs to reach it for everyone to benefit.  
🌟 The game has a nice variety in stages and obstacles to deal with. Plus, if you're skilled or explore enough, there are shortcuts to skip past different sections. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2175614747
[h1] Cons [/h1] 
❌ There was one section in the Aztec stage that I found incredibly aggravating. It involved a platform on a lever and two boxes. Getting the platform to cooperate, while moving boxes onto it, was difficult, even after figuring out what needed to be done. Thankfully, this was the worst part of the game, and later areas weren't any harder than this. 
❌ Although the time it took me to beat the game was fairly high, there's not very many stages to play through. I'd have enjoyed more of them, with simpler challenges, just to enjoy navigating around in more areas. Stumbling about is part of the fun. 


[h1] Tips [/h1]
🔍 Controlling the direction you face is essential in order to play HFF. It's not hard, but it feels different from other games I've played, and takes some time to get used to. After all, normally I wouldn't need to face a specific direction in order to climb up onto a platform or grab an object. 
🔍 I found that lifting my arms up made it easier to carry objects, as they otherwise drag against the ground. This is also good life advice. 


[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] 
It's hard to quantify what makes the experience of HFF enjoyable, because on the surface, it shouldn't work. The situations that players deal with can be somewhat whimsical and interesting, but the tasks themselves would be significantly easier in most other games. Although there were times I got aggravated with the game, it wasn't as rage-inducing as I'd have thought, in spite of how long it takes to do fairly simple things. That being said, I played the game with someone else, and think it'd be a much different experience if I'd done it alone. I wouldn't suggest anyone go out of their way to get HFF, because there are quite a few games that emphasize clumsy controls and odd situations. However, I still recommend the game, as I had more fun with it than I thought I would."

14394,"This game is a lot of fun, especially with friends. The clunky controls result in a lot of hilarity. You have control over the movement of your arms, and what would seem to be the most simple things become difficult challenges and puzzles. 

The climbing with these controls make it feel like a triumph each time you reach a new top, with music sporadically accompanying the victorious moments. 

The wide array of options for character creation as well as level creation allow for a lot of creativity for those so inclined. 

All in all, definitely worth a shot!"

14408,"This game can be confusing / frustrating at times, in part due to missing cues in the game and in part due to the sandbox-y, physics-based nature of the puzzles. But the flip-side of that physics-sandbox coin is that you will create your own unique situations that are hilariously horrifying as you watch your carefully made plans come undone.

Playing co-op highly recommended, not because the gameplay needs it in any way, but because you need a friend to truly appreciate the ridiculous situations you will get yourself into."

Runs pretty well, some very minor glitches with collision detection but nothing that ruins the experience or progress.  If you're looking for a cheaper, simple game to entertain you for a while, go ahead and throw this in your cart."

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. Ding  A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Ding  Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.

As you solve puzzles or obstacles to get to the end, the shenanigans you do with your buddies makes this game golden. The controlls aren't easy (on purpose) so if you have a controller i would recommend using one. The game is well worth the money, make sure you get your friends ready to play.  =)"

14843,"Probably the most pure fun I had while playing a game. It's so simple at first, but keeps giving new tools to play with, and with friends it's completely chaotic in the most erractic way. It's really meant to be played with friends and that's when the game trully shine. This game is the biggest example about the expression to not judge a book by it's cover.
It does not look like much, but this game gives so much with it's extraordinary gameplay that it's hard to explain how fun it is. One of the very rare game that made me cried from laughing too hard.
Ps: I have no idea how fun this game is by playing it alone, never tried. But from what I experienced, interaction with other players is what makes it so damn funny."
14844,"Fazia tempo que não dava tanta risada jogando um joguin eletrônico, mecânica incrível e bizarra. Recomendo demais pra quem é loko e quer passar o tempo"
14845,mnhnfgggdgergdgr
14846,this game cooled
14847,This game was amazing! I played for 6 hours just because it was that good! I recommend to play this game. Some of the maps were hard but I still like the game.
14848,its a dumb and fun game. some levels are difficult and require BIG brain. 9/10
14849,the best game with mates
14850,really fun with friends
14851,great game to go into laughing fits with your friends 10/10 would recommend
14852,no
14853,"This game is really fun and goofy, though I'd say it's most fun to play with friends/other people. If you're into puzzle games, then Human: Fall Flat should be entertaining and fun for you!
I personally got a little bored with the levels after a while, though that might just be because my attention span quavers in games where there is no overarching storyline, so take that as you will. I would rate Human: Fall Flat a 7/10, so pretty worthwhile!"
14854,"really fun with friends. The customization is good too, you can paint anything you want on yourself."
14855,haha
14856,funny human go weeeeeee

sometimes you can be stuck on a level for a long time though"
14867,"best joc ever
"
14868,"i love stupid games with funny physics, but this game feels like an unfinished game. The only thing that makes this funny are your friends.
"
14869,The game is P fun however The steam workshop for this game seems to be only Japanese people which kinda sucks bc I would like to Not See every anime movie and see Actual levels
14870,e e e love e
14871,"This game keeps on giving! It's great fun with a few friends on teamspeak. The standard maps are great to get started, and the workshop has a lot of good maps too!"
14872,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
14873,"Fun with friends, breaks bonds"
14874,good game
14875,"The workshop is a mess, there are two major problems with it:

Skins - because uploading even the slightest changes and recolors is easy without any sort of quality advisory, categorization (painted, recolor or image based) or tutorialization on how to make good skins, in-game, the workshop ends up being flooded with tens of thousands of low quality uploads.

Levels - while there are some good ones here and there, they're few and completely buried under the sheer flood of chinese made low quality content, which feature unknown writings, dubious thumbnails, dubious scripts (these are unity levels that can be freely scripted to do anything - malicious scripts are a possibility and may damage your computer) and strange cultural fluff that has nothing to do with the game but act more as an advert or postcard.

Curve digital, please fix this. I'll change my review to positive for this otherwise fun game. The workshop needs fixing, badly."
14876,"Very fun with friends! No time limits, can explore maps for hidden surprises. Amazing in-game physics. Each level is unique."
14877,yes
14878,One of the best coop game :)

14885,awsome
14886,Worth of buying
14887,KEKW moments
14888,"really worth it,  better u buy it in sale and only play with friends  then its totally fun and u wont get bored"
14889,"This Game is really Fun and Awesome, Especially with friends, lots of good maps in the workshop too
A Truely never ending Experience 
I Highly recommend it !!"
14890,"This is a belated review of this game from me (its been on the to do list for me for a while). However, I see my friends occasionally buying this game, so I figure I get this done sooner vs latter.
I last played this game early August 2019 and finished all the base-game (up to the Frankenstein level) I knew of solo with a few occasional co-op sessions with friends.
To preface everything, I have to say that [b]I did not[/b] like this game by the end.

I was into/excited for concept of the game going in, but I feel the execution of it wasn’t stellar and often monotonous. Movement the physics of this game and your main character is a bit too slow and weak, which isn’t a problem when starting out but when you start to get into certain puzzles latter in the game (around the harbor area and beyond) the game becomes a bit irritating and unfun to play. The core system of Human Fall Flat' feel like physics first and gameplay second, which is an mistake imo. It is not fun for me to clunk around as a weak dumpling struggling to get the job done for too long because my weak little arms. 

Having a 2nd friend barely helps in solving the struggles of weight and inertia due to them being as weak as you. Also I feel that saying a game is better with friends is a bit of cheap obvious thing to say. This game does not have any stellar work-together features (like other games which are design with friends in mind have,) it’s just a big multiplayer sandbox with a soundscape that is a bit too quiet at times.

Getting back to the core of the game, the problem with the core coincides with the levels. Parkour/swinging levels function fine because despite your weak strength your grip of iron often never fails. This does not extend to the puzzle levels/sections where more precision control is key and as said many times before, spaghetti arms makes the player’s life unnecessary struggle.

A feature this game gets right however is the customization in this game is pretty decent when it someone gets into it. I believe that workshop shows that factor in spades.

[h1]In conclusion[/h1], if you have a friend and get this game on the super cheap (the price of that is up to you). Maybe it’ll be worth as a little mess around, as a ""nothing at stake"" type game. 
Otherwise, though, I would recommend avoiding due to imo, there being better options out there. 
Games like [b]“Moving Out”[/b] https://store.steampowered.com/app/996770/Moving_Out/ and 
[b]“Totally Reliable Delivery Service”[/b] https://youtu.be/60pJXqYXm1E takes the concept of “Gangbeats but co-op and not overprice depressing to look into abandonware” and does it better. This is coming from someone who hasn’t (as of writing played) either of these games mention but feel their time was squandered by “Human Fall Flat” regardless.


Edit: I din't realize but this game has 8 player co-op. Which is a good thing in my review I was talking under the perspective of being 1-2 people. However I have to say, when it comes to getting you plus 7 other people in the same room to play a single game. All that can be said is good luck"
14891,This game is so fun when playing single player and multi-player I can tell it was very worth it if you guys have a chance to buy this game then do it :) promise me you won't regret it
14892,fun with the boys
14893,"Its just fun to go totally ham on all the level and find your own ways

14897,"Really fun Game, I don't think there is really anything to complain about. The game has made me some really funny moments I recommend Especially with friends."
14898,pretty fun especially with a friend
14899,"I play this game with friends every now and then and we always find a way to have fun solving puzzles together and messing around with the crazy physics and controls this game has. The only thing keeping us from continuing to play is the lack of new levels.. workshop helps but not enough.. do recommend it though, funny game :^)"
14900,lol putty man legs no work
14901,"adand
"
14902,"the only defect is a camera move.

this game's camera is snapped to the character's head which swinging all the time u play, as some game play videos show in Youtube. (Caution: the official sample video's camera is fixed for shooting these trailers by the developer, so there is no such a mode to fix the camera in the game itself.)

so u will get motion sickness after 10min or so, that's why i don't recommend this game.

if the developer gave us the way to fix the camera (= to turn off the camera shaking), ill change this review to thumbsup. i cannot believe they left it even today.

カメラ最悪：
複数の欠陥がある。ひとつはカメラ。頭部に固定されてしまっているため、ただでさえグネグネうごく人形に合わせて視界も常時揺れる。これを固定するオプションはない。よってすぐ３Ｄ酔いする。

操作性の悪さ：
そしてもうひとつは操作性。常にワンテンポ遅れる。ＵＮＩＴＹゲーム特有のモッサリ感。このせいでジャンプ後につかまる作業がおよそ成功しない。また変な慣性もついており、狭い足場にとどまることも困難。というか移動キーから手を離しているのに、カメラで見回しただけでヨタヨタと数歩移動してしまうおかしな仕様。おそらく簡単にクリアさせないための作者独自の改悪と思われ。そのせいでアスレチックアクションなのにまともにアスレチックできない。これを上記のカメラで行わねばならないのだから、なおさら３Ｄ酔いが多発。

ストレージ大食い：
マルチプレイの鯖リストで他人が初期以外のＤＬＣを使ってると、鯖へ実際にインしなくてもSTEAM Workshopのデータが勝手に \SteamApps\workshop\content\477160 に溜まっていく仕組み。だから定期的に掃除しないとストレージがパンパンになる。ゲーム自体は500MBらしいが、遊んでもいないワークショップのＤＬＣがダラダラ落ちてくるため数ＧＢ以上へ膨れ上がる。

結論：
ってことで、おすすめできない。カメラと操作性を直せば良ゲーになりうるが、発売から日にちが経ってなお放置してるところを見ると、変なこだわりを捨てずにあえて放置している、客のほうを向いてないデベロッパのように思われる。彼らにも読めるよう英語でレビューを書き、フォーラムでの通報もしておいたが、まあ期待はできないだろう。直したらサムズアップするつもり。"
14903,yeah its ight
14904,"bought this game for me and my gf > suddenly my friend appear in discord and I sent him this game too > my gf sleep earlier > me and my friend ended up complete this game for 8 hours.

Yea you need lot of friends to play with and you can also solo for couple map only. 

(lot of shortcut ahead !) 

Worth it ? worth it.

14905,Amazing fun game to play with friends to solve puzzles!! :(
14906,fun
14907,funny if played with (DRUNK) friends hahah
14908,"This game is an excellent puzzle game! In the future I would recommend the Developers to work more to the game, like adding new maps. Hopefully they will add them some time in the future, but overall its a great game.
"
14909,"amazing

14910,:)
14911,its so good!
14912,yes
14913,"My friends and I played this game from start to finish, only playing it together as a co-op game. I could see many of the puzzles becoming frustrating, if not rage-inducing in singleplayer, but if the game isn't a blast as a co-op puzzler. We learned the controls, the physics and their quirks, and other tips and tricks to gameplay at the same time, allowing us to both get better as we played the game at the same pace. While not being extremely lengthy, we both think that our money was well spent on this charming and goofy physics puzzler. I highly recommend this game!"
14914,The game is very nice. Physics engine sometimes is cancer but sometimes makes you laugh. Have fun with your friends.
14915,the game is funny and fun and kinda hard :D

14958,"very fun to play with friends. few base levels, but there's a workshop which is good.

Plus they bring the portal kinda experience where you have to dig up any possible ideas to pass the level. So many ways to complete a map while having a great time. Simply one of the best coop games ever made."
14988,t
14989,"Just get this game and experience pure silliness and fun. So, basically just buy this game already. Or, if you don't have money or are a kid... Then ask one of your parents or siblings."
14990,"yes it most certainly was. It most certainly was, it was!"
14991,"I played through the campaign with two friends and it was honestly one of the most fun and interesting gaming experiences I have had playing with friends. The game is so unique and it opens so many opportunities for jokes, and so many ways to get past checkpoints in unconventional ways. Seeing as the game is only $6 because of the Steam summer sale, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it solo, or with friends, because it is an experience that I am glad I didn't pass up."

14994,this game is BIG epic and cool
14995,"*falls before reaching next area*
me: heh do a flip
*proceeds to fall 20 more times from the same spot*"
14996,"I absolutely LOVE this game. 
You are able to create your own lobbies, levels, skins and share it with the steam workshop. In addition the developers organize competitions for the best levels the players are sending them. They keep the motivation up to create new levels.
Playing online is fun whether playing with friends or strangers. You can communicate with the in-game chat to make new friends! :D

Cons:
There are some bugs, but they are pretty rare. The textchat has no cencorship. Some people don't know how to create a private server and are randomly kicking players."
14997,indeed good
14998,"This game is a blast if you play it with friends.
Highly recommended. (More Players = More Fun)"
14999,god
15000,"Waste of time.
Cool concept.
Trash controls.
Frustrating physics / vehicles.
Many of the puzzles bugged due to wonky physics and wasted much of my time trying to have fun.

If you enjoy games where the inputs you enter actually line up with whats happening in game, avoid this.

Wish I could get my money back."
15001,The most I've laughed in a long time! The co-op multiplayer in this game is fantastically ridiculous
15002,really fun and funny hard with mac

15004,funny fall over
15005,Basically the drunk version of Portal
15006,coop fun
15007,"very fun alone and with friends, now with the workshop update you have so many levels to choose from!"
15008,"(Its good i guess.) - Previous review
 My previous review was just for fun but let's do an honest one now. In my opinion this is a great game, no matter what you are looking for. It's got it all; Action, adventure, puzzles, casual chatting, horror or chilling in a dumpster with your best friend. You've got it all here!
One thing to keep in mind though is that the original non-custom maps offer ""some"" content and you'll have a blast playing them with a friend or two (or 7 since 8 is the limit).
 However, where this game shines is with it's workshop. Not only does it allow you to find some absolutely amazing maps and avatars but above all it allows you to get a little fancy yourself and upload your own stuff which is always an amazing option. You can have your completely unique avatar and stand out from everyone else. No more people picking you up like a puppy because they thought you are their friend, with your unique character everyone will know who you are :D
 And gosh finally, i just want to say that the game has a steep learning curve. Getting used to controlling both arms independently could be pretty tough at the beginning. More often than not you'll get confused about which arm is which and let go and plummet to your death. Although that's where all the fun comes from. Watching your friends slowly come to the realisation as they are hanging from an edge. The realisation that they lack the skill to pull themselves up and then coming to terms with their impending doom ~insert maniacal laughter here~
 So yeah, overall it's good i guess."
15009,yes
15010,fun haha

15014,very cool
15015,"Fun physics and game overall, needs more players to play it so that we can get more workshop level content"
15016,the game is good but the recoil is harder than csgo. You need to use your brain and your muscle or you will f_uck up.
15017,"Very good game, lots of fun, i put pp on character is very nice pp. Very fun play with friends that i dont have :)"

15020,Ragdoll physics mixed with wacky puzzles is suprisingly fun.
15021,Funny game
15022,Worth every single  penny i spent on the game. We get new levels every update and can play many custom levels .Definetly worth to buy this game
15023,"Brilliant game, very fun and challenging."
15024,"Human Fall Flat is one of the best puzzle games I've played.

- Very entertaining to play with friends, you literally cry out of laughter when playing this.
- Supports Steam Workshop - countless blob skins can be downloaded and you can create one yourself!
- Puzzles are challenging - solving some puzzles took hours (unless you have 5head friends, I got Pepega ones).
- There are alternative ways to complete each puzzle.
- 14 different levels - initially the game had only one level, but gradually they added 13 more for free which is great.

10/10 would recommend buying the game to defy the rules of physics to grab the butt of my friend.
"
15025,"The most funny game i have played in my life , get it with your friends and have fun :]"
15026,"very falling, much flat"
15027,Noice
15028,THIS GAME REMINDS ME OF THE IRL ESCAPE ROOM I DID. IT IS GREAT! RECOMMENDED GREATLY!
15029,"This game is as fun as it looks stupid, and it looks pretty stupid.

The game is a physics and puzzle based platformer(?) where your goal is usually to make it to the end of the map with the use of objects and physics.

The game has a pretty diverse workshop, so you'll find something that'll suit your fancy.

Its a great game to play with friends, but its not very much fun without."

15040,"If you have a bunch of friends to play with, there isn't anything more fun."
15041,"Good 3D puzzle-platformer. Fun as hell with friends. It's not brilliant or masterful in any aspects, but it's still worth checking out. Also on multiplayer it's incredibly easy to cheese most levels so try to play by the rules as much as you can (unless you're just achievement hunting, in which case I won't stop you)

Update: Only recently found out this is actually one of the best selling games of all time... Holy crap."
15042,"Very funny party game, can only recommend!"
15043,"I paid £2 for this trash and quite frankly that was too much. It's more of the same ""haha bad movement funny"" gimmick that hasn't been original in a decade, it's so agonizingly slow that you will know exactly what to do and take 10x as long to actually do it. I genuinely have more fun filling the dishwasher than ""playing"" this. It's a playable lobotomy, and quite frankly I wish it were a playable shotgun lobotomy so it could put me out of my misery in the process."

15093,"Too much Fun with Friends !!!!
"
15094,"I feel like this is important enough to say upfront: this game is for co-op. You feasibly could beat every level in single player, sure, but why would you want to? The majority of the fun in Human Fall Flat is trying to coordinate your ridiculously uncoordinated drunk baby's movements with an equally uncoordinated drunk baby friend. 

Myself, I played the game couch co-op with my girlfriend, and we had a blast. Human Fall Flat is a dumb, stupid game in all the right ways. The game generally runs in a cycle: oh god how do we do this->aha, ok, here we go->f f f not like that->HELL YEAH WE'RE THE BEST->oh god now how do we do [i]this[/i].

The levels themselves are fairly massive, often with multiple routes, and they constantly escalate in absurdity—I thought the game would peak with a catapult, not even considering that later I'd need to, say, drive a car. Sometimes it gets frustrating and you need a break—like most video games, the water level almost killed me—but everything is doable with persistence and luck. Making it through to the end of the game felt like a real accomplishment, though we're saving the free post release levels for a special occasion.

There's admittedly a lot of bad control physics comedy games out there, and I'm usually not too impressed with them because they feel like one note jokes, instead of actual games to play and overcome. But the simple absurdity of Human Fall Flat makes this one of the better examples. If (and only if) you have a friend to hop in with you, Human Fall Flat is a solid recommendation."

15099,"I really love this game. I spent around 20 very enjoyable hours playing it with my best friend until we had finished the whole game and gotten every achievement (this was before the addition of new levels). It was tricky at first, but you'll really get the hang of it after only a little practise. I would definitely recommend playing it with at least one other friend because it might get frustrating otherwise. All in all  a very lovely game!"

15130,how the humand fall flat if earf is rounded???
15131,"Human Fall Flat is a physics based puzzle platformer where you are more or less controlling a ragdoll capable of basic movement such as walking, jumping, extending arms and grasping. Both of those are going to be your main tools to make progress as you solve the puzzles.

One thing I do appreciate with that is that you can solve the puzzles in quite a few ways since there happen to have more paths to victory than meets the eye.

Now, the game starts off pretty fun, especially in co-op, since you can play with up to 8 players online and 2 in local that you can mix and match. BUT the game has one glaring flaw that quickly tends to ruin it.

As you make a bit of progress, you will have to learn how to climb. If you are using a mouse + keyboard, you have to extend both of your arms by holding down both left and right click, often jump using space, look up so that your arms are extended up, and then look down to actually climb, all of that while holding both clicks. On a controller, replace the clicks with L2 and R2 and you can guess how it goes.

Not only is it unpractical, it's also putting a lot of strain on your hands which undoubtedly will result in pain. Seeing how often you do need to climb, that does tend to make the game a chore.

What is even more frustrating is that the devs actually added a ""fun"" ragdoll button but never bothered to add a dedicated climbing button that would make the whole process a lot more easier.

There's a second issue that comes into play as you progress and it's actually the selling point of Human Fall Flat: its wacky physics. Having to move a plank to make a bridge or even turning a damn lever will have you fighting with the jiggly physics and I personally kept thinking that the simplest task was only complicated because of the physics.

Needless to say, I didn't like Human Fall Flat. The controls are imprecise and unpractical which is a dealbreaker when it comes to platformers, at least for me.

Maybe I'm just too old and grumpy to appreciate a voluntarily flawed game, but unless your sole purpose in life is to become some sort of goofy internet celebrity that feeds on Wallmart coupons while making non-sensical videos where you pretend to have fun (we all know youtubers are really dead inside), save your money and your time."

15151,It's a cool puzzle game. Not a lot of content. I wasn't expecting to finish the entire game in less than 12 hours.
15152,"Well..... you need A LOT of patience, I like it, but if you are an impatient person I would not recommend it. (But I like it)"

it good"
15156,"Amazing game, really fun to play with friends."
15157,I have never laughed so hard playing a game before. But that is only really the case if you are playing with friend(s).
15158,"Very fun physics! Leaves way for players to find their own ways to solve puzzles and different challenges.
Steam playtogether is simple to setup and runs great!"
15159,"A beautiful, happy, delightful game of friendship and accomplishment. My pals and I just recently finished all available levels and have never felt so fulfilled since we started gaming together. It's very simple in concept, but so very fun in execution. The thought that gets put into every puzzle, every secret, every finish has thought and importance. Sound and music isn't common in the game, but the subtle sound effects are funny (such as bumping your head on a plank) and the music that does play is always great. My favorite is ""Sail Away"" from the Water level. We're going to be diving into custom levels shortly and plan to replay all the main levels with a few more friends in the near future to discover all the stuff we missed. I would definitely recommend playing this with friends over playing solo, it enhances the experience to work as a team in this game. I've heard joining random servers doesn't make for the best experience, although I can't speak for that as we've only played in ours (which does get guests time-to-time who we will play with unless they're asshats who sabotage). 100% recommended experience. Here's a video from our series we're doing on the game, this one of us playing the end of Aztec and the beginning of Dark:

15160,"A great game - more fun with friends. The campaign has some challenging puzzles and levels which are fun to play, but the online mode with custom maps are a lot more fun. Definitely recommend."

15170,"I've only just bought this game, but this game is so hilarious. I havent been laughing this much playing a game in a long time. Literally everything in this game makes you laugh. The way they walk, the way ure able to grab ur friend to help them up a wall but at the same time u might accidentally grab their face which is incredibly hilarious lmao, if ur friend isnt doing what u want them to do, just grab their hand and try dragging them to where u wanna go until they listen hahaha or just be silly and push ur friend off the map. Cuz, why not? XD Its even more hilarious when you fall down with them at ur failed attempt to push them down.

The way the characters move and do things is so wobbly and clumsy and hilarious. 
I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who love laughing and playing games that require teamwork but still allows you to be silly and fool around.
This is definitely a game to play with friends on voice call or together irl. I'll guarantee you'll laugh from start to finish.
Worth all the money."
15171,"its hard to move and jump and sometime your arm and legs get stuck to your body...that said this is the much fun I had with friends in a long time competing each level have a achieving fulfillment to it 10/10

15174,This is such a whimsical and enjoyable game to play both solo and with a group of friends. My friends and I were constantly laughing at all the stupid stuff that would happen throughout the gameplay. This is a fun game that can be picked up for very cheap.

15216,"Human Fall Flat is a hilarious game to play with your mates! You're just gonna end up in slapstick situations that'll have you laughing out loud over stupid shit, good stuff.

The game's very straight forward; you have to puzzle with physics, and you can usually find multiple solutions around any given part. Sometimes a shortcut is available, sometimes you can make a shortcut.

There's a workshop with a bunch of maps, tho I haven't tried any of those out yet so I don't know how much effort people put into those maps and how polished they are.

The base game has 14 levels at the time of writing and let me tell you, going through it the first time, some of these levels will have you stuck from time to time so you're not gonna blitz through it all. (If not only for the physics getting you into a shitty+funny situation, or bugging out.)"

15288,"Human Fall Flat is a physics-based puzzle game where you play as a doughy character and must traverse different environments to find the exit. Each level has an overarching theme like Castles, Haunted Houses and Aztec ruins and the puzzles relate to the levels theme. The controls do take some time getting use too since your character isn’t very strong or fast but there’s lots of humor to be found in the awkwardness of the whole game. Even performing simple tasks like opening a door or picking up a box feel silly and awkward but aren’t frustrating. All the puzzles can be completed solo, but it is more fun to play with other people, even if you spend more time agitating each other than finishing the puzzle. This game was a lot of fun to play and the developers are still releasing new levels to play so this game does have replay value with the new levels, along with all the fan made content for it."

There's so many ways to solve and get through the maps so there's no ""right"" way to play this game. Play with friends to make it more entertaining, I've spent a lot of time on this game not even playing the maps, but just grabbing friends and throwing them off the map as well as being thrown off.

15322,"Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious physics puzzle game. The graphics are very charming and watching a short gameplay video can lead to an instant purchase.

The levels are unique and offer diverse puzzles. It may take some time to get used to them, but I think controls are tight for this kind of game. My only major issue with it is that the levels can be way too long and you cannot save in the middle of a level. This can be frustrating at times if you are not ready to commit to 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted playtime. I would strongly suggest to play this co-op, in which case some puzzles will feel less tedious and the game will give you more laughs.

Human: Fall Flat is not perfect, nor is it very complex but it is a game with personality. 

[b]7/10[/b]
"
15323,"We have had so much fun with this game. If you like puzzle games then this is a good option.

I hope to see the following modes in this game in the near future:

1. Monster chase.
One of the players could play as a monster. The monster could chase down the other players while they are trying to solve the puzzles and escape the maze. The players could maybe set up some traps or do what ever they can to prevent the monster from reaching them.

2. PvP battle.
Just a basic battle mode. Players could compete who gets out of the maze first. and so on..

The good thing is that mots of the puzzles don't require a lot of precision, there's no time limit, and there are checkpoints throughout the levels.  The gameplay is great, and tackling your friend off the level is great fun and never gets old.  Overall a good co-op puzzler, and the steam workshop is a huge bonus."

It's a fairly short game that has relatively simple puzzles and gameplay mechanics, but there's a mountain of creativity that can be applied to the game via custom content (modding)
There's a lot to improve upon, but regardless, what it has to offer is amazing and all I can say is that it left me wanting more.
I feel like the developer expected the modders to finish the game, because the game doesn't boast many levels.

Still, I highly recommend it and I think it would be close to a masterpiece if the modding community was more enthusiastic on creating new levels."

We honestly laughed our heads off whilst playing. Usually when playing with more than two players the others start mucking about creating hilarious scenes. It is so much fun, we were really surprised (and sad) when we had finished it (there's no secret end-credit thing as far as we could see, just a looong fall where you bounce off the letters, saved you 10 minutes). I haven't really managed to play it much in single player mode but they say it is doable...

+ Hilarious
+ Co-op multiplayer
+ Singleplayer
+ Well executed graphics & puzzles
+ No permanent deaths (actually it might even be the funniest things in the game, try to see what stupid things you can get away with before you die and Fall Flat on your face/back on the last save-point)
+ Lots of save-points

- You can't act seriously even if you try 
- No hint option if you get really stuck
- Controls can be a bit easier but as soon as you have figured them out it is doable, but that is also part of the charm...""Wait, let me get you this beam..."" *grabs and holds on to floor instead* ""Ehm one moment..."" *lets go of floor, trips and now one of my arms has lodged itself behind my neck, tries to shake and shimmie it back but it won't* ""gimme a sec I'm gonna jump off the cliff, is easier, brb. Geronimoooooo"" *dies, falls on top of friend, ""hey there look my arm is now functional"" *waves and hobbles to the beam, lifts it up over head* ""look at my hippie-stick! I am super strong!!"" *wacks other person off the ledge...* ""Whoops-Sorry"" 

Honestly if you like just running around like a drunk Jar-Jar but with better (or worse) vocabulary, and (sometimes accidentally) solving puzzles, together or alone, this is the game for you. Can't wait for more levels for even more fun!"
15472,it is awesome
15473,Fun game. Therapeutic. Get to throw things out windows including other players and destroy things
15474,Silly game but pretty well thought out. Controls take a minute to get used to but it is a really stress free way to spend some good time with someone in local co-op.

15484,"[b][h3]pros[/h3][/b]
this game is very VERY silly in a million ways. the character you play as flops around levels and has incredibly sticky hands. while it does get tedious sometimes, its still very charming. all the levels have multiple casual puzzles to solve while you look at the preeeetty sweet scenery (mostly in later levels). 
the amount of easter eggs and achievements are both fun and rewarding.

[b][h3]cons[/h3][/b]
as you march into the later levels, you will notice that they become increasingly longer and more tedious. it can be incredibly frustrating to have a crucial item to drop down into the void, or fall all the way down after climbing for ages.
also this game can make you WANT TO THROW YOUR MONITOR OUT OF A WINDOW AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

[b][h3]bottom line[/h3][/b]
human fall flat is a very fun game that i kind of left sitting in my library, but im glad i picked it up again. the game is very charming and simple.
 the longer levels and frustration can be remedied if you're interested in taking shortcuts and thinking like a speedrunner because wooooosh gotta go fast sonic hahahahhahahaa

The derpiness of the controls and the physics are great layers of additional fun to the puzzles. I believe almost anybody can play this game, skill-wise. I definitely don't recommend playing this alone, it'll be a lot more fun with somebody else. And what's even better is that it doesn't have to stop at just one friend."
15524,"[h1] TL;DR [/h1]

[b] Is this game worth my money? [/b]
Yes, although I would recommend getting it on sale. 

[b] Is this game good gameplaywise? [/b]
Yes, especially with the continued community support.

[b] Is this game fun? [/b]
Undoubtedly, but you and at least one other friend needs to have it for it to be fun.

[b] 8/10 [/b]


[h1] Full [/h1]

For my ranking of games, I use 3 distinct criteria:

     [b] 1.	Pricing [/b]

At the time of this review I have 18 hours on Human: Fall Flat and I paid about $11 AUD (about $7.50 USD) for the game. This equates to:
     18:11 = ~1:0.61
This means that for every hour of Human: Fall Flat I played at the time of this review I paid 0.61 cents in Australian Dollars (or about 0.42 USD). This is really good money-wise, although it must be said that I got this game on sale. I would definitely recommend doing the same.

8/10 for this section.


     [b] 2.	Gameplay [/b]

Truth be told, the gameplay isn’t very interesting in Human: Fall Flat, but that’s because it doesn’t need to be. It’s the most basic thing one could think of: if your hand touches something, it sticks. That’s it. But what Human’s levels do with this mechanic is nothing short of genius. The levels take this mechanic and push it to its absolute limit. You’re frequently being flung across the levels or grabbing on to your friend’s back for dear life. While the levels do get old fairly quickly, continuous support for the Steam Workshop by the developers really help this game stay fresh. Most notably, the recent Workshop competitions bring out the best creativity in people.

7/10 for this section.


     [b] 3.	Personal enjoyability [/b]

Oh my god this game is fun. Honestly this game is almost perfect when it comes to how much I enjoy it (may I mention the aforementioned flinging across the map?). There is one major detriment to Human’s enjoyability, and that is its total reliance on you making your own fun with friends. It’s a sandbox with wacky physics, but it’s not at all fun by yourself. If multiplayer wasn’t an option this game wouldn’t nearly be as popular or good as it is. Don’t get this game if you don’t have a friend who’s also willing to get it and play it with you.

9/10 for this section.

15530,เล่นกับเพื่อนแล้วสนุกมาก ตลก ตลกตั้งแต่ท่าเดินตัวละครแล้ว แต่ละด่านก็จะมีอุปสรรคมากมายให้เราผ่านไปให้ได้ และตัวละครเราที่ไม่ว่าจะทำอะไรก็ดูอ่อนล้า แขนขาไม่มีแรงเข้าไปอีก ก็จะยิ่งทำให้การผ่านด่านในแต่ละด่านนั้นยากมากยิ่งขึ้นไปอีก ถ้ามาเล่นกับเพื่อนก็จะได้ช่วยกันผ่านด่านไปด้วยกัน แต่ถ้ามาเล่นคนเดียวจากความรู้สึกส่วนตัวจะรู้สึกยากมากเพราะเราต้องทำทุกอย่างเองคนเดียวซึ่งจะลำบากมาก เพราะฉะนั้นคิดว่าเกมนี้หาเพื่อนมาเล่นด้วยน่าจะดีกว่า

"
15545,good
15546,"verey good
"
15547,Love it!
15548,The way this game uses physics based puzzles and if your smart enough there are a lot of ways to solve those puzzles. I recommend!
15549,HA-HA-HA It's the best game for group playing with friends.
15550,Epic game
15551,gud gaem
15552,"This game is super fun if you want to spend some time with your friends, but it also works if you are a hardcore player that likes a challenge. Personally, I think it demands quite some brain effort and patience if you want to go through the levels correctly, and the game has a wide window of opportunity for creativity with the character and levels customization/creation.
If you want to have fun (with your friends or not), this game will just do it. If you want a challenge, this game serves you too. If you want to be creative and inovate, you might find your place around here."
15553,IT IS THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER PLAYED AND I DO RECOMMEND YOU DO IT IN TEAMS OF 3 PLUS AS IT IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH WITH 2 PEOPLE OTHERWISE IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE CONTROLLING A VEEEEEEEEERRRY DRUNK PERSON WITH AND WITHOUT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS :DDDDDDDD
15554,good good
15555,NICE GAME
15556,good game
15557,this game is great when your board the maps are challenging but do able and if you finish those there are lots of great workshop ones
15558,"REALLY good the first time around, slowly dulls as you go on but frequent updates and the addition of new levels will pull you back in every time"
15559,fun to play 2 player local co-op. Works well. challenging game play.

So there are only good points here !"
15564,"Difficult Controls, Puzzle and with Friends.
Nice recipe. Go ahead and enjoy."
15565,very funny game to play with your gay friends
15566,Really funny and good game.
15567,Add more content. I love this game
15568,Fun game for couch multiplayer
15569,"This is a really fun game, It's not like any other games I've played!"
15570,"my favorite part is that your character is a walking ragdoll,  in other words he/she walks and acts like a drunk person XD"
15571,i fell :(
15572,This game it's very fun!
15573,Great goofy game with friends 10/10 would fall flat again
15574,Amazing game to play with friends. Always gives a good laugh and has customizable options! Great.
15575,its fun
15576,"i play this game very often, the only thing i dont like is on my pc it takes a long time to load in and when i press the w key the game responds to it 2 seconds later"
15577,this game dosen't run that good for macbook air but it's still a cool game
15578,"A great game indeed, though characters move around and act like retarded polio patients. 
One amazing thing about this game is that new episodes keep coming out so that friends can gather together to conquer new tasks from time to time. Also it allows freedom in designing body shapes and painting your own outfits. I'm a puppy-like figure and my bestie's a penguin (LOL. 
ohh btw it's not Mac-friendly and if you have to play it on Mac then be ready for the huge lag between pressing buttons and your character's finally responding to it."
15579,excelente para pasar un buen rato con los panas

15607,Very fun game to play solo or in CO-OP!
15608,yep
15609,It's pretty fun and stuff
15610,it's an requirement to have friends to play this game.
15611,10/10 if you have friend
15612,My brain goes fucky wocky
15613,Fun with friends
15614,"this game is the right definition of ""fun""
i play this game literally ""daily"" with my friends
but i cant actually play on multiplayer
i mean i can host a game but if i join someone else's server there is an delay of my actions
can i get the solution? i also tried port forwarding but it didn't help please give me the solution of this problem, steam
"
15615,"most fun game ive played in years, but only with friends."
15616,haha human go flop
15617,"The style is quite nice with the low poly graphics, large maps,helpful community and interesting climbing mechanics. Even with all that I found the game rather sickening with the ragdoll physics, so ill have to give this a negative review however it quite good otherwise."
15618,"Its an amazing Physics-Based game, and i have so much fun playing
"
15619,awooooooga humunahumunahumuna bazoinggggg

15626,"Hilarious with a friend or friends. If you aren't afraid to fail a few times, this game is amazingly fun."
15627,"this game is awesome i had it on xbox and then got it on steam for the steam workshop content and the one thing i want: an option to exclude all anime/ story ""levels"" i want something that makes me think but i cant do that when i have to filter through the anime/story levels. please add this feature i would really apreciate it"
15628,"overall great game, super duper fun with friends"
15629,good game and need to use brain :)
15630,"It's fun as heck, but you really need to play with friends to get the most of it.
The puzzles aren't insanely difficult and the levels are a pretty good length.
The controls are wonky but it's the point so it's pretty good.
Anyone that cares about achievements, they all work other than 1 christmas one that only...sometimes works lol
"
15631,Better with friends
15632,h
15633,Fun way to pass time with friends.
15634,it is the best
15635,YES!
15636,Amazing :3
15637,"Haha funni ragdoll.

The biggest problem i have with this game is that it really doesn't work with anything other than keyboard and mouse. A simple update to fix the controller problems would go a long way.

nonetheless, this game is thoroughly entertaining."

15641,it is a really fun rag doll game with loads of levels. you can play single player or multi player. in multi player there are lobbies with fun things to do.
15642,I could hardly solve the difficult problem.
15643,Such a funny and fun game with friends. With the ability of being able to download more levels makes it pretty cool in my book!
15644,i want more maps thats all
15645,"Incredibly fun game, especially with good friends"
15646,"funny game, needs more levels though"
15647,I love falling
15648,Its Alot Of Fun
15649,very fun game
15650,"Good idea, bad implementation. You might get a few moments joy and maybe even laugh, but most of the time you will be struggling with unresponsive and sloppy controls. Some puzzles/contraptions are nice, but far too often you will solve the same ""puzzle"" or do a routine work (hello to moving a box on a button or connecting wires to power sources). When you get to moving logs to make a bridge you will hate yourself. Game performance is also not great.

Save your time and money for better games."
15651,ITS VERY EPIC and funny :)
15652,if you like ragdoll phisics and puzzles and some multyplayer than this is a game for you
15653,fun.
15654,"nice.
"
15655,PORQUE SI Y ESO
15656,"like
"
15657,"A Masterpiece of physics and skill combined with the sweetness (or bitterness) of multiplayer. Navigating through each dream (level) was a pleasure, and new ones come out a lot on the game. and if you're done with all the official levels, there is a whole workshop to discover. feeling like you've done it all? throw your friend or friends off a cliff and start a fight. thanks to all the programming, there is much to be done. 100/5 stars."
15658,Great puzzle physics game
15659,nice game
15660,Hilarious game to play with friends
15661,It's Funny game and good for family
15662,Fun game to play with friends
15663,"It's not easy to get your 'physics degree' in this game, but once you're there, it's satisfying to accomplish the majority of the mini-tasks in the levels — unless you want to complete all levels on your own, and it will become a chore to play! The game is definitely meant to be played with friends, and as with a notice like: ""A controller is strongly recommended to play [game]"", there should be one here: ""A friend (or two) is strongly recommended to play Human: Fall Flat""; emphasizing friend here, because it seems common in this P2P-game for hosts to 1) be indifferent about their session settings, choosing options like public + join game in progress: enabled; 2) that, followed with an instant kick of the players who joined a game in progress ... (don't take it personally!)

8.5/10 — attraction to this game was stronger than my minimal motion sickness left after setting FOV + Smoothing to the max.
"
15664,good levels
15665,"It was fun as it lasted, you could play by yourself or with your friends, I would recommend this if you wouldn't get tired of it or bored of it."
15666,it is a good game
15667,its fun with friends
15668,this game is for really smart people which magoo isnt WeirdChamp but a bonus is that you get prime italian carbanara which ngl is quite yummy just like magoo thick stuff
15669,preeeeety nice
15670,An interesting game which has a lot of funny things to do!  I really like to climb to somewhere I have never reached :) although some challenge is difficult to achieve...

5/5 game to troll in"

15693,"They dropped support for linux. I used to be able to play multiplayer. Now it gives a very unhelpful message about version incompatibility even though it states the exact same versions are used on server and client.
Lame. Support linux or get a thumbs down."
15694,It makes me feel violated in real life.
15695,Lots of fun!
15696,its cool to play with friends (if you have tho)
15697,It's my favourite Human: Fall Flat Part.
15698,"I've had so many hours of fun in this game, solving the puzzles, speed running every level, learning the best shortcuts and how to scale walls... even getting in some wholesome hugs. I just love this game so much! Definitely worth the price."
15699,this is a very fun multiplayer game and is a  game i would recommend to people with a interest in a challenge.so overall it is a very good game.
15700,"Haven't played it for a very long time, or for very long at all, but it's probably good."
15701,"Great, Fun game

15725,"Fun game , some puzzle and great gameplay , playing solo its fine but yeah its better to play with friends :) , and one more going 100% achievement on this game its really worthy and great experience :))"
15726,"I purchased this game for my little brother and I to some time. But it did more than kill a couple hours, it gave us lots of laughs and memories. The maps are not limited to only developed maps, but workshop maps as well! This game is a lot more fun when playing with others. My little brother and I spent most of our time trying to figure out short cuts to complete the map faster; resulting in some very dumb moves such as spending over 10 minutes to climb a wall. I rate this game a solid 
10/10 in creativity
8/10 in fun (solo)
10/10 in fun with people
10/10 in money well spent"
15727,"It's a unique, and charmingly awkward game, that makes you think about your surroundings.  Enjoyed best with friends or online.  The online community is great, and makes for a fun time, even if you're playing with strangers, and there is always players to join.  Definitely worth the price of admission."

People kick you from lobbies for no apparent reason. Seems this community is rather silly. Why have your lobbies public if you don't want people to join?

15755,ITS FUN
15756,"Works well now on a better windows laptop great fun and despite not being up to trend anymore still provides plenty of laughs 
old review for mac:

I installed Human: Fall Flat on to my Mac computer being very hopeful and excited to have something to play through lockdown with my boyfriend. unfortunately, the game flat out did not work even after attempting numerous resets and reinstallations, and researching similar problems over the internet. My screen was either consistently black or in an almost corrupted image. I am very disappointed especially after seeing so many good reviews, thankfully i got a refund i'm just upset as i supposedly met all requirements to be able to run the game."
15757,op
15758,good
15759,"Human Fall Flat is a very good game in my opinion. You can play with your physical friends when they come over for a party if you have enough players. You can work out puzzles together, and even play online! The best feature I like is the chat feature that allows you to chat with people online while solving puzzles. You can learn a lot about the game just by talking to them!"

15762,"So far so good but has a bit of problem:
- Local: some maps is kind of hard and weird to proceed, some environment bugs where u can stuck somewhere between train, box and wall very often, have to restart to unstuck. Puzzle is a bit repetitive as well.
- Multi: not much people still in this game server, take a bit of time to find match."

Anyways the concept of the game is simple but allows for a lot of possibilities, and performing simple acts such as lifting a lever or navigating terrain can be entertaining, though I can imagine some would find it a little frustrating. My favorite part is the music. I'm about to go on a tangent, but I was expecting the music to be wacky and silly, because that's what the game is. But instead it alludes to the more poetic nature of the game about struggle, adversity, and triumph. It makes me want to engage in a new level with my head held high and see what happens. My only criticisms are the laggy online multiplayer and it looking like a very quick port from the Xbox version, but those didn't take away from my experience of the game, save for the multiplayer, but I think that may be more of a fault on my old computer than the game."
15776,Its so funny xD
15777,"You need a friend ""special"" like you and you can have a shit ton of fun"

15779,"A solid surmount-obstacles sort of game. The Jelly-like consistency of your avatar does make climbing over barrels, boards, carts, catapults etc. a little tricky, but most puzzles don't require too much effort. Take breaks if you find yourself getting increasingly irked."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, obtain a power plant. You can do this through numerous methods. Then you move to china and create an alibaba.com account. Now, research how much a power plant goes for on alibaba.com. Compare this to how much money you spent on your personal power plant. Now for the fun part, put your power plant up for sale on alibaba.com. You should sell it for a price that is high enough to make you a profit but low enough for someone to buy it.

15873,[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/477160/Human_Fall_Flat/]Human: Fall Flat[/url] is a great game with simple graphics and comes with many fun puzzles to solve (much better with friends). I promise that if you play this game with your friends you will laugh your ass off pushing each other off into the abyss. The controls are pretty easy to understand and the puzzles aren't [i]too[/i] hard to solve. I just wish there were more levels.

15916,"This game is misleading, human does not fall flat. Human does fall a lot, and human does walk on flat a lot, but human hardly ever falls flat. Human falls sideways, falls on humans knees, but never once in my playtime of this game has human fallen flat.  I get that no game is perfect but the fact that human does not fall flat is absolutely atrocious. The name human fall ""a lot"" would be more fitting, but falling flat does not give justice to the game."

It is impossible to run the game with a Keyboard&mouse (player 1) and controller (player 2 setup) and it seems the developer completely ignores the reported issue from players.

15969,"This game is very unique, innovative in terms of it's gameplay mechanics. Don't let the low poly graphics deceive you. I've played it for like three hours and I had so much fun with it, even on Single Player mode. 

I really recommend playing this with friends, since it is kinda frustrating when you had to do everything by yourself.

There's only one major issue I experienced with this game, and that is every time I launched the game, I had to minimise all other softwares that were running on my Desktop. Else I wouldn't be able to play the game, and it also freezes my cursor in the middle of the screen. I can't move my cursor until I pressed Alt + F4 which somehow made the game working again."

Sadly online play only makes sense to play workshop levels or if you want to help people solve puzzles you already solved or if you could care less about spoiling parts of puzzles you haven't done yet OR if you play with people who will actually try to solve it. I've had a lot of people who just want to hang out or they keep skipping levels over and over before you've made any good progress or if you finally got over an obstacle BAM new level smh

16132,"Tell me, how much fun can be taking your friend on a suicide jump with you? You don't know? Try this and you'll understand."
16133,"This game is like being drunk. Dizzy, can't have depth perception, the physics are slow and cumbersome, controls don't control the way I want them to. As an alcoholic, I have enough of that irl anyway. Don't recommend for people like me who easily get annoyed by increasingly abstract level design and inconsistent physics/controls."

16138,It is simply amazing. You can do whatever a human can do with its arms. But with the difference that it is much more stupid and funny. I really recommend to get it to play with your friends.

Edit: Custom levels on steam workshop are some of the most absurdly surreal things i've ever seen in a video game. Roblox doesn't hold a candle to this."
16141,Good Game Very Funny To Play With Friends.

16143,very physic yonks
16144,good game for the the price
16145,ntabs
16146,"Hilarious fun, best played with a few friends who aren't afraid to get stupid. The physics is absurd but consistent, meaning that you can learn to play it 'well' but still get to laugh and cry at how utterly silly the whole thing is. Wonderful little bits of narration at the beginning and end, and so many variations in the puzzles and mechanics! Amazing game that can be completed pretty quickly, but you'll want to replay it all over and over to find all the little secrets and all the different ways to do things. Loved it!"

16157,bit buggy but good fun
16158,This is the best game I have ever played! Must be tried!
16159,"It's not easy to get your 'physics degree' in this game, but once you're there, it's satisfying to accomplish the majority of the mini-tasks in the levels — unless you want to complete all levels on your own, and it will become a chore to play! The game is definitely meant to be played with friends, and as with a notice like: [i]""A controller is strongly recommended to play [game]""[/i], there should be one here: [i]""A [b]friend[/b] (or two) is strongly recommended to play Human: Fall Flat""[/i]; emphasizing [i]friend[/i] here, because it seems common in this P2P-game for hosts to 1) be indifferent about their session settings, choosing options like [i]public[/i] + [i]join game in progress: enabled[/i]; 2) that, followed with an instant kick of the players who joined a game in progress ... (don't take it personally!)

8.5/10 — attraction to this game was stronger than my minimal motion sickness left after setting [i]FOV[/i] + [i]Smoothing[/i] to the max."
16160,Nice
16161,Very entertaining game and being split screen compatible my wife and I can sit together and play for hours.  We're laughed to tears at times and nearly thrown the equipment across the room at others.  But all n' all A very fun game.

16202,If you plan to play this game alone. You probably should just refund it.
16203,sas
16204,"Game with a lot of potential with great levels, but still hell of a buggy. Servers really bad. And controlls are weird. Response rate could be faster a bit.
Not playable if you don't have friends to play with, because you will end with some random guys who are not really into doing stuff you really need to do, and playing solo is ultra boring.
Still would recommend, but only if you buy it on a sale.

Played this religiously until we beat all the levels. Twas fun. Ran at 1080p, locked at 60 FPS on my laptop (i5-8250U, 8GB RAM, Intel UHD-620) and was an enjoyable experience.

There's not really much to say...80/100. I do not regret buying this."
16267,Absolutely great game for some random fun with a group of friends
16268,The remote play makes this game worth it. I was playing with my little  brother and holy shit did we die laughing at us just wrestling each other off the cliff for the first thirty minutes before we even went through the sliding door and got it stuck.

16325,Thumbs up!
16326,really good
16327,"ITS SUPER FUN
"
16328,"I'm sure some people will like this game, so take my review with a grain of salt - but it's not for me. This title is in a class of games that I describe as ""fairly simple puzzles that require extraordinary effort to solve due to purposely poor controls masquerading as 'physics' ""

Other examples of this genre: Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, Octodad, and QWOP.

I find these games 20% clever, 10% funny, and 90% frustrating as you fight with the controls just to get the guy to do the thing. Yes, I'm aware of the bad math - I'm making a point.

If that’s what you’re looking for, then this isn’t the worst iteration and you might give it a try."
16329,"This game is still great, way better on pc than it is on console. 10/10 would recommend to play with friends."
16330,Garbage
16331,very good !
16332,"This game requires patience and ingenuity to solve puzzles in clever ways. Using simple controls you must work with the laws of physics to reach doorways, activating switches and pushing things around to reach that goal one way or another in a free world 3d platform. There's no clock or external pressure, just a nice sound track that gets louder and more optimistic as you get closer to reaching solutions, but you must learn how to do things largely for yourself. Good news is there seem to be several ways of getting from point a to b, and there are little hint boxes you can find if you're stuck. I love how freely you can manipulate the space and how creative you have to try to be to complete the levels! Thoroughly engaging and fun for anyone who is a dedicated problem solver."
16333,"Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, you should buy it. If you are not sure you'll like it, wait for a sale. Like right now it's on sale. Go get it. What are you still doing here?"
16334,Best game evar!!!
16335,Probably one of the most hilarious games I've ever played.
16336,"Very good game, completed almost the entire game and I'm sad because it is so good but I will play it again. :) 100% would reccomend."
16337,"It is a really fun game, but there are somethings I dislike. It gets boring after a while and the servers lag when I play with my friends."
16338,Good
16339,"Fab puzzle game, trying to figure out how to use the quirky but consistent physics and awkward controls to get to end of levels. Tons of content, and still more via workshop etc."
16340,"I liked it for the most part, but if you get angry easily then this game isn't for you. The noodle arms and the constant passing out of your character make it annoying to get anything done."
16341,veri fan geim
16342,Awesome multiplayer game. I won't recommend it for single player. only for couch co-op and online. you will have a blast with your friends. Controls are tricky for the first 10 minutes. after that you will get used to and game will become extremely entertaining to play.

16358,good
16359,Great game to play with friends. Funny and absurd in good way :)
16360,"Despite not playing this game much, I still enjoy playing it when I do, It's one of those games that certainly gets you thinking with each map. (And the achievements also give you more things to do in each map than to just get to the end of each of them as well.) I of course recommend this game to those who do want a challenge of sorts, given the game certainly isn't very easy, but it's still definitely challenging in an interesting way. Those of you looking for a puzzle game of sorts to play with your friends? This is probably an option for you as well. For those of you expecting this, finding it without having watched any videos on it, to be a simple game. You'd be wrong for the most part. I'd suggest watching videos of the game first before actually deciding to play this game. Just so you understand what your getting into.
Either way, I recommend this game to all who wanna try this for a challenge. It does certainly have some fun moments, especially when playing with friends."
16361,"Everything about this game from start to finish is not only fun but extremely immersing. I've never felt so connected to such a goofy game, but somehow all the mechanics, the story, the levels just added up and built to a jaw dropping, goosebump inducing finale. Love this game."

16446,seems like an interesting game but I had to refund since the field of vision on local co-op made my girlfriend sick after one level.
16447,"[h1] Human: Fall Flat [/h1]

[b] A Fun And Hilarious Co-op Experience, But One That Is Pretty Short And Repetitive [/b]

[b] Human: Fall Flat [/b] is a funny, physics-based puzzle platformer that supports up to eight player Co-op. The goal of each map is to overcome a series of physics challenges in order to reach the exit, and there are multiple possible paths that players can take throughout their journey. The core gameplay loop is pretty fun, but the game can get repetitive, with many puzzles being easily abused with shortcuts. Additionally, the game has a decent bit of additional content, but many of the workshop maps play similarly to the base game, at times coming off as amateurish. This game has a definite charm, although it starts to wear a bit thin by its final few levels.

The puzzles are interesting enough at times, with some revolving around catapulting oneself over a castle's walls and surfing down giant water slides. The physics are wonky and wacky, adding in many moments of fun, but at the same time being frustrating to control. Oftentimes, your player will not be able to hold/place certain items correctly, and trying to replicate actions takes a bit of time and leads to annoyance. Its fun for an hour or two, but my friend and I had to take breaks from the game due to frustration with the controls and mechanics.

I do like the way physics lends itself to puzzles at times though. There were genuine moments of laughter and intrigue when faced with certain puzzles. I just wish there was an easier way to fine tune what exactly you want your character to grab, since aiming with both arms doesn't quite cut it for certain actions. Also, some puzzles were presented in an interesting way, but there were areas around them that allowed for us to pass through these locations. At times it felt cool and rewarded exploration, but at the same time it felt like we were finding ways to avoid the challenges presented to us. I think that some of these easier jumps and shortcuts could have been found and cut out from levels in order to have players focus on the tasks at hand rather than way to avoid participating in the game's mechanics.

I think this game should definitely be played in Co-op, as Solo play was much too boring to go through. The cooperative struggle to find unique ways around puzzles is where this game shines, and playing Solo takes much of that feeling away. Its still playable, and its still cool that the mode wasn't stripped away from the game, but it should only be played if you don't have any friends and if you are really intrigued to see what this game is about.

The music is alright, with nothing really particularly striking or memorable. The same goes for the sound effects, which are pretty minor and basic throughout the game. I also wish the graphics were a bit more interesting to look at, since the textures and levels blended together to look a bit too similar at times. Color variation could've helped, and some workshop levels play with this aspect, but it comes off a bit dry over an extended period of time with this game.

I think this game shines as something to partake in to relax for about an hour and goof off with some friends. Extended play sessions seem to burn through the games mechanics too quickly, and while the game is very simple to play, its interesting concepts suffer from a lack of in-depth controls as well. There just aren't really enough creative scenarios available that give the player that ""let me play just one more hour"" type of itch. The game does a fine job at what it aims to do, which is provide a funny and interactive Co-op experience, but it doesn't shake things up compared to many other puzzle games. I can [b] Recommend [/b] if you want a physics-based Co-op experience to play with your friends between sessions of other games, and there is workshop support meaning that levels will still continue to trickle in here and there from time to time!

[h2] Final Verdict: 6/10 (Above Average) [/h2]

This game is the definition of ""get together with the boys, and have some fun"" if you are looking to have fun this is where you should go, but if your here for storyline your out of luck.

16645,"Absolutely amazing. It's been a long time I've had so much fun with a game. 
I've spend lots of time just throwing my friends of the map for fun or just screwing around the map completely skipping puzzles.

The controls are easy to learn, but will always be shit. Don't see it as a bad thing: it leads to fun and hilarious moments for you and your friends. 

The puzzles are relatively straight forward, but the challenge is controlling your little guy anyway. Every map has some things to explore, so they are somewhat replayable.

It looks absolutely adorable and cartoonish, which fits the goofy nature of the game.

Above all else: the OST is beautiful. It's honestly one of the best soundtracks I've heard in videogames.

This game is one of the best I've ever played. I suggest you play it with friends though, the more the merrier. Some puzzles would be really hard without some people to help you."

16678,"Fun game. Got some great laughs with my friends.
The physic in this game is kinda goofy but that makes the charme of it.

The movement gets fun quick, as you are introduced to new ingame mechanics (pulling yourself up etc).
Especially when you do the ""superman"" move all the time, even when there is no edge available.

16709,"as far as competitive shooter's go, this one is my favorite. 6v6 with 3 roles: Damage, Tank, and Support. I prefer to play damage and thankfully Levi and some of the other boys like to heal me. I like to tank as well but I can only play Sigma or Orisa so it can be tricky for the fellas. 10/10 but needs new maps. I am excited for the PVE release this year but hoping it does not take away from the vibrant competitive landscape that this game already offers."

This game is pretty good and unique and i recommend it, This game is fun with friends and the puzzles make you go brain dead so much that you start collecting rocks and creating fires. It kills your brain cells so much that you become so smart and instead of using your brain power to complete the puzzles.

You cheat and skip them"

16781,"this game is insane , try it with ur frindes"
16782,"- Clunky controls - simulates well the state of intoxication, especially in multiplayer with higher pings.
- Clunky controls - often leads to hilarity, but sometimes frustration.
- Puzzles usually easy to figure out, but often difficult to execute - too much platforming and precision jumping to my taste.
- Enjoyable surreal, dreamy atmosphere. Funny animations.
- Great co-op game, but probably boring in single player.

16783,Cool!
16784,Found a guy named doru on this now me and him practice anal sex
16785,"An excellent game at a decent price, me and my friend have played all of the levels and they are all amazing. There are a few bug but normally they are a laugh and move on kinda thing, nothing to game breaking. Dont play solo that is super sad. 9.8/10"
16786,haha very funy i play with firend's and very fun the game lol . it is like the plaeyrs have no bones lol top 10 game off the year! (i think)
16787,"This game is so silly, and fun, a great game to play with your friends. 7/10"
16788,Play-doh was never so much fun! Must buy again.
16789,"I did not enjoy this game and eventually gave up at the halfway point. Not because it is an inherently BAD game, it's a good game, but there are some aspects of it that make it, in my opinion, more frustrating than it's worth. 

PROS: Huge variety of achievements for a game of its size, which will have you coming back to play it multiple times
Environments are very clean-looking and fun to explore 
Music is good when it's present (see below) 
Customizing your character is really fun 
Every level is themed differently 

CONS 
You have to control each arm individually, and click to grab things. However, there is no priority given to objects that are important to grab (a lever, a door handle, a box) versus the floor or a wall. For some people this is part of the fun, but after the tenth time I tried to pull a lever and couldn't because my hand had suctioned to the wall instead, I was fed up. 
You control your arms by moving the camera around. This is fine at first, until you get to the parkour-like sections of something like level six. You have to raise both arms over your head (thus moving the camera into a position where it's looking up at your head from the ground), run, jump, and grab something else. This is extremely difficult when you're forced into a camera angle where you can barely see your feet.
There is good music, but it's only around for a short while in each level and then disappears. It also doesn't match the tone. I expected the game to start giving me meaningful messages about life, because it sounded like something out of a thoughtful documentary.
By far the most frustrating part is that, when you respawn by falling back into the world, you can't get up right away. I feel like a game like this should have you up immediately because it's just so frustrating, but you have to watch your little guy lay there a bit. 

Honestly, I'll probably keep playing because I want those achievements and I want to finish it (since I paid money for it, lol). But it's out of determination, not a sense of fun. I did not have fun while I was playing this game. That may be okay for some people, but it was not for me."
16790,iz gouda game
16791,"This is a great game. The puzzles are challenging but fun. I love how I am given absolute freedom to do whatever I want. I can do the puzzles, or not do the puzzles, and still progress through the levels. I can go where ever I want to go with enough time and curiosity. There is so much to explore in each level. I really like how I can skip parts of every level by just exploring. 
The way the character bends like a rag doll can be fun some times and frustrating other times. It is interesting to see what objects my character just won't grab onto."
16792,"ppeeee
"
16793,Uppy
16794,Its really addicting!
16795,pretty cool
16796,its a great game. made me rage multiple times. there is no story so that part falls flat but its a good time killer/ puzzle
16797,good and big funny with friends
16798,it's fun but the sensitivity is low at first. otherwise its awsome
16799,"This game is truly amazing. I loved playing every moment of the main levels, and then replaying them again and again to get every single achievement in this game. Honestly, this game can be a little tough to get the hang of but once you get the hang of it, you will fall in love. And the game doesn't end when you beat the main levels, you can go onto the steam workshop and download countless more levels. The game is still being updated with new levels at the time of posting this, and I think they will stop improving and adding more to this wonderful game."
16800,"This is a very silly game.  I don't say that because of the controls or the gameplay.  Okay maybe the gameplay.  But it's fun to play online and create your own character while you hop and walk around maps.  I did finish the game on the switch but I thought I was missing something.  So I got it on steam, great decision.  I got alot more game play than on the switch.  I hope you like the game as much as I do."
16801,very fun to play with friends
16802,Fun and enjoyable coop game.
16803,this game is very fun specially with friends and even better when someone wants to speedrun the game and then there are like 3 people trying to slow yo down or just being anoying to eachother I really like this game but i'm pretty sure I  have lost friendships because of this but that doesnt matter cause I  had fun and they didn't

16820,"This game has some amazing functionality paired with a cool concept of collaboration. The game (when it works) has been pretty fun to go thru, specially along with friends makes for some enjoyable moments. This sadly is not always true when playing online, more often than not the game provides a poor connection to the servers, random glitches such as invisible floor, no skin applied, pink skies, and getting stuck in the middle of objects. I really wished that the online functionality worked better. Overall good game."

16843,This game is one of the most fun games I've played with my friends. The wacky controls add to the games comedy. It is worth the money and I would buy it again in a heart beat.

16862,"What can I say, I love piloting a sack of potatoes across obstacles. This is a fun little climbing/obstacle/puzzle game where you are a lumpy, unwieldy, blob who must get to the end of a set of challenges. It can be both challenging and silly, and is a ton of fun to play with friends (there is also online play if you want to meet new people). There are a lot of customizable options for character skins and tons of workshop content for new levels and other fun bits. If you like jumping puzzles or obbys, this is the game for you."

16896,"Human: Fall Flat is a Playable character in a world of NPCs. When you've been playing games your entire life it becomes difficult to find the excitement you had gaming in your youth. Why? Games become stale when you've played hundreds of them. You've seen it all and realize most games are just carbon copies of ideas made by developers long ago or they're just a re-skinned triple A cardboard cut out that repeats annually. The first time I saw Human: Fall Flat was on a twitch stream of two Korean friends hysterically laughing as they fumbled around trying to complete a level. While watching I had the thought ""the physics of this game would probably allow you to climb anything.""  I bought HFF and sure enough you could climb everything. A fact many didn't realize as I had the 2nd video uploaded to youtube ever showing this. https://youtu.be/XNx-NvgyuNc I wasn't the only one as a youtuber named Igor had uploaded a video of climbing just two days prior to my own. https://youtu.be/KO6bNAjwPzc Two different and separate people came to the same realization about a maybe unintended mechanic of a massively popular game. That's the unique beauty of Human: Fall Flat, even before you play it, it sparks your imagination and makes you wonder what is possible. There's no game like HFF other than cheap knock offs that tried and failed to copy it. If you're still on the fence let me provide the side cutter. Human: Fall Flat is one of the best games I've ever played, you can easily spend 100 hours playing it and after that you can learn how to climb and forget what day it is trying to climb to the top of one of those trees on the christmas map. Did I mention you can make your own levels?"

         >>Simple yet great concept use just movement keys and a mouse, so literally no pro noob difference.
         >>Very vast and  ever expanding mod community made levels,maps,characters,skins,etc.
         >>easy to be a modder too.
         >>Funny with mystery,horror,race,sports,arcade,speedrun,etc level types support.
         >>Instant start in a lobby.
         >>Runs on potato devices too, so great multiplayer experience for friends without benefits too.
         >>Nobody would give a shit to cheating/hack/exploits in such an enjoyable and simple game.
         >>Kills boredom (only Multiplayer).
Cons: >>Price seems a bit unreasonable compared to other products pricing ideology, but the sale price is 
              okay(that should be the base price).
          >>Again, very limited official content for the price, there should be at least 80-100 hours of official 
              levels coz mods are community made and may give issues,glitches,etc.
          >>Modding system needs optimizations, coz sometimes when you join someone's custom level lobby, 
               the props are passthrough and illusive( happens one out of 8 times approx.)
          >>Dont hope to enjoy single player. SERIOUSLY!
          >>The modding community is dominated by Chinese (or whatever the stroke language written on 80% 
              of good mods) which is bad because Chinese people exist in a community/world of others plus 
              imposing their own language and culture everywhere they go. Its like if I (being Indian drive on right 
              side norms), go to some LHS driving country and still drive on the right(wrong side) just by an 
              excuse of silly patriotism.

16961,"Hello everyone!

Human: Fall Flat or HFF for short is a very unique game. You should give this game try.
The puzzles are not that hard to understand but the absurd controls of the game makes it a little bit more harder to do.
all puzzles have multiple solutions or even shortcuts that help you a lot when you understand the controls its not that hard.
Also you should check the community made maps for this game with your friends. Its just so dumb and funny
Also also try to complete achievements they show you a lot of secret places and they are very fun to do.

17028,"It was a very love/hate relationship for me with this game. I mean, the puzzles are super fun but the game mechanics is soo crapy it drove me crazy. I guess for a lot of people that's very funny (or if you play with friends), but to me it was very annoying. But still fun. In a (very) masochistic way.  I'm very happy I managed to solve most of the puzzles on my own. Especially the final one, lol. I guess the idea is not to give up but instead to think and explore. And to learn to enjoy it. But yeat, at times (so many times) I was soo willing to give up. Particularly on the Aztec level (and also on the parcour part of the Water level). But I didn't and I finished it and I'm very happy.  In a bit sore way :)"

17044,"Aka Play-doh Man Climbs a Wall.

A fun physics-based platformer puzzler that if you get bored with it's occasionally dumb puzzles lets you say 'F**k it' and climb the wall instead of opening the door. 

Worth it for the goofs you can do with friends, but the puzzles are memorable enough I'm not sure about it's replayability."
17045,Great and hilarious fun with friends.

17047,its very nice and gay
17048,"saw so many youtubers play it, at first i thought the game was not for me and that you need friends in order to play it. i was sorely mistaken and i am having a blast playing it in single player."
17049,fun to play with friends! also the characters are floppy!

17076,"Frustrating, tiring, and confusing at the same time, fun, quirky, and surprising. That's pretty much my experience playing this game. Some levels have alternative solutions and shortcuts. You can mostly find them used by speedrunners but I suggest you discover them yourself since it's part of the fun of playing this kind of game. One thing that bugs me is the music used by the game. It's not bad, but sometimes the music playing doesn't match the atmosphere of the area. I usually just turn off the music and play my spotify playlist or something."

17078,"Not had this much fun with a game for a while, play with friends (if you have any) highly recommended <3"
17079,"very good apart from the chainsaw physics
.
"
17080,"Good game to ease up your mind after playing some fast paced games. It'll be even better if you play this with your friend, and see each other screwing around :)"
17081,"I can't tell if there is any real logic in what you do in this game… There is no story. There are just multiple levels that you try to “beat” with horrible mechanics.

You sometimes just want to punch the character that you play, because he is to stupid to hold or move any objects. But that’s the fun part of this game!

It may be challenging sometimes but finishing the level feels like a great reward.

I personally finished all the levels that the developers created, and I tried out some workshop maps. There is plenty of content and it will keep you busy for a couple of hours.

PS: I played this game with a friend. I guess you could play it singleplayer too, but it is probably easier and more fun with someone else (just a guess, as I said, I never played it alone).

17082,Really funny with friends

17113,"Great game! Physics are wacky and fun but controls can be frustrating since turning your camera makes your guy walk a bit. So in essence, you could walk off a platform without touch WASD and just moving the camera. Other than that, levels are awesome, community levels are amazingly creative, check ratings for good levels to download.
9/10"
17114,game gets boring after 4 or maybe 5 levels. game tries to keep you entertained by adding new features but they all fail.

17139,"Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious, entertaining, and straight up wacky game. And it's great... for the first 3 hours. We'll get to that later. For now, let's talk about the pros.

            The physics in this game are hilarious. You can grab your friend and throw them off the map. Only for them to grab the ledge and now you're both hanging off the map!(I really recommend playing this game with a friend). 
             The movement itself is something to behold. You’re constantly wobbling and flopping around everywhere. When your character moves a switch, they’re moving their entire body and it’s hilarious. The goofy physics are so well done that it is able to differentiate itself from other puzzle platformers.

	    So how do the puzzles mesh up with physics? Well really well for the first ⅔ of the game. The puzzles aren’t too long. They feel the perfect length, and they all introduce a new type of puzzle. 	
The pacing feels perfect for these first ⅔. It always feels like there’s something happening, and that combined with the constant goofiness of playing with a friend makes the game a joy to play. But it’s time to talk about the big things holding this game back.

	There are a lot of things this game tries to do that just doesn’t work. This game has sections of precise platforming. And it just doesn't work in the 3D environment combined with the ragdoll physics. And it can be pretty frustrating. 
         Also, while the first ⅔ of the game have nice pacing and short and sweet levels, I can’t say the same for the later levels. They are too long and very tedious with pretty boring mechanics. For example, in one of the levels you are tasked with putting coal on a conveyor to go into a truck. You then drive the truck on a pretty long road. Then light the coal burners, and put the coal in it. Tell me that’s fun. It’s not. I just can’t see how this made it into the game. It’s boring, tedious, and just not fun.

         In Conclusion, I think this game has a great ⅔ and very lackluster last 3rd. With some very bad puzzle design in my opinion. So much so that I didn’t even finish the game because there was no point in wasting my time in something that wasn’t fun. (Also my game crashed at the very, very end of the level, after spending 30 minutes on that level. lol). I still recommend this game for the exceptional first ⅔. Maybe wait for a sale. But hey, you might disagree with me. Thanks for reading my review.

EDIT: I went back and finished the game and while I do stand by my opinion I do think so of the later levels are better."
17140,"I seldom write games review. but i have to say this game is a MUST HAVE if you have kids! or friends (they are the same thing)
My 6 yo daughter asks me to buy this game to play with her after watching her teenage brother play online. Best decision on my steam account. 
The controls are a bit frustrated at first. but no overly so, get a bit time to get use to it you are all good. We have many hours of fun. My little girl enjoys dressing up her character, custom paint it and make our characters look like twins. She even gives me advise on how to play. When I was out grocery shopping she can play with her brother and won't be missing me.
Custom map from the workshop has so many added value to the game too!
The music is a masterpiece. First i saw the bundle to buy both game and OST i thought ""why people would buy soundtrack of a silly game?"" I was so surprise when I play the first time and instantly regret i didn't buy the bundle. 
I can imagine many years after, listening to the soundtrack and tell my daughter ""remember when you were a little girl you used to play with mom on this game? we were so silly and it was so fun...."""
17141,SO FUN
17142,"Extremely unique game that is immensely fun to play with friends! We've all asked ourselves that age old question,"" What would I do if I was a drunk Pillsbury Doughboy working with heavy machinery and completely puzzles?"" Well now you don't have to!"
17143,wonderful game no matter yourself or with friends!

17178,"one of the funniest games ever , dont play alone and play with friends."
17179,"Human Fall Flat is pain. But a good type of pain. A pain that you want to experience more of. It's like that type of pain when.  The greatest enemy is your own floppy legs, and your willingness to go on, as you struggle through the levels, wondering where you went wrong."
17180,"Play alone, kind of boring. Play with others, hilarious!"
17181,nice game play with frends
17182,"Want a fun game to play with your friends? get this. Played it til 4 am just to finish the puzzle while messing around.

I found out that there's a delay input when I connected to my friend but it doesn't spoil the fun.

Mess around, pull your friends out of the world, and finally, finish the puzzle. Great game"
17183,The game is innovative and extremely fun. Puzzles are creative and the learning curve is just right. Incredibly entertaining with a bunch of friends!
17184,"The physics are good and there are some funny moments. Great with friends. People should try it.

+ Mod anything you want
+ Lots of customizable options
+ Great community

17253,"A very entertaining physics puzzle that allows you quite a bit of freedom to screw around with its many quirks. Its main premise (you control your character's arms) works very well and especially in multiplayer creates hilarious moments.
The main game is on the short side. It used to be only 6 areas long if I remember correctly, but even with the current amount you have to take things slow to get through it in more than about 15 hours. After that there's still Workshop levels to get through, but they're a hodgepodge of hidden gems and stinkers.
All in all, I would recommend it, but only when it's on sale."

17279,In three words: boring to death.
17280,"good, funny fun

"
17281,"It is a nice idea, but the levels are a bit bland and boring. There are large parts of the levels where you have to run/jump for extended periods of time; with nothing interactive or fun to fill it. Overall the game has a nice concept the the lack of features and interactivity make it a little boring and basic."
17282,"I love this game, It's an amazing family game!
"
17283,Fun to troll
17284,Here's my opinion: Really funny when you have friends. Pointless and frustrating without friends. They both still give out that accomplished feeling when you finish something or do something cool. Overall. Cool game.Still don't have friends though...
17285,"good to play with friends and with other too
"
17286,"Like the game

17308,Good but better with Friends
17309,I really like this game for how much you can just go anywhere and there's a lot of ways you can skip certain parts of levels and it feels very rewarding.
17310,yes
17311,Nice game
17312,funny haha made me laugh
17313,good.
17314,so funny
17315,A fun game that can be played in a serious and fun way. I would suggest only getting if you have friends that play it though because it gets old without people you know.
17316,This is probably one of the funniest games I've ever played with friends and we definitely had a good time

However, there is cons i always facing which is whenever i launch the game, it always updated with same thing like every single day. I don't get why I need to update every single day."

17391,"[h1] Falling in the dreams [/h1]
  The first time I took control of Bob, I staggered carelessly, like a drunk. His hands were both sticky, his walking steps sound was lovely, and he jumped like an inflatable balloon swaying in the wind.
  Bob walks out of his dream by constantly solving mysterious.
  With background music and background vioces,you could play the game slowly and enjoy the different ways out of each fantastic dream. There is no perfect answer to each dream. There may have some shortcuts in many places, which makes the game much more interesting.
  Many of the items in the achievement system are difficult to achieve and many are hard to find. For example, it's easy to get lost when collecting gems in the 'mountains' level. And if you want to stand on the snowman hat at the 'Christmas' level, you need to have a strong climbing ability. From my perspective, the most difficult achievement is time-limited achievement. It takes a race against time to connect the cable in 35 seconds. This really takes patience to try again and again.
  The creative workshop is really worth seeing and fansinating. Many players have created beautiful and fun maps for everyone to subscribe to, and Bob's clothes can be various. Because it's a dream, it's up to you. To create infinite possibilities.
[code] It seems that falling will never end, but the dreams will finally have a time to wake up. The end of 'Human:Fall Flat', also the time you should wake up. Reality is something which with more mysterious than this game we have to face.[/code]"
17392, Play with friends + have a good time = profit
17393,The devs are encouraging more workshop maps with prize money which makes the content endless and incredibly fun
17394,ziauriai zjbs
17395,يبلب
17396,its funny to play with friends but if you paly by yourself its kinda lonley
17397,it very good
17398,im not playing on my computer and i love it (playstation)
17399,"really good game if you wanna chill with your friends or randoms  and have a good laugh XD ,"
17400,Its good
17401,"The game feels cheap with very basic visuals, poor audio, clunky gameplay, and the objectives are easily exploited. By the time you get used to the gimmicky physics you're probably bored of it. The only saving grace is having a laugh with friends at how silly it is, but you could probably save the £11.99 by just watching some bad meme videos together on YouTube for free and get the same result.

I wouldn't recommend it even if it was on sale, beyond a couple of hours there's little to no longevity to it."
17402,haha funny man go grab grab
17403,i like game
17404,lol
17405,sgnfdsfghm
17406,HILARIOUS.

17409,"its a cool game, you have a great time playing it. gets kinda boring if you complete the default levels but yeah dope"
17410,"LOVE THIS GAME. I bought it for me and 2 fiends on PC, and another copy on xbox"
17411,iz koolaid
17412,yeah
17413,nice game
17414,"when human fal flat game
i was a t home eating dorite chip
then man call me and say human fall flat out
i say no way"
17415,It's stupidly funny
17416,"H:FF is a really difficult game to describe, but I really don't want you to watch the videos of it, because it is so much better to go in without knowing any hints.  The developers call it a physics puzzler, and that's a pretty good place to start. You control a gummy little character that walks like a drunken toddler and has amazing sticky-hands.  Your arms -- both of them at the same time -- point where you look, and your triggers stick and unstick your hands.  Oh, and you have a jump button. But that's pretty much it. The controls are, naturally, kind of terrible, and that's the point. Everything else emerges from that in a way that is eerily effective.  It starts out being really difficult to mantle over obstacles, and the game is oddly sparse with obvious help. But, in the first level, you're actually being taken along a training run that is a study in how subtle a tutorial can be.  Between that tutorial, a physics engine with a ton of slop, and some level design that is really forgiving of, shall we say 'creative solutions', you'll soon be completely unaware of the game.  You'll enter a zombie zen sort of space where you're just waddling across yet another chubby fantasy world and enjoying the hell out of it.

Two of us have put in more than eight hours over less than two days in split-screen, and we still can't seem to find the end of this game! I call it 'cooperative', but the game might actually be possible to play single-player.  It wouldn't be nearly as fun, of course. I'd love to try it with the 8-character online play!

The game is not without its drawbacks, of course. The game's antagonist is, as is typical in physics games, the controls and the camera. The controls are, again, terrible. I came away from hours of gaming with controller-claw. The camera thinks it knows where you want to be looking, and is often *quite* wrong.  Since your camera is unavoidably connected to control of your arms, bad camera translates into bad control of your flappy little appendages.

Still, and again, *that's kinda the point*.

I strongly recommend this game if you've got two controllers, at least one friend, and love couch-coop games."
17417,"my friend hold me like simba, i heppy"
17418,I really love this game. I recommend that you buy and play this game. It's so much fun.
17419,Just really funny and just an amazing game
17420,"This game is really enjoyable when played with friends!
"
17421,This game is very very fun!
17422,Human Fall Flat is a great game. It works playing solo or with friends online. The achievements make it so that even if you've finished all dreams there is still a reason to replay by doing these challenges or alternative routes. It's pretty fun to learn shortcuts and when playing with friends leave them behind.
17423,I found this to be  a game of mental gymnastics. It tested my patience and made me realize my coordination is not only lacking on the dancefloor. If it weren't for Captain Boat Dock and the twelve benadryl I took before my morning matcha I do not think I would have reached completion.
17424,goood
17425,"Quite a bit of fun in a group.  Solo, I would expect it to be less enjoyable."
17426,"It is intresting
"
17427,"A time filler that is all, nothing really of note. Good design."

17434,"The game really is a massive time killer and runs quite smooth on an entry-level rig. Gameplay is frustrating and often requires the use of a brain, a component few people have. Get it, it's great."
17435,IT IS SO AWESOME YOU CAN CONTROL THE GUY GREAT
17436,"Everything's fine until you watch videos of speedruns, it really make me feels like I'm a fking idiot all the time playing thí game :)))))"
17437,this game is very fun but after a while got quite boring but still was a very fun game.
17438,"I love it. It's a great game to play with friends. :)
"
17439,"I liked almost everything about it. All of the mechanics are great and it is very fun to play in multiplayer with your friends. The only thing that is a problem, is the price. $15 is a good amount of money, but it's still an awesome game that I would recommend."
17440,Fun
17441,one of the funniest co-op experiences i've had
17442,good game cool with friends

17446,Very Fun
17447,"The game is fun as heck with friend ! need more levels, keep adding new levels !!"
17448,Fun puzzle game to play with your friends. Limited level so make sure to check out the workshop to subscribe for more challenges.  Your character is so wobbly that you might have problems play FPS game later on.
17449,"So much fun! Great to play during a sesh. Online is funny AF. Controls are tricky to get used to at first, but once you get the hang of it it's great."
17450,very good game would reccomend
17451,did I get this game for free?
17452,"Hilarious and very satisfying to play with a friend.

If you suck with controller like me, go the keyboard and mouse, so much easier."
17453,"This game is awful. It feels like there's nothing to accomplish, there's nothing defining what you should be doing. The controls are clunky and make this game even less fun."
17454,SO much fun especially to play with friends online! love it!
17455,Great to play with friends and have some good laughs. The extra maps are a plus. Even some of the bugs are fun sometimes lol
17456,yeet
17457,"uh-
good game i guess"
17458,The funniest controls ever! and a great way to play online with random sweet persons that help out to finish harder workshop levels :D

17475,Very fun game I throw my friends of a cliff and they hate it
17476,you can have lot of fun in this game
17477,"Challenging puzzles.  And yet, there's no risk in doing trial and error.  Although there is that small sense of vertigo when you fall, it's reduced by the feeling that its safe.  The human itself isn't very human. It struggles to jump, run and its muscles have been replaced with a bag of potatoes. Maybe it's an out of shape 200kg bundle of fat."
17478,"Awesome game! ultra fun and height graphic, kind of dead when your character is making any action which is very funny."
17479,A nice little funny game.
17480,Good Game
17481,"Human Fall Flat is super fun and it's even better with the steam workshop! You can do online, play with just yourself, or just mess around!
Probably the best puzzle-solving game I've ever played."

17484,"fun sht to play with frands :D

17486,I got motion sickness from playing this game. Never going to play it again.
17487,Good game and  very funny with friend
17488,"sooo much fun playing with friends. ragdolls are amazing, puzzle solving is fun. 10/10 worth the purchase if you want some laughs."
17489,Damn do I enjoy this. New maps are released so slowly and that is the main problem although v good game
17490,wow
17491,"Fantastic physics-based puzzle game (except for the infuriating water level). Its most outstanding quality is that every level, almost every puzzle, has multiple solutions. You can get creative and find original ways to get around an obstacle, when you fail to see the obvious solution that is right in front of your nose.

Playing with a friend in local co-op with split screen (or with others online) is of course great fun, and the cooperation to solve puzzles makes up for the shortcuts you can find when playing with someone else: instead of finding a way to put an object on a pressure plate, one of the players can just stand on it, and while the other player has passed the obstacle, the first one can jump off a cliff to respawn at the next checkpoint. Because of the multiple possibilities and solutions, the game definitely has some replay value, and it would make sense to play the game solo after completing in co-op, to figure out how to do it without someone else helping out.

The game's release date appears as July 22, 2016. There was a new main level added in November 2019, and an extra level (apparently a popular one from the workshop) added in March 2020, so I'll be on the lookout for new levels in the future."
17492,Insanely funny and very innovative game!
17493,Pretty fun and challenging at times. I play it with my 8 year old daughter and she loves it too.

17495,Great game!
17496,"Pro's: 
- Open-ended level design 
- Fun solo or CO-OP
- Ragdoll physics are refreshing but funny
- community maps add lots of value

- Sparse soundtrack 
- Basic colour scheme/art style

17501,"This is a fun game to play with friends, will you complete the level as quickly and efficiently as possible, or will it turn into pain and misery as each of you tries to sabotage the other when you try and use a swing, or trying to put something where it's supposed to go? Will you turn this game into Gang Beasts 2.0? It's all up to you and how much your friends can handle. A fun little game with a ton of maps to select from."
17502,Fun puzzles that require not just ingenuity to solve.  I was constantly struggling with my floppy body which caused no end of laughter!

17516,"Approx. 15 hrs to complete all puzzles - moderate levels, easy and funny control of the stupid formless character when you get used to it lol
Additional 20 hrs to get 100% achievements - for psychos like me, I would say three to four of them are hard, but doable

All roads lead to Rome. Just be crazy, be weird, be whatever! You will find endless possibilities in this game, which makes it worth playing multiple times either with friends or strangers. More players, more fun!"
17517,It's epic
17518,"95% of people I've recommended this game to have had a blast. It's dumb fun, intriguing puzzle-solving, up to 8-player co-op, yet somehow never feels too chaotic in spite of that. The control can be a little frustrating sometimes, but it's easy to work around once you've gotten the hang of it. 
The developers seem to continue releasing updates on their own still, not to mention the game has a very active workshop for user-made maps and characters! Curve Digital also, as of writing this review, are actively holding competitions with cash prizes for those who make the best workshop maps, which then get uploaded to the base game as 'Dreams'. There's literally no end to content here.
If you can get this game on sale, then great, but I honestly would hold no qualms paying the full asking price for a game that has entertained me way more than it ought to have. Get it, you won't regret it!"

17522,Extreme FUN and EXCITEMENT playing online with family members far away during the Corona Virus stay at home order April 2020.  Steam chat made it feel like we were all in the same room.  Such fun levels to this game with several ways of accomplishing the missions.   -- Some performance issues even on high end gaming PCs -- but still lots of fun!

17586,"It was absolutely hilarious, I love ragdoll physics, it's fun, challenging and humorous, the game lived up to the feedback of other players."
17587,"Singleplayer or Multiplayer?: I would say its best with Multiplayer/Your freinds but it can be played with strangers.

Worth It?: I bought it when it was on sale for 8,99€ i would say its worth it for that price in my opinion the normal price (15€) is a bit too much but its up to you.

Controller Or Keyboard: I havent tried it with controller but it easier to learn the controlls with keyboard.

Recommended?: Its up to you i would say i recommend it i like this game alot and it can be very fun especially with freinds and the community maps are very fun too."

"
17655,"ez gppd ga,e"
17656,"This game is fun with friends. I have something to suggest to the developers though. They should add a latency check and pings. Whenever you join an online server there is a chance that you would be lagging so hard to less and to none at all. Since you cannot check which country does the server is hosted to or what is the ping of the server, its impossible to find a perfect server with no lags at all."
17657,Great game to kill time! Better to play with friends and having fun!
17658,wqe
17659,"This is one of the best games i have ever played, you can meet great people and have a lot of fun even with random players. this game made me feel like im actually in the game and i was not distracted by the real world, i recommend this for people who want to have a lot of fun with friends or with random players, you can still play alone but the game is 100 times better with friends. this game is very good."

17676,"oh my GOD i cannot even cover all the bugs when trying to play with a few friends online, I would keep crashing, loading into invisible worlds with no texture and everybody floating, a random P2 would join and be phasing through walls when I only have mouse and keyboard connected, infinite connecting screens, my character stops responding and is stuck in place while people see a different version of my character and I become transparent. I've tried uninstalling, updating everything, all the troubleshooting steps for everything but I keep having problems."

17692,"Yes
"
17693,"This is perhaps the ultimate puzzle game! I love the fact that there are several different ways to finish each level, you don't just have to follow through how you are supposed to go. The game play is smooth, despite your bumbleling character, and the level designs are very fun!"
17694,"[h1] cant think of a person who'd not love this game [/h1]

The game puts you in the role of Bob, a man whose name is stupid as his looks are. Bob is a faceless, colorless, overweight man who has been assigned the task of escaping series of physics based puzzles in his stupid mysterious dreams.

If you had to choose someone to escape you’d probably want someone with agility, strength, and flexibility. you are lucky that Bob has none of these things, in fact Bob seems to lack many fundamental human attributes, like a sense of balance. in-fact bob is trying to maneuver your drunk dad."

17820,"This game was hilarious in multiplayer.  At first, the controls feel a little clunky and slow, but early on I realized it makes it more weighty and timing is important.  I played it with 3 other friends all the way through.  Trying to drag your flailing friend off the edge of a cliff, or hanging onto someone's foot while you're all swinging on a chain are pretty funny.  The game introduces complexity bit by bit and makes great use of its clever level design, sometimes providing alternate paths to beating each level.
Play through to the end credits too - there is a nice surprise!"

Also well done physics-based puzzles, very good skin customisation and makes for some of the funniest multiplayer gameplay possible when you're playing with friends. I'd definitely recommend"

17915,"VERY GOOD GAME 
FUNNY WHEN YOU PLAYED WITH FRIENDS"
17916,"Slightly flawed but tremendously creative game. If you enjoy puzzles (not exceedingly difficult), are relatively adept with controller (KB&M is easier in my opinion), and have a buddy with this game (or couch co-op!), I'd highly recommend this game.

+ Great physics. The best part about this game is how the objects react to you. Blocks have a good heft, levers work in an expected way, and even your plushy bounces with a cute squish. You can end up spending hours in this game just trying things out and seeing how the physics engine reacts. Seeing unexpected interactions or funny physics based goofs is when this game is at its best. Explore the levels, and learn how to move laterally across walls with just your hands, you can get into cool locations and skip parts of different puzzles.

- Frustrating controls. The main gripe I have with this game is that the controls are wonky. I'm not sure if there would have been a better way for them to design the controls, but I know that the way it exists in this game currently can be quite frustrating. Your character will wave their arms uselessly while trying to reach for ledges or other objects. If you need to grab an object and orient it in a specific way, get ready for an annoying couple minutes while you desperately try to position your hands on the object in such a way that you get the right leverage.

+ Plushy. Your character is so cute! The controls are frustrating, but that's somewhat offset by the fact that your plushy walks so cute and looks so stupid with it's hands sticking out. Your plushy will often get its hands stuck behind its own head, and you'll struggle to get it free (look down!), and while that's frustrating, you can't help but laugh because of how it looks like a dumb puppy chasing its own tail.

- Mediocre puzzles. I feel like they had to dumb down the puzzles a bit because as a player you'll spend most of your time just trying to maneuver yourself into the right position or move objects around. Many times I'll come into a room and figure out quickly how to solve it, but the rest of the time is spent trying to move the pieces into the right position. I'll admit that a couple times it threw me for a loop, as I assumed the solution, but then I realized the physics wouldn't work. I think if the controls were a bit less clunky (again, I don't know if this is even possible), they could have put in some more difficult puzzles.

+ Atmospheric music. The musical chirps in this game fit the theme perfectly, and when you enter a new section of the map, it will play a little tune, which changes throughout the game. I found myself really enjoying the music, and I actually wish there was more of it, as it's often quiet in a level while you're stumbling through a section.

+ Level design. Not the puzzles specifically, but the levels themselves have a lot of charm. There are two starkly different approaches to level design in this game, the first couple levels are in a sand box style level, and the last couple are set in interesting real-type environments. I wish there were more  of these ""real"" environments, but the sandbox styles maps aren't bad, they feel a lot like Portal"
17917,"One of the funniest and best games I've ever bought on Steam. Recommend playing with a bunch of friends, it gets way funnier"
17918,Much fun. Such derp. Many laughs. This is the kind of ragdoll-ish gameplay everyone needs. Puzzles where you and a group of friends join together to solve in hilarity fashoin.
17919,Worst game cuz I got no friends

17977,"It is a whole fucking fun mess, and pure chaos. 
*Beware*
Gameplay can cause destructive rage, and agitation.
The game is perfect for trolling with your friends, endless messing up, and pure stupidity. Make sure to prepare your hands for cramps, and sweat. The game is challenging, and puzzling, yet it is pure stupidity. Oddly satisfying to play, and weirdly fun. A perfect game to bond with friends.

I thought I would be ok, but the constant camera wobble made me sick in less than 30 minutes and I had to stop playing. I was sad because I really wanted to play. Hopefully there will be an update that lets folks turn that off if possible. If not this game is just going to sit in my library til the end of time now unused."

18023,"If you like puzzle games and crazy antics from your character, this game is so much fun that I can't really describe it properly. My first experience with the game was watching a friend play and get his head stuck in an elevator on Carry. I laughed until I cried watching him trying to wiggle free and shortly after got the game for myself.

Now, I haven't played it in a long time and just got back into it. It is even more addictive now than the last time around. So, if you have a thesis to write in order to earn that degree you've been fighting for the past two and a half years, don't play it just yet... or you'll waste most of your thesis time on the game instead because it's more fun and gives you instant rewards. Hey, I'm only human, okay!"

18103,"I saw the game was on sale and i was like ""Sure, why not i love Ragdoll games""
First i was trying to figure it out the controls, it was weird but i got used to it, i found a way to climb by swing around and grab
music is great but it feels empty after the music ends and just birds sounds.

The puzzles are creative and you that love being Lazy you can just jump around and ignore everything
my favorite levels were the Castle, Mansion and Snow, everything was fun, jump around, try to destroy everything and etc.

The ONLY complain is the Objects Glitch too much when doing Puzzles, they can hit with another object and EVERYTHING Fly around or Under the map.

The Final Result: YES YES AND YES, Fans of Ragdoll Games, this is a Fantastic game to play and screw with your friends.
8.5/10 I Had a Blast Playing this game and would play again in the future, i just wish the music didn't stop it feels awful without music"

18196,My first bought game above 10 euros. I don't think my payment was for nothing. I play this game with friends on my pc with keyboard+mouse and controller. Biggest fun I ever had with my friends (if we don't arguement what that other did wrong).

18202,"Great game with friends, absolutely recommended! This game set a bar for me and my friends. We tend to compare games now relative to this for the online experience. Mostly how close it came to being as much fun as Human Fall Flat!"
18203,cock
18204,I play it with friends. I jump and try to pull myself up by the edge. I'd rather pull myself up by my buddy's hair 10/10 would pull me up by my buddy's hair again

18211,"Awesome game, very quirky and fun to play with friends. Recommend to everyone!"
18212,"This game is amazing, only a few hours in but me and my friend are loving it! We kept trolling each other the entire time and it was a blast, some of the most laughs I had from a game in a long time! Can't wait till the next time we both get a chance to play. Great value too since I picked it up for %60 off, worth every penny. 

Though I can imagine it's not the same experience if you plan to play solo. I think it would still be worth if for sure as a fun simple puzzle/platformer. But if you have friends to add to the chaos just buy it, lol."
18213,fun to play
18214,Seeing my friends hump each-other as they try to climb up a wall is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

18229,"I play on Linux. The devs just removed Linux support after I bought it. Honestly, I don't think I can recommend it for that reason.

Anyway, my little brother in law love the game and I actually bought it because of him. If you can forgive their ethics and have some people who may enjoy playing it with you, it's probably worth it."

18274,i liked how you can make custom maps and play whith friends but they need to fix the maps that are 18+ content
18275,very good game
18276,"This game is not meant to be serious, the controls are intentionally wonky and it takes a lot of skill to not just fall off of everything. It's hilarious especially with 8 players in multiplayer all rag dolling around at once. There are lots of community made levels once you finish the campaign. There are lots of secrets and easter eggs in the campaign that you can play it over and over finding new things each time. Definitely not a singleplayer game or a simple platformer. It's more like gang beasts but with larger maps."

18287,"Fun physics based puzzle game. You can beat the levels how ever you want, get creative. If you want to play the ""intended way"" go ahead, or if you want to come up with a creative solution, go ahead. or if you want to use your grabby hands to slowly move around on the bottom of the level and bypass every obstical and get to the end, it will probably be tedious and boring, and maybe even slower than just doing the level, but your welcome to go ahead and do it. There is no ""wrong way"" to play."
18288,Very nice game if you wanna rape half your harem

18355,"I love this game! Its very simple yet very fun and smart!
HFF is also very fun in multiplayer!
The online works good and so are skins and stages that the community gives!
Overall a fun and great game!"
18356,"The game is very silly but actually also very intelligent at the same time.  You'll find yourself laughing hysterically but also scratching your head trying to solve the different puzzles to move on to the next room.  It has a great physics engine and you have to be both creative and technical to get past the obstacles.  The controls are very simple and it's kid friendly, but the movements at later levels do require some finesse, so patience and focus is sometimes necessary.  A good game to let your kids play so that they will have fun for hours but will actually be using their brains and practice their problem solving at the same time.  I have nothing bad to say about this game, I find myself constantly in awe of the developers' creativity."

18358,"pretty nice game with workshop open, which means not only you can play their story line but also you can make up a map that you and your little cute friend can play. And online also, which means if you master in this game you can show how nubility you are to the other player who you dont even know them."
18359,Kiddo really like this game.
18360,"It's fun and puzzle based, sometimes you can just get a good laugh."
18361,"This is the perfect adventure game, the whole goal is to get to the end of level, you can skip the whole thing if you can climb around the puzzles, or you can complete them, there are no requirements to beat a level other then being at the end. I dont recall too much of the soundtrack, had my own music playing, but the graphics are amazing, everything is near interactable. Just overall a 10/10 game"
18362,this is one banger game. you can throw your friends into The Void and attempt to solve kinda convoluted puzzles while one of your friends dances in the corner. i have 300 hours. would reccomend if you like fucking around with ya mates. 10/10 would play another 300 hours of.
18363,Recommend to others! Very peaceful games and you can have fun here with friends!

18445,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. It's graphics are great and the concept is brilliant. My only problems are that in the levels, they don't give you an object. They just throw you into a level to mess around with until you just happen to trigger the spot where the level ends. So it confuses you for a while (which I get that is supposed to happen) but at least they could say, ""this spot is the end, figure out how to get there."" And then the puzzle part is getting to the end. Other than the annoying wandering around trying to do anything useful, this game is great!"

18454,It is a simple but very good game that both entertains and laughs while playing.
18455,"It's a great game, much more fun if played with friends!"
18456,"If you're up for hours of finger-cramping and sweaty hands (keyboard and mouse gameplay), this is a really great game to struggle through with friends or even strangers. The story levels/dream levels are extremely fun to play and I absolutely love how some of the achievements for the game are out of the way and some may be time-consuming. In addition to the dream levels, there are hundreds of workshop maps that will cater to your liking; parkour maps, puzzle maps (i.e. mazes, riddles, sudoku, puzzles, etc.), hide and seek maps, battle arenas (i.e. sword or lightsaber fighting), bunnyhopping maps, etc. Although, I do have to say that finding a really good map after playing all the most popular ones of all time is a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, but it's worth it. 

The levels are meant for you to get from spawn to the exit and there are a couple of tutorial tools IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME to help you (dream level called ""Mansion"" and ""Mountain""), so all those reviews about not knowing what to do in game, did not pay attention to the voice overs or the helpful hints. 

If you play a lot of the workshop maps and can handle the language barrier, I do recommend downloading the Google Translate app on your phone to translate the foreign maps (mainly Chinese). 

Cons:
1. There is camera bobbing, which can get pretty annoying, and the initial few hours of playing this game will give you a headache/motion sickness, so beware of that (my friends and I got used to it eventually).
2. At certain times of the day, if you're playing on a public lobby, either hosting or joining a random lobby, there will be a lot of people, especially children under the age of 15, who will troll you, so also be cautious of that.
3. Sometimes when you're hosting a lobby, some of the interactive parts of the workshop maps will show as moving for you, but not for the other people in your lobby. This is more of a Unity thing from the map's creator part; they may have forgotten to code some of the nodes or whatever for multiplayer version.
4. If you are hosting or joining an online multiplayer lobby, get used to the lag that follows whenever a new person joins the lobby or just the lag between you and the host. Lag happens, get used to it.

Lastly, I concocted a list of great maps to start off with a friend(s) on Reddit. Enjoy! https://www.reddit.com/r/humanfallflat/comments/d6ooko/list_of_great_workshop_levels_to_play/

P.S. Feel free to add me on steam if you want to play with someone. I'll be glad to show you the ropes. If you actually want to find someone to play with at any given time or have questions regarding Unity, workshop building, or some technical stuff, join the official Human: Fall Flat Discord server for a quicker response."

18465,"***Just buy if you have friends to play with***

Well, the game is really funny, the times I've played I really enjoyed the physics and the hilarious way the characters move, walk, jump, grab other players, etc. The maps are really creative, indeed the game has really interesting puzzles you actually have to figure out how to solve, and some of them you need help from other players, which makes the game interesting as you laugh with your friends and random people online.

However the game has problems, first of all is really laggy. I would say, the game has a whole second of delay sometimes, and that makes really hard to calculate certain jumps, and accurate moves in general.

Then I don't know how the fvck, but the game isn't well optimized, despite the geometry and graphics in general seem to be easy to deal with, sometimes I get artifacts, the computer just freezes, restars suddenly, and that never happens in other games, so I'm addresing the problem directly in this game.

I'm pointing the people that play sometimes as this problem, they're just retarded, they try to throw you out of the map, grab you while you just want to play, and that's not funny the most of the times, thankfully, that just happens sometimes, and you can just leave the party if you're feeling bored. 

Then the game just kick you suddenly for no reason, so that's why I really encourage you to buy ONLY if you have a good amount of friends.

Despite of that, the game is really worth your money, and you'll have a really funny experience. Buy it you won't regret."

18522,Hardest i've ever laughed with my friends online :D
18523,yeeee
18524,i like
18525,"i have to say that this is one of the oddest puzzle games that I have played.  The controls are deceptively simple but let me tell you when you are trying to climb that wall or jump and climb you find things are not as simple as they appear.

The game is well worth the money. 

The puzzles make you think and many times have a simple solution or a much more complicated one.   

Anyone who has a bit of patience for single play or from the group online videos a few friends with a taste for something different give it a shot.  

"
18526,fun
18527,This is a simple yet amazing game with fun puzzles and a unique climbing system with my 275+ hours I can safely say this is a time killer in the best form. Also it has steam work shop with access to this it has so much more potential. Just buy it if you like a funny physics game!
18528,puzzle game but flop

18534,"great game, great graphics, and a ton of fun!"
18535,"It's a really, really fun game if you have someone to play it with. It can get a bit frustrating at some points, and it definitely will if you're alone, but if you're in company, you will be too busy laughing to be frustrated. The clunky physics and cartoony graphics, plus the character customisation make it a really fun and funny game. 

Completely recommended."
18536,hi
18537,
18538,"super fun to play, especially online multiplayer. tho its not uncommon for connection to be lost during this, tho that might be partly due to my internet. 9/10 would recommend ."

"
18628,"x5 the fun if you have friends. interesting puzzles, interactive tools and vehicles, lots of character customization. if you don't enjoy puzzle-solving, there's multiple ways to progress including sequence-breaking or just climbing over the walls. on top of that, the game is hilarious to play, with physics resembling Gangbeasts. I laughed my ass off the first half hour of playing by just watching my character waddle around and trip over obstacles."

18737,"This is a great game and played very well on Xbox Game Pass for PC so I do recommend the game just not here on Steam. I wanted to play it with my kids so I bought it on Steam so I could stream it to another room via Steam Link. The Steam version appears to have a bug that causes your character to intermittently not grip which is very frustrating. I did some trouble shooting and Steam Link is not the issue. I tried several different type controllers including the Steam Controller with no favorable outcome. The bug also happens when not using Link. It appears there are others with this issue and have been uable to solve it either. I don't know what the refund policy is so fear I just paid $15 for a game I'll never be able to play.

Refund denied due to me trying to troubleshoot the game and exceeding the allotted refund playtime window. GET FUCKED VALVE."

18784,It's a fun little puzzle platformer! That pretty much sums it up. A few friends and I had some great times in this game! Not to mention there's probably more fun to be had if we get around to doing the custom player maps!
18785,"Good game Really fun with friends 
Maps were well made and fun 
Puzzles are easy but still fun
Music is good 
Achievements are good

My only con with the game is priority in my opinion if you look down and grab it should never grab the ground if there is an item right there. 

On top of that sometimes priority with grabs does not work and my players arms just slide off the thing im trying to climb. Other than that games really good and worth full price."

18793,"It's a pretty fun experience, specially online. The first time you play the campaign it's really really great, and it's still fun to do it a couple more times. When you get bored of it, you can try to play it with other people or check out some of the custom maps (But most aren't very fun)."
18794,GOOD
18795,Really fun game to play with the boys
18796,good
18797,Totally recommend this game to mess around with friends to solve puzzles and see what disasters you can create.
18798,Bring friends and have sexy times.
18799,"The game is a lot more fun to play when you have a friend; otherwise it's kinda boring after a while.

It's a nice game but I just couldn't get into it."
18800,"Great game, i don't think i ever laughed as much as i did  in the 26 minutes i played it with my boyfriend. Sadly it also gave me the biggest motion sickness headache of my life, but were it not for that, this would be another game where i play into the triple digit hours.
Definitely play it with a friend rather than on your own! It's fun to figure out the puzzles and also the controls and it's even more fun to watch someone else flail and fumble around as you do : )"
18801,nice game and funny
18802,its fun
18803,A GRATE GAME!
18804,"The controls in this game are incredibly horrible, making it not fun at all imo."

18810,"This is a great pass time especially when playing with your family. I play this with my son on the laptop and on PS4 for hours, and he loves it. It is simple fun without any overly violence and you can get in so many funny situations that it will make you laugh.
I believe that this is one of those games which you play when you just wish to relax and not think about a complicated story or goals to be achieved.
The Graphics are simple but quirky, typical physics based look and minimal colours. It also helps having so many youtubers playing this on their channels which gives you even more ideas about fun stuff to do in the game that it might not have been intended for.

If you just want to kill some time, or want some fun with friends and family, I would definitely recommend this."

18852,"Me and my best mate have spent over ten hours now screwing each other over getting from one obstacle to the next, flailing over each other grasping for a chance to proceed or harass each other to the next area. You can also launch your friend from a catapult into a k pop inspired tower as it plays in the background. It's basically gang beasts without violence and with puzzles and borat skins.

18853,Most fun you can have with friends late at night!
18854,i had fun time
18855,Pretty fun.
18856,Its a good multiplayer game. I would reccomend the game if you have friends who also own this game or hope to get it but even if you dont online multiplayer is fun too. The real chaos happens when your with friends irl split screen or online because you can shout at them and throw them of the edge.

18868,it is good shit
18869,"One of my absolute favorite games! I have snagged so many different groups of people to play this game with, and each time is better than the next. It's a great solo game, but an even better co op game! Physics based sandbox that can be played however you want. I've watched someone completely bypass all the puzzles by just climbing the map, and I've seen people spend hours on one puzzle because they're too busy sabotaging each other. I would absolutely recommend this game!"
18870,fun hehe xd
18871,"bought this game to play with a friend, online is unusable despite my connection being in front of my firewall and having no issues in other games. disappointing as it looks good, if you can stay in a game long enough, not worth the hassle."

18880,"in single player use your brain to solve fun interesting puzzles in vibrant levels, or load up multiplayer and watch every single game mechanic be exploited as a group of r*tards make there way though each level. if you say two head are better than one prepare to eat your own words as your ""friends"" make you consider ending your own life."
18881,It's a stupid game but it's fun
18882,Very cool split screen two player!
18883,"Human Fall Flat is a fun little puzzler with plenty of hilarity in its scenarios. The levels feel like playgrounds where you could do whatever you want. With the ability to play this alone or co-op, plenty of ways are out there to create chaos. That doesn't mean it is all well and dandy, as holding on to objects can be a bit wonky and playing solo shouldn't be done in long play sessions. That being said, I still really enjoyed what this crazy game tried to do."
18884,"Great game with lots of stupid things to do.
Lots of workshop levels.
You can mess with your friends.
Lots of workshop contests."
18885,Drag your friends of the cliff and all other kinds of fun <3

18892,more addictive than I thought and you won't get bored quickly because you can go through it in several ways
18893,great bonding game for friends its calm enough to talk about other things and has enough action to get a good laugh

Instead it's got fun physics and reasonable puzzles."
18908,so realy good.
18909,"very fun :))
"
18910,"Amzing game , super fun if you play with other people...highly recommend"
18911,"Honestly, this game is one of the best games I've ever played. Playing with friends enhances the gameplay by so much. I encourage everyone who considers to buy the game to have their friends also get it as well. The normal maps are definitely worthwhile, and while the puzzles might've been frustrating to deal with sometimes, it was definitely an experience. The satisfaction of completing a level makes all of the mistakes and falls along the way SO worth it. So if you are reading this, you should definitely give this game a shot."

18917,"This game poses some very good challenges in the way of puzzles while playing singleplayer. The challenges when in multiplayer come in the form of extreme amounts of goofing around, grabbing each other and trying to toss them into the abyss, catapulting each other, destroying stuff, and much more, ignoring the puzzles.
Fun game as singleplayer, Even better multiplayer. Can play both coop and online, and can also remote play together. Pretty damn good. Worth the money."
18918,Well it is a game that makes you crazy while playing it and if you rage quit you just want to play it again after 10 minutes.
18919,really fun
18920,Its fun as hell
18921,Worth it if u play with some friends.
18922,"It's really fun to play with others, but it's not really fun when you play by yourself"
18923,this game need u to think using ur knee
18924,Troll AF!
18925,"Human Fall Flat is an awesome puzzle game, with physics like Gang Beasts. The puzzles can be challenging, and when you run out of base game maps to play, the community has many. It has multiplayer, and sometimes having fun in the lobby is amazing, Overall it's great."
18926,FIRE
18927,"Hilarious game mechanics, awesome to play with other people you know. Puzzles are hard enough to be challenging but not impossible once you get the hang of the game. I would recommend this game to anyone that loves humorous, relaxed, and cute puzzle games."

Then he needs to tie his leg to a rock and jump in the atlantic ocean from a plane 20k feet above ground. Then he should try to come up to the surface the same way you can climb in this game. Would only recommend to people with mental issues, which is the minority of the world population. Thumbs down biaaaaatch."
18934,it is ...    COOL!!!!!!
18935,funny to play with friends

18939,non-stop laughter.
18940,"I have probably laughed myself to death sometimes with this game. It is a pretty large game with lots of workshop maps and it is REALLY FUN with friends. I would recommend it and the price is pretty good for the game. The workshop community is alive and you get new maps almost every day, you can also make / download other characters which is really fun because you can almost become anything as a lot of people make new characters pretty often.
"
18941,human fall flat is a funny game that I once played the game was fun to play from behind (tps) and very interesting to play
18942,"Bought many copies for my friends, had tons of fun, also had tons of frustration...

18950,"The game is silly fun with friends only buy this game if you got the friends who are willing to pay and play with you. also note that the game servers are hosted by the one who well, hosts the game meaning if they have bad internet you are going to see input lag. but if you can deal with that its a really fun game to play with friends with tons of new levels being made."

19077,This game is very funny and fun to play with friends or by yourself. I would give a 4.5/5 it would just be better if there were some more maps but it is a cool game regardless. It has fun puzzles and cool game functions and secrets to find.

19086,good game
19087,"It's a really good game. I really enjoyed it, it's worth your money"
19088,"Pros:

1 In the early period of game, lack of climbing training leads to hands hold hands corporation, weird gestures are Extremely laughing maker when play with friends and family
2 Details are nice.

Cons:

1 Double players mode with  controller + keyboard are fairly hard to make it work, it takes me about an hour make it work, it is pretty kind of most usual hardware question of this game, if nothing works, try Steam - Settings - Controller - General Controller Setting - unCheck 2 3 4 and Check 5(Generic...), then restart game.

2 Controller holding button(LT+RT) is kind of not working most of the time, on the other side, keyboard + mouse is totally easy, result is climbing is much more harder with a controller, but 99% success with keyboard + mouse

3 User guide is not enough for toon tuning, please find out in game settings, totally two toon, 1P and 2P, default white, customize is also fun.

4 Single player mod became kind of 3D puzzle game, much more less fun"

19108,"There aren't many games like this that I know. If you like puzzle games with some tricky but fun game physics then I think you'll like this game. Especially when you play with friends or at least other people. Also the addition of the workshop is nice since there is a lot content extra now. I could tell you more, but I'm pretty sure a gameplay review will give you more info :)"
19109,"Dunno what to say, it's a decent multiplayer/single-player game, I had fun playing through it and halfway during my first playthrough of the game I saw you could play online. Somehow I've noticed that there was a online mode, either way I like this game, its a fun game where you can goof around and physics are pretty satisfying sometimes."

19152,"Wobbly wankers is one of the most entertaining games I've ever played. You control a wanker that has the balance of the main character of Death Stranding and you gotta solve these puzzles. Get a group, get not sober and you've got a f*cking party and a lifetime of hilarious memories. 10/10 will be playing again. And again. And probably a few more times after that."
19153,its just funny and fun
19154,"We've been playing this as a family off and on for months now -- it's a great teamwork exercise, and we've had a lot of laughs together.  Finally got to the end today, and would enjoy going through it again."

19183,Hilarious with friends. A bit... janky.
19184,very fun to play with friends. and also its nice that you can choose a skin that represents you. i picked donkey kong because i am a monky

19212,I liked it cuz it pussle
19213,"This game is straight fire. When playing with a friend, he commented ""how is this not game of the year?"" and he's 100% right.

This game is a little gimmicky, and the controls take some patience, but it controls well and does something you won't quite find anywhere else. Puzzle solving, sometimes brief, sometimes long, and always creative. Play it with friends for a wild time, and it supports remote play. Score. The character customization is also hella nice. Me and a few friends just remade some shitty OC's we made a while back in paint for kicks, and it made the game like 10x as fun to play. Just make a dude you enjoy, and you'll have a great time hanging with friends, rowing boats and flinging catapults. 10/10."
19214,"it is nice game
"
19215,EPICNESS AND FUN

19254,Ouch
19255,ITS SUPER FUN FOR PRICE YOU BUY NOW
19256,Honestly expected better for this game not as fun as i thought it would be... save your self a few dollars and buy some thing else.

19258,yyy
19259,Fun game. Jumped off a cliff. 10/10 would jump again.
19260,"Very ok
"
19261,its fun!
19262,"I just had my worst game-related motion sickness! The first time I played it, I had motion sickness but it was bearable. The second time, I had to leave my friend and drop dead on the bed.

I mean the game is fun but they should fix the camera. I play a lot of games but I never experienced severe motion sickness until I played this game"
19263,"I wish I could refund the game, but unfortunately, I bought two copies for both myself and a friend, and I've played it for five hours now, and nearly beat it in the process.

This game is a puzzle game where the puzzle-solving is 5% of the challenge, and the execution of your solution is the other 95%. You can glance at any one of the puzzles and solve it in ten seconds of thinking, and then spend ten minutes fighting the physics engine and controls to achieve the plan you had instantly laid out. There's also some great periods of time where you wander around in confusion, because the game generally avoids giving you meaningful direction.

I found the game extremely frustrating after the charm wore off. Don't buy it for the puzzles, buy it for the physics, I guess, and only on sale, because it's a very short game. The included customization reminescent of various streamers makes me think that this game was an early example of streamer-bait games."
19264,ok
19265,best game ever
19266,"best played with friends, and people who love experimenting with physics"
19267,the game is soooo amazing but i really want it to be for free cuz i want to play with my friend and he cant buy it
19268,this game is fun
19269,This game is so fun to play with friends and generally just have fun with the physics. tbh I didn't really like the first bunch of official maps. BUT I can't recommend more to play the 'Extra Dreams' they are honestly top tier. This game also comes along with workshop support and there are tonnes of awesome community maps. I've spent more time on the workshop maps than the actual game!
19270,Addictive...kudos

19288,"Quirky. Open-ended. Physics-based. Puzzle. Long ago, the the two brothers played in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Chinese Players attacked. (with viruses)

Only the Developers, master of game development, could stop them, but when the players needed them most, they vanished. 

A hundred days passed and my brother and I decided to play an old game, a game named Garry's Mod. And although it is great, I have a lot to learn before I move on from Human Fall Flat. 

But I believe the Developers can save the Game."
19289,really good but very hard cars are not simple but the puzzles are great
19290,hey
19291,"Got this in a Humble bundle almost 3 years ago now, but was never exactly eager to play a game with ""Human"" in the title. Turns out it's Gang Beasts with less PvP and a focus on solving puzzles to progress through maps.

The player-made content (levels and player skins) is where this game really shines, but even in the core levels there is a fair amount to do - both linear puzzles and optional achievement-related tasks.

Human: Fall Flat raised my faith in Humans. Just launch the game and join a random party, or host your own (public). Either way you're guaranteed a good time."

The humans have a wobbly body made of muscle. They can grab things with their hands. They are curious and like secrets, and view the world from about two metres out the back of their own head.

Nobody told the alien that humans have skeletons."
19307,As if you are bringing sofa into apartment without elevator

19315,"Trying to play as serious as I do in Far Cry, I found it to be absurd and the physics little more than aggravating. When I played with my roommate and two other friends of hers, I laughed and we messed around and had a fantastic time. Buy this game! Enjoy it by yourself but don't take it too seriously. Join with some friends and create some real mischief and laughter. :-)"

19454,"have had too many fun moments with friends
"
19455,"Not going to lie, this game was plainfully average at first, however as the story progressed and the characters became much more developed - I soon found myself immersed into the Human Fall Flat world. Additionally, I have recently been able to become an Australian firefighter, and that is friggin' dope!
Moreover, my experiences on Human Fall Flat have not all been jolly, I've been drop kicked, head-locked, and seismic slammed more times than I can verbally interpret. Many fights have broken out amongst my friends and I due to these conflicts, and many friendships have been lost.
Overall, I rate this game 3 blueberries / 10.
Make sure you give your mates a little snack when they least expect it."

You would think once a checkpoint is set, you'd always be able to return to it. That's not the case in this game. Expect a few frustrating experiences of losing all progress in a level."

19465,"I can't find my friend's server but any random online ones, so what's the point of having a multiplayer mode if you can't play with your friends? I don't need to observe the stupidity of some stranger."
19466,"Amazing, the climbing in this game is so satisfying, makes me want to go outside and be human.

That's too help to you to play better"

19478,"yes

19479,Interesting with friends!
19480,You can get a Ricardo skin and show off his Abbs while throwing friends off edges.
19481,I love this game it has a great sound track it's a lot of fun alone but when you grab some friends it becomes just so much better i think this game is a fantastic game overall
19482,"You can throw your friends off the map and drown them so 10/10.

But really with a friend this game is a ton of fun, and the more the better. The Steam Workshop ensures that this game has an endless amount of content and the devs are also adding official levels from time to time.

The price won't be a problem since the game pays off with the amount of fun and laughs you'll receive out of it, solid buy I'd say."
19483,Gud
19484,Very fun and clever game with a funny theme and simple controls. I like how you can play with your friend on the same computer offline if you have a controller you can connect to your computer. 10/10.

19495,"Fun game with floppy jelly-like physics and good workshop support.  Simple to learn and tricky to master, and infinitely more fun with friends.  Thinking outside the box can allow you to find creative solutions to the puzzles and half the fun is finding ways to skip ahead and climb to almost unreachable areas looking for secrets.  Definitely recommend and I still play this game on a very regular basis despite having finished it multiple times."

19498,AWESOME TO PLAY AND A VERY AWESOME TIME WITH FREINDS AND WORKSHOP LEVELS.

19501,"Interesting controls and puzzles. Definitely recommend when on sale, not sure about at full price though. Great to play with friends too."
19502,"what the hell, this is an amazing puzzle game. Maybe a bit overpriced, but still amazing. my advice is wait for a sale, then buy it. this game is sooo cheap on sale, it is normally 60% off. BUY ON SALE."
19503,This game is awesome! The physics are so good they're funny and there is some short cuts that you can take too! My only issue is that my sister gets to make fun of how big my butt is in the game. But besides that I say keep adding new levels!

Levels can be done single-player, but some of them are a lot easier in multi-player. Love playing this solo trying to get achievements, and trying to solve puzzles with friends! Plus, very cool customization tool for your persona."

19553,"When I first played this game on my xbox one, I thought it was great. When I bought it for my friends and I during the most recent steam sale on pc, it was some of the most fun I've had in a while. The hilarious things that happen just from you being dumb with your friends are endless. This game is like a Piñata, because it has so much content in it! The customization for your character is so free and fun, that I've spent HOURS making characters. I've played as obama while my friend was... well, uh, ""not nice man from the second world war..."" 4/5 -I can go in a blender

TL;DR: Great puzzle game, play it with friends."
19554,"Fun game with friend's and not so fun alone , usually hard find public sever, cause you will get kick out."
19555,"whether you play alone or with a friend, you're going to be left in in laughter. this game is 100% funny as hell and so much fun. if you have a fun twisted imagination u can definitely put it to use in this game. this is one on the best games to play with a friend. everything you can think of you can do. this game in itself can be made into a mini series that can leave fans laughing and wanting more. if you make it so enjoyable to watch, you can convince the viewers to even purchase the game themselves and play it with their friends. this is my #1 recommended couch/party play game you and ur friends can really enjoy."

19593,"This game is exactly like every video you've seen of it. Dumb gameplay, addicting as hell, overall a great game."
19594,Its Fun you get to shoot FIREWORKS! :D
19595,"You best play this game in a group of friends. Solo this game does have nice puzzles, but breaking the levels in a group is even more fun. The achievements are great, except for maybe the speedrun achievement. Part of them are for just completing the levels. Part of them are for completing optional side objectives you may not even know were in there, and part of them are for just downright breaking levels or puzzles in various ways."
19596,Very fun game to play with friends. Pretty hard sometimes but it makes it make interesting. I really like the controls while they are quite hard sometimes. Had some amazing fun with my friends in here and do not regret buying this. Deserves all the money I spend on it if not more.
19597,"Play with a friend so you can throw them off cliffs and drown them.

10/10 would murder again."
19598,"Best $6 ever spent. If you see this on sale and want to play an amazing game, you need to buy this!"
19599,"This game is really fun with friends and really relaxing alone.
The graphics are nothing special, as you can see by any sort of gameplay but still it's enough to play the entire game without even noticing it (basically i'm saying that they work).
I recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun time with friends or a relaxing experience while watching something.
The game has Workshop support so there is infinite possibilities.
If there is 1 thing i'd add to this game. It would be VR support, i have 2 other friends with PCVR and they both said that they would want VR support for this game and playing this game in VR would be their best VR experience so far and i fully agree with them"
19600,"pp big
"
19601,"awsome
"
19602,"Coming the point directly for this game:
Pros-
1.Includes friendly themes and lobby to play.
2.Can be played offline or with steam friends or random players online.
3.Includes offline splitscreen to play with a partner aside also supports the steam remote play feature.
4.The game have tons of workshop contents to play online or offline mode.
5.Sometime you will burst out of laugh if not controlled.

cons-
1.The players jumps half second later in online mode if you have somewhat slow internet.
2.Sometime free skins are distributed but i never could get/understand how to get those skins.
3.Don't support dual keyboard and mouse setup for offline coop/splitscreen."

19618,"I really wish I could give this game a positive review but there are a few bugs that are deal breakers. First off, the game is very fun but it keeps constantly crashing and kicking me out of the games I am in. Also, I really dislike the fact that invisible skins are a thing. It really ruins the game when a person with an invisible skin comes and trolls you to the point where the game isn't even playable. 

Also just a recommendation: Single-Player mode. The only way to make your game ""single-player"" is if you host a game and hope that no one joins your server."
19619,"Absolutely hilarious! Even with only 2 players this game is amazing! Most of the time we just run about breaking or cheating the game and thinking that was the correct way to solve the puzzles! Overall 10/10 MUST BUY if you have at least ONE friend to play it with - will guarantee endless laughter!

P.S Plays perfect with M&KB, haven't tried it with a controller."

19727,"Tl;dr what doth life?

[b]Final score: friends/5[/b] 

Human: Fall Flat is a game about solving little physics-based puzzles to progress to the next area. It’s about completely ignoring the puzzles and just jumping over half the level. It’s about grieving other people and throwing them off the floating white island, that you are stranded on. But most importantly it’s about having fun with your friends. 

For this reason I declare myself not to be in the fortunate position to review this game accurately in its fun factor or replayability. I can only tell you about things like purposefully frustrating mechanics, that give your character the cute, clumsy movement you’ve seen in YouTube videos where people are having fun… with their friends. If you would like to know more about the fun you can have with your friends in this game, don’t read my review. Because I don’t have any friends to play this with. 

People might say that, it’s my fault for playing a game that is mostly only fun if you play it with friends, or that I am at fault for not having friends in the first place, and they would be absolutely correct. However, did this game make me forget the fact that I have no one to play it with? No, it did not. Maybe for one or two moments in which I was strategically trying to find a way to skip half the level that one time, but most of my playthrough was a constant reminder that I am alone and may very well be for the rest of my life. 

If anything this game made me understand the importance of social skills and desirability of an interesting personality, which I do not possess. It confronted me with the minuteness of my own existence and brought me closer spiritually to the great empty and cold nothingness that is the universe – devoid of anything resembling human compassion. A nothingness that is deafeningly full of the harsh reality that we will never amount to anything meaningful in the lifespan of our species, as the meaninglessness of reality cannot be rivaled. 

All in all, this is a good game and I would recommend it to people with friends. 
As for anyone else? Maybe."

19758,"This is a really hilarious game, with silly human figures roaming around. Grab, push, pull eachother to your heart's content. Customize your human with funny clothing, hat, full body suits and paint your human with fun colors. Throw your friends off cliffs, swing on ropes hanging from high places, and solves many puzzles and mazes. You can host servers and start ""Levels"", wich feature challenging problem-solving puzzles for you and your friends to crack. Join your friends' servers and hang around in the lobby or subscribe to other lobbies made by other players on the Steam workshop to play around in theirs. Humorous body movements and leaps will give your human life and silliness. I will guarantee this game will make you laugh as your drown your friends or get launched from a catapult. The Levels get harder and more confusing as you progress, but you will experience life-threatening experiences, literally! You will always respawn and appear falling from the sky until you hit the ground, then get up and move forward. Unlock checkpoints and finish the Levels. New Levels and content come fairly often, wich really brings excitement to your game."

19765,fun when not sober
19766,I LOVE IT!
19767,omg where do i even begin with this game a simple thing like walking and jumping is so hard in this game the basics of a video game are made so difficult which makes this game totally unplayable omg and the puzzles are so impossible because you cant even move properly and where is the gameplay no guns no spell no abilities there just nothing. only nothing would not recommend so bad after the releases of riot games such as league of legends and legends of runeterra and hearthstone you make this actually step up your game bethesda games

19770,Great ragdoll physics and it's really fun to play with friends. You can troll with them and everything like that. I like how you can interact with every single object and that there are different missions and especially creator-map-made maps from community workshops so everyone can make a map. 10/10 recommend.
19771,pretty fun and a good game to have fun with your friends you can also connect a controller on pc and have your friend play on controller and you can play on pc at the same time its a good game to laugh at and play around
19772,The puzzles are varied. We have a hard enough time completing them in multiplayer. I can't imagine how hard it is solo!!
19773,Boring game.

19779,fun food for brain. Physics class was a fun experience after i intro'd the teacher to the game.
19780,"Dumb, physics-based fun.
Each level is unique and silly in its own way and they're never repetitive. In whole it's a pretty relaxing game, but can be quite frustrating at times. While Human Fall Flat is definitely best to play with a friend, it still delivers as a solo adventure (it's much harder though)."

19796,"I've wanted to own this game for the longest time. 
The greatest influencer of this want was the Game Grumps with their, ""Human Fall Flat - Steam Train"" Series.
I still rewatch those episodes once in a while. 
I wish they would go back and play the game some more. 
They didn't finish the game or come close during their let's play series.
And since the game has added a lot more since then, it's a shame they don't go back and try it again. 
I'd pay to see Arin, Ross, and Chris yell at each other on how to complete each puzzle.

But in terms of the game, It's solo enertaining. 
I'm quite surprised on how low the achievement percentages are. 
The game isn't that hard. 
It might be 'challenging' but once you get a hang of it, it's just a matter of controlling your character to do the thing you want. Or if you don't like puzzles, you can always swing your way up walls. 
That m1 - m2 swinging climb is actually broken. It might take longer than actually doing the puzzle, but it's a whole heck of a lot easier to manage.
I had a lot of fun playing this game by myself. Whenever I tried to play online I'd get kicked from the server. 
Going back and achievement hunting also adds a whole new level of puzzling, especially that, ""stack all 4 boxes"" one.
that was a doozy."

19945,"This game is absolutly amazing!!! Super fun... I have a few recomendations tho.

1. when i am customizing my character the game likes to crash alot during me painting or toggling or saving etc. idk if its my pc but its very bearable since everything saves before it crashes. it also starts up again rly fast.

2. when painting add a way to make stright lines... and mebe paint in square.. triangle etc shapes

3. add even more ways to customize which i think u devs doing as i speak soo,...

devs and game is awesome money could not have been spent better"
19946,Worth every penny
19947,"A small game that was meant to be played with friends.
It has some levels by default but there is also a lot of workshop content,the game is based on ragdoll phsyics.
I would say it's well worth the price."
19948,good while listening to skrillex
19949,"Goat Simulator meets Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. But, you know, actually fun."
19950,"Wiggly physics ragdolls trying to do stuff in ridiculous ways. Frustrating in spots, silly in others, overall entertaining enough to get a thumbup. 

Runs fairly smooth on 3 yo hardware.

Didn't bother with any of the co-op stuff, as none of the levels looked interesting enough for that."
19951,"Absolutely don't get this unless you have friends to play it with.
If you do, it can be fun to mess around for a couple hours, but that has more to do with chasing and grabbing each other as floppy people than the actual puzzles and levels themselves, which feel kinda empty and vapid.
Gameplay and level design are where this game... falls flat for me. You might know the solution to a puzzle immediately, but the floppy, imprecise controls can make something simple - moving a box, for example - take longer than it feels like it should. The movement seems to be meant more as a joke than an actual mechanic. Solutions tend to be pretty one-dimensional, because that solution is all the controls will allow you to achieve.
I can see why someone would like this, and while I had some fun with friends for a little while, I personally can't recommend it."
19952,very fun game to mess around with friends :)

Playing this game singleplayer is always a possibility but is not recommended (in my opinion) because you get more laughs and enjoyment out of the game when you're playing with friends!

Luckily, if you have no friends (i.e. me) then singleplayer is completely doable through your own efforts!"

Almost Too Good To My PC
It Cant Handle The Graphics
i say it yes cause i liked the game
but if it had stars as a rating i would rate 7 out of 10"
20008,gud gam ;O
20009,"Short sum:
Very unique puzzle game with charming characters and maps. Great to play with friends, a lot of good community maps, which extend the mediocre amount of dev maps. 

Pros:
- A lot of fun when you play it with friends
- Interesting puzzles
- Powerful character editor
- Sometimes there are multible ways to get to your goal
- Especially the newer dev maps (everything after the nuclear plant) are quite good
- Download community maps, a lot of them really good, extending your playtime (Little Big Planet Vibes)

Cons:
- Some maps, especially the early ones feel a bit empty. 
- Either you like the controls or you hate them
- Some puzzles feel like you are using glitches to get by, instead of properly solving them
- Some minor glitches and bugs, but not really a con, imho
- Music is horrible! I can't even recall if there is more than one song, because 90% of the time, there is no music at all! So make sure, you have a good playlist running in the backround, when you play this game. 
- You can't turn down music when you play a community map, which sometimes is really really annoying (I'm looking at you leap of faith part 1! Still a good map, though.)"
20010,very fun
20011,"I love this game because of the hilarious physics and graphics. The campaign is awesome and there's all kinds of cool maps you can explore, yet it is a little short (but the devs have added some more stuff lately).

You can play online and that's what really changed it for me because you can goof around with your friends (or strangers lol) or you can speed run through the levels with more people. I recommend this game to somebody who likes ragdoll physics and exploring. (But also likes puzzles.)"

20013,Good for killing time.
20014,"First tried the game via remote-play-together with a friend and immediatelly got hooked. Great physics game that doesn't explain ANYTHING, so you need to experiment to explore the gameplay. If you can, DO play it together with a friend, as it is SO much more fun than alone! =D"

Typical physics game really, in line with the typical rage game just as well, minus that nerve wrecking aspect.

Playing with friends will be lots of fun for a while, unless you're a content creator. In that case you're going to totally love this game."

20026,yes
20027,It's a silly little meme game thats good fun with friends. I don't recommend playing alone as half the fun comes from watching a group of dudes flail about wreaking havoc on the physics engine.
20028,nice
20029,"This is an amazing party game with friends. There's plenty of things you can get creative with in the normal levels and when you're bored of those, there's a massive amount of workshop content to go through"
20030,"good fun to play with friends, my biggest request is that I wish there was more levels, or for there to be more english workshop levels. My other request is that you make the level creator more complicated allowing for more unique level designs."
20031,PHUN!
20032,Way too much fun with friends to be worth $15. The addition of workshop maps can bring so much more fun to the game and when put together it’s just great
20033,Best played with friends.
20034,A fun game to play online or play with friends.
20035,best game ever but could you make a level creator where you could invite steam and xbox friends and more levels please
20036,dummy fun physics and even better with friends
20037,Best co op game ever!
20038,"great fun with friends , well worth getting"
20039,noice
20040,"The thing i liked is that it is perfectly functioning i havent seen any ""Bugs/Glitches"" overall. The thing i disliked about it is that sometimes my arm gets stuck on like inside my body sometimes"
20041,I really liked how fun and funny it is.
20042,its a verry cool game i have always wanted this and i finaly got it
20043,Pretty fun with friends
20044,"funny,pretty good graphics,loads of worlds to play, physics and lots more (also has workshop maps)"

20050,"Honestly one of the best indie games I have ever played, spent many hours not only one PC but also console."
20051,Would not recommend playing alone but with a group of friends this is a blast.
20052,adrian splat splat
20053,physics engine is awesome!
20054,"Good Game, fun for groups of friends, WIsh they had more maps and more community activity."
20055,Funny Game.....:)))
20056,Fun with friends. Still fun by yourself but MUCH more difficult than if you had friends. There are easy ways to abuse and skip levels with just climbing and rolling on walls but it is much less fun to do it that way. They still add new levels from time to time and the game has workshop support so if you have fun you can find some other fan made levels you might like. Definitely recommend this game with friends but I haven't tried public lobbies so if you are buying without friends to play with then I am not sure I can recommend it.
20057,gfy
20058,"Great game all the way through, better with friends."
20059,Its a great game. Even better with FRIENDS!!!!

20068,if they dont fix the workshop download spam ima gonna ask myh money back like real so0n .... I got the game for my son he enjoys it but i mean i feel like im ina toxic relationship right now with all those stupid contents that im gettin pretty muych everyday ...I think i downloadedd the game it was like 7GB or so and now i get like 2-3GB of contents from the workshop like everyweek. Do these guys expect me to buy another harddrive just to keep playin this game ?? cuz at this rythm in 1 year the game is goin to be a 700GB from workshop i never ask for. I hhavent found any way to unsuscribe or block this shit and i think many poeple are having tthe same issues this is todly ridiculous.

20070,"I would say go get it but you might have your own opinion but It's a dumb funny fun game, I watched some videos about it and now I have it! I hope this tells you that you might not like it but atleast I do! I hope if you get it you have a nice time playing."

20073,yes

A uniquely hilarious experience full of fun for a small group! The mechanics, although feeling a little clunky at times, make every interaction an absolute blast. Despite a short playtime through the few levels available it's constant fun whilst maintaining a logical challenge through puzzles that require constant teamwork to solve. 
Don't expect a game you can play for more than a few hours but it's still an extremely enjoyable time, especially with friends!!"

There's limitless possibilities to do things, no invisible wall, no deaths, just a simple puzzle game that is easy but can sometimes be challenging when it wants to. Climbing is a bit difficult (for me at least), but overall I love the game it's fun and I highly recommend to get it but wait for it once it get's on sale."

"
20252,"I haven't laughed this hard in awhile. If you have friends I highly recommend. Some levels/areas may be hard on your own however.

Depending on you or your friend's internet you may experience input lag on multiplayer. I've found that about 2 or more seconds of Input lag just barely passes the unplayable mark. I generally get about a one second difference.
(If anyone knows the solution to this, other than ""git b3tter int3rnet duh"", please comment or message me."

20263,funny game
20264,pretty fun aye
20265,nice game and fun with your firends
20266,"Noice puzzles and Platforming physics. Pretty goofy too, would recommend."
20267,its fun
20268,"I get that the entire game is a meme, trying to cash in on the ""so bad it's good"" ragdoll physics playground genre such as Goat Simulator and Surgeon Simulator, but it has some very big, actual issues that kills most, if not all, of the fun you could get out of it. It doesn't have properly functioning controller support which means practically no chance of playing local multiplayer. Yes, even when using Steam's controller configuration tools to rebind the controller to keyboard controls. Then there's the online multiplayer which is a broken, laggy mess. Even if you decide to use mouse and keyboard controls to play with a friend, you'll often be at the whim of your internet connection where you'll almost always be a full second behind your actions. This effectively renders online multiplayer unplayable. Playing the game by yourself is just boring, frustrating, and not even that funny even if you have someone watching you.

If you really want to play it, I'd recommend trying it out to see if you have any issues with it first. If you do, also make sure you get a friend to try it with you too, because that's where the real meat and potatoes of the game is. If you can get the controllers working and both have a decent internet connection and can stomach the lag, then you might enjoy it, but the novelty will still wear off quickly."
20269,Very Fun.Laughed hard.Almost Came
20270,"is good
many floppies
big laugh
character customization could be better, but it's not bad"

20272,"“Human: Fall Flat” is a platform-puzzle game where you play as “Bob”, a clumsy little figure that can run, jump and use his hands to interact with the environment, move objects or pull himself up ledges and obstacles. There isn’t much of a story to it, you go through various themed levels trying to reach the exit by solving puzzles in a variety of ways. This is where the game shines because it doesn’t hold your hand, but rather leaves you to figure things out for yourself. Depending on how patient and composed you are, this can either be a relaxing or infuriating experience. In any case, just looking at the simple, minimalist visuals after successfully making that hard jump feels rewarding.

Highly recommended for anyone that loves physics and platforming puzzle games and doesn’t get mad after his hundred and first attempt. Also worth noting is that the developers have kept adding new levels to the game to the point where there are twice as many as when I purchased the game, and the best part is that they are all free. It is well worth buying it, even at full price.

Overall score - 10/10"
20273,--
20274,This was Incredibly fun! I got confused on some of the puzzled but ended up cheating by scaling a wall near it and skipping it. However I am sure that if I figured those puzzles out it still would have been fun. Overall It was a great buy!

20339,"I love it because it is a fun and sometimes a challenging game, and because of its wacky characters or amazing levels overall I rate it a 10/10"
20340,hi
20341,its a good game
20342,Checkmate.
20343,"Funny yet challenging escape puzzles. Not that replayable once you beat the levels but the first run through is so worth it. Multiple ways to go about things in each level. Oh, and you can customize the character models!"
20344,"-Joins game

-People get crazy and overload the motorboat and it almost sank

-Gets stranded on desert island with many others who fell off the boat

-Me and the bois attempt to make it to the other boats but they are taken

I would get stranded on a desert isle because of selfish people again :D"
20345,"its a really funny game and if you dont have anyone to play with theres an online section. this game is amazing 
"
20346,"Very good gameplay, some sequence breaks, would recommend 4/5"
20347,very fun to play with friend
20348,"hilarious, drunk baby like ragdolls, play serious puzzle solving or run a muck"
20349,"Very well thought out game and physics in this game are amazing.. And having to control the entire character is really a fun filled experience.. Just the amount of laughter and fun you have playing with friends itself makes this game ,a winner.. Top of that this game has workshop content support too so the amount of levels you get with the game is limited only to creativity from amazing people.. 

Must buy for me!!"
20350,mishkata mi e pedal no igrata stava

20367,Hilarious and fun game to play with friends!
20368,Such human
20369,"Great game for playing with friends for a few hours at a time. Some levels CAN be a little frustrating at times, but overall extremely fun with lots of laughs. If I had to change something in the game, I'd say the addition of an OPTION for per-player level progress would be nice. Currently, any player reaching a checkpoint sets that checkpoint for all players which isn't the desired effect in certain cases.

Workshop is amazing for this game.

Worth the base price. 9/10"
20370,its mean it keeps making me fall off
20371,"I recommend this only if you have friends to play with AND you enjoy playing with physics to accomplish some random things. This is a slightly easier but more amusing 3D version of QWOP in the form of a physics puzzle-type platformer. It has been walking a thin line between frustrating control and amusing gameplay, but its crossed the line into frustrating control.
Occasionally awful camera views aside, I even tried using a controller, but that felt even more difficult to control.
I tried several instances of public multiplayer, but they weren’t particularly helpful or much more entertaining."
20372,Like the tittle said I fell flat.

20401,"this is an exceptionally fun game, especially so with friends. there are many different ways to do each level - which leads to my favourite method of playing, which is to figure out how you are supposed to complete the level, then do the complete opposite and try and complete the level"
20402,very fun game
20403,"Fun for all ages. Controlls take a while to grasp, but then it's really awesome. Kinda short, but workshop maps are cool too."
20404,"Fun with friends, 10/10 would play again."

20416,"The credits have fucking 600  different people for a fucking game made with unity,  this is a abomination of nature and a culmination of all that is evil and bad in this world. DO NOT buy this game, solely because of its horrific, terrible and nightmarish onslaught of positions and people who have no meaning other than that of a torture to the players and viewers alike."
20417,Awesome!
20418,
20419,Our idea to make a catapult using a player falling from the sky to fling the other person forward didn't work. 10/10
20420,Fun to play with friends I guess.
20421,"very good game i love it 
if you want a game of endless fun try
this game out"
20422,hi
20423,"Amazingly funny game, more people is more fun. Free climbing in this game is very tedious and sometimes frustrating. Puzzles are difficult and different enough that each one requires a new approach, without making you think ""ah its this kind of puzzle"". Only thing i didn't enjoy was snowboarding achievements, shit took 2+ hours to get because its buggy af. Also pulling friends off the map is addicting, but dangerous."
20424,"is good game lots of laughs 
"
20425,"Amazing game to hang out with friends and make new ones and its also great to show your skins and the levels can be very challenging but its so much fun. If you are looking for a multi-player and puzzle game in which you can also get skins, this is definitely your game!"
20426,Good game
20427,h
20428,DOPEEEE
20429,"This game is GREAT. But how would you (developers) care for the addition of mods? Like Minecraft, Doom (90's version.) and other games. It would be fun, and creative. Okay, thanks for viewing this. Hope this gets added, peace out. <3"
20430,Funny.
20431," Awesome, just buy it"
20432,"it's a good game

20450,a laugh with friends
20451,I've played this game for quite awhile and its very entertaining.
20452,I received this game as a gift from a friend and I love it. The puzzles are fun and open for multiple solutions. The Workshop also means you can play community made levels or try making your very own.
20453,yes
20454,Is good
20455,more maps more fun
20456,"Beautiful, silly, funny and adorable little platforming game filled with puzzles to solve. It's a great joy to play. There are a few glitches that can sometimes stifle progress. Namely a chain on a level that wouldn't respawn. However, there are many creative ways in which each obstacle can be overcome, so even the occasional glitch just forces you to be more creative.

Grab as many friends as you can, playing this game. It's a blast. You'll be giggling the entire afternoon."

20475,"The physics based puzzles are very enjoyable and creatively designed, and the nature of the game allows for some funny moments, especially playing with friends. The only issue I've had is high ping while playing with friends, but not much can be done when it's based on geographical distance between players."
20476,"this game is like your playing a drunken toddler. its very funny when you playing multiplayer, it sometimes has lag but across from that its a really great game and i would recommend it to you guys as a 5 star game. Good luck and have fun!"

20500,"I wanted to like this game and bought it because several of my friends have it. I thought it would be fun to mess with each other in the game - it looked super fun in the previews. 

What they don't tell you (and there is NO WAY to turn it off) is the constant wobbling of the camera back and forth. The character wobble is bad enough, but the whole screen wobble is too much for someone who gets motion sick easily. I even tried playing in a window rather than full screen and I can only stand it for a few minutes before I have a horrible headache and feel queasy. I would be more inclined to play if there were a setting to completely turn off the camera wobble. As it stands right now, though, this is a no go for anyone who gets motion sick easily."
20501,"good for ha rd thinker and having fun with friends

20545,It is a sandbox game with a purpose. learning the controls can be difficult but when you learn more there are so many things you can do. The levels are creative and the workshop levels are pretty awesome too!
20546,So I have been playing for maybe 9 hours and... SPEEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS. Its the best game you can ever find. Its also playable without wifi. All you gotta know is how to play then your lit after that. Btw I aint no robot if you are thinking
20547,its fun with people
20548,Extremely fun with friends and a good laugh

20557,Funnest  game ever made 🤣🤣
20558,"It's great. Although the physics are kinda dumb, it makes the game not boring. Played with a few friends and a family member, and had so much fun. Many levels have many ways to solve them. It's really cool. You should at least check it out."
20559,yes
20560,Didn't play yet but it's great 100% recommend
20561,"it's just good. Great physics, Great multiplayer capabilities, and great puzzles that you can solve however you want! (kind of.)"

20564,"This game is fun and interactive, me and my friend were laughing at the physics in this game and its not only the logic and physics it is just the game in general is great with how it lays out and the story to it this is just an all around amazing game, in all ways, in my opinion"

20569,"This game is incredibly stupid and clever all at the same time, it's charm is only succeeded by it's ability to make you work as a team to get through it's amazingly crafted puzzles/levels. Definitely buy this game. The only negative I have is that it's not four player over local network!"

20580,"As time goes by I noticed that I tend to play multiplayer games just to hang out with some friends rather than to compete and see my stats change.

Human: Fall Flat is an excellent choice for this kind of gaming sessions. The gameplay is simple yet very hard to master, and the game has charm written all over it. Even after playing for 10 hours, it is still hilarious to see one of my friends just miss a hard jump or see the physics of the characters completely mess up.

In all of the co-op sessions we had so far, we had a lot of fun. For this reason, Human: Fall Flat earns a very easy recommendation even at full price."
20581,"That was fun.
"
20582,Fucking good game
20583,yes
20584,So funniest
20585,Fun Epic but even better with friends. Oh wait sry you haven't got one :(

20587,               MEOW
20588,It's so fun to jump in and troll along with other players sessions. So fun to play with friends too so it's a buy!
20589,"Got on sale, worth every penny if you have a friend."
20590,if your bored you can just grab random people and dunk/suplex/throw/sister abegale/smack most of the players trying to mess the other players up
20591,So cute!
20592,gr8
20593,It's Funny Floppy And Fun! It's A Very Good Game And I Highly Recommend It To Other People!
20594,Cosby Gang
20595,"The first time playing this game there were so many people in our lobby, and for the first hour all we did was sabotage each other. It was great to have a really fun experience with so many people, lots of games limit you to only 4 players or so."
20596,Super fun and even more fun with friends
20597,I played it all the time on xbox and just bought it for my friend and we played until 5 am
20598,Silly and fun.
20599,very fun haha
20600,yes
20601,"its fun to play with friends,you'll have some challange in maps but in a fun way."

20610,"This game has a feature that if you can't figure out a puzzle, you can just painstakingly climb your way over or around any obstacle. Excellent design choice."
20611,yes
20612,Loads of fun with friends. Laughed until my sides hurt 10/10
20613,"Human Fall Flat is super fun once you get a hang of the controls, and it's even better when you're playing co-op. I would 100% recommend, especially playing with friends. :)"
20614,me gusta
20615,very fun
20616,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
20617,"When I first got the game, there wasn't much in the game. But now new mechanics and maps have been added to the game. I finished and deleted the game, but now I'm going to download it again. :)
This is a very fun game with your friends and you will definitely enjoy it."
20618,dou
20619,dude i would totally recomend this game! its amazingly fun and the possibilitys are endless. when i didnt have a gaming computer i turned down the settings to low and it worked fine! i totally recomend it
20620,boring without friends
20621,Very fun when played with others. Decent to Sad Puzzle when alone. :(
20622,so funny play with friend
20623,Great game for fun with friends. Quite a lot of new levels posted on the workshop would definitely recommend!
20624,"PvP is better than offline
<3"
20625,poo
20626,"I would only recommend this game to you if you have at least one friend you are going to play it with. That being said, if you do play this with a friend, its bound to be a great time. The wonky way your character controls and ability to kamikaze your friends off a cliff with you is wonderful fun. The game has some pretty good levels with a lot of different puzzles and mechanics, from driving boats and trucks to sending your friends flying via catapults (i demand trebuchets however as they are fundamentally superior). Where it really shines, however, are the community maps. From silly and nonsensical to small indie game quality levels, there is a huge amount of variety in content and quality to be found in the workshop. All in all, this is a fun little game that makes a great game night with the boys."
20627,it's fun
20628,Stress-relief game 😉
20629,Super fun to play with online people.

20666,wait to buy it until its on sale the game has sales often.
20667,Played this game with my girlfriend (none gamer) and she enjoyed it as much as i did. We will continue playing this game together. We both thought it was better to play with controller then keyboard.

20696,yes
20697,"Just bought, just played it with my friend for a few hours in the middle of the night and it was very fun and funny. Must be a whole different experience with a handful of friends rather than 1, plus considering this is a puzzle game with 50 solutions to one problem made it just fun to play. Plus you can just grab fans out the wall and plug both sides of a cord into a outlet and you go bye bye. Funny one right there."
20698,good
20699,"you dont need to do task to open a door and finding a way out, just climb the wall cause your hands are sticky,

20720,"Great party game, if you can get a party together; the devs have a Discord server to help with that. The only problem is that some people, myself included, have trouble with their joystick not working properly- to mitigate this I recommend using a third-party program that can make the controller emulate a mouse and keyboard."
20721,It's fun to play with friends

20748,"You have to be in a certain mood to like this game, and you need to be playing with at least 2 or 3 friends to really have fun. It looks really fun in trailers and stuff, but that's not the feeling you get when you actually play the game. It gets really boring and it feels like there'snot much to do. I feel like its more of an idea of a game than a game."
20749,Complete puzzles with your friends as a loosely controlled jelly bod!
20750,yes.
20751,Super funny!
20752,Finished this game twice with friends now and I can say it's EXTREMELY fun with friends and much easier. I don't see any problems with the game except for the fact that it ends. If its on a discount and you have friends that are interested you should definetly get it!
20753,"Unique to any puzzle game I played so far. Physics seem wonky, but are actually surprisingly accurate.

Worth about 4 hours of gameplay. But the 4 hours is all pretty good and refreshing.
Playing this over again is not worth to me. But there are some easter eggs.

Could be fun game to speedrun."

20789,GOTY. Hate fuck. Heroina. 10/10.
20790,"The game is fun with friends, Best to buy during a sale so all friends can afford it. The developers are nice and the game is well made. Some flaws are present but not big enough to ruin the experience overall. Some improvements can be making some more customization for your character like importing images for faces and such, more to do such as the electrical and plumbing parts were fun and interesting, 

Overall i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys adventure platforming games with friends. 
"
20791,"For the price, it is surprisingly good and with remote play it just makes it way better 10/10 worth buying.
Consider adding an option where we can play custom maps and create one too."

20797,very fun with friends
20798,"With all the steamworks levels, and the well designed base-game levels, I can see this being a fun, silly game to play with small groups of friends at least once a week. The physics are hysterical and manipulating them is a lot of fun. FWIW Multiplayer connectivity seems much better on steam than XBGP."

20803,.
20804,SUPER FUN
20805,"This game has a fun element to it, the characters are kind of similar to what I have seen in the game ""Gangbeasts"" , which means its dank through and through. First 3-4 levels are mostly instruction levels where you get to know the mechanics and then comes the real deal. The puzzle maps are pretty fun to solve and along with your friends the fun really gets to you. Also I must say after 3-4 level the difficulty level increases a lot. I'd totally recommend this to people who are looking to have some fun and use some brain otherwise you can almost always got to EU and get plat 3 , no brain needed there."
20806,eys

20853,Fun game
20854,This game is fantastic!
20855,"Lots of fun to play with friends. The controls will take a bit getting used to and it may frustrate you, but after that it's a hilarious mix of slips, falls, and ""Is this supposed to happen?"" moments. The workshop has a collection of levels you can play through if you get bored, and this game still updates with a new level occasionally. Overall, lots of secrets to discover and this is a very replayable game. Absolutely love it."
20856,"Great little casual game to play with friends online and or with a friend with remote play if they don't have the game.

It takes team work or you can attempt to do the maps alone. but its really fun wait for it to go on sale again for 6$ i would'nt spend 15 on it though."

20878,I think it was minecraft
20879,"Hilarious coop with friends!
It is hard to overstate just how well this idea works.
It´s slapstick, requires some thinking, a bit skills with the controls but (so far) never feels unfair. And once you overcome the obstacles with a friend, it´s immensely gratifying."

+ Easy to learn, medium to master.
+ Level variation
+ Plenty of ways to ""cheat""... Sometimes rewarded!
+ Free extra levels!
+ Fantastic multiplayer game!
+ Lots of customizing your own avatar.

- Racing achievements are neither fun nor satisfying.
- Vehicle controls...

It's been lots of fun."

21012,pp
21013,10 out of 10 would recommend. It has really silly physics. The multiplayer is fun to play because who wouldn't want to throw their friend's ragdolled avatar off a cliff? The controls are awesome! I would recommend using a controller because that's what I use and it's easy to control with one. Overall really good game.
21014,Good to play with friends.
21015,"its fun when you play with friends i play with my brother . i havent played by myself but i recomend thi to play with friends

21020,Get a few friends so you can grope walls and each other for a good time!
21021,"This game was released in 2016, however new levels were added recently even it is almost the end of 2019!  It is very addictive, sometimes you will get frustrated, but I can assure you that all puzzles can be solved before you smash your monitor.  Achievements and shortcuts encourage you to replay the game again and again!  Workshop and multiplayer definitely are bonus."
21022,There is so much you can do! The possibilities are endless!
21023,"well it is a challenge

8/10, good for relaxing or for flexing your mental muscles"
21028,"This game is awesome, if ur gunna play on pc I recommend having a controller because in my opinion it is easier to play that way"
21029,So much stupid crazy shit you can do and its even better with friends!

21039,"This game is fun.  Just pure, classic, physics based hilarious fun.  The only time it becomes frustrating is when you're desperately trying to reach that object with a long stick or pole for far too long... but even then if it's not enjoyable for you... it's twice as funny for anyone watching/helping.  The camera is probably the only real slightly upsetting aspect of it considering the direction your arms reach are directly related to where your camera is pointing... but the lack of control is what makes the game somewhat difficult and without it I honestly don't know if the game would be fun or challenging without it.  

The level design is also rather impressive, they don't bother too much with restricting you as there are more than one way to get to the next level... and even some ways I'm sure no one intended for you to discover at all.  Open-ended levels somewhat make me nervous because I get the feeling I'm going the wrong way or I'm not doing what I should be to accomplish the task at hand.  Even still, playing solo each level has taken me roughly 30 min to over an hour depending on how much I struggle to put a box on a button. lol

All things considered... then reconsidered... if you can laugh at yourself or your friends without shame and you're also a fan of any physics-based gameplay I don't know why you're reading this... you should be playing.  Even still they just released a X-Mas based level this year so content is still being added.  Stop reading... buy this and play with me because I have no friends. LMAO"
21040,yes it is:]
21041,"it a good game :)
"
21042,"Fun, neat and creative."
21043,This game is jolly good fun. Even my mentally retarded nephew and brother seem to enjoy it very much. It is the perfect time killer for people with mental deficiencies. Their uncontrollable laughter seems to indicate a good time. I rate this game 3 chromosomes out of 2.

21082,I played this game for a total of 16 hours and completed it in that time. I hope that they release more levels as this game was really fun and at times really frustrating. The controls are easy to manage and it is a really relaxing no-brainer puzzle game. Loved it!
21083,cool and challenging

21092,"WHY TF IS ROCK LIKE ICE!!! the entire level is comprised of rock, i dont know that many rocks that act like ice. some slopped surfaces you can climb, some you can't, figure it out for yourself, where tf is the consistency, like I get we're playing as the humans that act like squids but damn you got to figure out a lot in this game and when you find a path, it's like the developers decided, ""nope this isn't the path we wanted, slip off and start again"""
21093,Great game about experimenting with the environment to solve puzzles. Way more fun with two people. I love to play this with my kids!
21094,"The Finniest game ive ever played in my life. if you want to die by laughing, get this game and make sure u play it with your friends because thats the funny part!!"

21108,"Wow. I can't put how great this game is into words! The puzzels are fun, and the ragdols in combination with multiplayer makes the game great for joking around. I honestly don't think i have laughed as hard ever before as i have in this game.

Pros:
- Fun and challeging puzzels
- Cuztomisable characters
- Great potentil for speedrunning
- Advancments that give you reasons to complete the puzzels in new ways!
- Multiplayer both local and online
- Workshop support

Cons:
- Controls can feel anoying when trying to do complicated tricks
- The level ""Water"" is the bane of my existance

I recomend this game for everyone!"

21120,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
21121,"jj
"
21122,"Nice physics-based puzzle game. I love that you can play it alone or in multiplayer mode. It's great for goofing around and having a fun time with my kid. H: FF has some varied locations, nice physics-based puzzle challenges and difficult achievements to complete. It starts off quite easy but there will be plenty of things to do for sure.
Also, the developers keep adding new levels that are community competition winners etc. into the game - and adding them achievements as well."
21123,"I love this game. its goofy, fun, and funny. p l a y i t."
21124,My friend (who is like 5 years older) picked me up by the dick and carried me to hell so... i rate 8/8
21125,So cool
21126,"Human: Fall Flat is a wonderful and funny game. Best played with friends that you can talk to while playing. It's a very funny, physic based riddle solving game. The original maps are a lot of fun, but the community maps are even better! There are a lot of different solutions for each level and you can spend a lot of time on here. 10/10, would recommend"
21127,It's good
21128,Fun to play and cute.
21129,"Absolutely so much fun, even if you play it by your self its so much fun. But if you are playing with friends or family, Its even better :D"

21143,Drunk Simulator
21144,"If you get a few friends together to play this game it can be mindless stupid fun and laughter.

It is quite short, but they add levels somewhat consistently and the community makes plenty of custom levels. 

Worth buying for the laughs if nothing else."
21145,Nice game
21146,"The first time I played this I played it for like 8 hours straight, cried laughing like every five minutes, and ended up skipping (a three hour drive) and therefore a day of school just to play it late into the night. Best way to play is get a group of goofy friends to play it with you and hilarity basically automatically ensues. 10/10"
21147,ITS AWESOME
21148,Fun game with friends. I've cried laughing while playing this. Its a must have for any steam account
21149,Fun to f*ck around with some friends for a few hours.

21163,is a gud game
21164,is good.
21165,FUN
21166,"Absolutely amazing game.
I really enjoy Human: Fall Flat, but before we start with the things I love about it, there are issues. I will split them up with the classic pros and cons.

Cons:
  - No Latency Hiding on multiplayer games. This is extremely irritating if you have a high ping.

Pros:
    - Variety of interesting mechanics
    - Interesting levels in the campaign.
    - Can customise character with various clothing items.
    - Can even paint your character to add various drawings, symbols etc. 
    - Funny Player movement
    - Multiplayer levels that require effort of all players.
    - Very funny with friends."
21167,"fun, funny, challenging"
21168,"Basically all but ignored linux support for asinine and unexplained reasons. Usually that boils down to sheer incompetence. That alone warrants the non-recommendation, but this game has more problems going for it that I cannot recommend buying it at full price.

Gameplay is slow and clunky. initial impressions for me was that the physics were solid, but as the levels went on there were cracks. Points where it looked like the player was never intended to use or go for arbitrary reasons even though somehow I got there.

This was back when the game had linux support. Now they're mostly filling the cracks, but unfortunately they did it with the invisible wall treatment rather than working around it to make something fun.

The castle level was my breaking point: too much tedious crap that wasn't fun at all- just imagine what was beyond, how much worse could it be?

Conclusion?  One of those ""better with friends"" games that's more fun when watched by a streamer than actually played."
21169,"Best game ever made.

21180,superfun
21181,"★★★ simple elements, scene atmosphere

The sound of the little white man falling on the ground seems to sound very cool

☆ the number of levels in the game is not large, but the design is also very creative

★★★★ the game's physics engine is quite good, so that in their own pass at the same time more extra fun

☆ relative to the traditional game more interesting
"
21182,Fun. Timepass. Achievements are difficult to do. Pretty good game. Buy during sale.

I cant pass the first level."
21184,noice
21185,"Fun and engaging puzzle-solving game especially with friends.
A chat box could also be useful in communicating especially when playing in a lobby with others.
Game could however be much better if new maps were released more often."

21202,nice game
21203,"Although a bit hesitant at first, the game has grown on me. I've only played in single game mode so far, and even though controls can feel a little wobbly, its a nice relaxing and at times slightly frustrating puzzle game.

Update, I have now finished the game in single player mode. It feels slightly short, but if you get it at a discount, go for it. It's great for casual gaming when you have an hour or two to spare. Technically it is very well made and seemingly bug free, so well done!"
21204,great game. 10/2 would play again.
21205,Really fun interactive game

21225,"play only if you have more than 1 brain cell, then its fun"
21226,this is a very fun game i love it it is one of my favourite games the puzzles are fun the community maps are amazing and the physics are super floppy (good in my opinion) overall the game itself is fun.
21227,This game one of the best i have ever played
21228,Nice game
21229,"Hilarious and interesting physics games with a lot of cool, open-ended puzzles. Multiplayer is a necessity for this one, in my opinion - I played it the whole way through with a friend and we never stopped laughing and messing with each other. Maybe the biggest weakness of the game is that some puzzles are a little too obtuse to figure out, even with two brains, but in a way that just incentivized us to try weirder and more interesting solutions. It's a very fun and quick game that knows what it is and doesn't outstay its welcome."
21230,Super bad and annoying control
21231,.
21232,"Silly and fun, perfect game for people who like puzzles and rag doll physics"

21246,Tons of fun with friends. Community maps make this game fun for a long time.
21247,i think i have had the most fun in this game than any other.
21248,"I was looking up ragdoll and parkour games, and I came across this on youtube. I immediately wanted to get the game, and I loved it. There's [almost.] unlimited customization combinations, And if you can't make it the workshop might! This game is perfect for ruining friendships too.... If that's what you're into.
However, with friends you can do roleplays sometimes, ruin your friendship, maybe even play hide and seek or tag!

I personally recommend this game if you're into parkour, ragdolls and character customization."

21281,"A clever combination of puzzle, parody and platformer, Human: Fall Flat is easy to play and fun to lose. I'm sure I'm not the first to make a comparison to Portal, so I'll add my voice to the chorus: it's what would happen if you merged Portal and QWOP, except without the high-tech gadgets of the former and somewhat less infuriating than the latter. It is often surprisingly easy to cheat, or get into areas of the game where you're not sure you're supposed to be, not unlike the Stanley Parable, but the game is difficult to break and rewards creative solutions. Stylistically simplistic and careful to avoid any pretence of narrative, you may nevertheless find yourself lending depth to your sticky-handed avatar, especially if you take a minute to personalise her hair and outfit. Mine looked like a little girl in a pink pea coat and galoshes for most of the game, which did a lot to endear her to me (but did beg the question, ""what is this kid doing running around a construction site, or piloting a container ship?"") 

Very fun. Will play again, and hopefully find new solutions to the same puzzles."
21282,"Good game, lot's of fun but it's a bit short. Most of the community maps are shit so basically it's a fun 11 hours and then... nothing"
21283,"If you can´t talk with your siblings or friend. maybe neither the family becuse of the society addicition of game, phone and other addictive technology, then you can still have fun. And this game is prefect for having fun and for team work at the same time. So all can take a part of the fun, and ignore the addicition."

21300,"In of itself, it is already a very good game in a strong way.

To start with, i am a guy that doesn't like puzzles that much, at times when i can't clear i get frustrated after a short amount of time. But here's the catch, i haven't gotten frustrated in this game at all. i just completed the ice level, and with a semi-full understanding of the physics system i felt confident when i began progressing to a solution.

Though the levels made by the devs can feel few, but that's where the workshop comes in. At the time of writing though, to put it nicely, not worth looking through at the moment. But in the future there could be nice levels worth playing through. There's also a guide on how to create levels (haven't seen it through, can't confirm if it's good)."
21301,It's something to waste time in and have a point where you think you might die of laughter because of the dumb things you can do.

21312,"Really good game for single-player yet a lot better and more fun with friends.

I have no issues with this game as I think it is very enjoyable. However, I have come across a couple character glitches in the game where I had to reset the map to fix it - only had to restart the game one time because of this.
The levels aren't difficult and it is fairly easy to gain achievements - if you're looking to collect them."

But on sales it's totally worth it!"

21359,"One of the best physics-based games I've ever played hands down. It's infinitely more fun with friends and the amount of user generated maps and modes truly make this game even more fun than it already is. The devs truly care for this game, and it is an absolutely joy for me every time I see they've updated the game with a brand new map, the most recent one being Ice at the time of this review. All in all it's one of the best games I've played in a long time, if you're thinking about it I highly suggest you get it!"

21390,"A great puzzle game, fun with other players. Quite frustrating sometimes but hilarious when it's one of your friend that keeps failing.
It takes about 30h to 100% the game, but even after completing it, there's still a lot of fun things to do! Some achievements are a bit broken and you will need to redo the level again to unlock.
The game is constantly being updated with new levels. There are also plenty of levels to be found in the Steam Workshop.
And there is character customisation"

Human: Fall Flat is that type of game you would play with your friends gathered together on one couch with split screen whilst giggling and yelling ""Stop screen peaking!""

21502,if you get crushed you get launched into the outer realms
21503,"Initially underwhelmed, once I got past Level 4 the puzzles became increasingly interesting, more about understanding and utilizing the environment than just climbing and jumping. I recommend this game for the kind of person who plays The Witness in couch co-op mode. With more players it is possible to circumvent puzzles, but the game will be much more fun if you play into it.

Sweet spot imo is 3 players. More than 4 became very chaotic."

21513,"I really liked this game! It’s kinda hard but once you get the hang of it it’s really fun! The only issue I have is with the customizing the characters.

This game is a drunk person simulator trying to get around puzzles using your wit and sometimes brute force (or luck) to accomplish your way to the exit.

21582,"An incredibly fun game to play with friends but also great alone. 
No matter what way you finish the levels in the game, whether it'd be with your smarts or sheer dumb luck, the game will be enjoyable. And though, it might get a little frustrating or stress-inducing at times due to the controls, the amount of satisfaction you get when you clear that part of the level is enough to compensate for that."
21583,"Great game, lots of fun! Even more fun with friends!"

21590,"Even though the concept is very simple, playing this game with friends and solving the levels is super fun. Recommend this game to everyone"
21591,Love this game! It’s fun to think of ways to progress to the next stage and feel excited when you reach a checkpoint. Has new content every now and then plus there’s a workshop so there are plenty of levels to play through. Would definitely recommend :)
21592,Very funny to play with friends.
21593,Fun
21594,"This game is quite good, I like the fun puzzle ideas and the customisable characters. It is a lot more fun to play with friends rather than just single player though, so keep that in mind when making your purchase."

21602,"The best ""messing with your friends"" simulator.
With workshop, the potential is huge for this one."
21603,Amazing game! ;)
21604,This is fun game to play with friends
21605,"Very Funny and make us think better for solving problems
Enjoy this with your friends and make fun :)"
21606,Very fun with friends
21607,"fun with people, not alone"
21608,"Nice game, great puzzles but constant camera lurching and character wobbling is causing me nausea/motion sickness - can't play more than about 15 mins without having to quit."
21609,"Discover the funniest cooperative physics-based puzzle-platformer!
It's true"
21610,This game is fookin great
21611,Just an all around fun game to play with your friends on a friday or saturday night
21612,"Excellent multiplayer game to play with friends. With continued development and introduction of the community maps patch this game is in a great place, and new content is constantly being made available. Well worth the $15 and even more so if you find it on sale."
21613,"Funny with freinds
"
21614,"This game is hilariously fun! The way you move your character while doing certain tasks to reach your goal is very good. Customizing your characters including making your own is pretty unique though messy at some point when you're trying to editing the details. I highly recommend this game if you and your friends wanna have a laugh together. If so, then this game is definitely for you!"
21615,"gg
"
21616,Fuck me thought this was going to be a 30 min thing but just played 5 hours and couldn't stop laughing
21617,Excellent game at making you realize how stupid you are. 10/10
21618,It's fun and stupid but a good stupid
21619,Fun with friends
21620,Good Game :)
21621,Fun with friends! Enjoy watching my friends fall flat on their faces! Didja know the community hub skins are amazing and fun to apply to your characters?
21622,"Anytime someone asks me if I know of a game that's good to play with friends, this is the one I recommend. This is my go to for a good laugh - I just wish there were more levels!"
21623,xD
21624,Great fun game
21625,"Oui
"
21626,"You know how 3D Platformers can sometimes be really hard to control? Well, this game takes that problem and makes it a feature. That might sound terrible, but the point of this game isn't precise maneuvering, but instead watching your character bumble about haphazardly as you grapple every obstacle. It's a fun time. Trying to accomplish things as a faceless drunk is very entertaining, especially if you've got someone else to play with. Multiplayer makes things even better, trying to coordinate with someone else while you're trying to coordinate yourself makes for a great experience. They keep adding new levels every few months and probably will for the forseeable future. Workshop levels are also worth giving a shot."
21627,"This game has slowly become one of my favorite Steam games. This game is all about the freedom of the player. There are set instructions you are encouraged to do, but you can solve the level by just doing shortcuts. The levels are well designed, it's fun with friends, and it has a lot of replayability. There's also updates for free new levels, and has Steam Workshop levels for user-made custom levels and skins. 

I would personality say, ""Human: Fall Flat"", is worth everybody's time for a good time, and it is super rewarding!"
21628,"Fun little game I enjoy playing with my friends. Nice to see that they continuously update it with more levels, and the workshop feature makes it even better. Nominated it for Steam Awards"
21629,boom
21630,good fun
21631,Very chill and funny game to play with friends :)

21636,"Bought this for a sweet deal and I'm really impressed so far. The levels are very engaging and you can play online with your friends and throw them off cliffs for fun :) 
The selection of levels is a bit low in my opinion, but the community workshop helps fill that void and keep you entertained for many more hours!"
21637,NICE WITH FIRENDS + WORKSHOP SUPPORT
21638,This is a really good game to play with friends!
21639,bu fiyata kaçmaz.
21640,Only three words describes this game ULTRA MEGA AWESOME
21641,"I bought this game on sale thinking it was going to be a fun physics game, but tis more of just running around instead of the cool physics I thought i would have gotten, its more of just gang beasts and really no fun if you wanted what I did"
21642,nice
21643,"So much fun, couldn't stop laughing"
21644,i like it beacause i think its creative
21645,itssss so gooodddddddd
21646,"This game is a mix of challenging and silly. The co-op experience is often hilarious as a herd of people with very little coordination try to solve jumping puzzles and falling off the map. 

The developers have also consistently added new content for free and the workshop has added a lot to the replayability of the game with player made levels and costumes. It's a fun, casual game that you can play with friends on a random evening without a lot of planning."
21647,Interesting puzzler with wacky mechanics and plenty of potential to screw around
21648,ITS FUN WITH PEOPLE
21649,Very fun and entertaining game

the music is epic"
21680,"fun. silly. teamwork with friends. anger but good anger cooperation. destroys friendships but builds
"
21681,"If you're looking for a game to play with many of your friends all at once id recommend this. Cant imagine playing it alone cause most of the fun is stacking up over your friend's, pushing each other around, and working together as you try to solve puzzles to complete the map."
21682,Nothing is more important than happiness. This game makes me play with my friends very happy!
21683,asdasd

21695,Fun with friends
21696,gud
21697,"I actually have no idea how this game is this much fun tbh. It's mechanics are so unique. This game is also mentally challenging. For instance, when i quit playing, it feels like i had a math test that had like 100 hard questions. I feel exhausted after I've been trying to climb somewhere higher for one hour. I definitely recommend it. It's not a game to be played alone though. It would be great to have couple friends around to play this game with them since it's so much fun to play with them."

21706,adorable drunken blob of walking blubber simulator
21707,good
21708,funny man fall down
21709,"I love this game.

It covers a few genres, incredibly well, namely:

Puzzle - there are numerous ways to progress through each level and each has it's own unique mechanic.

Platformer - playing as an individual who totters around like they're ****faced has never been more fun.

Co-op - this is an incredible game single player, but add a friend (or three) and let the hilarity ensue!

Definitely worth the price, even more so if you have a friend over for drinks; you can hold hands and skip and everything!
"
21710,"yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa still having fun and climbing for nothing 
and cheers for endless fighting with friends , grabing their butt and turning them up and down 
and pushing them for falling the edge xD ♥"

21723,God will curse you if you won't share this game with your friends
21724,"I have been hearing good things about this game. Until I finally decided to play it with my gf. Let me just say that we loved it, it is quite simple yet complex at the same time, you need a bit to think and to coordenate to surpasse all the challenges!"
21725,great game makes me laugh every time xd

The wacky physics are part of the fun but the controls are not so wonky that you feel cheated on the platforming parts too often.  The community has made some great levels too, so once you've played through the game be sure to check out the workshop."

Like Gang Beasts with puzzle elements.

One of those games you really need in your library. 
Supports remote play and workshop. And on top of that it still gets updates, entire levels to be clear.

If you're looking for a fun game with friends that is not too expensive, i'd say go for it!

21930,"10/10 multiplayer, no hace falta explicarlo"
21931,Funny as FK
21932,the physics and an idea of user created maps is amazing its really fun game everybody could play and enjoy

21942,gud
21943,...
21944,"Play with friends, it's really fun if you do
"
21945,"This game is fantastically funny and engaging. We play this in co-op and the interaction you can have between the characters makes it so very fun. We are often in hysterics. The humans have so much character to them!
it is an achievable game for non gamers, as well as interesting challenges for gamers. So it suits everyone in our family. Recommend it to all!"
21946,not bad i got it for free
21947,:)
21948,e
21949,lol
21950,gg
21951,"its fub

"
21952,"While it made me laugh a lot in the beginning, due to fuzzy controls and characters, the controls are actually amazingly satisfying to master. This game probably has the coolest physics I have ever seen, which makes the difficulty to control stuff even more hilarious. When steam play, it is even easier to get a friend to play with you. Just buy it, it's really amazing!

EDIT after at least +10h: the game got even better as time went by! There are amazing new maps, with stunning visuals, released completely for free, with entirely new physics and mechanics that completely blew my mind. I'm not even gonna say what they were because that would be a huge spoiler. But these devs are amazing!"
21953,issa cool
21954,Great fun
21955,its good
21956,This game is so fu***ng good!!
21957,VERY GOOD AND FUN I LOAF TO PLAE WIV MY FRENDZ.

21959,For a game you can speed run in minutes I've clocked 21hrs. Must be some reason I keep replaying :)
21960,YEYEYEYE
21961,"This one of the best puzzle games out on the market!

Human Fall Flat is a game where you are a Ragdoll-ish human who is placed in worlds with a sires of puzzles to solve in order to get to the end of the level.  Your character is able to be customized to your liking with preset skins/outfits or a skin painter(skin painter is a bit tricky for me at least).  The game is also multiplayer in online or local play, so you can join your friends for some stupid fun!                                                                         The game also has a active workshop (at the time of this review) where people post awesome things like custom maps and skins!
Any one with money to spare and who likes mind games I HIGHLY recommend purchasing thisgame for some puzzle-solving stupid fun!"
21962,good
21963,"Very fun game indeed, especially while not playing alone, although random people might hurt the experience, so friends are highly recommended.

Official maps might take short time to complete, but there is a ton of levels in the workshop to download.
"
21964,IS COOL
21965,much fun

21972,Its good to play with FRIENDS
21973,Yes especially when i get to solve puzzles all over dr_piranhas stupid ass!!!!!!!!!
21974,"Fun, silly and great for playing socially with friends. You can bring it out at parties for people who have never played --and it's still fun if no one really knows how to play it. You wobble around clumsily, attempting to solve team work puzzles, accidentally knocking over everyone and everything. Very funny to watch."
21975,"fun
"
21976,"Pros: Can play with up to friends
Cons: Don't have friends"
21977,Freedom Style.
21978,"Nice puzzles, Great value at $7."

21996,If you want a game to play with friends and laugh a lot this is the game for it.
21997,this game is very very good but online is terrible i got called an nword and kicked from a lobby
21998,It's amazing no other words
21999,"I never cried 2 hours in a row because of a game. Having 8 people in a lobby is just a bomb about to go out. You don't need to complete the levels to have fun. Just explore, mess around, throw your friends off the edge of the map. ITS GREAT!"
22000,"I look awesome
I know it sounds crazy
but this little doughy body
is far from lazy

Im out here wildin
solvin and thrivin

I look awesome
Thats a fact
And if you wanna contest it 
Lemme bring you back

Grabbin them coals
Puttin em in the furnace
but dont stop now cause you know we aint through wit em
I raise my fists in the air 
I got two of em

Swingin and clutchin
Solvin puzzles with my bro
The application of physics is all that I know
The air is my domain

I simply dont have time
To listen to your drivel

So lemme remind you

Human fall flat is an awesome and hilarious game and continues to be one of my favorites to this day. 
I would recommend playing it with a friend if you can. I usually play it with friends online, although, I enjoy playing it both online and alone."
22004,Hilarious game to play with friends
22005,nice
22006,funnest game I've ever played

22010,cool
22011,"its good , i wish they add a co-op only maps , the onlines feels weird  only one player can do all the work."
22012,Hours of fun with my friends and we haven't had any problems with it ever! 10/10 from me! :D
22013,Very fun and silly puzzle game to play with your friends!a
22014,"It's not a game for me. The gameplay is slow and clumsy. It's not possible to select ctrl for jump (I use the arrow keys with my right hand), the spacebar is unreachable with my thumb. Tried using numpad ""0"" to jump with my little finger but that doesn't work very well either. Just looking around makes you fall off platforms without even touching the movement keys.
Also, it doesn't support linux so I have to reboot to windows for playing it which is not worth the hassle for me."
22015,human fall splat.
22016,I like play game cuz game i play fun cuz play
22017,Yes verry nisse
22018,YOU CAN MAKE FRIENDS ONLINE

22021,its like the epicness of gaming
22022,ok
22023,"am cumparat acest joc in speranta ca il voi aduce pe kyle inapoi, nu a functionat :*("
22024,"Fantastically great, with the addition of remote play together it should be even easier to make a bigger group. The more people the more fun."
22025,yee

22049,Haha this is great
22050,fun with friends
22051,"A very fun game, however, many of the new maps are not very enjoyable. They lack quality, thought, and achievements sometimes don't work. All of the original levels are absolutely amazing, and if you go the extra mile to achievement hunt, you will have a blast doing it. The newest released level gives some hope for more quality levels to come. But it is the first in a long time."
22052,very nice game
22053,The lag is annoying
22054,The game is fun and has multiple options on how to win even if it isn't a reasonable path
22055,FUCKING AWESOME
22056,10/10
22057,"NICE GAME, GOOD TO PLAY WITH UR FRIENDS
"
22058,"This game was super fun to begin with, but now with the workshop added, its so much better! now i can play more levels with my friends! this game is worth downloading!"
22059,"Dear Interested Customer,

Human: Fall Flat is a great game to play with friends however if you do choose to play it by yourself it will just seem like a puzzle game. Play with friends, don't play with yourself."
22060,！
22061,very fun and entertaining!
22062,"very nice
"
22063,"Official levels are enjoyable and so are a good chunk of community made maps. The game is great to get laughs in and there is nothing more enjoyable than watching someone attempt to learn how to play.

Unfortunately the workshop is filled with a bunch of 中文 crap. Everywhere. Literally plastered everywhere and the maps aren't even relatively good. I am not basing my rating of the game on this but just know if you're planning on getting this that you will be bombarded with way too much asian crap."

22077,game sucks but its fun

""Do you have Human: Fall Flat?"" ""Yes I do."" = play with friends with non-stop laughing.

Hope more new levels will be released!"
22085,<3
22086,If you have a group to play with it is 100% a go. If you are solo it is 100% a go! Blast of a game to play with. Bonus: Take a shot every time you drop a crucial puzzle piece off the map or someone falls off.
22087,Cool game

22095,controls are amazing not a moment of frustration
22096,"good
"
22097,It's pretty lame: having tried multiple times to join or host a game resulted in unbearable lag to the point of being unplayable. The levels I did play seemed bare and not fun to play without any kind of goal.
22098,"Fun

























if you're gay"
22099,this game is horrible. dont buy it. its a waste of money. i would actually rather play pubg.

22144,"I love this game its so silly
Playing with friends is so fun"
22145,you can throw minorities off a cliff
22146,"A classy little physics puzzler, probably up there with the Portal games. 

In my opinion.

Which counts for very little."
22147,love it
22148,This game is super fun. You play with/without friends in a immersive puzzle game. There's alot of fun levels and many courses to play through. But i think the game would be so much better with an in-game level editor.
22149,
22150,yes
22151,"Funny game to play with friends. You can go everywhere if you're stubborn enough to climb on walls, reaching unreachable. Game physics is good, your character is really clumsy but that's the charm. A level creator would be a nice feature :)"

22190,"If you have the cash, get this game. I have never played such a fun puzzle physics-based game in my life. This game is even better with friends and even then, the online community is relatively friendly and will cooperate with you in puzzles (as long as you’re not a dick). My game library is full of violent, gun-based shooting games and it’s gotten so stale so, I am so glad I bought this wonderful game. There are very little negatives about this game and an almost limitless amount of content due to the Community Workshop.

Rating: 9/10, just buy it (it may be puzzle-based, but even small brains like me manage to have fun)

22212,"Human Fall Flat always gets new updates. The developers are really on this game. The non-mandatory solutions are not too difficult, but also not too easy. Be sure to play with friends. The control is a bit hard to get used to but understandable. For 15 bucks a game, which you should definitely try."
22213,Funniest game ever! <3
22214,its great and super fun definately worth it
22215,The game is great for teamwork and thinking
22216,Probably spent half an hour going back and forth an obstacle I can't cross until I begged my friends to go to the next level. Very fun.
22217,"Fun game to kill time, Best to play with friends!"
22218,"One of the best, if not, the best puzzle solving game I've ever played. The puzzles are very creative and the game takes quite a while to beat. Once you do beat it you'll want to replay parts. There are often secret solutions and multiple routes. I've found shortcuts that let me skip 1 or 2 puzzles at a time. One time I traveled under the map like you would with monkey bars just to see if I could do it. Even cheating like that felt highly rewarding because it wasn't easy to do. It's possible to climb up a wall by swinging left and right by one hand and then regrabbing the wall at the right moment with the other hand. Once you learn techniques like this the possibilities become endless with where you can go. I highly recommend an Xbox controller for this game. To climb up an edge press up with the left joystick and down with the right joystick."
22219,Amazing game I love how you can grab your friends and throw them off cliffs

22225,"Like many of these wacky physics games, the novelty wears off quick and you're left with a game that's a chore to play and only worth playing if you're streaming or something.

22226,"I meant to play only a few hours, and somehow got sucked into so many more. The game play has a great balance of challenge, and flexibility in how the the levels are solved. Very addictive."
22227,"its good stuff
"
22228,"Absolutely the greatest Co-op puzzle game of all time. Do not get scared by the term ""puzzle game"" though, because using the entertaining as hell physics and teamwork you can usually find a second, third or fourth way to finish every level. With more refined gang beast-esque gameplay Human: Fall Flat is amazing"

22240,"I had tears in my eyes from laughing so much when I played this with my 7 year old nephew and that was not even in multiplayer.  At somepoint i got my hand stuck between a rotating windmill and a barrel. We couldn't continue because we were laughing too much more than once. 

+ very child friendly game. Kids can try it before you solve it
+ crazy physics
+ a new surprise in every map

It was cheap and excellent entrainment. We will continue to play it later...
"

22257,"I must say, I was hesitant on purchasing this game thinking it wouldn't be my kind of game but boy was I sadly mistaking. I not only bought this game for myself but after playing it for 10 mins I also bought it for my two daughters and we played this game for 12 hours straight. This is a great strategy game that has amazing physics and great teamwork! Probably one of the best strategy games out there! Highly recommended!"
22258,it fun game about climbing stuff and imagination.
22259,gvc
22260,"It's pretty fun, discouraging at first but you pick up on some tricks to get through the levels pretty quick. A lot of ways around doing any challenges, which honestly i'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing. Not much replay value, though."
22261,Can't think of any better co-op game :D
22262,its great fun to play with urr freinds i reccomend it

22278,"very fun i just can get enough of it, although i would like the old christmas map from like 2 years ago. besides that, tons of fun and always recommends to my friends"
22279,the game
22280,"Pretty good, crashes a lot"
22281,"I love game physics. and physics games in extention.

Theres just something so releaxing about seeing a computer program come up with how a thing should fall down, or how a cape or robe flows in the wind.

I'v bought games just becouse the capes looked cool. This is not on of those games you should know.

There is however an abundance of falling involved. and what els should you expect from a game with a title as this?

Human Fall Flat is a physics based puzzle game. However with the addition of workshop support there's also an abundance of great parkour maps you can jump, swing and slide your way through.

Not only that, but the game aslo includes a neat character customization mode, where you can dress and paint you human into whatever you'd like.

On top of that the whole game can be player online with up to 8 players.

This game is an acuierd taste. you'll either love it or never look back after about 5 minutes. its can be somewhat slow but this is really more a game too relax with then get into competition.

I love it and give it a solid recomendation!"
22282,It is a great game very enjoyable to play with friends so yeah play it
22283,very fun with friends
22284,yes

22311,Easily one of the funniest games I've ever played.  Simple mechanics.  Seamless multiplayer.  Cheap as chips to purchase.  Utter utter genius.  You'd be a fool not to.
22312,"A Great game to try new sex moves, it spiced it up to a new level and we could understand each other more with our genitals. It wasn't until we got to the best sex move and it only works once, my girlfriend was hanging by the fan and she fall on top of my knob at the perfect angle and I instantly spoofed. Too bad I can't tell her how great it was cause she stopped breathing. Other than sex this games rating is 4 out 5 Size 5 Sherrins."

22340,"Absolutely one of my favorite games of all time. It's funny, it's cute, it allows for so much player freedom in movement and puzzle solving AND you can play it with your friends. The main game levels are great, and the addition of the countless workshop custom levels only makes it better."
22341,A really fun game :D
22342,"Reeee
"
22343,it is a fun game for multi or single player. first level has positive affirmation narrations but the proceeding levels treat you like the little b*tch you are.

22345,"Lots of levels, challenging skill tests, great puzzles, amusing physics.  An elegant time waster."
22346,The most funniest multiplayer game i have ever played in a while. I really recommend this game to other people to play with their friends.
22347, i iu ui iuuiiuuiui
22348,"Jest to fajna gierka, wciągająca z znajomymi :D, polecam bardzo 9/10"
22349,Amazing Game! Perfect to spend some free time with.
22350,Very good game. it's like vr but without vr
22351,We had lot of fun playing in local !
22352,"Extremely entertaining for the first few hours. Best with friends! Loads of laughs will become you as you struggle to master the simplistic yet challenging control of your ragdoll. 

The first few official maps are tutorials, setting you up for the rest to come. 
After that, the more challenging ones will keep you busy for a while, and are great fun to explore and figure out the puzzles. 

However, the greatest problem with this game is that once you figure out the puzzles, the replayability is limited. Replaying the same maps gets old after a small while. 

There are workshop maps, however a GOOD workshop map is a rare gem hidden among a ton of utter rubbish. 
Official maps are amazing, and well thought out. Workshop maps, seldom so. 

There are a few workshop maps you can try out for some good fun, but they too get old quickly. 

10 hours in, I feel I've got just about everything I'll get out of this game. With new Ice level may go back to try that out, as well as any others that come out, but that's about it. 

Bottom line, buy it on sale. Good fun for a few hours, but not worth 20$ in my mind due to the limited replayability. 


"
22353,"Played it a bit, its ok"
22354,This game is fun in both online and offline so you'll be having fun playing this game no matter with who you're playing it with.
22355,fun game to fuck about on
22356,derpy game 10/10
22357,"เป็นเกมที่เล่นยากนิดนึง เพราะ
-ต้องควบคุมตัวละครให้จับสิ่งของต่างๆ
-ต้องคอยคิดแก้ปัญหาเพื่อผ่านด่านเสมอ
และที่สำคัญ !!
-ต้องเกร็งหน้าท้องตลอดทั้งเกม เพราะเล่นกับเพื่อนแล้ว แม่งฮาแบบ ฮาขี้แตกขี้แตน ขำกันจนปวดท้องตายไปข้าง 55555
โดยรวมถือว่าสนุกมากกกกกกกก เป็นเกมที่เล่นกับเพื่อนแล้วสนุกและฮาสุดๆ คุ้มค่าที่จะซื้อมาเล่นจริงๆครับ ถ้าเบื่อแมพเดิมๆ ก็ยังมี Workshop ด่านที่ผู้เล่นสร้างเองมาให้เล่นอีก แถมยังมีสกินให้ลงด้วยนะ ! แล้วแต่ละสกินคือฮาๆ มีมๆ กาวๆ ทั้งนั้น !!"

22421,Every new map I'm jumping on to grab the achievements and then explore. So simple and so well made.
22422,"Some laugh, can get frustrating but that adds to the laugh I think. The lads and I could play hours of this game and not be bored. But when you do get bored of it, or tired for that matter (cos the patience is demanding), it takes a bit to get back into it.  Community stuff as well is class, kicking about a physics based world as a Krillin mannequin, for example, is enough ample opportunity for failure but its hilarious."
22423,"Fun quirky game:) very emergent and fun puzzles
"
22424,I love grabbing my friends and throwing them off the cliffs :)
22425,epic
22426,grate game for adveturus puzzle solving people olso if you get bord you can ride of a building in a rubish bin!
22427,"I started with Gang Beasts and I really expected Human fall flat to be a cheap knockoff, but actually it's a slightly better, albeit different game. Rather than domination it focuses more on Cooperation and it really shines. 

The Puzzle are ingenious and what at first sometimes seems like an epic task is actually incredibly funny and satisfying once you complete it. Hooking up a crane to pick up a cargo container with a random French guy who spoke no English was the funniest experience I've had in a game for a long time. 

Far more depth to this game than gangbeasts and well worth it. I have not even tried the Workshop yet."
22428,fun
22429,有什么好说的
22430,"An okay, cool game in single-player. But multiplayer is where the real fun is. Played with a friend ""local"" with Steam Play Together Beta, sooo much more enjoyable. Definitely would recommend as a couch coop game. Controller recommended."

Definitely worth it"

22493,its really fun and not a time waster at all
22494,fun with friends
22495,"This game is awesome! I recommend playing it with (best case) 3 friends, then you will get the most laughs and fun out of it, while you solve puzzles and riddles together. The controls can be a bit frustraiting, but once you got used to it, its okay. You can also just join other players in their games and that can be really fun too. Its just hilarious how the characters move :D"
22496,"If you like slapstic fun puzzle games, then this game is made for you.
More fun with people however I played most of this game by myself."
22497,Well thought out game with plenty of community support. Developers still update it too. A great game that involves puzzles and cooperation without violence. Great for all players.
22498,Very fun with friends but make sure you all have good internet otherwise there is some delay for others but to counter that you can put graphics on lowest settings to get rid of some of it

22557,"I enjoy this game. It's a ton of fun to play with your friends, it's still fairly fun by yourself but it's definitely even more fun with a group."

22562,very fun game i fail so many times but still have fun with friends
22563,"Definitely worth playing with one or more friends. While it's insanely fun and makes you laugh, it also has levels that require time to think about the solution."
22564,Very great CO-OP game and it is the best when you play it with other people or friends
22565,"10/10,if your bored and got nothin to do,play this game"
22566,Super fun with friends. 10/10
22567,So much fun I cry laughing sometimes
22568,There seems to never be a wrong answer when playing this game. You can beat levels in so many ways and the achievements are fun to get too.
22569,"The jello physics are extremely detrimental towards an enjoyable experience.
It's fun to watch others play, but not so much fun to play yourself when your character routinely refuses to grab things, when any slight incline is actually a frictionless slide, when your required to jump off a movable object, but BECAUSE it's movable it's constantly teetering back and forth and trying to slide out from under you whenever you make any movement, most of those movements you don't even get to control because jello physics.

90% of this game is fighting against the controls.  10% is actual gameplay."
22570,"Gather up some of your dumbest/silliest, most creative and funniest friends and this game will give you the most memorable laughs you've had in a good long while."
22571,This game is good for laughs over fun puzzles

22586,"Its So Much Fun! Completing Quests , easy or hard is so much fun, it doesn't matter if you are single play or multiplayer. Also you can pick players up which I find a lot of fun to throw them off the map! lol. I laugh so much at how the characters are built its honestly amazing.You also get to make your character your own.I highly recommend!"

22630,Great fun multiplayer
22631,"This game literally gives you nothing but your ability to jump and grab stuff with your hand and i can still sink more hours into this than most triple A titles, altough sadly this is ONLY because of workshop content.
The base maps this game has are laughably lame in comparison to the amazingly fun and interesting workshop maps there are, but they are a bit challenging to find if you don't know what you're doing.
A fun puzzle/parkour/strategy game to play with friends"
22632,"A fabulous multiplayer game. Has single player functionality but is definitely best played with a couple of friends, Also better if none of you have the solutions when trying to solve the puzzles. Leads to laughs and generally a fun time."

22641,game....... good.
22642,"This game has a unique platforming and puzzle solving theme to experience. Theres lots of customization when it comes to creating a character, and the workshop is always busy if you can't make your own. People might have already made the character! The game alone can be pretty bland at first but the more you play, the better (trust me), Plus it's even greater with friends!"
22643,"multiplayer shenanigans galore! occasionally frustrating, always hilarious. The ability to grab your partner by the seat of their pants and shove them in a furnace is a major highlight of this game."

Please for the sake of the developer do not buy the game from a 3rd party website, but buy it through steam. They really deserve it, and the game is not that expensive =)"
22669,good ghaem
22670,Wacky fun that keeps you up for hours and you end up losing track of time and are late to work every day and they end up firing you because you're consistently late to work but maybe it's actually because you don't know how to do your job either because all you do is think about HFF. It's a great game

22693,great game but play with friends
22694,YES
22695,Awesome and amazing
22696,"This game is so much fun.  The new ice level was a lot of fun, and free.  Thanks so much for the effort put into this game."
22697,"yo wtf happen to my game, where is it in my library"
22698,It's endless fun and I've made sure to get 100% completion every time a new update comes out. My only complaint is that there aren't enough levels yet but I'm hoping over time the devs will keep it going like they have been and keep me drawn in. v

22708,Super fun and Silly with Friends xd
22709,Adorable fun as a casual experience with enough depth and character to be memorable. I'll always redownload this every time they add a new level - what a great dev team! The controls are very simple but using them takes some time to master and gives this game a lot of depth as a speedrunning game. The level variety is decent and there is enough of them that it will take a good few hours at least to complete that first run.
22710,"it aight

22711,It will make you laugh & have a good time!

if you have friends or like speedrunning"
22716,"This a game for beefy dudes just being dudes lifting weights without shirts on. When you aren't lifting you are working your legs running like the manimal you are. Absolutely savage. You work those arms and work those legs doing construction work like a machine, because we are savages. No manlets allowed. This game is for Chads only, 7 inches or longer. If you don't have these desirable traits this game will transform you into an absolute unit, giving you them gains because this game is the most masculine and extreme testosterone filled piece of media ever created.  This isn't a woman's game. It's just for guys and like there's nothing weird about it man."
22717,"Even when I play alone, I still have a lot of fun with this game. Anyone who learns and understands the physics and mechanics of this game can pass all the levels without playing the game as it was intended to be played. In other words, you can fly around maps and climb walls you're not supposed to climb. The custom character models are always fun, and the level workshop has great selections when you've completed all the main maps. 10/10 highly recommend."

I highly recommend giving this game a shot, you'll love it once you get used to the (intentionally) wonky controls and general game physics."

22830,Fun
22831,"I have played for an entire day's time this game and all I have on my mind now is how to solve puzzles the way they were not intended, like climbing a mountain that could take 30 minutes to one hour in order to complete the level without going through the level, how weird can the game get if you hold an unstopable force with an unmoveable object and many more things that involve different ways to complete a level the hardest or easiest way possible."
22832,really fun. Watch neebs gaming!

22838,human fall flat is an awsome game when you have fineshed each level go back ther are two ways throught every level. also you can play other levels comuinity created levels and build them you can also play online with up to 8 players.

Most of the puzzles aren't overly challenging and there are multiple ways to solve them (or break them for maximum hilarity.) It's a great game to chill and play around with, but it's a LOT more fun with friends. There's a level customization option now too, though I haven't played around with that yet. But, yeah, as for the game overall: definitely recommend it, especially if you have a few friends who want to have a great time for a couple hours."
22870,its aight
22871,"This game is really fun, and is really great for co-op (if sometimes a bit frustrating). Some of the levels have a bit too much platforming for my liking (the controls can get annoying), but the game is great overall, and I'd highly recommend picking it up!"

22920,Surprisingly funny game ! have a lot of laugh with my friend. Worth buying.
22921,Fun Multiplayer and single player game exsplore all different maps and download new skins. This game is based on sorting out things and working together with your freinds. Each map has its own different thing if your new and need help freind me or ask me in the comments. The puzzles are very easy its not like a mystery game you just have to build ur way up the reason i downloaded this game because i watch youtubers play it and it seems fun. I think the game is fun personally but some people may not think the same way its just my opinon. Its fun try it out like i  said message me or freind me so i can help you game not that exspensive its very cheap. Hope this summary exsplains more about the game to you
22922,"its a fun game and i would highly recommend playing. The only down side is, it gets boring after a while, so i would say to play with other people."

22935,its very fun and easy and you can make friends.and you can play a lot of lobbies and make your own character/skins.
22936,Very fun game to play with friends. Best 15 euros ever spent. 10/10
22937,"This game is hilarious mayhem. The puzzles are all pretty straightforward, and there are often several different ways to reach the next checkpoint. ""Dying"" has no penalty, so you're free to explore with no real risk. The levels really shine when you team up with a few friends, however. Mischief is encouraged as much as cooperation - this is not a serious game. There are also a ton of excellent Steam Workshop levels to try out, so IMO it's worth the purchase, even at full price."

It has a wonderfull a soundtrack, good IG-physics and of course nice riddles.
The maps are looking good and you can explore literally every single place in this game. Not on the way like the game says but still have your fun with climbing.
"
22948,I like puzzles.
22949,"Well, Its everything you would want in a game, funny characters, all laughs, But yeah apart from that its a good game with some nice levels, but because of the lag ill give it about 9/10"
22950,"Its really fun. you play puzzles/quizez but in 3d and you have to figure out how to get out of that world.. You can change your charcter. Draw on him. Dowload models from workshop and more. Its for controller, keyboard and more multiplayer and singleplayer~!!!!"
22951,"this game is fun

i also genuinely am attracted to the climbing maps
very cool"

23031,Good game
23032,"My 7 year old loves this game. The characters move in a very silly way, and it's fun to mess around with the physics and have your guy get launched by catapults and stuff. Even without him it's a fun game to mess around with, just wait until it's on sale."

23052,10/10 would stuff friends in trash and push them off a cliff again
23053,I heavily disapprove that the Linux release was silently deprecated and we were left on an outdated version. Being forced to use Proton is annoying and the game is effectively broken now because it also doesn't launch any more.
23054,A really fun game to play with frnds
23055,ITS pretty fun with friends

23058,"An excellent time with friends, and still enjoyable on your own."
23059,"This game was a blast! Played it with 2 friends and we all had a great time.

After having played all the default levels, I do recommend to play with at least 2 others.

We'll probably come back after a few weeks to see what the workshop has to offer.

I did however experience some FPS drops when playing on max settings.
Not sure if the game isn't well optimised or if it was because I had some other porgrams running.
But you would think a i5 6600k and a GTX 980ti would be more than enough to run the game.
Didn't bother to check their load or temp. just turned down the settings to just above medium and the game seemed to run fine.

23075,Fun to play with friends.
23076,"Before tearing into this game for its various problems Ill start with the good.

Warning - Swearing ahead | This game seems to have a semi young fanbase so if you live in a good christian household I would advise skipping to the TL:DR at the bottom.

Human Fall Flat is a truly great game overall and Ive had plenty of laughs and enjoyment in this game. Its physics based movement is great and is a great change from the traditional movement of other games, the way you're able to interact with the world was jaw dropping for me the first time I played, the puzzles are great and levels are even better for visuals and design you can tell the Developers truly put their hearts into the levels and thats very lacking in the modern gaming scene. workshop support ontop of this allows of nearly limitless maps to play on.

Now for the bad which is mainly one huge problem, that being lag


Oh good lord the experience this game provides can be almost entirely ruined by lag and delay in your movements introduced when playing non-lan games. as some if not all of this games puzzles require some form of precise movement/timing having nearly a half fucking second of delay from when you press your button to when your character preforms the action is unbearable and has caused me to quit many online games. if you play online you'll find yourself missing jumps, diving off ledges when you pressed space and even walking in a straight fucking line can be a challenge as you will overcorrect because it takes so damn long for your character to do what your keyboard is telling them to do.

Im not even sure why the lag is so bad, maybe the physic based movement really doesnt mix well with online servers as I assume it almost all has to be done server side and nothing can be Client side and then updated for other players like how most games deal with movement and actions online. It really doesnt help theres not a single way to actually view what ping you have or what ping servers will have if you join them, so just blindly seeing if a server is somewhat playable is exhausting and tedious. 

Other smaller problems which I wont elaborate too much include

Allowing people to grab other players with no way to get them off without kicking them can be extremely annoying and easy to abuse and piss people off

Developers have been known to patch out certain techniques that abuse the games engine allowing people to skip parts of levels or puzzles which for a non competitive couch coop type game is extremely counter intuitive and plain fucking stupid in my eyes, but as a casual player I dont care too much, but I can see the issue.

Certain levels puzzles have literally no guidance as to what to do especially on some of the later levels which is an extreme whiplash coming from the earlier levels which have a great flow to the puzzles. It seems they sometimes try too hard to make open ended puzzles to the point of being so god damn blank with instructions skipping them is preferrable to grinding your brain cells away actually figuring out how to do them, which for a game based around puzzles is really fucking dumb.

Im sure I missed some smaller points but thats my basic view and opinion on Human: Fall Flat.

TL:DR

Absolutely amazing game with a unique and interesting movement and interaction system great replay value, and very fun with friends, lag is a big draw back so beware before putting your money down, dont come looking for a great online playable experience because it isnt here at all. If you have a group of friends who dont care about lag or all live close enough to set up lan 100% go for it, but if you dont put your money somewhere else or wait for a sale.

I would love to give this game a recommend but simply cant, 15 bucks for game only enjoyable on your own and in Lan multiplayer isnt worth it in my eyes and until the lag problem online is fixed Its going to stay that way."
23077,it good
23078,Gud and funny... LUV IT!!
23079,Cool Game. So funny...
23080,Stian get this game
23081,"Pretty nice game. Great to play with family :)

PS: Unfortunately there's no moderation in multiplayer mode. Disgusting! Don't let kids playing that!"
23082,berry good game with friends

23088,I love Human! It's SO fun when you have a bunch of friends and we all have it to play together! I play with my brother all the time!
23089,this game is good!! hahahahahahaha!!!!
23090,"One of the best casual sandbox games to play and mess around with friends. I definitely recommend.

Although if you don't have any friends, you can play solo but it tends to get quite lonely due to game design and the lack of AI."
23091,"fantastic for parent / kid gaming. zero inappropriate themes or language. just goofy floppy characters trying to escape puzzle levels using the environment. there's a ton of paths to the finish too - some paths are as the level designer intended, some are roundabout back doors that get you secret achievements. 

very fun game - but also very frustrating if you don't like puzzles because sometimes the solution isn't obvious...until you solve it, and then ""OH OF COURSE!"""
23092,"Two words: MOTION SICKNESS

This game is actually fun and me and my daughter were having lots of laughs. But the way the camera shakes like crazy makes me (and lot of people, it seems, just google it) sick very quickly (20 minutes tops). Beyond that, the way the controls work makes this worse, because your hands will go where you are looking and if you walk while looking up or down, the view automatically goes to the front.

In short: a mess. Some of these complaints could be addressed by the developers, but it doesn't seem they are willing. A shame, I really wanted to keep playing."
23093,I love the game but whenever I try to play split screen on MAC the controls for second player stops working every 3s. This is serious issue that stops me from playing.
23094,"One of the funniest games on steam, so many laughs."
23095,"7/10.
6/10 alone, 7/10 with friends.

Fun game to play or just mess around in, community made maps, some developer made maps,

This is a game of simple puzzles some of which feel rewarding to get right.

Also has custom skins which are nice."
23096,"O jogo é bom, se jogar com amigos, jogando sozinho o jogo perde a zueira kkekskdekseksak"
23097,yea
23098,Best game ever for a group of people. Very fun and difficult game. If you are playing alone I don't recommend to buy this game.
23099,this game is worth every pennie
23100,"After buying this game for 5 minutes, I have to immediately write this comment because the way you enable Split screen/ local coop SUCK ASSSSSSSSSS. HOLD to join Player 2??? Hold what? Hold your dick? Were you high? developers? Tell me which button, can't you? Turn out I need to hold the ""OPTIONS"" button on my PS4 controller. MY GOD!!! Wasted me 10 minutes in googling. Even google couldn't help me because a lot of idiots keeping saying hold the trigger button and I don't know that the hell they are talking about. WTF is a trigger button?? Jesus. This is earth, please do something that humans can understand!"
23101,"Good game,fun game to play with friend

69/10"
23104,"Human Fall Flat is one of the best games ive ever played. The graphics are beautiful, runs on a bad computer, and doesnt use too much CPU.

I would recommend this game if its on a sale, i rate it 8.6 out of 10."
23105,"Gang Beasts like controls and mechanics, but simplified and watered down, gameplay gets extremely dumb after a few levels,

At the docks, I spent over a third of my time, nudging a boat, and then managing cargo cranes to make a bridge, and my rage inducing killer just after: 
Chained rafts on a current, where the main item, a 2 ring chain, that was supposed to be used to hinge the boat to the level and prevent it from being taken by the current, fell into the water and did not respawn. making my coop with a friend extremely frustrating for the last few minutes before I said to him to refund this physics-luck based POS.

Jelly controls and combined view/grab mechanic is nauseating alone, [b] THEY MADE IT SO THE CAMERA SNAPS TO HORIZONTAL LEVEL VIEW WHEN YOU WALK AND TILTS BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS VERTICAL ANGLE UP OR DOWN WHEN YOU STOP MOVING, INDUCING MOTION SICKNESS [/b]"
23106,GG
23107,"Wow, interesting!"
23108,Human that falls flat
23109,"The game revolves around you, a person know as a ""human"". You can play the whole game by yourself or even invite your friends in online mode, and with the game's nonstop updates you're sure to get new levels. You can also go to steam workshop to find levels created by other people around the world, you can even make your own. This game is honestly one of the best for me."
23110,The developers silently dropped Linux support and only said something after they were questioned. Unacceptable. Don't trust them.
23111,"Great Puzzle-ish game love how you have to use your brain to find your way around the map.

如果能统一分配一起玩的朋友就更好了"

23135,Clever (custom) Levels.
23136,"A blast with friends. The physics-based mechanics make for some hilarious moments. And now, with the addition of Steam Workshop support, it's a must buy."
23137,"Very fun, I love the game it is VERY funny, I almost died of laughter multiple times. One little thing that sucks is that its laggy, but thats all!"
23138,"An immensely simple, yet deeply gratifying little physics based puzzler. Strikes just the right balance. Totally worth it. Have only dabbled in the co-operative play. It can make the puzzles a bit easier, but it's just as fun in co-op as it is solo. Works well on low end machines with a few tweaks as well due to it's aesthetic. Excellent controller support as well. Avatar customization is also simple yet fun. I have not played anything else quite like it."
23139,"This game had me laughing for 10 straight hours during a game night with a group a friends. We battled each other, pull each other off of cliffs, solved puzzles, completed complicated workshop parkour...never had so much fun in a game that kept me laughing every single minute! Amazing experience. Recommend 100%.
So grab a group of friends and go crazy!"

23141,"Pretty goofy little game you can play with friends. Levels and Character customization are great! (Especially with workshop) The physics are what make the game with your little marshmellow man runnin around with his lil stumpy legs.


Quick fun game best with 2-8 people. 7.8/10"
23142,This game sucks i cant run it on my Macbook Pro
23143,BAKCHOD GAME
23144,"Wacky, brainless fun. Screwing around, solving puzzles and messing with game's physics is super fun. Definitely recommend."
23145,Its very good and funny game me got a lot interes for playing it this game.
23146,Ive never had such a hilarious time playing a game with a friend. I literally sh!t myself laughing every time I play this
23147,"very very fun game, especially with a friend. oh the things you can do! Labour of Love Award for sure!"
23148,Bought this by accident and now I can't return this shitty game
23149,cute鸭！
23150,its shit
23151,"a fun game, it has workshop so there are alot of maps to try, could be good if u just want to chill and maybe watch videos on the side or something.
i'd say the price is alright for this kind of game but if ur not sure about it wait for a discount."
23152,"The first login encountered a problem with God's perspective! Restart the game back to normal, the lack of regular game matching voice chat function, high delay in the country! Games are fun! 90 playability! It is recommended to open black entertainment is better"
23153,"There is no normal support of ofline maps, all threw down on a workshop.
you constantly get kicked from a lobby even if you help in passing levels, for no reason, those who throws down players and the ruiners still plaing(not their friends), bunch of retarted kids without a understanding what here needed to do.
A game turned out good, but collected garbage in itself only
Ah and yes, 10 kicking idiots that can not create private lobby from 10

Нет никакой нормальной поддержки офф карт, все скинули на мастерскую.
Тебя постоянно кикают из лобби даже если ты помогаешь проходить, просто так, тех кто скидывает и руинит прохождение оставляют, куча малолетних даунов без понятия что тут нужно делать.
Игра получилась хорошая, но собрала в себе только мусор
Ах и да, 10 кикакющих идиотов которые не могут создать приватное лобби из 10"
23154,yes
23155,"pretty epic game
I love yelling at my friends"
23156,Funny
23157,funny and fun can be quite hard trying move them around but funny reguardless <3
23158,Great Derpy Puzzle Game! Pillsbury Parkour Challenge! Don't forget to download your favorite skin as a preset.
23159,"9/10.
Fell flat on my face, played as kyle from south park, smacked someone with a crowbar."
23160,on pc its ass
23161,"Hilarious game to play with your friends! I love the puzzles and the gameplay mechanics, and the fact that the devs are constantly updating and bringing in new levels. Keep up the great work!"
23162,just perfect :D
23163,LMAO
23164,i'm walking around as a really white guy who looks like he is constantly blacking out. so its like a third person view of me
23165,"If you want to have a good time with or without friends there's no way I wouldn't recommend this game. The physics engine has potential to cheese some levels which makes it have crazy replayability. There are multiple ways to beat each level and several ""secret"" areas to discover.  Overall a good time and would hope others have just as much fun as I did on this game :)"
23166,The best game
23167,The best game ever (this is one of my favorite games)
23168,can i get a refund on this game?
23169,"The game was really great,the game may be really short but it also could be really long,depending how you play it, i would actually buy another if there was 1"
23170,"Tried my best to not twerk
Failed"
23171,its aight
23172,Good game but needs some more missions
23173,"I have actually only played this game for about an hour. (I left it running accidentally... oops!) It's really clever and interesting. The co-op element is great too. I want to play this game because it is great, but it gave me terrible motion sickness with all of the close up angles. I can't play for more than 15 minutes at a time without feeling nauseous."
23174,"Pretty fun, always a enjoyable experience."
23175,⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
23176,Best game 10/10 better with friends!
23177,"Funny, easy puzzle

But the shaking of camera make my head spin"
23178,Накачал пресс смехом
23179,"It is very rare for me to be so incredibly angry at a game, and still having the time of my life. This game is one of the only ones to ever do that for me. In fact, I love this game so much I will go ahead and label all the ""bad"" parts about this game. 

THE BAD: Nothing. I don't know of any ""flaws"" per-se that were not already intended. The goofy physics will always make you chuckle, and the crazy camera helps with the immersion. That is all I can say negatively about this game, honestly.

THE GOOD: This is the funniest game I have ever played. The rag dolls after being flung 500 mph are fantastic, and the fact that you can grab your friends and throw them around is too funny to be real. The levels, while not mentally challenging (for the most part) are fun to figure out, and make you feel successful for being able to fly onto a rock, and pull yourself up. This game is just so great, I am almost at a loss for words. Buy this game!!!

STRONG: 9/10 to a LIGHT 10/10 Easily!"
23180,I bought this game for me and my best friend and we had an awesome afternoon.
23181,So much fun I had with my friend!! Just wish there are more levels
23182,very epic
23183,"It's ok playing it alone,  but way better playing it with a friend."
23184,Funny.
23185,This game is so dumb. I love it!
23186,bemis
23187,"This is my favourite party game! Whenever a new level gets released, I notify all my friends and we play through it. The steam community has made this game virtually endless and I can't stop playing!"
23188,GG
23189,"Perfect score for me.

Though sometimes can be tedious and frustrating if you're not god-level at this , it stays fun because it's completely skill based and physics based. It fills the role that so far only portal managed to hold for me being a physics action/puzzle game with a sense of humour."
23190,"Great Game! 

To see 8 people trying to move a plank for 15 minutes, is just plain funny :D

23215,"It's fun to play. It's very pleasant and satisfying.

23224,Fun game full of fun really fun
23225,Very GoodGame
23226,10/10 best game to play with friends. Taught me how to lift my friends and throw them off a cliff
23227,FuckingFUNNY!
23228,"Smoke a blunt
Invite some friends
Let the magic happen"
23229,This game is pure humor and tears. Especially since i got it on sale for 50%. If only more of my cheap friends would play a game that's purely for fun. The puzzles are also cool too but the mechanics overall just make for hilarious gameplay. $15 bucks is reasonable but 7$ is a steal.
23230,very relatable game
23231,THIS GAME IS FUCKING  B O N K E R S
23232,Most fun I've had in years.
23233,"If you're opting for a fun, interactive platforming game, this is the best option for a wacky, funny experience with your friends. You can customise your avatars and let others see it and download through Steam Workshop,  custom maps and more. If you're really ready to laugh your head off, this is the game for you."
23234,"Love the game. It very entertaining with friends an i love how there's more than one way to beat a level.
"
23235,"An excellent physics-based game that comes with great level design, totally recommended if you're going to play with a friend!"
23236,"This game is so much fun and funny.And I highly recommend it to others and you can even download community creations levels,lobbies,Characters and it's so much fun.There are a lot of characters in the workshop and so much levels to play are in the workshop.Download them for free and have fun with this game."
23237,It's funny at first but the controls become more frustrating than entertaining after a while.
23238,"The game is marked as having Linux support, however, the support has been dropped a long time ago and it's impossible to play online. The devs know about this issue yet refuse to remove the Linux support tag just to trick some Linux users like me into buying the game thinking it has native Linux support. Luckily, there is an option to force Steam Play anyway."
23239,This game is extremely boring to most people that like gun games. The music needs work and the online also needs work.So i say don't get it is the biggest waist of money ever!
23240,yes.
23241,"this game is so fucking bad
Its so laggy and I have a gaming pc it sucks
I dont recommend this game at all!"

Notes:
The game is a puzzle solving game, with rag-doll like movement. WASD to move and right and left click to grab. Have you ever played ""Getting Over It""? It can get that frustrating at times, especially if you play for a while or after a difficult day. The one complaint I have is how frustrating the mechanics are, and its not even a complaint. I just get really frustrated when it doesn't act the way I want it to. The level design is either intended for speed-running, or idiotic. There are entire sections of levels that can be skipped by giving it some thought, and I like that, but there are some places that seem like they didn't try to prevent skips. 
I have never encountered a bug in my 20+ hours on this game, which is awesome. Plus, they release a new level every once in a while. I got 20 something hours from doing a couple of plays and all of the achievements, and you could get even more from downloading levels from the workshop. All in all, I think that if this game is on sale, you should probably grab it!

9/10 because of some frustrating late nights trying to get some achievements!"
23243,"I love this fun game.

The only problem is that the head bobbing makes me feel sick in 15 mins every time I play this game. Changing FOV or smoothing won't help. It's the first game gives me motion sickness.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated on 12/02/2021:
I have not idea if devs have fixed this issue or I'm used to it now.

And the Chinese New Year lobby is amazing!"
23244,Hilarious game xD
23245,yes
23246,Fun Game
23247,"The game is completely fine, but falling flat is just abusing yourself in the game. The game makes injuries is you die, and the falling is much like dying in real life to us! We literally fall on our stomachs in this game!"
23248,blob man
23249,"Very entertaining, you will spend hours and hours trying to figure out the puzzles, only to slap yourself when the solution was right in front of you the entire time."
23250,Letoy ih kayak punya kamu....
23251,I thought this game would be fun and silly to play with a friends as I have slow paralyzed hands. The developers have taken to trying to make it some sort of weird physics based speed running game and nerfed the movement time and time again making it more and more unplayable. Save yourself the money on the carpal tunnel doctor and just ignore this trash can.
23252,"You should play it with your friends.
And you will always laugh until your stomach hurts."
23253,n word pass will be instantly taken away if you are caught playing this game.
23254,very fun game
23255,"jogo não me custou nada, nem lembro como ganhei, mas não curti, não é meu estilo, talvez para quem gosta bastante de quebra cabeça e desvendar esquemas seja maneiro, é o único apelo do game, eu passo!"
23256,Really fun to play with friends! :D
23257,Very funny game. Especially if you play with someone.
23258,"cmon this type of game is just so f-ing fun ! even the first intruction part is just amazing!

+1 for the graphics too! hell yeah buy this game, and yeh I'd rate this game as a 10 out of 10,34½"
23259,Most funny game.... just host and play with your friends ..
23260,"Throw your friend off the ledge, you won't regret it"
23261,"Simple controls and a LOT of fun to play with friend(s). Several ways to get past many challenges.  I would like to see more maps available, but its a good value for less than $15."
23262,hmm yes
23263,Drunk man attempts to find specific door way to fall to his death. Significant structural damage occurs where ever he wanders. 9/10 would commit drunk arson again.
23264,"I love this game and so much fun with my friends, I highly recommend this game."
23265,"If you want to have a good laugh with your friend then this game is definitely for you!
Two minutes into the game and im already wheezing"
23266,"Me and a friend went through a railroad yard trying to work together.

It lasted 5 seconds before he shut a door on my and my hand got stuck. I'm still there to this day. 

10/10."
23267,Workshop content makes this a decent grab.
23268,I bought this game for 5 people now.
23269,Good Game
23270,this game is ok !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
23271,"Very fun! you can breeze through the dev made maps in like 2 hours, but community maps make it worth!"
23272,good
23273,"I finished all of the levels so far, and really enjoyed working out the puzzles. Some were more complicated than others. The fingers on my mouse hand got tired, I played it so much. For some reason, concentrating on holding on to things made me press the mouse buttons harder... like that would somehow help."
23274,is fun
23275,"please help, i use mac and when i try to play, the screen just stays black and nothing happens. I'm sorry, but until it is fixed, i will have to thumbs down.

i play on windows now lol so good game (UPDATE)"
23276,A great game to play with a group of friends and to solve puzzles with or pick each other up and drop them off the map.
23277,this game is fun because of all the obstacles in it
23278,"""no no i swear im not gonna slam your head into the ground- [b]BOOM BOOW BAM PAH YEAH [i]EAT IT[/i][/b]"""
23279,gets old very easily

23281,cool
23282,like
23283,"It's a fun coop game to play with your friends and random people online. Joining in to other player session was easy. 
But the camera motion when the my avatar moves makes me dizzy. I thought it was just me but my other friends had the same dizziness as well when playing even less than an hour. 
If the devs enable option to make the camera less wobbly, I would definitely recommend this game."
23284,hmm
23285,Awesome game to play with friends!
23286,"its a great game to play with your friends and its funny at the same time so i`ll give it a 10/10 
and i love all the maps :D"
23287,"its fun, wonky, and has lots of replayabillity, and it you like to troll your friends, then thisa game is perfect for you
"
23288,"Split screen sometimes unplayable with xbox controller on mac. Other games work well.
The game restart helps sometimes. So restart the game until both players controls work.
There is another problem: even if both player have their controls sometimes player with gamepad looses his control for several seconds. This unplayable situation repeats frequently. Game restart helps."
23289,"great game, i played it ALOT on console and now i own it on pc and its way more fun on here :D"
23290,"This game is funny, charming, clever, addictive and super imaginative. Absolute must buy!"
23291,It's been a while since I cried laughing with my retar... er I mean brilliant friends.
23292,pretty good alone better than brownies with friends.
23293,"One of the best games to play with a group of friends! I highly recommend it if you have some time to kill, absolutely hilarious game yet challenging. Makes you think and makes you laugh....."
23294,nice
23295,HELL YES! Tons of fun!!
23296,yep
23297,It's a pretty good game because it is coop and I like coop
23298,Oof
23299,Simple controls and wobbly physics makes you think philosophical...
23300,Pure wacky platforming joy. If you have two friends to play with (or more!) do not hesitate to pick this game up.
23301,Most fun game if your with a friend. Havent laughed this much in years
23302,meh

23307,nice game
23308,"i honestly love this little mess of a game. Any glitches you can find are hilarious and i mean, even the core game itself is funny XD its good for a bit of entertainment but i do think it runs short of that after a while"
23309,Funny As Hell. Recommend Only For The Ricardo Skin.
23310,"If you have friends, buy it"
23311,"Buddy gave me this to play with him. I just played this for four hours, and I laughed almost continuously for the entire time. This is like Mount Your Friends, had a hideously hilarious baby with QWOP. And you look like a drunk maniac the whole time you're running around. 10/10 Would stumble drunkenly through these puzzles again."
23312,A really fun puzzle game best played at first by yourself then later with friends. Achievements are really fun to achieve and feel like they are worth it. Only minor bugs but overall a great game.
23313,"This is so funny playing with friends, not recommend for solo but still funny xD"
23314,"Can play this for the entire day without getting bored.

P. S - Only Coop mode ❤️"
23315,"I think they should add fighter pilot uniforms... they have swat/military, police, and fireman uniforms but not fighter pilots... devs pls consider

23348,A Great Game to Play With Friends Or Complete Strangers! A Straight 10/10 In my Opinion
23349,"Looked like a fun puzzle game , but the video wobble of camera and character makes me motion sick."
23350,"its a very werid game at first but when you get the hang of it, its pretty fun and has its own charm to it"
23351,"Great great! I had a lot of fun while playing this masterpiece. First I started playing with 1 friend and it was good, after about 2h of playing my second friend joined us and it was even better! Community workshop made this game live a lot longer and even creators keep updating the game on their own giving community more and more tools. If you think of buying I can deffinitly recommend that game. Although you have to have friends to play this game. Whithout friends you wont have as much fun. 
Hope my review was helpful and sorry for grammar mistakes if there were any!"
23352,"best game evrer but glithschj
"
23353,Really good game. There is a low amount of levels but there is a workshop with thousands of levels.
23354,Great game.
23355,"THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE THE GAME SO FLIPPING MUCH
"
23356,best game of year
23357,funniest game ever great family game.
23358,6/5
23359,Ayyy lmao
23360,"Very fun, creative game to play with friends, we've got one level left until we're done with the base game!"
23361,"One of the most enjoyable games I've played in forever. It's so much fun, especially in multiplayer. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard as a group of us fumbled our way through the levels."
23362,"This game does not function and crashes so incredibly often
"
23363,The hilarity of this game with friends is unlimited... My entire purpose in this game is to troll everyone I play it with.  Trolling Simulator: Fall Flat.
23364,"i love it :>                                                                     i also love the creator for this knowledge :>
"
23365,its a game
23366,"This connectivity is so weak, for moments i assumed we were just back to Dial-Up connections."
23367,"This game isnt about solving the puzzles, it's about how much you (and/or your friends) can d*ck around in that said level to the point where you do complete it.
This is a game I've played with  friends a few times, and I cant get enough of it. We play for a few hours and were only done with like 3 levels because this game is the literal definition of ""a wacky, in a good way, time.""
This is like a party game, but more open.
Think of this as an open world Quiplash. They give you something to start with, and you and your friends go on with it from there.
Make it what you will in this journey of Human Fall Flat.
Truly a game so good, so funny, for the world."
23368,"I guess I'm one of very few that dislike this game. It seems a nice light bit of fun, but realistically- it feels pointless and boring. The few games I played were full of toxic players who had no interest in actually playing the game properly. It appears everyone's bored of this game but their friends are still playing it so everyone just screws around trying to make a boring game funny. I was expecting a puzzle-based 'gangbeasts' and received a janky blob that moves so slowly that I nearly used up all my refund time trying to get from A-B. Luckily I was within my refund time because this game is dull and lacks what the trailer suggests."
23369,i died laughing at this game. it was great fun. enjoyed most with others in some sort of inebriated state.
23370,FAF
23371,crap.
23372,This Game Is easy to play with friends and even more fun to master
23373,"so interesting game for fun
"
23374,"bg ybhu
"
23375,"wtf……

Just bought it several days ago but given a 50% discount so soon."
23376,.
23377,"Very entertaining, like a good game should."
23378,I love it
23379,Shit.
23380,"A very funny game with great maps, wonderful for a family and a group
played it with my 8-years-old brother, had lots of fun, it was a bit difficult for him but we managed."
23381,"funniest game i ever played with my daughter we both have it on our pcs an there nothing like throwing your 5 year old off a clif 
"
23382,"If you are in urgent need of a good laugh with funky and sometimes frustrating moments, do not pass up the chance to buy this one. just an advice: bring a friend for a hilarious experience."
23383,"Short but really great with a friend, good times messing around and figuring stuff out

And for those using Linux OMEGALUL IMAGINE USING LINUX"
23384,"For 1st try this game is HARD but if u play together with ur friend , the game become fun , easier and funny. Annd You cant stop laughing xD"
23385,This game is fng awful.
23386,yes
23387,"Hilarious game to play with friends, definitely worth the cheap price. We picked it up to de-tilt from competitive games and it did its job!"
23388,"One of the most interesting game I have played, so good to just work throught the game."
23389,yea
23390,"Hilarious and so much fun! The movement physics are surprisingly intuitive, and the bumbling nature of the gooey doughboy character you play is hilarious. Clever puzzles that are fun and satisfying to solve."
23391,fall flat
23392,An amazing game! I got this last Christmas I think during the Christmas lobby. I played it with my 2 sisters and had a blast the lobby showed so much of the games capabilities  with the new workshop the game just opened up ever more. I really want to see the Christmas lobby again though may even with more added! Overall if you want to relax with either friends or just alone this game is for you!
23393,Most simplistic and wholesome game I've played in awhile. Laughed my ass of within the first 10 minutes
23394,I hate puzzles.
23395,"really really fun, only thing ill say is bad though is that lobbys are really laggy"
23396,Best coop game ever
23397,WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH
23398,Great game to play with friends. I dont have any so it kinda sucks :(
23399,Absolutely fantastic puzzle/physics game I love it and it's always a great game to burn a few hours on when bored.
23400,This shit don't work in linux if you want to play with peple on Windows
23401,Developers pulled the Linux version from Steam.
23402,good fun fame
23403,IGN- 9/10 - Cannot Fall Round
23404,Funny af with friends
23405,"This game is freaking fun, including playing with your friends or not"
23406,"Lots of fun.. especially with friends. Most of the time trolling and getting in each others ways. Recommended for a quick laugh and team building.
Please developers come out with new puzzles or a user customizable level feature so we can make our own for more new challenges."
23407,"xD
"
23408,"man waddle haha physics woah ahahahaha fall? flatr
g"
23409,"Great Game would recommend to anyone but there is fog everywhere and i cannot see anything not even my characters cheeks
"
23410,"Awesome game, if you want to laugh, play this game, everytime i play this i laugh out, the way the models move is funny af."
23411,gay
23412,my mom hate me
23413,It is a very strange game
23414,"Amazing to stuff around with your friends, if u finish it once, you can do it again but try a different way/method, or just have fun messing around and driving dumsters off skyskrapers"
23415,"Invest the time in learning how to wallclimb, then cheese cheese cheese."
23416,"This is a really fun puzzle game! The only gripe I have is with the shitty servers. It's almost impossible to play with friends or online without high latency. Other than that, it's one of my favorite games."
23417,good with w a ffs
23418,"Really fun game with your friends, just not for me. Really do give this a try!"
23419,cool
23420,"Easily the funniest game I've played with friends.  I'm neither young enough, or old enough to have been this close to peeing my pants - thank you devs"
23421,Your not human if you don't play this game.
23422,"a nice game to play with friends
fun and interesting gameplay, like gang beasts
this game gets hard to play when you or the host has a bad internet connection though
single player campaign is cool but its definitely not as fun as with co-op partners that actually know how to play
good customization although workshop characters would be cool
you can upload maps on the workshop also which is nice"
23423,THIS GAME BLOWS!
23424,It is worth for the sale
23425,It is a really really fun game to play with friends!
23426,­
23427,Yes
23428,"I can recommend this game now that there's workshop support. This game is a blast with friends.

The default levels are fun to teach you the game and maybe speed run but they got old kind of fast. I hope the workshop stays alive and well for a long time because this is the perfect game for it.

PS. Mostly bugless, and the bugs that do exist enhance the experience more than they tarnish it.

10/10 would fall flat again."
23429,7/10
23430,"The puzzles are great. Unfortunately the game relies too much on having very high controller skills i.e. not casual gamer level. I understand it is physics based, but being forced to place objects very precisely with an intentionally quirky movement gets old and boring very fast."
23431,"Very original game with interesting splitscreen  local coop! 
https://youtu.be/fzwhUyfetWg"
23432,"20% playing the actual puzzle game
80% wrestling with friends and hanging from cliffs"
23433,"Really funny, and fun game, had a lot of fun times in it, and I would give the game 8/10."
23434,"I have only have this game for one day(as of now) and it has already taught me the wonders of human nature. We wonder about the world around us,we push each other off cliffs.and the main point...Humans can't fly. You see the reason we fall to each level is because its a metaphor to how each failure brings new opportunities. The soundtrack does help bring to light the deep and meaningful parts of this game and...and... never mind the game is fine just buy it"
23435,+
23436,"Heavy lol.
6/7"
23437,"This game is veri funny, and practice cooperation"
23438,"this is the best game ever I love it
buy it"
23439,very goood. funny!
23440,Super fun game. Even more fun online although there is a bit of input delay when you play online.
23441,Linux supported dropped silently.
23442,"Human: Fall Flat’s ridiculous controls and animation do a great job of making repeated, frustrating, and unfair failure at physics puzzles. Then, when you get bored, just play it with a friend and make it 10 times more fun."
23443,i fell then died
23444,Decent fun little puzzle platformer. The controls are wonky but it's pretty hilarious. Best played with friends.
23445,"From the wacky ragdoll physics, to the awesome levels, Human Fall Flat is a fun game with friends and alone. You can get launched by catapults or smash a stone wall down, and even zipline! This game is worth the $15 for what it brings to the table."
23446,"400 workshop levels? Bullshit. 

In multiplayer the game is brilliant, but the sad part is it is over so very quickly. The included levels will last you maybe 4 hours if you're good. Maybe even less. The workshop levels are a mixed bag of too hard, too easy, and impossible due to bugs. Workshop levels are just buggy in general, but the worst thing is I experienced crashes on over 50% of the the levels. Some crashes were so bad I had to pull the plug on my PC. The main game crashed on me once. Also it's a complete pain in the ass to get the workshop up and running. You need to download Unity. There is little info about this on the forums, but a google search on the subject will likely bring up the old method of inputting a code, causing a great deal of confusion and time wasting. After downloading unity one must spend a bit of time loading all the info from the game into Unity before one can begin downloading player made levels.

Overall I was disappointed, the game is unique and absolutely genius, but given the time spent creating the game, I can't imagine it would take THAT much time making some official levels, the engine is in place and the levels can be constructed fairly easily. I would say the content should be double what it currently is. I'd take that over 400 crappy player made levels that need to be sifted through for hours of trial and error crashes. Sadly my time is too important to me and the whole experience has been soured. 

By all means get the game, unless you're piss poor, and if you are poor, get it on sale. Because the game is one of the best coop experiences I've ever had. But the creators should have made DLC or made the game longer or something because a great idea has gone to waste."
23447,its fun but there are just a few custom maps that are good
23448,its good but not as better
23449,The game is eh. But the part I absolutely love is the avatar creator it's so fun 100% recommended. The game is fun but the avatar creator is amazing I absolutely love it.
23450,"i don't know what to type on reviews, so i just wanna say this is a good game Kappa"
23451,"amazing game!
"
23452,It is a really fun puzzle game and nice to play with friends but I wish there were more levels. This was partially made up for by adding steam workshop support but more levels would be nice.
23453,"Nice & fun coop game ! 

"
23454,Funny
23455,THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!!
23456,really fun game with workshop levels
23457,Pretty dope
23458,My uneducated ass thought this was a Flat Earth game.
23459,endless fun unless you finish all the default maps then the fun ends 10/10
23460,"Congrat on getting workshop, now veri good gem"
23461,it  is  a  very  good game  it  is  the  best  game
23462,good game
23463,OK
23464,Great game but is best played with some friends.
23465,I hate the lag and I want a refund
23466,This game is a challenge but I like it!
23467,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
23468,You get bored very fast
23469,"This game is like life, you as a human will fall flat many times in life. But! if you surround yourself with friends you may be lucky enough to be pile drived off an edge into the sweet abyss..."
23470,"game is fun for the most part PROVIDED you have friends to play with if you don't and want to join people you'll be thrown of the edge, verbally abused (or at least attempted ;) ) and inevitably kicked. so for those looking to make friends try somewhere else but for those who have friends then enjoy the derpyness the game has to offer."
23471,"I cant see my friend but he is in the game, i can see stuff moving around and the game says he isnt in the game but he is"
23472,I bought this game first on xbox and put more than 10 hours on the game and when I got it on pc I played for 5 hours in 1 day and think the steam workshop makes the game so much better and allows you to play millions of other levels. My only complaint is if you hit the windows key to exit you cant move your mouse from the top left of the screen  I don't feel many people will have this problem. This game is 100 percent worth 15 bucks. I could put hundreds of hours into the game and not get bored because theres so many options. Would recommend.
23473,"Funny enough with friends, but way too short for the price"
23474,"funny and puzzle game ,"
23475,lort motdack shien ed metle itale.
23476,fun game to play with friends
23477,10/10 game hope they add new maps so i can speed run it ya
23478,"This game is QWOP in depth and mechanics.  It's cute, but it gets boring just after the 2hr mark."
23479,"Very fun game to play with friends. Bit of a lack of re-playability after all of the levels are completed but the steam workshop helps to solve this, and the devs are still adding new levels too. It is still a very fun game that will get a good few laughs with you and your buddies :D"
23480,"Well this game is the funniest game i have ever and its similar to Octodad which is funny too, The movement is hilarious because its a really hard game that takes sometime, Also there's a online party which makes this game more hilarious, But i wouldn't say this game is cute like A Hat In Time (which i will buy sometime) I already posted a mod that's called bob the builder, The failing makes this game ridiculous."
23481,Really fun with a friend.
23482,it's good game i love this game
23483,Great multiplayer!
23484,i love this game so much have over 200 hours and where can i donate
23485,nice game to chill
23486,Just bought the game but it doesn't work. When I launch it a white/grey dotted screen is the only thing that appears. I noticed that other buyers had the same problem but I didn't find any reply from the developers about the issue or how to fix it. I'll ask for a refund!
23487,"amazing game to play with your friends if you got any. also any ""glitch feels like a feature"""
23488,"+ easy control
+ you can play out of the box
+ grafics are ok
+ hilarious with friends
+ bought it for 5€ at mmo,ga

- quite short but workshop could extend it"
23489,Funny as hell.<With Friends>
23490,Ok
23491,this game is very cash money n' gucci ngl
23492,SUCH AN ADVENTURE COMBINED WITH SPICY PUZZLES
23493,"I have to write another review because mine ended up not being that fair with the game. Now that Workshop is a thing and knowing they're still doing their best to make this game feel better to play, I can finally say it's a 10/10 game. I recently played it, after more than a year without playing it with anyone, and all I can say is that it's still extremely fun and one of the best games you can play with your friends (I was dancing Thriller and died because of this game's ragdoll physics, never laughed so hard honestly)

Buy this game, for you, for your friends, for your family, buy it for everyone, it's the greatest it has ever been (also, for my friends who know they're the reason why I'm typing this new review, I love you, thanks for all the fun)"
23494,Hidden Gem.
23495,"human fall flat 2: WAGON CHASING, FLAMES, DEATH, FALLING FROM HIGH HEIGHTS (in game already) GUNs,DUMPSTER DRIVING, MURDER,THROWING TVS IN A FIT OF RAGE, FLAMETHROWERS, who can wait
"
23496,"i did not buy it after getting my ""epic gamer pc"""
23497,"It´s a really fun game to play with friends. 

You´re navigating a drunk moving dummy through some obstacles and puzzles. The difficulty is often not really about finding the solution but rather controlling your dummy (or the machines) properly to solve the puzzle."
23498,a
23499,This game is the meaning of my life
23500,"It's a great game to play with friends and having a awesome night playing this game.
But there are not many maps, and the workshop maps werent so great to play.
In my opinion its okay for paying 15€ but the little choice of maps isn't so great."
23501,"Arkadaşlarıyla vakit geçirmeye oyun arayanlar için ideal bir seçenek. Workshop haritaları kendi haritalarından daha güzel ve zorlu. Kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum, her kuruşuna değer!"
23502,boring
23503,This Game Is VERY Enteraining But Can You Please Add Some More House Maps?
23504,"good game, worth the money and split screen is a blast. Split screen online is pretty awesome too!!"
23505,"It's fun but - beware: it's also frustrating and the frustration increases as you play.  The game is mostly about trying to control a very clumsy and imprecise character and try to get him to do things in a physics based world, and sometimes you're trying to do more precise things than the controls allow for - so yeah - it can be frustrating - but it's also fun up to a point (at least for me).  But don't be surprised if you spend an hour trying to do a simple task.   I often found myself tensed up on the mouse and keyboard just trying to get the little guy to do what I want him to. Also, the friction levels are low so lots of items are very ""slidy"" and easily knocked over with a bump. 

But yeah, I can see how this could be fun too for people who can pull this stuff off.  I only played single player local, so can't comment on multi."
23506,nibbaa watt ahour
23507,Very addicting game and extremely fun and funny
23508,"This game is fun for a group of freinds, and i would reccomend it if you and your freinds are in the child zone even tho you and your freinds are adults."
23509,"this is a good game 
"
23510,"really short but fun with friends.
"
23511,"Amazing game! I recommend you bring along a group of friends for hours of hilarity and enjoyment! 
Even after you complete all the core maps in this game, there are tons of fun community created maps to play!"
23512,Good game
23513,"So I bought this game on the premise that using a controller would work with it as it does with every other game labeled ""Full Controller Support"". That unfortunately was not the case. No matter what controller I tried it would not work past ""Press A to continue"". All research I can find is that this is a bug that's been in the game for over a year. Been reported, but no one has fixed it and there's no work around. If you plan to play M+K then you should be fine, controller use is still sadly a gamble on if you get the game working or not. Best of luck."
23514,Workshop integration was the best to ever be added to this game.
23515,A very interesting game.
23516,Really fun game to play with friends!
23517,i love this game
23518,good game if you lack motor skills
23519,A fun physics platformer with some interesting original ideas. Best played with friends.

23524,"An absolute blast in multiplayer, a terrible and miserable experience to play singleplayer. 
The 5 hours I've spent playing by myself have been the worst of my life, but the 20 mins I played local co-op with my boyfriend on his pc were the most fun I've ever had playing a game. 

Please just play it with friends you'll have so much fun!!"

Seems like an enjoyable game and if it worked for me, I might have recommended it. It seems like a fun game to play with friends because of the weird glitches and funny movement."
23528,"Fun puzzle with some very good mechanics, but can get a bit boring playing alone."
23529,Arkadaşlarla eğlenceli ama fiyatına değmez
23530,"Fun Puzzle Game, Way better with friends"
23531,One of the best game you can play with your friends.
23532,"Played this in one player mode, less chaos but ramped up difficulty, so many times i thought if only someone else was here. But i finished the game with a few head scratching moments, the great thing with these puzzles is that there are a number of ways to complete it, even ones the devs never planned. Play multi for a laugh fest, single player for ultimate challenge."
23533,"haha fink about the moder fuknig title !!! human fall flaT!! its like dose fat people falling videos on youtube ahahahahahaha

wathcout fat idiot is falling, earthquake will follow soon!! XD

anyway fun game play with friend jump around and dont fall FLAT!!!!! XD"

23538,"throwing people off the map? yes. thats all i need :D

23539,"Funny with friends, gets old after some time but worth it"

23541,Was a very interesting and fun game to play with friends! Had a lot of laugh and giggles! :D

23543,"Dis game fun, uwu

23544,"This game is fun. I always laugh at how goofy and silly it is, however it's entertaining."
23545,Great game made by great people to play with great friends
23546,Really cool and fun game to play with friends!
23547,Yeet.
23548,"A fun puzzle game with controls you will take a bit to get used to.

Very fun and cute, a blast with friends"
23549,"Funny game, I love it , always got a great time with my friends and family ♥"
23550,Quite ok but you need a little skill to play well. Over time it will be easier and easier to play on boredom. I'm on the plus side :)
23551,Enjoyed messing around with it for the first few hours. Puzzle solving is not an issue as they aren't that complicated. The rubbery controls and semi-slippery surfaces slowly cranks up the frustration. It is amusing for a while but the humor evaporates through monotony. Once I got to the point of wondering why am I still playing this I stopped. If you like goofy physics and are fairly laid back you'll probably enjoy it. Would probably be a fun group game laughing at each others antics. But for solo play it's merely meh.
23552,Really fun game :)
23553,☆☆☆
23554,fuc
23555,"just got it, is a great game. you will have more fun with your friends but i dont have friends who will play with me soo i only play singleplayer and i really like the custimazation and you can make your own levels and stuff. really cool game"
23556,This is probably the most fun i've had on an online game in a while. Just a great overall game with a great workshop community that produces new content by the day. Also a great in-game community as well (well mostly). Not to mention the great controller support this game has! it has never been easier to kick someone on a controller before!
23557,"This game is so fun if play with friend, good game :3"
23558,Fun with friends.
23559,I want my friendships back ;_;
23560,"This game is fun for about an hour, and then I came to the realisation that it is not really a puzzle game.

In a puzzle game you spend your time figuring out how to solve the puzzle to progress to the next one. In Human Fall Flat, you spend about a minute working out how to do the puzzle, as they are usually extremely simple, and the next hour battling with the controls to make your character perform simple actions such as carrying an item or climbing a ladder.

The controls seem to be intentionally designed so as to result in amusing accidents, similarly to something like QWOP or Surgeon Simulator, but after the first hour or so it just became extremely frustrating."
23561,"Fun, inexpensive and all round great for a little adventure and time killing. Try it as you may and hopefully you are able to get a few friends involved.

While this game is a bit random with players being good to somewhat griefing everyone. I do somewhat recommend it if on sale as the content is really lacking at this point. Try to get it on sale but also have fun with it as the fun likely won't last part a few days with such lacking content."
23562,"I have  problem, I think I like this game a little too much."
23563,"Definitely a must-have game to play in coop with friends, besides its semplicity it's literally one of the funniest game i've ever played"
23564,Still waiting for the new update  zz...(-_-)
23565,A hilariously addictive game to play with friends. I got this as a gift from a friend whom I played with. It was literally funny how we tried to outwit each other in getting through the levels.
23566,"A very fun game to play together with your friends. However, after you completed this game once, you already know how to solve each puzzles. So, it is not that funny anymore. That is the case if you play with the same people. But if you play with other new friends who hasn't played this game yet, you can just sit back relax and laugh at their jelly characters trying and failing over and over again. I recommend to play this game, especially when u and your friends are drunk from a night out XD"
23567,"Its only fun with friends and after when your done playing all the levels and workshop levels we just stop playing. 
also online sucks because you can get trolls that grab you and drowns you or you join a game and gets kicked. its so fucking annoying.
3/10"
23568,This game sucks
23569,"I like to play this game on gamepad, or on android phone gamepad, its called HandyGamePad"
23570,"Haven't laughed as much in a long time (because of a game at least).
Has nice mechanics and is enjoyable alone but nothing can top the fun you have when you play with 3 or more of your friends and do dumb s*it together"
23571,"Amazing physics combined with deep gameplay truly bring the game up and up and up

the minimalist art style conveys constant emotion never seen in the game

The music Is amazing and very rewarding 

10/10 game

Just play it"
23572,"boek laa bossku
"
23573,"Great puzzle game with funny physics and intuitive controls. A bit short, but the workshop maps fix that problem.
I don't have friends to play this with but I've seen that the co-op is a blast, but if you're like me, the game is very much playable alone as well."
23574,I've never played a game for 1 hour and laughing straight for 2 hours.
23575,"this game is amazing with a full party of friends, and alone as well"
23576,its like a pancake
23577,Very fun game to play with friends.
23578,haha funny ragdoll game
23579,"Best game to play with friends, not recomended for lonely depressed boi"
23580,"This game is just AWESOME!
Get yourself 2 friends and you'll laugh all the time and you will enjoy this game sooo much!
The campaign is short, but you can mess around in some levels and just do whatever you want, you don't really need to complete the campaign that fast!
This game is worth buying and is hella fun."
23581,It says mac books can play so i bought it and look at that they can't wowe
23582,Nice Game Dude!

23586,"Absolutely hilarious with friends!!! decent game with some fun puzzles, only problem is that it's pretty short, so it's worth picking up on sale."
23587,"This game is absolutely perfect. It is so much fun and has everything a good game needs. 
This is what i call.. GAME-DESIGN!
Good Job!"
23588,"If you have MOTION SICKNESS, BEWARE!! This game will make you sick. 

The game looks so much fun especially in multiplayer, but I wouldn't know that since I can't go too far without feeling ill. Not sure if it is the camera or the wobbly human character. Overall, I would still recommend this game if you plan to play with friends/multiplayer."
23589,Funniest game I ever played

23600,"game is fun, but steam workshop messed evrything. MP levels is laggy, and game is not optimized. tried one workshop made lvl and my pc almost flied to cosmoss with fan speed... i5-8400 and 1060 3gb still isnt enoght?"
23601,"it's so funny when you play with your friends. 
l laughed all night  :p"
23602,"The controls make simple tasks really frustrating. I feel like that's the point. Also, I struggle to play the game when I'm alone, it's a much better game with friends whether you want to actually complete the puzzles or launch them off cliffs at not high speeds."
23603,"This game is based on simple and wonky physics and puzzel maps.

If you want a game to play with friends this is definitely a very good choice (Alone is not worth at all).

 [b] Pros: [/b]
 - Very fun and entertaining
 - Workshop support for maps and skins
 - Well designed levels (Small open world feel)
 - Simple and smooth graphics

[b] Cons: [/b]
 - Too simple mechanics that will turn boring over time
 - The wonky physics can be fun but sometimes frustating
 - Few levels (only 10 at the time im writing this)
 - The community isn't very productive
 - The replay factor isn't that affective
 - High latency really destroys your experience

With a little more polished and complex mechanics, lower price and --> MORE LEVELS <-- , this game can grow so much...

Sry for the english btw."
23604,this f*****g s**t game will not start can someone please fix this i wasted 15 pounds on it ffs i hate this i want to end it all
23605,"the characters and the animations are designed cute and funny. the levels are creative and finishing them is more fun than frustrating . it also has a multi player mod , so what more do you want from a game ? 
100% recommended."
23606,This game is really fun. It also includes a nice positive message of [u]teamwork[/u] and working together to solve puzzles. Definitely recommend!
23607,"The game seriously needs a ping column in the server browser list, because having a good ping is essential. Nobody wants to press space and jump 2 seconds later. The only way of finding out your ping in a server right now, is to join it and see how long it takes you to jump, so the process of finding a good server can take a long while.

Aside from that, the game is lots of fun, and quite creative with physics."
23608,More maps please
23609,GG
23610,"Very nice game, relaxing gameplay! Coop is so much fun! Do recommend"
23611,love murdering my friends and family members 10/10
23612,"a trash game to fun game, i like it"
23613,goofy funny game definitely recommend it
23614,this game is amazing.
23615,"Playing this game on your own is okay, at best. Playing this with at least a friend or two is superbly worth it. Some of the best laughs I've had playing with friends. Buy this on sale and gift a copy or two to a friend if they don't want to buy it themselves.

A C tier game on your own, but an SSS+ tier game with friends."
23616,"haha, human: fall flat

kind of reminds me of the time my wife died in the hospital from a severe and terminal heart disease

needless to say this game does not fall flat unlike my wife, i fucking miss my wife"
23617,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
23618,"my wife left me, but the game was pretty good"
23619,Good physics style platformer. Now has workshop support so hopefully some good community levels inbound!
23620,"  Most fun I've had on Steam in a while. Only negative in the game that I see is that it really wouldn't be too fun without a group of friends to play it with, but if you have people who would play it with you, get it.

     9.5/10"
23621,amazing co-op fun
23622,gud
23623,"Perfect games to play with friends with funny gameplay, but the stary was to short, im end it just 8 hours"
23624,"Played this with my gf, it was amazingly fun! We had such a great time playing this! Thank you to the creators of this game!"
23625,"Love the mechanics of the game, fun and interesting gameplay. Especially fun online with a few friends... I originally wanted the game because of youtubers and streamers and I would definitely buy for a friend.

HOWEVER... there is a problem that really fucking infuriates me, I like to collect all of the achievements for games I enjoy a lot. 
There is one achievement I literally cannot unlock for whatever reason. I have followed the guides down to a tee and yet still no achieve pop. Its the Construction levels ""Primal"" achievement. all achieves but one is certainly one way to give me a headache."
23626,Just buy the game I can see it in your eye. It's worth it.
23627,It was ok
23628,"Hella' fun if you play with friends.

Great for some laughs and giggles."
23629,"There has got to be another game like this. Gang beast isnt it either. Its cool and all but this games spot on. 

RECOMMENDED"
23630,very fun and interesting with friends
23631,"It starts out pretty great and hilarious. After about ten levels, it's unbelievably buggy to the point where you can't finish levels anymore. If you try to load a checkpoint, it drops you back in the correct location, but it resets your progress for the entire level, oftentimes trapping you in a place you can't get out of. So, then the only you can do is restart the level. Buuuut restarting the level seems to break it even further. Like the one with all the doors and cables, the lift starts to drive itself into walls or in circles without the player even touching it, and the switches don't work, soooo you can't move the generator to where it needs to go, which means the level is not completable. I tried just climbing over walls to get around these issues, but the character's climbing abilities are pretty lackluster, and eventually I got tired of falling over and over. I'm going to say I recommend it just because I did really like it while it was working, but just be wary that it seems to be broken once you get to the later levels."
23632,"This game is great, If you are good at puzzle games. But you need to have a LOT of patience to play it, I just played most of it again so I could make an honest review. Let's go level by level to write a review:
1. Mansion: It's fine. A good tutorial level.
2. Train: It's ok, it's basically a continuation of the first level.
3. Carry: It's probably my favorite level of all the levels.
4. Mountain: Just as good as carry, but a little harder.
5. Demolition: Meh, it's ok.
6. Castle: Everything exept the ending to it is fine. The ending is really annoying, it's a big spike in difficulty.
7. Water: The WORST level. It SUCKS. All you do is ride from boat to boat. THEN you have to do a part that makes you line up 4 hooks over a giant crate with 4 holes in it  with levers. Then you have to get the crate in the PERFECT spot. THEN you have to do stuff with rafts and MORE boats. It's absolutly HORRIBLE level design.
8. Power Plant: Meh, it's fun if you have friends. Otherwise it's just boring.
9.  Aztec: A difficult last level with intresting new mechanics.
10. Dark: I haven't beaten it yet, but it seems fine to me.
Overall: A fun game to play with some friends. Some of the parts like the ending of castle and the entirety of the Water level are WAY too annoying. But everything else is fine."
23633,it's ok
23634,i like dragging my friends off the edge
23635,"Great little game to play with friends or alone. Much better with friends though! 

short adventure puzzle-solver with good comedic value with the way the ragdoll physics work."
23636,This game is an absolute blast with friends! I can't tell you how much the gang and I laughed our butts off during our brief amount of gameplay.
23637,Very fun
23638,"I loved this game from the moment I first started playing. It has a soothing yet purposeful feel to it, and that makes it all the better. There's something about it that makes me feel composed and patient (which is just as well, as a few puzzles are awfully frustrating). I love the light, soft, laid-back style going on. It has enough detail to leave one mesmerized, but not so much detail that's it's overwhelming or distracting."
23639,It's fun to play with friends.
23640,10/10
23641,"Best game ever i could Yeet my friend off the cliff for like infinite times!!!! 0h
and The Puzzles are REALLY great!"
23642,This is the most hilarious game I have ever played. If you want to mess around and have some challenging adventures at the same time (not really challenging) give this game a try. I have played this game with some friends and it was probably one of the best laughs I have ever had. I highly recommend this game for everyone and it is really really fun.

23648,"I had a lot of high hopes from this game, especially because of its prestigious publisher Curve. Once booting the game to play with friends, I was greeted with some terrible windows 98 looking UI. An ultimate turn off!
I then hosted a game. So far so good? W R O N G. My friend couldn't even join the game due to a loading hang. Upon further investigation, this has been a known bug since December 2017! Is this CNR? I'll give you my repro!
This isn't a game I'd play alone or with strangers and not being able to play with friends meant I have requested for a refund with 16 minutes of 'play' time. This 16 minutes was in fact just loading screen... nothing... reload game... repeat.

I am sad this hasn't had the love and care it deserves."
23649,Fantastically fun frenzy for friends frantically fighting for freedom.
23650,"I purchased this game several months ago before steam workshop was added. At the time, while still lots of fun, the game was short lived due to only a small number of levels but I would have still rated it a decent 7/10. 

Now just a few months on, there's plenty of great community content in the shape of levels and custom characters. I can honestly say that it's made a world of difference to the longevity of the title.  I return to it several times a week when I'm in the need of a break from more serious titles, or just to have a chilled out laugh with friends. 

Would I recommend this game? Heck yes but only if you have friends to play it with. Playing solo is quite frankly a little dull. 

In a nutshell, if you want some casual co-op fun then this is a great little title to consider. 9/10

"
23651,"one of the funniest games of all time
defo buy
your missing out on alot

"
23652,Fun to play with friends!
23653,So funny game when you play it with friends.
23654,"This is a game I randomly found on youtube, the funny physics was worth my attention, the fact it was made for co-op was worth my money. I bought this game to play it with my friend and it didn't disappoint me, I always had so much fun and looking forward to play it more. The game combines easy/medium puzzles with a funny and tricky physic that makes the easiest tasks not so easy to perform, it creates a lot of funny situations, especially with your friends. Is it worth the buy? You judge.


PROS
GRAPHICS: When I bought this game, I had a 1gb graphic card that could barely fit into the minimum requirements EAH5850), despite that the engine wasn't too heavy and could run quite smooth without FPS drops, meaning it can run on most of nowadays' PCs. The graphic is easy but not minimal, good enough if you're not looking for something complex.

PHYSICS: Physics is not perfect, but funny as hell! You will find yourself in very funny situations you can barely control and while one side of physics is automated (like climbing short walls), the other side will make the easiest tasks (like using a key) harder than you could imagine, making the game funny to watch and hard to play, at least at the beginning.

COOP: The game is fully playable alone, but coop is the best part of it! You can choose between multiplayer, private and local. Playing in private servers with your friends (and with a mic) is the best option you should go for, local coop works fine as alternative. Helping each other solving a puzzle can be more a handicap than help due to its funny physics, but that's what make this game so funny. I haven't tried the multiplayer with strangers, but I recommend it mostly if you have at least one known friend to privately play with.

PUZZLES: Despite there's not a huge variety of puzzles and some tasks can become repetitive, some puzzles can be quite challenging or creative, some may be resolved in alternative ways, but it won't bore you too much for a couple runs. The workshop can add some new puzzles invented by users, giving the game a Portal 2 potential with custom maps and ideas.

ACHIEVEMENTS: The game was quite short after all, it didn't take too long to complete all the maps, thankfully the developers didn't forget to add a very good extra with achievements! Some achievements are funny and creative, a good variety to use as secondary missions, adding some extra fun to play it again in a more challenging way beside solving the mere puzzle. All of them are possible and don't require hundreds of hours to complete, it's highly recommended to try some of them once you complete all the default maps.

UPDATES: The game seems steadily updated, especially for big updates (new map and workshop just to name two), which gives some room for improvements. Every update is welcome but the game is already in a playable state, worth the buy in the early access in the actual state.

WORKSHOP: The few default maps and the lack of workshop was a big con I reported to my future review, the adding of the workshop in a beta state through group subscription was a decent temporary solution, the full implementation of a working workshop was the best move to make the game great! It's still a new feature and the maps are not perfect, but it's the first step to greatly expand the game, almost mandatory for a game like this.


CONS
MECHANICS: Mechanics looks great, but I had the flashback that developers didn't realize how some mechanics featured could really break the game. You can climb any wall by swaying left and right, jump longer with hands up, huge shortcuts, features that were supposed to be limits in the game and not used as advantages to skip harder puzzles, once you learn them or someone abuse of them, the game is partially ruined. I fear the devs didn't notice it at first and now it's too late to change mechanics, but they aren't easy to learn at the first runs, better stay away from them if you want to enjoy the game.

MAPS QUANTITY: The quality of default maps is quite good (beside some huge shortcuts), unfortunately there aren't many of them and the workshop quality is a bit too far still. They should add more default maps to give the game some concrete roots and extra playing time, but the quantity of updates gives hope there may be more maps in the future. Achievements are a good reason to replay the maps and the workshop is the best alternative once the game is over.

PRECISION: While the funny physic is eye candy, some puzzles require a precision that should have been in the game. I had some problems with some movements and failing some hard tasks because the physic has no precision can be far from being funny. Sometimes jumps are too late, hands don't stick on surfaces, often failing a rather easy climb, just to name a few.

REPETITIVE: The lack of variety of puzzles can make the game repetitive, but the adding of the workshop gives a chance to break repetitiveness if given the right tools. Probably you will get tired of the game after the first runs, just depends how much you want/can play with your friends.

Final word: A very funny game greatly recommended to play with friends, funny hard physic perfectly fit into easy tasks, simple light graphic to make it run smooth and workshop to keep playing it for a longer time. Very recommended with any group of friends, especially with rookies."

Not only can you make your character have the most ridiculous customised skins, but you can spend hours just dragging each other along and throwing people off the edge of the map! Troll behaviour aside, the levels are very fun, and in later levels can be pretty complex!

23715,"First off, I highly recommend Human: Fall Flat! It is the best game of its kind! There are many different ways to solve the puzzles in all of the levels, and even more options and opportunities for fun open up with the more friends that you have. If you don't have any friends available to play, single-player can still be quite fun, or I'm sure you could make some new friends by joining an online game or talking to the friendly people on the Discord Server ( discord.gg/hff ). I found the controls to be intuitive and responsive enough to make navigating the physics-based worlds and platforming a dream. The official levels are enough to provide hours of entertainment, but the introduction of official workshop support has already shown what awesome content the community can produce! I hope to keep seeing new stuff and continue playing this game for many years to come."
23716,"This game is the funniest shit ever. I don't think I've laughed as hard as I have playing this game since the Chappelle Show came out waaaay back,"

23761,tbh just mess around and dont do any of the levels until 3hrs later. quite cool tho
23762,Just good silly fun.
23763,Laughed so much i cried
23764,Definately recommend playing with friends with this game.
23765,The mechanics are fairly easy to learn and sometimes there is more than one solution to problems that you encounter - it makes for a fun game to play with your friends.
23766,哈哈哈哈哈
23767,Must play with friends
23768,"Fun with physics!!  The game is wonky, difficult to control, and that's what makes it hilariously fun to play with friends.  Have a blast and enjoy! :)"
23769,funy game
23770,"Great fun with friends! Although you could probably get through the game in less than a couple of hours, you'll spend so many more finally all the secrets hidden by the level developers to rack up those Steam achieves. With the marketplace for HFF in its infancy, good community levels can be hard to find, but the original levels are the best designed puzzle levels I've seen in some time."
23771,Human Fall Flat is an absolutely fantastic and hilarious game for the whole family to enjoy. I've spent ages playing this by myself but it's always better with friends. Some levels on this game do get confusing and are sometimes hard to follow but its generally really fun to play.
23772,"Great workshop support with a lot of possibilities to create a further gaming experince besides the official content.

...I call it the ""wiggly woggly wtf are my arms doing"" simulator: You need patience and creativity to figure out the levels but also the way to hande your human.
Enjoyable and long-lasting game with good content and a lovely design. 10/10"
23773,Great coop game
23774,">levelı yapılması gerektiği gibi yapmaya çalışırsın

23779,Nah
23780,"Dumb premise, glitchy physics, and clumsy controls.

10/10"
23781,"A great game, need to learn how to control it but it is heaps of fun. :)"
23782,Played this with my GF and found that it so stressful yet satisfying when we finally completed a level.
23783,It is so satisfying to throw you friend outside the map while they try to get to the end <3
23784,its addicted xD
23785,Great game to play with friends!
23786,"great game, my nan plays it all the time when she baby sits me"

23795,very good gam
23796,Extremely amusing.
23797,Great
23798,10/10
23799,"Great game. The levels are fun and reward exploration, while the movement is entertaining and at time hilarious, while still being pretty useful once you get the hang of it. More people = more fun, and with local coop, it just gets better."
23800,lol this games sick lil bro
23801,Its pretty fun
23802,Fun to play
23803,"When the lobby has you gripped, you know a game's good."

23805,This game is some quality co-op fun if you have friends. I didn't have much fun D:
23806,Dope
23807,"I have no problems with the game except for the fact that the gameplay of
the character is a little wonky at times. I got this for a friend,
and he reviewed it, saying that it gives him a headache. oh well"
23808,Very funny!!!
23809,falling big fun
23810,Great Fun With Friends
23811,Very nice
23812,"Good game, but beware.

Devs/Publisher pulled a really nasty move and [b]silently[/b] removed Linux support.

Not only removing it, but entirely breaking it by walling off Linux users to play with Win/OSX users due to version checks.
Could be fixed if the Linux depot would be deleted, but that is apparently too hard.

Now to play again with other platforms, Linux users have to force Steam to download the Windows version and use Proton.

I'm not against the decision, it's understandable that more platforms are a pain to a small team, but this could have been handled extremely better than it has been."
23813,"Amazing, Hilarious, and sometimes suprisingly difficult due to controls, but all the funnier! multiplayer will always be way cooler with this sort of game:)"
23814,"A fun physics based puzzle-platformer. Can be a little on the frustrating side at times, though, particularly when it comes to making tricky jumps.

Character customization is always a big seller for me and this game delivers, allowing to paint directly on the character model. My only complaints about it are that you have to zoom in and out to get to certain parts of the body which can lead to uneven lines and that the brush bleeds through to whatever part is directly underneath the part you're drawing on, meaning you can accidentally paint over hard to recreate detail work. Thankfully, Crtl+z is a thing so most of the time you can undo your mistakes.

I don't think I'd be recommending this if I played it by myself. I highly advise convincing a few friends to pick this up as well if you're interested."
23815,Nice time killer.
23816,"I'm not sure what it is about rag-doll physics that tickles my funny bone but one thing I do know; whenever I see it, I may laugh so hard a little bit of pee comes out. Two hours of game-play and Human: Fall Flat has yet to force me into a wardrobe change but I guess it's only a matter of time."
23817,"I HATE THIS GAME! AND HERE'S WHY:

~I spent countless hours on a game that has so much easier solutions. Think you found the quickest way to solve the puzzles? WELL YOUR WRONG. There's even easier routes. But wait, There's also troll routes, ways that are having you spend countless hours making you think you found the solution.


.....Nice Job! :)"
23818,"If you're unsure, check out the first 10 minutes of gameplay:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE_4jbZ_6jA&t=545s

This game is great with a bunch of friends. Even just messing about in the lobby is entertaining!"
23819,This game is way better with friends
23820,such an engaging game . install it and have fun with old friends .
23821,goood game :D
23822,"I have so many great memories from this game, I used to play it all the time with my friends, and there is never a moment that I don't enjoy playing this game, definitely would recommend trying this game out."
23823,"Can throw my friends off the map
10/10"
23824,Great game very funny
23825,"Pointless game but scarilly addictive, WTF!!"

23829,Legal :)
23830,Always get a laugh out of this one
23831,"THIS GAME IS GREAT, A lot of fun game modes to play"
23832,"It is a really fun game to play with friends, and it's good in solo too because puzzles are somewhat interesting. But sometimes it may feel like a drag because of game mechanics but it is really fun to play."
23833,"loads of fun with friends, hoping for more content soonish :)"
23834,Fell flat
23835,Very good
23836,lots of fun with friends. you'll be laughing although. :)
23837,"This game is just an overall funny, laughter based game which makes it appeal to fans. This game is built so well for just only one person making this game happen. Even when it breaks, it still is hilarious. Although this game is short, it still makes up for it with the recent addition of the steam workshop."
23838,Just a simple funny drinking game. I connect with my military buddy's and have a few drinks. We laugh so hard it hurts the next day.
23839,its good
23840,"Me drunkenly stumbling home simulator. Slightly inaccurate because you can friends in this game, but otherwise damn near perfect."
23841,It's pretty fun physics game. Bring a friend with you for a better experience.
23842,10/10
23843,Good Game
23844,"Phenomenal fun.

The only complaint people have had about this game is that they want more levels.

505 released 2 new ones as of my purchase of the game. Nominate it for the Steam Awards!"
23845,this game is fun if playing with many friends
23846,coolies
23847,A game where holding another players hand is mandatory.
23848,Great game played with my bro
23849,"This game is not your avarange puzzle maker. At first I thought I wasted my money on this game but now I love it. 
Playing it with friends makes this game really shine. You can have so much fun , even if you don't like this genre.
Also the background music is sooooooo emotional .
"
23850,This game is great with some friends.
23851,goated
23852,Yes
23853,Very fun game
23854,good hillarius game
23855,Great game and extremely fun to play with friends!
23856,Fun to play with friendos
23857,Its a fun game to play alone or with friends
23858,"This game is fun to solo if you like puzzles, and the multiplayer is most enjoyable thanks to the steam workshop. You can get endless laughs with friends experiencing your wobbly characters trying to achieve a goal, or simply mess around. Every level has different ways of going at it and the aforementioned workshop is a huge plus.

also the soundtrack is really beautiful.

Definitely recommended."
23859,Wacky game for a fun night with friends.
23860,wonky is good
23861,I reinstalled this game after a few years of not playing it. Let me tell you about how much and how hard I laughed from playing with friends. We had some decent fun doing the levels but the community created levels... that's where the real gold is. We played a hockey one and were non-stop laughing from how absurd the game became. Everyone grabbed sticks but I decided to just grab the puck and run it to the goal. It essentially became football when we started running defense and interference. The game is 11/10.
23862,"Very good game, especially with friends."
23863,Funny...at first it was tough...but the more you play and laugh at it...its an amazingly dumb game....good memes
23864,Fun game.
23865,very fun and cool
23866,Simple and Fun
23867,So goofy but sooooo good i laugh my ass off everytime i play
23868,Just bought this game for a few friends of mine to try. 6 hours later we would recommend it and had many laughs. For about $8 I would say this game was definitely worth it. It would be nice to see more levels added to the base game.
23869,Must Buy too much fun to play with friends
23870,Funny game
23871,"I think this game is most enjoyable with a bunch of friends to play with. You can just mess around and have a good time and you don't even have to pay attention to what's going on half of the time and you will still get a kick out of this game. Playing alone is pretty enjoyable too, at that point it's a silly puzzle/platformer game of sorts that can but doesn't always get you thinking hard. But every time I have played with friends it has never failed to make me laugh or just have a good time. And now that the game has workshop maps there is so much more possibility for single player and multiplayer fun. Overall this is a pretty solid game"
23872,"If you think about it, this game is WWE 2k20. I love it"
23873,If you have at least one friend this is a blast!
23874,"At first the game was lacking with the few levels it had, but since they opened the workshop it is totally worth the money. Great laughs all night!"

23986,This game is good :D
23987,"You HAVE to play this game with friends. I first played most of this game through my brother's account since he had a steam link and controllers so we could hook it up on a bigger screen, but I ended up buying it anyway because it was fun and just in case I felt the need to play it when I was away on campus. lol

Whether you work together to solve puzzles, find hidden entrances, or just waste away 10 minutes fooling around trying to throw each other off, it's always loads of fun! The art ranging from the characters to the details of the landscape and scenery is very nice and user-friendly. The scale of the landscape is wide, and I like how interactive it is. It can just get a little frustrating sometimes when you can't figure it out, but just remember to be patient and work it out. It's hard to put its value in words, but I would say it's worth the cost."
23988,Pretty fun game to mess around with some friends.
23989,hfjkfkgj
23990,Really fun game to play with friend! Control are a bit funcky at the beginning but you get use to it!

24006,"I love this game! The physics are great and easy to learn. The levels are tough but if you use your imagination you can figure it all out. The game struggled to work on my worse than average laptop but if you turn down the settings a bit should run pretty smooth. 
Also, I love how your character doddles around and the customization is absolutely amazing!"

Although it doesn't have a ton of maps, you could always DL it from other peoples Workshop and Mods. Each level gets more challenging but because its so flexible, there are just so many ways you can get around the maps without going through the intended obstacles.
.

I recommend you buy it on sale c: 
Because then, you can get one  for ya gf/bf, or friends <3 yknowwatimsayin

24172,"This is the kind of game that is an absolute joy to play with friends. It's fun to screw around by yourself, but you will get bored pretty quickly. But with friends, and now that the steam workshop was added? There's a ton of fun to be had here. 110% worth the money, even if you only put a few hours into it. There's not much else to be said, it's just a ridiculous amount of fun and laughs.

I would like to see more official levels, hopefully we'll see more like the Halloween addition in the future."

24287,"[h1]Puzzle Beasts![/h1]
Although it is a rather short and very easy game, its great FUN! I often find myself coming back to the game hoping in online lobbys to speed run the game with whoever I can find. Ive beaten the game 3 times in a row with one of the groups i joined because the game is just pure fun! If you enjoy physics based games, platformers, or puzzle games at all I would highly recommend the game to you. Just keep in mind the game will not give you a challenge through the intricacy of the solutions, the main challenge comes from the way the platforming works. However unlike games such as surgeon simulator the controls are very easy to pick up. In conclusion this is a great game to mess around on solo or co-op, and its the type of game were if it looks fun to you im sure you wont be disappointed! (Side note: There is a TON of workshop content that adds a lot of playtime and a bit of challenge to the game.)

[b]In conclusion:[/b] You get a lot of bang for your buck here and you may want to grab an extra copy for a friend!"

A lovely little physics-based platformer/puzzle game. Quite nice and peaceful. The real fun comes when you mess around with friends in multiplayer. Work together to make any puzzle easy, or just flop all around and get nothing done. Additionally, the achievements are quite fun to get, not really grindy.

24289,fun
24290,lots of fun with friends. derpy movement is adorable and amusing
24291,Its a gamer game
24292,"Great game for dicking around with friends. Puzzles are fun and varied, and the shenanigans are top-tier. Absolutely worth the purchase!"
24293,Better to play with friends
24294,"extremely fun with friends, highly recommend this game, and good price on sale."
24295,Great game to play with your friends
24296,is good
24297,"Great co op experience, played it with a partner and its super cute and fun. Only wish is that there were more maps as we went through it pretty quickly."
24298,A really excellent one of a kind game. i do recommend it

24300,Good
24301,so kek
24302,"I played Human Fall Flat with my sister and we had a great time. Things can get a little wonky sometiemes, but that's part of the challenge 
(Not super relevant side note: I think the way the characters waddle is really charming). 
Highly recommended - especially if you're planning to play with a friend"
24303,veri epic gayme
24304,h
24305,"This is a great game, which i had good times with my friends, a lot of weird stuff happened"
24306,"Right now it's 50% off. Despite the graphics and simple look, there is absolutely no excuse not to get this little gem right away! Playing this with friends made us all tear up laughing. We have all played games for 25 years or more and finding games where this happens is truely like finding a needle in a haystack! One of my friends was not convinced from the look of the game, I gifted it to him and he also made the remark that it had been forever since he had so much good, simple fun and laughed so hard in a game. 

It reminds me about Gang Beasts - but so much more fun and puzzle oriented. So many ways to solve the puzzles and soooo many ways that things will turn into something non intentional and hysterical funny! 

If you have a few friends to play with using discord or teamspeak or whatever, this game is a must. It's entertaining in it's own glorious way. I rarely write a review, and even more rare after only 8 hours of playtime, but I simply have to recommend this. 

10/10 would save my buddy again despite him hanging on only to my crutch while we are swinging over the abyss  after something went wrong, as things tend to do alot in this game, but that's what makes us love it even more! 

Get it... like seriously... get it..."
24307,"A game that will make you laugh with ur friends, if you have any to play with :D"
24308,"love the game, would play more if my friend didnt talk to his e-girl all the time"

I will be delving further into it soon and will update my review once I understand the game more fully. As of right now, I would recommend it."
24368,"This game welcomes you to a world of dreams where in the normal ""local"" levels, you're entering rooms with puzzles. Most of which you can skip by exploiting the physics and climbing around things.
The game has an active modding community, so it has custom models and levels made with Unity.
The multiplayer works well both online and locally. Promised a good time for a friend group."
24369,Fun with friends
24370,Yes
24371,"One of the most frustrating games, ive ever played, but really really good fun"

24424,"Lots of fun, for adults and for kids. :D play fall and do it again."
24425,"Takes a bit to get used to the controls, but it's a fun puzzle/platformer. Highly recommend with friends."
24426,"Sweet game! 
Played it all with a friend and we went to complete the whole gave and get every achievment.
Lots of bugs to find and abuse.
Got about 15 hours of fun :D
Totally worth and wacky"
24427,it was fun
24428,"This game is built around solving puzzles with weird hand controls, and initially, it's pretty fun. But by the time you get to the more involved and interesting levels, you're probably so tired of the slow and clunky control scheme that you won't be as interested in actually beating them. And, if you are interested in beating them? There's only about four to five fleshed out levels."
24429,goog game pepehands
24430,bruh
24431,Very fun
24432,Absolute Mayhem. A truly unique type of game. Kind of 3rd person view puzzle game. Where the parts you and your group need to move forward are in the world and in your brain. Combine elements of the world to create openings where there are none to advance to the next Map. More fun in a group but still enjoyable alone!
24433,"Great game, great with friends, even better with Workshop support."
24434,haha
24435,Nothing to say here: just play it and enjoy.
24436,very fun

24439,title doesnt lie
24440,This game really fun to play with friend and u will had meny shitty momment with your friend trust me =]]]
24441,Stop thinking and just buy it. workshop provides endless content and the ridiculous things you'll see and get into is worth the price. and if its on sale then its a steal in my opinion.
24442,"Nice game, better with friends."
24443,suck big ass
24444,Fun to play with friends over Voice Chat. :)
24445,"This game is mixed with many factors. Comedy, messed up physics, character editing and multiplayer. I love every bit of this game~~ :3"
24446,"Great game. Fun is increased greatly when played with friends
"
24447,"Great game overall. I recommend multiplayer but I enjoyed getting the achievements solo too.

Controls feel a bit funky at first but it gets better.
Official levels are amazing, had a blast playing them with couple of friends. Too bad there's only 10 of them...
Workshop levels are OK but not really comparable to the official ones."
24448,"Really simple, fun and challenging puzzle game. Really good music as well"
24449,fun to play with friends
24450,its fun
24451,"This game is a special one. The graphics is simple (yet pleasant to look at). There are no demanding or competetive gameplay mechanics. Also no particular plot. None of them are needed. This is not what this game is centered around. To be honest apart form some jumping puzzles, actual puzzles and satisfying physics engine there is really not much else here. But that is fine. Crucial even. Because this game is about you filling in the blanks. It will let you experience as much fun with it as you are willing to have. In other words it will not entertain you any more than you let it. You have to take what it gives you and entertain yourself.
I can hardly imagine playing it solo. However, if you are to play it with a friend I would say that this is one of the best coop experiences I have ever had and its value skyrockets. It is all about fooling around, making fun of each other and crafting jokes as you go.
So, if you have someone to play with go for it and let yourself enjoy this wonderful game."
24452,Great game to play with friends
24453,it fun

24461,"Good game, everyone should by when sale"

24463,"Love the game, even though its a little bit short. Its cool that you can also play offline multiplayer"

And the workshop update made this game even better."
24506,Cool physics fun gameplay
24507,Plenty of fun. Tactically annoying. Play with friends or join random online worlds. Many mods allow for unlimited gameplay!
24508,"""Fun with Friends"" kind of game; you'll get a lot of laughs out of this.

The limited amount of built-in levels has been a bummer, but now steam workshop levels are available."

24519,FUN AF [strike]if you have friends[/strike]
24520,Really good if you have a group and a strong desire to mess around
24521,"Physics based puzzles, interaction with world. Extremely fun, especially when played with others. Interesting way to implement graphics, where the objects don't seem to have any textures but still manage to look great thanks to shaders and whatnot. Controls are bit odd at first, however you get used to them quickly. In game worlds are built around certain themes - in respect to both puzzles and graphics/atmosphere. Talking about atmosphere - the OST is fantastic!"
24522,"nice game, i'll give it 5 stars if i can"
24523,yum

24536,"climb things, grab things, throw friends off :) for sure worth the cold hard cash"
24537,"This is the ultimate sandbox experience. Physics work amazingly well, the exploration aspect is always entertaining and rewarding, and destroying things is always a great deal of fun. Especially now that this supports Workshop, you can spend countless hours doing all kinds of things in this game without it ever getting boring. 

Absolutely hilarious when played with friends.

I recommend watching Jacksepticeye and Robin play it before making a full decision. If you don't, I still recommend getting it if you are interested because it is definitely an amazing game to play; especially when you have no internet."

24552,Yes
24553,Always has me laughing with my friends
24554,"an amazing an wacky game to play either by yourself, or with friends! Of course playing with friends is most certainly the highlight of this game. And since workshop maps are now a thing, the fun is endless! Most certainly a great party game with friends, i highly recommend!"

"
24592,Buy it if you have someone to play with.
24593,It's fun
24594,"Human Fall Flat is a fun little puzzler with plenty of hilarity in its scenarios. The levels feel like playgrounds where you could do whatever you want. With the ability to play this alone or co-op, plenty of ways are out there to create chaos. That doesn't mean it is all well and dandy, as holding on to objects can be a bit wonky and playing solo shouldn't be done in long play sessions. That being said, I still really enjoyed what this crazy game tried to do."
24595,"Love it, I play this with my friend and it's always a lot of fun 10/10"
24596,It is pretty dope
24597,"One of my favorite games of all time. I really enjoy the physics-based puzzle aspects of this game, the models are cute as hecc, it's both singleplayer- and coop-friendly, overall very enjoyable."

24599,Good game and fantastic workshop contents
24600,yuman
24601,"The base of the game is great however it lacked a lot of content, now with the workshop its become a fantastic game with lots of hilarious moments. This game should be played with multiple people however. TIP if you don't have a lot of mouse pad space you might want to increase your dpi."
24602,Fun game
24603,Fun to play with friends! :)
24604,"Hilarious, challenging, and fun with friends.

I mean what isn't to love about this game?

Bonus - How to Twerk:

Begin by looking to the ground in anticipation and relax the glutes. With both hands firmly grab hold of terra firma. While maintaining an iron grip, look into the sky.

Bounce that bottom.

Be sure to look over your shoulder at your audience. Note the glow in their eyes.  You gave that to them."

24628,"Absolutely LOVE this game.  The levels are the perfect degree of difficulty, and there are many solutions to each level... and Bob is adorable"

24634,Silly and fun with friend(s).
24635,Really nice and Dumb game
24636,Great co-op game to play with friends. Would recommend.
24637,"this game is great its best played with friends, but could be played solo. Its great if you love playing games where you need to solve mini puzzles to continue in the level, or enjoy exploring maps that are interesting and engaging. The workshop for this game is also beginning to thrive. People are extremely creative with there maps and skins you can put on your character."
24638,Yes.
24639,"At its most primitive state: the bones of a puzzle are to get from Point A to Point B, to put everything in place to complete the task at hand.  The glory of the puzzle relies solely on the maker at hand: putting obstacles and rules in place to make the puzzle more challenging and engaging to the participant.  In 2016, a small studio released their unique decision on their obstacles and rules: wonky physics, intuitive obstacles, and 8-player madness.

[b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] follows Bob, a particularly wobbly fellow who finds himself within his dreams, dreams that require him to use ingenuity and a keen eye to make it past obstacles that block his path find the exit of his dreams.  Your Bob is fully customizable, with preset options and colors to choose from.  If you're feeling creative, you can draw a specific face for your character, or use a webcam and add yourself onto your Bob.  Bob will have to navigate through 10 levels that will take you from catapulting and scaling castles to navigating and surviving rapid waters.  Enjoy every level with up to 8 friends online, and enjoy the infinite levels beyond with the newly added Steam Workshop!

[b]Fall Flat[/b]'s most interesting quality is the quirkiness and movement of the characters.  Almost every task is done with the floppy arms of your Bob: pressing buttons, winding back catapults, even driving a stick shift tractor trailer.  The left and right arm have individual buttons, when an arm is selected, it reaches out and Bob's hands become like glue, sticking to whatever surface or object comes in contact.  Bob will be able to climb up ledges and maneuver around each level...maybe not with the greatest of ease.  Part of what makes [b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] difficult is the general oddity of navigating around each level with Bob.  It's almost intentionally frustrating, and it will take some getting used to, but the handicaps of not having full movement make the puzzles that much more satisfying when they're completed.

The real bread and butter revolves around the multiplayer of [b]Human: Fall Flat[/b].  Having 8 Bobs all vying towards a single goal will almost always end in some kind of hilarious travesty.  I can't recall a single session where I haven't been laughing and yelling at my friends for hours on end.  The combination of that many minds trying to complete a task with the stunted movements and floaty physics is a match made in heaven, even if you start to realize who you would and wouldn't trust as the leader.  The newly added Steam Workshop content will be the saving grace for the longevity of this title: you'll always have your mixed bag of how good a level actually runs, but we've found some really creative levels that really push the physics and creativity to a whole new level, and has had us loading up the game more and more.

The off-center style of movement and puzzle solving may turn some away at first, but [b]Human: Fall Flat[/b] is absolutely worth the time.  I love the simplistic art style and the way [b]No Brakes Games[/b] took a kooky idea, that can be frustrating to control, and transformed it into a hilariously good time: just make sure you bring your friends for the ride.

24692,This game is a blast to play with friends. The controls take some time to get used to but once you get the hang of it you can really do a lot of maneuvering! The created custom maps and everything means that you can always come back and have something new to do.

24720,BEST GAME
24721,"Great Game, wish there were more levels"
24722,"The first time I played this game it was fun, but replaying it felt boring. 

Since then, they've added workshop support. So now you practically have endless levels to play."
24723,"Funny physics, hilarious narration, and awesome levels. Definitely worth the money."
24724,"It's probably not such a bad game for what it is, and it's multiplayer too"
24725,Best game ever to release stress
24726,"有朋友一起起来玩起来绝对不错的说
匹配的话有时很懊恼..."
24727,"It's just simple, cooperative (or not) fun, nothing too complex, some skill required and some patience... characters are a bit slow when walking, but other than that, its a fantastic game."
24728,It's short but quite fun to play.
24729,Super fun game to play with your friends (and by yourself too). It's floppy gameplay is awesome.

"
24741,Nice game for friends
24742,Great coop game to completely lose track of time in
24743,"Human Fall Flat is unlike any game I've played. It has traits that involve goofy physics and puzzles that you can complete with your friends. How the game makes you think is so exciting as for what may happen next is out of your control, so you have to think of what might work next. The multiplayer is amazing, with your friends you can goof around and throw each other off buildings or use your teamwork to complete the next obstacle. You'll be playing on their given maps, in my opinion there aren't that many but that is why you have the workshop too download more maps and funny player models. I would recommend this game if you like funny physics and some silly game play that could also be challenging. I recommend it even more with friends!"
24744,good game
24745,"Onlyu played 4 hrs with a friend and could not stop laughing. The mecchanicsa are pretty impressive I must say, i am really having a blast.

If you enjoy solving puzzles alone or with a friend I truly recomend this game"
24746,"A 'must have' game, that you would like to play with your friends XD"
24747,"Fun, addicting and challenging.
Awesome game, even if you don't have friends to play with"
24748,Its alright
24749,Best game iv'e played with friends!!!
24750, 1213
24751,This is a solid Puzzle game that is constantly changing its core game-play. No level is the same. More enjoyable with friends.
24752,"I really like physics based games. I really like puzzle games. Put those together and you have Human: Fall Flat, a physics-based puzzle game where you put your brain before your skeleton, apparently. It's nice to strain your brain for answers alone, but when you have a few friends with you, spending your time at the start of the level admiring each others playermodels and throwing yourselves off the ledge, the game gets REALLY good."
24753,Funny as hell with friends
24754,very delicious
24755,!!
24756,Very nice
24757,Good game with friends
24758,Better now with workshop

24765,10/10
24766,Shut up just try this game!!
24767,"With the great music and the puzzles that are satisfying to resolve,yet  very easy,I truly think this game is very relaxing to play.No need to think complicated and the feelings when you solve the puzzle and the music comes in..... It's the best things to have while playing this game.Also this game supports multiplayer,but I recommend you to refrain it when you first play it.There are currently about 10 maps which will probably take you 10 hours.Just clear them all,feel what I just said,and you will have my permission to play with others."
24768,One of the best games.
24769,good game i like
24770,i like this game quality. very fun to play together with friends.
24771,nice game
24772,"The workshop is T-Posing on us, we must buy this game to T-Pose on them back!"
24773,"It's all fun and game until someone decides to pick you up and throw you off a cliff.

Overall, it's a very fun game. Best to play with friends. But if alone, while likely not AS fun, it's a decent puzzle game. The Steam Workshop integration also means that some... interesting... content can be made and shared by the community. But like any game, that just enriches the experience. It's definitely worth it and I would recommend."
24774,Fun game
24775,Sick game with friends
24776,Since the addition of workshop maps this game has become twice as good. The content is pretty much endless and it's an amazing game to play with friends.
24777,Amazing game! allot better now with steam workshop support! :D
24778,"This is a fun physics based puzzle game to play with your friends.
"
24779,Great game to fool around and have fun with friends.
24780,An exellent fun game and now that workshop support is her im looking forward to some new user content

24790,"Great Game, but is more fun when playing with friends."
24791,"Hilarious physics platformer, great fun with friends."
24792,"Very fun to play with friends since you can always screw eachother up just for laughs.
There is also multiple ways for most of the levels to get to the end."
24793,weird
24794,"Play this at 2am with a full group of friends, trust me. It's ridiculously fun and frustrating in a good way. Half the time, you're wrestling with your bud to either throw them off the edge or prevent yourself from being thrown off. Highly recommend!"
24795,funny games worth playing
24796,Really fun Co-op. I would recommend you to play it with friends.
24797,"Had so much fun playing this with friends, had us laughing for hours and hours."

24808,Great game.
24809,"Silly, whacky, fun, Co op and great game to play with friends. 
I will grab my friends from the falling edge and let them go to death."
24810,"Human Fall Flat the puzzle game that you can finish every stage more than 1 ways, and somehow it's not boring to play with your friends even tho you'll repeat the stage more than one."
24811,"A really hilarious game with challenging puzzles, add a friend to increase how hilarious it is."
24812,"The first time I looked at this game I thought it was a joke, it doesn't look appealing at all in the trailers, but, that's only because the trailers aren't put together well enough, this game is one of the best that I have played on Steam and it is amazing with friends. All there is that's problematic is the servers aren't the greatest so you will experience lag with other players, hosting or otherwise."
24813,good game
24814,is cool

24820,"This game is so much fun specially if you;re playing with your friends. The laughter will make your jaw hurt. My only criticism for this game is the hosting connection problem as sometimes the delay can be incredibly annoying.

Overall it is one of the best games to play with friends and if you really don't like your jaw."

24864,"One of my favorite games ever.
The physics are impeccable, the controls are wacky, and the levels are super interesting.
It's just very short and the community is basically only chinese and koreans."
24865,"superrrrrrrrrrrrrrr fun when playing with friends!
"
24866,To anyone who suffers from motion sickness: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I eagerly purchased this game as I enjoy puzzle-based games and the videos showed the game from a stationary viewpoint. I mistakenly assumed I would be able to somehow stabilize the viewing area while playing. Nope. Could not even complete the first puzzle before becoming violently ill due to the game mechanics. There is no way to zoom way out. Every single step causes the entire screen to wobble and sway with the character's movements. Five minutes of playtime and now I'll be sick for hours. Wonderful.
24867,Good fun with friends.
24868,That's funny-strategy game that you should buy it
24869,"Probably the most fun I've had playing with friends. It's quick, simple, but very enjoyable. My face always hurts from smiling when we're done."
24870,This is definitely the best game to play with your friends regardless wether you like it or not
24871,so far so good
24872,good game
24873,i laugh
24874,"What appears to be a Flat, boring game... turns out to be one of the most enjoyable puzzle games around .. especially when playing with friends! 

10/10... would drag you off a cliff again!"
24875,it gud
24876,This is an incredible fun game to play with friends and the customization is simple yet enjoyable!
24877,Nice
24878,It's a very fun game to play with your friends. It's hilarious and enjoyable and even make your own maps. Customize your characters and use workshop maps for more. You can't get bored of this game unless your those types of people who can't play for a long period of time.
24879,"Don't hesitate, buy this game, it is awesome, good times!!!"
24880,great game for playing with friend if you still have any..
24881,falling is more fun than succeeding
24882,It's alright.
24883,great drunk fun
24884,Fun game to play with some friends and endless workshop levels to keep you entertained.
24885,"walk around as a ragdoll, and get ready to laugh. i played this with two of my friends, i have never laughed so much in my life. 
Fun puzzle game, but feels way to short, 

i buyed it, played in few hours, then complete. 
but still, from the fun i had by playing it, yes its worth it."
24886,BEST Funny GAME EVER!! This game also train our mind to think how to solve the level!!
24887,good and fun game
24888,great and hilarious physics/puzzle game
24889,mateeeee its coolll MABAR!!!!
24890,"A really fun game to play with friends, Human: Fall Flat does not fall short in providing a fun, sometimes chaotic, gaming experience. You'd like to think solving puzzles in this game is a piece of cake but you'll quickly learn just how wrong that assumption can be! Prepare to find out just how mischievous and hellish your friends can be because you'll likely have at least one person trying to actively sabotage progress at every step (that, and getting distracted by trying to get to areas that likely have nothing to do with actually solving the room)."
24891,i'm glad that i can dress up as my favorite communist dictator and throw my friends into the void
24892,good game with friends
24893,I really enjoy this game cause you can finish levels like in any way and with the custom maps now i could go on here and have a blast w/ my friends on like just about any day. its great
24894,Nice game! (y)

"
24902,"Great fun - doesn't require amazing gamer skills to pickup and play, part of the fun is the frustration of badly controlling your invincible blob through, over and around the world in ways that aren't supposed to happen."
24903,"Enjoyable game, I just wish they added more.

The Steam workshop is a good community.

24908,Good fun!
24909,"A charming little physics game that will have you rolling in laughter at all the ridiculous situations you can get yourself into. While there is 2 player local coop, the controller movements are much more difficult to master compared to mouse and keyboard, which may result in some frustration. A memorable experience regardless."
24910,ok a

24914,Didn't think I would like this game at first but as I played hours flew by.  In the end I enjoyed the silly and goofy style of this game and was a good purchase.
24915,Very funny!
24916,This game is very easy to play and grants so much fun if you play it with your friends. I've lost count on how my friends and I have dragged each other to a cliff to laugh and changed funny skins.
24917,I wish more of my friends played this so that I could spend more time with this amazingness.
24918,Yes.
24919,Just Laugh 3: The CliffPush >> This Time Its Personal

24946,10/10
24947,"I've done so many playthroughs of this game, and I still never tire of it. The fact that you can complete the levels in so many different ways and that it's fully co-op (couch and online) sells the game itself. I highly recommend it for anyone who's into platforming games opr are looking for a game to relax with."

24958,Honestly one of the funniest games I've been! Better with friends.
24959,"It is fun. Do not expect any ground braking gameplay. The controls need getting used to bunt once you get the hang of it it is fun in a ""what else i can do here"" way. Coop is very nice with a lot of situations where you will be lauthing at the screen ;)"
24960,gg

24978,Very fun silly game that allows you to do puzzles your way or their way.
24979,I have been trying to start this game up but unfortunately there is no display and it looks to be corrupted. I've played this game before and it was fun but I wasn't able to play
24980,this game is badd

24982,fun to play
24983,"Nice game, fun!"

24987,"Very fun to do stupid things with friends.
or solve puzzles.. that too."
24988,Fun game to play with friends so far! XD
24989,Great laugh with your m8s
24990,"Extremely fun to play with friends, recommended 9/10."
24991,Really fun game especially with friends
24992,It's a game for humans.
24993,best causal game ever played
24994,fun :3
24995,"poes funny
"
24996, always had so much fun and looking forward to play it more. The game combines easy/medium puzzles with a funny and tricky physic that makes the easiest tasks not so easy to perform
24997,"Human: Fall Flat is a game in the genre of ""Wacky Physics Controls"" a la Surgeon Simulator, Goat Simulator, or Octodad: Dadliest Catch.

Where the physics in these other games often leads to frustration more than enjoyment, Human: Fall Flat treads the line much more carefully. Although it still takes a bit of getting used to, when the controls click, they feel intuitive and natural. Simply grabbing a ledge and watching your human clamber up a ledge is a joy. Similarly, the puzzles in Human: Fall Flat rely more on intuitive solutions than fighting the difficult controls. Grabbing a hook to slide down a wire, using a windmill to launch yourself, or a glass window with a fire extinguisher provides a cinematic moment made all the more satisfying because the controls are grounded and almost tactile.

Extended multiplayer and workshop features are an excellent addition. If solving puzzles by yourself is fun, then doing in while one or more friends struggle for control of a boat or fight to throw one another off ledges is double so. Workshop levels, while not as extensive as the likes of Garry's Mod, bring an extra couple hours of enjoyment and the promise of creating your own puzzles - though I personally have not used the Unity integration to develop any myself.

As with these other physics games, even though Human: Fall Flat is an outlier, there are moments of jank where you can't just get your little arm to grab that ledge, or the water wheel that normally lifts you to the exit is weighed down by your extra companions. Likewise, there are cheap solutions such as swinging just right along a wall to slowly climb upwards; though some of these are still satisfying.

Ultimately, all I can say is while I loved the game, I wish there were more official levels. Human: Fall Flat brings a bouncy and jiggly world to life, and I wish I could spend more time there.
"
24998,Fun to play with friends and now has workshop maps
24999,"Not much content when i played first, but it's so much fun with friends."
25000,It Is 10/10
25001,"Simple to play and enjoyable, best played with friends but can still be completed solo.  Depending on skill the levels provided can be completed somewhat quickly, but workshop provides plenty more adventures.  This game is great for what it sets out to do."
25002,Earth-chan not flat
25003,gud geme
25004,10/10
25005,"Really fun game, Still updating with new maps. and nice puzzle's"
25006,very funny with friends
25007,"Single-player: Can become quite tedious alone, but at least you don't have to worry about people throwing you off cliffs. ;)
Multiplayer: Extremely fun with friends
Community: Really good

Overall: 7.5/10"
25008,vedi gud
25009,"fun game. Play with a friend or more.
We almost died (in game) laughing so so much.

The workshop skins add to the humor by an order of magnitude.

Its on summer sale until july 9th and DEFINITELY worth the the discounted price.
The default puzzles are great.
"
25010,++
25011,So very glad they added steam workshop levels!
25012,"Funny physics, funny to play with friends"
25013,"Very fun game, hours of fun even when I beat the game because you can download player-made maps and play with friends!"
25014,Very fun with friends. DO NOT buy this game unless your playing with friends because if you play by yourself its just boring. The graphics are nice but the controls your gonna have to get used to a little bit. Other then that the game is good and i recommend it if you want to play a multiplayer puzzle game
25015,10/10 So much fun
25016,Fun game
25017,good game to enjoy <3
25018,<3
25019,its good game
25020,"I am just gonna say it, this game is a better parkour-simulator than any Assassin Creed game"
25021,Great game!
25022,"This is probably the most fun party game I've ever played, if you have friends just get it and make them buy it, it will be worth it :)))))))))))) no, I'm serious stop reading the reviews and do it. [b] NOW [/b] 😡

I'm not sure what the price tag is and I'm way too lazy to check, but even if it's around the Train Simulator 2020 with all the DLCs it's still worth it, I promise you, I'll go as far as to say that if you're not having a good time I will personally pay you back for whatever you paid for the game.[spoiler] I am not actually responsible for your spendings and am just giving a piece of friendly advice, therefore don't actually expect me to give u any money, stupid. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] Why the fuck are you looking for more, I told you to get it [/spoiler]"
25023,a very fun game with interesting physics based puzzle and very good community made map
25024,"This is a very fun game, especially with friends. The puzzles aren't too complicated, but they're complex enough for the game to still be fun. The main ""campaign"" can take anywhere from 4 to 6 hours to complete which I thought was a bit short, but this time can be extended further now that the developers added workshop support. Solid game, 9.5/10."
25025,"Amazing game to play with friends! all kinds of whacky and stupid fun
- 
10/10 should buy and even more at this price"
25026,"Fun to play with friends, LMAO! Loved it! xD"

25039,good
25040,"""Why do we fall, Bruce?
So we can learn to pick ourselves up again."""
25041,Awesome
25042,"This is really fun to play with friends and can turn chaotic if you have more than 4 people, especially if nobody listens. You can also play it alone but you just have to think more carefully about the puzzles. The physics are hilarious, especially if you get stuck and start jiggling.

You can customise your skin, the graphics basic, yet adorable. There's a few core game levels and there is an abundance of workshop content! The core maps get larger as you go along and can be completed in any way you please, by doing the task, taking a different path or just climb over everything!

Overall an entertaining game! Love playing the levels over again and trying out new content!"
25043,this game so funny.....if can voice chat inside game sure more fun
25044,Ragdoll!
25045,Really really comedic! just playing with 1 friend is really hilarious. one of the best games to pick up during steam sale due to the replayability of the game.
25046,"So ridiculously silly. Each level has a multitude of ways to be solved, so it definitely has replay value."
25047,"Pretty fun game to play with friends when you're bored, always have challenges to comlplete when you want it to be a bit more challenging, I'd recommend buying it !"
25048,Great fun
25049,Great sandbox for multiplayer madness with friends!

25101,"Fun with friends, boring alone."
25102,"I loved, i lost, i cried and i died. but most importantly i cause this game to last 2 hours longer for everyone i was playing with."
25103,Yes
25104,"This game is great fun with friends. I wish there were more levels, because you can get through them pretty quickly."
25105,"Quem criou este jogo tinha trissomia 20 e meio.
Recomendo"
25106,huyiq3yyhuasdvva
25107,I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS HILARIOUS GAME OMFG IM CRYING WRITTING THIS
25108,Fun game !
25109,This is so much freaking fun with a buddy...
25110,This game is fun and laid back. Ever since they came out with the community workshop the game is 10 times better than before. There are still bugs here and there and many things they can still make better but over all totally worth buying while on sale.
25111,"Stop reading reviews and just buy this game already, its absolutely phenomenal."
25112,"I love this game, it's absolutely hilarious to play with friends, though everyone tends to:

1) Go WWE on each other and beat up on someone while one person actually gets to the checkpoints. (Seriously, half the fun is 'fighting' each other.)
2) Get lost.
3) Constantly tries to 'sabotage' the level by throwing all the items off the edge.
4) Decides to get attached to one friend in the lobby and takes every single opportunity to hold onto them/grab them/bash their head into a wall or the ground until they fight back.
5) Everything literally just comes down to WWE. It's Fight Time and there are no friends, only enemies to throw off of the map edge. Your friend is gone, there is only The Edge. They will keep coming back. There is no stop to Fight Time.

Great game, fun game, highly recommend."
25113,great fun
25114,"I can pull my friends, who made their avatars look like the austrian guy with the funny mustache, into the abyss.

10/10 would restore the Reich again."
25115,"Flop around and win the game, easy :P
Love the fact that every level has tons of ways to beat it.
"
25116,this game is 100% gauranteed to make you laugh
25117,My friend wobY really suck at this game
25118,the pest sim
25119,Fun Game!
25120,"This featureless, pudgy, toddler-like character stumbling around drunkenly on screen is the best thing ever. People falling down is hilarious and while playing as a wobbly, awkward toddler-like character takes a lot of getting used to, the game leaves each level wide open to a variety of solutions to suit your own personal style. It can get a bit boring playing the whole game solo but you just join someone else's online game and the fun is right back to the level it was when you first got the game."
25121,"This game just keeps getting better, and with the recent addition of workshop support, the game now features endless fun."
25122,cool
25123,Awesome & fun game to play solo or even with friends!!!!! xDDD #funny_moments
25124,Amazing with friends
25125,I like the strip club
25126,"Amazing game! One of my favourites to just goof off in with my friends. Great controls, gameplay is great for hours of laughs if you're the kind of person who likes doing stupid stuff for the sake of doing it. The only complaint I have is that there seems to be lag in most online sessions"
25127,My kids absolutely love this game.  It is an enjoyable coop game.
25128,absolutely so much fun playing this with my friend :v ayyyy 11/10
25129,Pretty fun
25130,its fun since u can make dumb shit
25131,Enjoyable coop experience. Definitely will make you laugh
25132,Best coop game. You definitely must give it a shot. It has awesome physics and unique gameplay. Also it is updated regularly. Developers add new maps and mechanics.
25133,"threw my friend over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again telling her death is not an escape
10/10 would torture my friends again"
25134,"kalo main ini sama orang goblog, goblognya bakal nular sumpahdeh. apalagi kalo lu nya udah goblog duluan, udahdeh abis."

25149,fun with friends
25150,"I watched my fav caster played this game and didn't understand how could it be that difficult to solve the levels
...until i bought it and played it by myself (lol)

really funny and relaxing(?), especially when you play co-op with friends
trust me, just like Overcooked!

really recommend XD"
25151,"superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr goodddddddddddddddddddddddddddd

25152,Great time killer with friends.
25153,The game is best to play with a friend
25154,Great game to play with friends!
25155,"Drowned another player in the sea, bruteforced all the puzzles and made my character have sweat and piss stains all over in the character editor. 10/10 doing it right."
25156,"Love this game, great to play with friends or family."
25157,hit on da head
25158,Simply entertaining and good fun
25159,i like fire trucks and moster trucks
25160,I fell. I grabbed then fell. I grabbed then raised then fell. There was a lot of falling. 5/7 would fall again.
25161,It is a very fun game especialy in coop. also very adorable.
25162,"This is one game I enjoyed SO very much. I played it in CO-OP with my best friend who moved far away from where I live. We had a blast, laughed so much our abs still hurt to this day and have great shared memories.

The big plus is the added workshop with custom levels! Props to the devs for making the best silly physics based game :)"
25163,"Extremely fun game, levels are cool and community levels are amazing."
25164,"very cool
"
25165,you can fall. i like
25166,great game to play with friends
25167,"Human Fall Flat is great game to play with your friends incorporated with the ragdoll physics the game is hilarious. With the workshop made maps there is the ability to explore the vast creativity of the community and have an almost never ending fun. 
The game works best with a controller which does require an extra purchase but is worth it as there are many other games just like it."
25168,"Not quite what I thought it would be, but all the better for it. Has a portal-alike feel to some of the puzzle situations, working out just how to get the world (and your weird little body) to do what's needed to move on. I like this a lot more than I was expecting to."
25169,"Game with an unlimited amount of fun. Great time playing it by yourself, even better time when playing it with friends. Besides campaign there are quite a lot of workshop maps to continue with.

Developer is adding new maps that are free to play once you own the game.

Still standing behind the review above even after few years of playing this game."
25170,Great game 10 out of 10.
25171,Who knew drunken flailing could feel so natural?
25172,A fun game with ragdoll physic
25173,Accidentally did a puzzle starting at the end of it and ended up at the beginning of a level. 10/10
25174,"Human Fall Flat takes platforming and elevates it to a comedic level. There is a healthy amount of levels to progress through, each with their own unique puzzles to solve (or bypass completely). The game often presents you with little ways in which to ‘cheat’ or tricks you into thinking you're cheating, only to find you have been baited into a wild goose chase.

When you start the game, you have the option to customize your character with a variety of different outfits and heads. This adds massively to the game and makes characters easily distinguishable when playing with others and lets you add a bit of personality to the otherwise palette-less game. My favourite set up is the skeleton skin on a pirate with a peg leg, wearing a rubber duck dinky. Because who doesn’t love pirates? Or rubber duckies?"
25175,nice game
25176,"fun game with levels that lets you and your friends see who is the stupid one in the group :)
its also very fun to just mess around in the map"
25177,"Grab some tissues. 
It's hilarious!"
25178,"If you know, you know"
25179,I had a really fun and joyful experience playing this game. Get's even better with Co-op!
25180,"Really fun game to play with friends! The co-op was really fun and made you think a lot at times, the models and whatnot were very fun as well. If you have money to spare and friends to play with, I would definitely recommend buying this on sale"
25181,WOW :)))))
25182,"I can pick up my friends and throw them off the platforms

10/10"
25183,lol
25184,This game is really awsome and it's so much fun to play especially with friends
25185,Funny game more friends more fun.
25186,"fucked borat in the ass 

10/10"
25187,"A great game to play with friends. Lots of ways to the following:
Break the game
Annoy your friends

25189,This is the best game ever made.
25190,Funny! Pleasing! Relaxing! It's a fun game!
25191,Super fun game! and now that has steam workshop we end playing it a lot
25192,"Such a lovely game. Literally everything is perfect, the music, the atmosphere, the physics. Especially recommended for friends. Big probs to the devs."
25193,sure
25194,ísdghaísdchawdg
25195,Very nice
25196,"This game was really really great before Workshop support was introduced, then all of a sudden it was absolutely fantastic.
HFF (as Human: Fall Flat shall henceforth be known) is an incredible multiplayer game, no matter if you play it locally on the same machine or online with your friends. 
You can play with random strangers too, but we all know how playing with random strangers on the internet usually works out, right? It might work for you, of course, but I recommend some actual friends + your favorite voice chat software.

You can also try to play it alone, but I doubt it's even remotely as much fun as it is with other players.
Also, playing alone makes this game a lot harder as many of the tasks found in this game are built for multiple people.

If you're into co-operative fun, have friends and want a sheer endless amounts of maps, thanks to Workshop support, get this game.
Do it. DO IT NOW! 
Seriously."
25197,Think outside the box
25198,This is an accurate representation of what would happen if drunks did parkour in a cloud city.
25199,:D
25200,The game is really fun to play with friends but theres only a few levels that you can complete in a couple hours
25201,Great puzzle game if you are up to play with your friends !
25202,good
25203,OwO
25204,Орная игра
25205,"This game is very nice! I would recommend it to anyone who are interested in ragdoll games. Even though I recommend it but this game is best played with friends. Playing alone is fine but won't be as fun. Playing with your friends... well.... that could either be really good or umm really bad but in really funny ways XD. 
When I recommend this to my friends we played it which was awesome. But for some reason I turned on my troll mode and decided to troll my friends. How did i troll them? Pulling out the wires and placing them in the wrong section XD. When I did that my friends will grab me and will throw me off the ground making me respawn multiple times but hey it's was all fun and games and it was really funny. 
Sadly we finish the main story too quick which made it bored for a while... Until they released workshop maps. Time to troll or work with your buddies XD"
25206,A lot fun play with friends
25207,Nice Game!
25208,Super fun to play with friends and a great team game! Really loving it.
25209,Ere interesting game and fun do play
25210,This is so good game I recommend it
25211,I laugh so hard
25212,Funny
25213,"yeah just a nice puzzle game,fun if you playing this game with friend"
25214,"Oh man, this game turned out to be even funnier than i originally anticipated. 
I was thinking that this was gonna be another one of these games where you just switch off your brain, sit back and enjoy the physics unfold, all while laughing your kidneys off, sort of like Gang Beasts.
BOY was i wrong, this here actually has you thinking like 60% of the time if not more, and you'll be asking the question ""WHAT DO I HAVE TA DO NOW"" [b] a lot [/b], and i've come to understand this after playing only for a couple of hours and completing just a few levels. 
My very first playthrough concluded with me as Ricardo Milos and my mate as mankini Borat catapulting ourselves inside a fortress and then trebucheting ourselves to escape (He did manage that, i didn't.) So yeah... Let that give you some notion of what this game is like. 
Overall, i really recommend that y'all try this game, because you're in for a special treat. ('Specially given how relatively cheap this game is)"
25215,"Funny game. There's a low amount of maps made by the devs, but there's a Steam workshop."
25216,Insanely satisfying and amazing. Better with friends.

25223,good game to play with friends!
25224,"Super fun game to play with friends, my friends and I played and managed to finish it in about 5 or 6 hours, but we did manage to cut through entire levels using our expert climbing skills. Lots of fun with the added workshop ability so almost endless levels could be made for it. 

Had me throwing friends off cliffs and sacrificing myself with them.

20/20 would play again."

25233,great game to play with friends :)
25234,so good and gory
25235,"I would highly recommend this game to everyone, who got friends to play with.

+Simple controls
+Good optimization
+This game is pretty much about logic solutions and I like it
+Really fun to play with your friends (more friends = more fun)
+You can download more content from the Steam Workshop
+The game is getting some updates with the time

-I would be happy, if there were more Levels
-15€ is a bit too much for such a short game imo."
25236,"good game, you can play this with your friends(if u have one) to have a good laugh"
25237,ezz views
25238,"Wow, very cool"
25239,keren gamenya...buat seruan2 mabar sama temen2
25240,good game spent a lot of time on this game
25241,"Definitely worth the purchase. I bought this on a 50% off sale, but it would probably be worth it full price. 2 player split screen co-op makes for up to 16 people online (with 2 per PC) and the physics based nonsense is very fun. I was surprised to see that the game isn't just meme tier humour, but actually has some well thought out physics based puzzles, often with multiple solutions and the ability to sequence break levels with some co-op ingenuity. 
There's also tons of workshop content which means the game can go on long beyond the handful of levels it ships with."
25242,"Gifted by a friend.
This is so fun with friends .
10/10 would drag my friends butt to glory !"
25243,Thank you for the Steam Workshop update! <3
25244,VERY FUNNY GAME
25245,"good game, very funny!"
25246,"Been playing this game for a few months and it is hands down the most fun game to play with friends.  There is hilarity on every game.  Have gifted this game numerous times and everyone has loved playing it.  The custom maps are a great addition to the game play.  

If you're looking for a really fun somewhat relaxing game to play with friends and love to laugh grab this game you will not be disappointed.   But make sure you play with friends as that is the best way to play the game.  Playing solo or on a random group can be a bit boring and toxic. 

Enjoy."
25247,Bought a copy for myself so that I can play with my daughter. 11/10 very fun game to play with friends!
25248,fun game.
25249,"FIX THE GOD DAMN CAMERA

25251,fun
25252,"One of the best co-op games there is. Fun physics puzzles, creative mechanics, great interactability and constant updates make the game one of the most fun games I've ever played.  Workshop support with official tutorials on making levels allow for many more hours of fun and allow you to discover the creativity of some of the creators."
25253,"You are a guy who goes throught great challenges to finally commit suicide by dropping into the endless void.

25264,"funny game when u playing with friends 
"
25265,"i am human









want to be a human with no bone? this game is for you then. the gameplay is just like any puzzle game but you need to control both hand to progress, and a lot of jumping. the workshop on this game? its just maps and skin(i only use it for the skin) sometimes maps from workshop can be quite laggy, in my case. and finally, multiplayer mode, ah yes i have fun trolling my friend that hasnt grasp the control yet:v. just drag him to the void, fun times.




Great time with singleplayer, better with multiplayer. workshop is just a plus tho. i suggest getting this with your friend and ofcourse while on sale. 8/10"
25266,A surprising amount of fun. Initially I thought this game would be a drunken brawler similar to gang beasts but it ends up being a platformer/puzzle type game. Well worth the money!
25267,Its so Funny if you be creative
25268,Nice and funny game
25269,"easy to learn
funny game

would recommend to buy it in sale, because content is not too big"

25271,"Ridiculously fun game where the character looks brainless but puzzles actually require some thinking to solve. Music makes everything depressingly funny, love it!"
25272,Best game ever!
25273,This game is fun. Look it's the steam summer sale and I'm just trying to help out my team. Though I do actually find the physics in the game fun and enjoyable.
25274,Lots of fun for hours. Playing solo the stages are fun but the real fun is with friends.
25275,<3
25276,It's too good
25277,Fun game to play :)
25278,Hilariously fun with friends. Community Support for maps has made the game infinitely replayable.
25279,👍
25280,Best Game to have fun with friends in free time
25281,"A beautiful slightly janky game to play with friends, and by play I do mean push them off the edge over and over again, physically in a virtual game or mentally in real life. Every player has the very realistic essence of a drunk clumsy idiot, whether they are like that in the real world is just down to them. I am too a clumsy idiot. 

All jokes aside, its a fun little game to annoy your friends or to work together well to escape the levels or try to work together well, but your arms and legs fail to do things cos that's exactly what the game is, 'Drunk walking problem solving simulator 2016 idiot edition'.

Only problem with the game, is if more than 2 people join your lobby; there is slight delay when people try to jump or grab onto things. Host is usually unaffected by this, but from playing as the lobby host and player in a friends lobby, it can be frustrating when you jump and it doesn't decide to do that, but also can be a meme so yeah."
25282,good and intresting game
25283,This is game for you and your friends to lough your asses off.
25284,"Funny game, better play with friend"

25301,I love This Game Its Fun to play With Friends
25302,jaja
25303,fun
25304,This game is silly but entertaining. Had many laugh playing with friends.
25305,gg
25306,"I actually bought this game because it was recommended to me by a friend. At first I didn't know if I would enjoy it and had absolutely no idea what it was even about, but my mind immediately changed once I started playing it. Your character can be customized however you want and they are very hard to control. This makes it challenging while also giving you a good laugh because they have no bone structure and flail around. With that being said, a group of friends and I made some very goofy characters and had some difficult times with them flopping around. CAREFUL, your friends WILL throw you off the edge of the map, but no worries as you will re-spawn just to have it happen all over again xD

One thing that frustrated me the most about this game is that some of the objects that you need to use to advance through the puzzles spawned in terrible spots causing you to have to reset the level and start all over again (or from your last checkpoint).

Over all, I highly recommend this game as it is very unique and you are bound to have a great time, and a good laugh. I would also love to see more maps in the future.

25372,"This game is and was very fun, I do recommend it and it is a great party game locally and online. Beware on who you play with because it does take communication. Its fun to do the puzzles but some can be skipped by some cheeky placements."
25373,So much fun to play with friends. You can sabotage each other from solving the puzzle and pull them of the world. Had a blast playing this. Just needs more puzzles.
25374,"this game had a lot of fun maps, it was a good game to kick back and play with my friends and just relax. Good easy hearted game"
25375,This Game Is Fun IF U HAVE FRIEND

25412,great game. if you get a couple friends to pay with this will be one of the most fun games you'll every play
25413,fun to play with friends
25414,"Fun game, especially with friends. Definitely makes you think!"
25415,I haven't played online multiplayer so I won't comment on that but in terms of local co-op games this is one of my all time favorites. Something about exploring the maps while trying to work out how to solve puzzles or attempting to clear a difficult platforming jump with a friend is very satisfying. On top of all that you can also pick your friend up and throw them off a ledge when you're frustrated so all in all a great game.
25416,Amazingly funny and outrageous physics based puzzle platformer with great multiplayer and amazing  Workshop levels. 10/10 would spin climb a  castle again
25417,Great puzzle game can get boring some times though..
25418,half off

25432,Play with your friends! You wont regret it.
25433,gOOD GAME!
25434,"I still remember when I first played this game was 24 Dec 2018, that time I'm really a stupid, I meant not about how to find the solution for finish the level, but I'm really stupid about climbing, I can't even jump or climb on a simple low height block. But now when in 2020, I can finish every level very simple and quick, also I can jump any block easily, not so sure what is the reason I can do all that easily but because I trained myself a lot how to jump and climb in-game so I'm not afraid for falling down after I jump and land on somewhere. I also found out there's a lot different way to finish the level, shortcut maybe?
This game is pretty interesting, I always play this game with my friends, it's cute character, atmosphere, environment etc...  I like this game! Wish there's a lot of new levels in future!"
25435,Very cool

25488,ok
25489,"What a wonderful surprise. This game can be a bit challenging when starting but soon you will get hang of it. And oh boy is it fun. I have had many laughs playing this, it has the right amount of puzzles mixed together with fun. I just wish there were more official maps. I highly recommend it."
25490,My stomach hurt from laughing at this game. This is a great way to goof around with friends.
25491,Good game.
25492,d
25493,"One of the best games available if you want to co-op with friends and have fun. Totally recommended. One thing I would request is more downloable content, but now it has public workshop so I guess it's ok."
25494,"Many puzzle games I don't mind. Many games where the mechanics are ""whoops, everything is a little hard to control and that makes it silly!"" work well. This game combines the two for the result of ""I know exactly how to solve the puzzle, but I can't wrestle the character into doing what I am trying to have it do."" Not fun for extended periods of time. Holding down one / both triggers for many seconds in a row is also pretty fatiguing (Grow Home also has this problem). Not sure I would recommend."
25495,its fun

25499,"This game is very sand sculpture very happy, I like"
25500,always fun to toss your friends over the edge of the world!
25501,"A fun game ruined by developers that can't commit. They've completely dropped Linux and GoG support, so if you play on Linux or have a GoG copy of the game than you will be stuck on a old version of the game and unable to play with friends that aren't on a outdated version."
25502,Great Game.  Silly and fun.  Great to play with friends online. Plus its split screen too!
25503,game is extremely fun but i recommend the steam workshop maps over the base game. not worth 15 bucks tho.
25504,"is it a bird ? is it a plane ? no! its human fall flat !
The game is so fun you will definitely enjoy playing it with friends or alone
it has a lot of levels to complete , and if you completed them all then you can get new maps from workshop very simply ,as well as you can customize you character the way you want it to be.
definitely recommend it <3"
25505,"Ragdoll physics - 10/10.

25506,great game
25507,"I don't review often.

But this game... is the most fun I've had in ages. It's captivated me from the start.

Highly recommended, great with friends, great mechanics it's just a fantastic hidden gem of a game.

10/10"

Absolutely fantastic experience.
Definitely worth playing.
[u]Enjoyed it.[/u] 
It was somewhat okay. 
Avoid like a cancer."
25509,how the heck do i put human fall plat on xbox one if there is no steam i would really love to know instead of play on my computer so i would really love to know NO BREAK GAMES how the heck am i supposes to play on xbox
25510,"This is a very fun game and you should definitly buy it and you will not regret, and after you finish the normal levels there is steam workshop levels to extend the fun"
25511,good
25512,1337
25513,:D
25514,This game is absolutely worth it. In my opinion nothing was bad in the game. If you like challenging puzzles this is a game for you!
25515,This Game is so stupid it is funny and sometimes raging.
25516,A fun and hilarious game to play with friends
25517,Flop
25518,good
25519,Great with friends to screw around with
25520,"Fun game with friends! 
New control logic
A bit difficult to control in the beginning"
25521,good
25522,"This is a character based puzzle game.  You spend more time trying to control the character than solving puzzles.  Where Portal 2 is 10 out of 10, this one is a 5 out of 10.  At least it doesn't have stupid crafting like almost every other game now."
25523,"Great to play with friends. Love the workshop submissions keeping it alive and fun.

Very funny when everyone has a good sense of humor."
25524,Brilliant game to play with friends. Main game is a bit short. But there's lots of workshop maps to play.
25525,This game very good
25526,Now that the workshop exists this is TOP TIER co-op game. Literally endless content straight from our Chinese comrades.
25527,really good game! fun to play with people. maybe even roleplay with the right map.
25528,"Dropped linux support. Shitty move by the developers, have no interest in supporting these devs if things like this continue. Really a shame because it's a fun game."
25529,no fun
25530,"A fun and interesting concept. 
Really needs more levels though"
25531,"really good game and fun and you get to find funny , nice friends i recommend it to everyone buying it is worth it have new friends and chat with funny people."
25532,As you can see i have played this game a lot and i like it so its a good game
25533,Funniest game i've ever played
25534,gufno
25535,"There is nothing more terrifying than a play-do guy staring you down and proceeding to throw you into the void
Very cool"
25536,It's a great game to play with friends and there's plenty of quality content on the workshop if you've finished the base game.
25537,The funniest game i ever played with my friends XDDDD
25538,Fun little puzzle game. Better as multiplayer but also enjoyable as singleplayer.
25539,"Simply an amazing fun game.
The official maps are a bit short but so much fun to play.
Enjoyed every minute of it."
25540,I remember playing this awhile back and it wasn't too difficult or easy. It WAS fun. Now I can't even get past the second level (the one of the crashed train). It has been made unnecessarily difficult.
25541,"awesome game with friends 
"
25542,"Fun to play with you friends once in a while but gets boring really fast, and can get very frustrating at times."
25543,Not happy with the fact that they dropped Linux support.
25544,Exciting puzzles and fun to play with friends. The more the merrier!
25545,Buy only if on sale. Otherwise good game
25546,"good for some goofy people that like puzzle games, I can totally see getting a good laugh or two outta this one!"
25547,I'm Sir Gankington and I approve of this game.
25548,"This is very good game if you have friends to play it, if you dont have friends who dont want to play, get them to play :D"
25549,"This game is just AWESOME with friends.
I played a bit, with my brother, since I have no friends.
And it's been so much FUN.
The only thing...
The extreme lack of content.
Not so much maps, the character customization....
C'mon.
4/5, still recommend. But only with friends. Or family relatives. I am a loner."
25550,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST GAMES EVER,

I STRICTLY ADVISE AGAINST THE PURCHASE OF THIS GAME"
25551,"Hilarious co-op play. Really fun working together. Love the ability to theme the character with a photo skin. Sometimes frustrating, but overall its a great game. Highly recommend."
25552,"Funny and Interesting game to play with friends once.

It easily gets boring after the first few hours of gameplay .  Definitely not something I'd play in the long run.

Can't say the money spent was worth it."
25553,"Haven't laughed so hard in a game in years.  Not a game I would play solo, but it's a blast to play with a group of friends."
25554,Probably the best Multiplayer to have fun with friends .
25555,"This is a game I randomly found on youtube, the funny physics was worth my attention, the fact it was made for co-op was worth my money. I bought this game to play it with my friend and it didn't disappoint me, I always had so much fun and looking forward to play it more. The game combines easy/medium puzzles with a funny and tricky physic that makes the easiest tasks not so easy to perform, it creates a lot of funny situations, especially with your friends. Is it worth the buy? You judge.


[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]
[list]

[*][u]GRAPHICS[/u]: When I bought this game, I had a 1gb graphic card that could barely fit into the minimum requirements EAH5850), despite that the engine wasn't too heavy and could run quite smooth without FPS drops, meaning it can run on most of nowadays' PCs. The graphic is easy but not minimal, good enough if you're not looking for something complex.

[*][u]PHYSICS[/u]: Physics is not perfect, but funny as hell! You will find yourself in very funny situations you can barely control and while one side of physics is automated (like climbing short walls), the other side will make the easiest tasks (like using a key) harder than you could imagine, making the game funny to watch and hard to play, at least at the beginning.

[*][u]COOP[/u]: The game is fully playable alone, but coop is the best part of it! You can choose between multiplayer, private and local. Playing in private servers with your friends (and with a mic) is the best option you should go for, local coop works fine as alternative. Helping each other solving a puzzle can be more a handicap than help due to its funny physics, but that's what make this game so funny. I haven't tried the multiplayer with strangers, but I recommend it mostly if you have at least one known friend to privately play with.

[*][u]PUZZLES[/u]: Despite there's not a huge variety of puzzles and some tasks can become repetitive, some puzzles can be quite challenging or creative, some may be resolved in alternative ways, but it won't bore you too much for a couple runs. The workshop can add some new puzzles invented by users, giving the game a Portal 2 potential with custom maps and ideas.

[*][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]: The game was quite short after all, it didn't take too long to complete all the maps, thankfully the developers didn't forget to add a very good extra with achievements! Some achievements are funny and creative, a good variety to use as secondary missions, adding some extra fun to play it again in a more challenging way beside solving the mere puzzle. All of them are possible and don't require hundreds of hours to complete, it's highly recommended to try some of them once you complete all the default maps.

[*][u]UPDATES[/u]: The game seems steadily updated, especially for big updates (new map and workshop just to name two), which gives some room for improvements. Every update is welcome but the game is already in a playable state, worth the buy in the early access in the actual state.

[*][u]WORKSHOP[/u]: The few default maps and the lack of workshop was a big con I reported to my future review, the adding of the workshop in a beta state through group subscription was a decent temporary solution, the full implementation of a working workshop was the best move to make the game great! It's still a new feature and the maps are not perfect, but it's the first step to greatly expand the game, almost mandatory for a game like this.

[/list]


[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]
[list]

[*][u]MECHANICS[/u]: Mechanics looks great, but I had the flashback that developers didn't realize how some mechanics featured could really break the game. You can climb any wall by swaying left and right, jump longer with hands up, huge shortcuts, features that were supposed to be limits in the game and not used as advantages to skip harder puzzles, once you learn them or someone abuse of them, the game is partially ruined. I fear the devs didn't notice it at first and now it's too late to change mechanics, but they aren't easy to learn at the first runs, better stay away from them if you want to enjoy the game.

[*][u]MAPS QUANTITY[/u]: The quality of default maps is quite good (beside some huge shortcuts), unfortunately there aren't many of them and the workshop quality is a bit too far still. They should add more default maps to give the game some concrete roots and extra playing time, but the quantity of updates gives hope there may be more maps in the future. Achievements are a good reason to replay the maps and the workshop is the best alternative once the game is over.

[*][u]PRECISION[/u]: While the funny physic is eye candy, some puzzles require a precision that should have been in the game. I had some problems with some movements and failing some hard tasks because the physic has no precision can be far from being funny. Sometimes jumps are too late, hands don't stick on surfaces, often failing a rather easy climb, just to name a few.

[*][u]REPETITIVE[/u]: The lack of variety of puzzles can make the game repetitive, but the adding of the workshop gives a chance to break repetitiveness if given the right tools. Probably you will get tired of the game after the first runs, just depends how much you want/can play with your friends.

[/list]

Final word: A very funny game greatly recommended to play with friends, funny hard physic perfectly fit into easy tasks, simple light graphic to make it run smooth and workshop to keep playing it for a longer time. Very recommended with any group of friends, especially with rookies."
25556,"Been a while since I laughed this much when playing a game. Just watching the way the character's body moves make me lose it. Also mod support = skyrim levels of replayability. 

FYI half the fun of the games is just playing it with friends (DO NOT SOLO IT YOU'LL JUST END UP HATING IT)"
25557,"I have never laughed so hard in my life! 
""DAMMIT JARRED, LET GO MY LEGS AND STOP GRABBING MY ARMS!!"" 
Its a great game! Tons of fun by yourself and friends. Especially friends. Good amount of game time too.
10/10 Slips Over the Edge"
25558,9/10. At its best with friends.
25559,I enjoyed listening to my friend cry in agony as i threw him off the edge for a 50th time in a row. Puzzles were also good
25560,stupid but funny
25561,"There are games I love that practically require friends to play them, but even my friends say this game is boring. Even the little kids I have over say that they would rather play something more interesting and engaging. Funny physics and lackluster puzzles are not enough to engage people for more than 20 minutes. There just isn't enough here."
25562,"A ridiculously fun game.
Always wanted to do a pushup... backwards... with one hand... while climbing girders in mid air?
This game lets you.

Tried this with my other half and after an hour or so, we could not see from our tears, or take a breath because of laughing.

This could be a perfect game for couples who have a slight perversion towards twitching and twisting bodies, unreal poses and all the clumsiness.

10/10
Would climb girders again while pushing up with one hand backwards. 
(Only if there is another player to hang on to my face and drag me up again if I fall.)"
25563,"*Human: Fall Flat*
 The game is good with friends,and the workshop for the game is awesome for the maps after finishing the original game's maps.
would recommend it for people to play with 3-6 friends."
25564,"Best Game Ever
"
25565,"Ridiculously fun game, the only complaint I have is that there should be more maps."
25566,"I was hoping It was a funny game but it isn't. In addition, it costs too much. Didn't like it"
25567,"This game is very great in constructing clumsy physics, it's different from the average puzzle/play-box game. Very fun to play with friends and messing around, on how much I've played so far, every time you go on to play you get at least 30 minutes or an hour of gameplay. if your playing alone, if your playing with friends who are fun to play with is un-decided it depends on how long u guys want to play."
25568,Very fun co-op game for very autistic people
25569,beautiful game. willbe extremely fun with friends.
25570,Extremely fun game to screw around in with friends.
25571,THIS IS A VERY VERY GREAT AND GOOD GAME!!!!!!!!!
25572,The menu doesn't work with opening it in a level.
25573,"Too laggy to even play. Joining servers is hopeless you either get disconnect because ""connection"" or kicked. Even playing it by yourself doesn't work its laggy all around even if you have a good PC."
25574,I beat this game.
25575,"I wanted to play it with my friends but they finished the game before I finished my download. I played it alone, not really fun.

My friend just told me that he would play with me again, but still, not really fun."
25576,"Honestly, its pretty good. it reminds me of Gang Beasts a lot! When you have 2-5 friends it gets really funny!"
25577,good xd
25578,I laughed so hard with mates.
25579,Love the game so far up until the temple level which can kiss my behind.
25580,funniest game ever!! XDD
25581,What a treat of a game
25582,"Alright, let me get this out of the way. I would recommend the game. It's a good game, it really is. It's fun with friends and gives my right hand a great, sweaty workout. BUT, I'd like to point out some annoyance and irritating stuff of the game.

1) I don't know how the game's servers are like but often when playing online with people, the connection becomes laggy and personally, I find it aggravating. Have you ever tried to hop rapidly or run, jump, and let go to fly at the same time while all of your inputs are like .3 second delayed? When this happened (can happen to others as well), I honestly thought there was something wrong with my keyboard. ""What's wrong with my spacebar? Do I need to clean it?"" Turns out, it's just input lag! Maybe others would catch onto it sooner than I did, but I just find it overall frustrating.

2&3) Online lobbies and the community. This may be a personal thing but I like to join random people's lobbies and play with them because I got no friends, and I wanna make friends. Simple enough. However, majority of the time when I do join, these f*ckers keep kicking me out, perhaps simply because they don't want a stranger to join. How about making the fucking lobby private! That's an option you dinguses! Or player cap it! 2/2, 4/4, 8/8! Or even better, ban me so I don't have to see your damn lobby in the list! It just frustrates me to play with these bozos! It's not like the devs can do anything about this! You can't change people, so why the hell am I ranting?!

Edit: The game has gotta fix it's server disconnect causes. For example. If you received ""Server disconnected"" while playing or when you first joined, most likely (other than the host actually stop hosting) they just kick you and it gives you the wrong cause! How do I know? Well I come back and and same again, disconnected, BUT this time it showed the real reason: You've been kicked. After this has happened to me, (which has happened multiple times) it's just something I expect now and accepted that people didn't want me.

Overall, I just find the online community toxic. I'd suggest play with your friends. Invite them. Make sure no one else can join. The game is much more fun if you can talk to them via mic for better communication. Have I mentioned that the game will make your hand sweat like it's going through a workout? Maybe it's just me. 7.9/10"

25587,I never thought i would have so much fun playing a game with my girlfriend! This is a must have to play with your friends! You'll laugh your a.s.s. off with this game!!
25588,"Played this game for 30 minutes with a friend, decided to try it out online.

Within moments I was in some wacky workshop-created level, with a bunch of cool people, laughing my head off as we hooked a humongous cane around this impossibly long suspension wire leading over a huge cliff.  Once the cane was hooked, we all frantically grabbed whatever we could (each other, the cane, whatever), and we all rode that cane into the abyss - laughing all the way.

No game has made me laugh this hard.  Ever.  Well worth the purchase."
25589,"It was good for a few hours, but it was still crowded. Play together. That's interesting. It just doesn't feel very stable"

25595,Get high play with friends
25596,Fun Game!
25597,"I had never heard of this game before until this week, and I don't know how because it is superb.  Your character has sort of the floppy, flailing, uncontrolled type of movement you find in games like Gang Beasts and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, so it is rather challenging to control your character.  The game sends you through a series of puzzle levels similar in nature to what you would find in the Portal games, and has multi-player co-op levels in addition to single-player.  The co-op levels are designed to be completed by two players, but you can have up to four players in a session.  The only problem with this is that sometimes one or two players can be left without anything to do for a certain task, but having more than two players can also help with finding solutions quicker and completing difficult parkour and timing-based tasks that will inevitably require many tries to get right.

The main frustrating thing about this game is that you can end up getting yourself into situations where you must reset the level at your last checkpoint.  You will have to deal with moving unwieldy objects from one place to another using your floppy controls, and sometimes these objects will get stuck somewhere and won't de-spawn and re-spawn, meaning you'll have to reset the checkpoint.  This isn't bad on some checkpoints, but some require more tasks or more difficult tasks than others.

Another issue is that objects sometimes re-spawn in bad positions where they are unusable, such as a gondola being upside down or a vehicle spawning on full-throttle forward, so you'll have to reset the checkpoint until everything spawns correctly.  Your character may also be spawned in a place where you'll immediately fall of the edge of the map or into the water, causing you to die instantly.  Your character may also be spawned stuck inside a solid object, which will probably require a checkpoint reset again.

But overall, this game is a lot of fun, especially in co-op mode.  With the hilarious character physics, the rage-inducing challenges, and the humor provided in the game, you are bound to have a good laugh with your friends.  If you want something that you can play with friends to keep you occupied for a while, I highly recommend this."

25603,"I am sad to say that if, like me, you struggle with certain types of motion in games, you may find this game unpleasant to play. After a mere  4 minutes I felt motion sick and realised that this game, much as liked its premise, was not for me.  I had to log-in for an extra minute or two just to be able to post this review (min 5 minutes played). Back in ye olde days I would have returned to store for a refund - unfortunately in this modern era this is not possible. Thankfully I bought during a sale, so have not wasted too much money.

I still think I would have enjoyed the game had it not been for the motion type used.

25607,fall fat
25608,"it is a really fun game, realistic physics and many funny actions/moments happen through it, I really say it is a good game but its price is a little too much for that many levels and how much we have to wait for new stuff! I got a refund from this game cause I pretty much ended the whole thing and had nothing to do with, well I had other things I wanted to buy for that cash, I'd say update more often please and make this game free or at least cheaper one day!"
25609,"This is a fun little co-op puzzler that is simple, but pretty fun. The controls are very basic, but difficult to really get the hang of. The levels also offer a bunch of different ways to get through, especially when you're playing with friends. Speaking of playing with friends, I definitely recommend it even though they will likely be trying to throw you off the map half of the time. The freedom of choice an the co-op feature are what make this game an easy recommendation for anyone who likes the idea. I love this game :*"

25619,"human fall flat is amazing but Im lonely  and I need friends please tell anyone thats lonely too and tell that my username is juggerin7
 so they can look me up on quick invite and they can friend me I just need friends"
25620,"Goofing off with Human: Fall Flat's wonky physics and finding unintended puzzle solutions with friends can be a ton of fun, but if you're actually trying to beat the levels in a reasonable amount of time (or unlucky enough to be playing by yourself) its unreliable controls and lengthy puzzles can get frustrating pretty quickly.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

H:FF keeps its controls simple, with a jump, grabbing stuff, and ragdolling being your only abilities. If you grab a stationary or heavy object by the edge, you can hoist yourself on top of it, and in turn you can lift or drag around light items, or swing on hanging stuff like ropes and chains. The direction you try to grab is based on where the camera is facing, your hand locks into place with an unbreakable vicegrip once it touches something, and you control each hand's grab individually, so you can get really creative with how you latch onto and manipulate the environment around you, especially if you've got friends helping.

For some examples, if you need to rotate a board and are sick of the tail end swaying around whenever you try to move it, have one player grab both the tail and the ground next to it to act as an anchor. Need to prop it up against a wall, but it's too long/heavy to lift the entire thing from one end? Have someone grab each end to get it a couple of feet off the ground, then a third player can ragdoll underneath it at just slightly off-middle and grab the underside, getting the board to a 45° tilt by pushing up on it. The more people you have, the more out-there you can get with your puzzle solutions, and the more quickly you'll be able to implement them, which does wonders to help alleviate how annoying the controls can get.

Controls in mind, the game's dedication to everything but the floor and walls having physics also applies to your arms, so your hands have to actually move from your sides to point towards the crosshair once you press grab. When this combines with how your hand sticks to the first thing it touches, trying to grab things in tight spaces or at specific spots often means you'll just grip a wall that was between the path from your hip to the crosshair, or the floor next to the object, the wrong spot on it, or etc. Likewise, moving across thin platforms is a test of how many times you can mentally handle starting over thanks to how wonky your walk cycle is (especially if you're carrying something), and trying to lift anything overhead to get it onto a higher ledge is next to impossible if you don't have someone up there to grab and pull it the rest of the way up. To a point I get that this is all there for the game's ""haha our physics are so wonky and unreliable!"" style, and that can be a ton of fun for a bunch of friends goofing off, but should you decide you actually want to focus on winning, needing to try a dozen times to accomplish something as simple as rolling a log under a board gets incredibly frustrating, especially if you play solo (or even with just 2-3 people), where everything takes exponentially longer to set up.

[h1]Level Design[/h1]

H:FF is absolutely oozing with puzzle variety. Most levels tend to have a set of 3 or so puzzles that all stick to a single mechanical theme, such as needing to pilot various boats from island-to-island in Water, or power doors by connecting cords between them and batteries in Factory, but interspersed among these theme puzzles will be a ton of different one-off obstacles. Factory has you haphazardly drive a dump truck up a floating road to a nearby mine then load coal into it via a conveyor belt, Water has you using a 4-hooked crane to lift shipping crates and build a giant set of stairs with them, Dark has a minecart section where the cart can go careening into oblivion if you and your pals haven't distributed your weights on it properly, and there's a ton of other stuff I could spend half a dozen more paragraphs listing off.

Most importantly, almost all of these puzzles are open to being messed with, exploited, and just generally being broken six ways to Sunday. Water's crane puzzle can be solved by having a player swing and jump from one of the hooks to the next area by raising the crane to the right spot, you can jam doors in Factory to carry batteries past where they're meant to go & skip entire puzzles in the process, and I wouldn't be surprised if I someday learn that 8-player parties have found ways to build human bridges by grabbing one another's feet. The sheer variety in both the puzzles themselves and the solutions a creative group can find means there's a ton of fun to be had even on repeat playthroughs.

However, for as fun as H:FF is with a bunch of people working together to find wacky, unintended fixes for obstacles, your experience is drained significantly if you're by yourself. On your own, puzzles tend to only have one reasonable solution, which'll take far longer to achieve due to lack of manpower, and even if there's some kind of ridiculous alternative it'll often take even -longer- to accomplish than the intended one, without the fun of the ""this solution took 10x longer than normal but we're all goofing off together so it's still super-fun"" effect. Puzzles that take 5 minutes to solve with a large group can easily eat up 20 minutes of your time solo or duo, and the result is levels that start to drag on far longer than they ought to, which only amplifies how annoying the controls get.

[h1]Balance[/h1]

The challenge provided by puzzles can be a bit of a mixed bag. There's a lot of fun in figuring out the ""how"" of puzzle solutions, especially if you go for an out-of-the-box method, but in some cases the intended ""how"" is incredibly obvious. Unless you go out of your way to find an alternate solution in these cases, the only ""challenge"" is actually getting the physics to do what you want, which is more of a gamble than an actual test of puzzle-solving skill. Puzzles where your destination is obvious but how you can go about getting there is open-ended are the game's strongest parts, but the way the difficulty curve seems to reset as each level opens with ultra-simple stuff like ""small room with a locked door and a boulder to bash the lock"" keeps it from reaching its full potential.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]

Graphics stick to cartooney, simple geometry and single-color textures, acting as a good match to the joksey tone of the gameplay while keeping areas & puzzles easy to analyze at a quick glace. In sharp contrast, the music is really good epic-sounding piano and orchestral stuff. The first 3 levels had the beginnings of an ironically-serious storyline about humanity overcoming all of their obstacles and such, but the narrative voiceover abruptly ends after that, so I suppose the music was meant to amplify the dichotomy between that and the not-serious gameplay. It'd probably still be funny, but the music only plays in short segments after checkpoints, so most of your play time will be spent with the only in-game noises being footsteps & stock ""water flowing""-type sounds, leaving a surprisingly empty tone compared to the lively gameplay.

[h1]In Closing[/h1]

Human: Fall Flat's playful ""our game is wonky and hard to control but full of shenanigans"" attitude makes it a blast to play with a large group, but tends to bog down the fun factor during its less-open portions. I wouldn't recommend playing it on your own, with at least one pal being pretty much essential to having fun with it and not being stuck on individual puzzles for 30 minutes apiece, and every buddy you bring on top of that being an additional benefit to your enjoyment.

7.2/10, jumps to an 8.2 with friends

25621,Fkn hilarious
25622,"It is a fun game to play. I mostly play it with a friend, it can both be goofy and utterly frustrating at times. So patience and discipline is something that is tested in this game :D"
25623,This game it's so fun! To play with friends to help us to complete the level. Might be little lag but it's still fun!
25624,"Great with friends, especially Chad Wright."
25625,"i like this
"
25626,yes
25627,the best game puzzle in my life its very funny
25628,bloody wonderful game. made me cry of laughter
25629,"I was using the community maps and skins so my friend and I had ""The Adventures of Ricardo and Ricardo Jr: In Space!"""
25630,good
25631,"Okay, Okay, look, you got a pal or two? Get the game, watch the play-do men throw each other around. And with Steam Workshop support being a thing now, why not get it?"
25632,nice
25633,"This game is hot
9/10
"
25634,Good puzzle game and can be funny watching the character bumble about but unfortunately I can't recommend as the 3D camera motion gives me serious headache after playing for 15mins or so.
25635,One of the more accurate drunken toddler simulations I have played.
25636,GOOD GAM
25637,"Very funny game. Play with friends and or family on it. Hilarious. I love it very much. I play with my brother, friends, and family on this game. Easy to play and easy to make maps on."
25638,"This game is a lot of fun especially with the new update which include the workshop
Its just hilarious with friends 
This is one of my favourite games on steam"
25639,The best puzzle game ever!!
25640,"Fun enough, but you really want at least one friend in for multiplayer to unlock the true hilarity and enjoyment of this game. Once you have that, it's a barrel of laughs, good times, and the occasional well-designed head-scratcher. The level and puzzle design takes it well beyond the ""lol bad physics are funny"" fundamentals and into the realm of something quite distinctly fun."
25641,Good game.
25642,"This is the only game in the world which gave me pure artistic experience.
Thank you Tomas Sakalauskas."
25643,"Trash client. I was on Linux and I found out that I could not join my friends. When can you update your linux client to match windows ones????? I paid the same price for it! If you do not have the ability to keep all platform upto date, then just don't advertise for muti-platform."
25644,i can't even get in the game
25645,I love this game
25646,Pretty good game but i have to not recommend it because they havent updated the linux version in over a year.
25647,"My wife and kids hate when I play this game.

""Dad, please stop laughing. We have school in the morning."""
25648,good game to mess around and have fun playing with your wonderful friends  to play on and off sometimes. Good laughs good times
25649,"Amazingly fun game if playing with friends. 
Easy enough for a casual player to finish them while messing around.

Achievements aren't difficult, require some practice due to time trials etc."
25650,"Great game with friends. Can't imagine this game without friends tho. 
Just make sure that you have some type of recording software because you're going to get into some funny scenarios that you'll want to keep."
25651,Its such a fun game with friends but boring alone
25652,"Released with Linux support, bought with Linux support - and then Linux support silently dropped, no more updates, and no refund. Not at all impressed."
25653,gud game buy it
25654,"A lot more fun than I expected, and even more fun with friends! 10/10"
25655,Fun multiplayer game
25656,The only thing I can say - this is the best game I've ever played (:
25657,fun with friends but bored alone
25658,"I've played it with a friend and we've had a really good time! The controls seem silly at the beginning but are interesting when you finally master them!
The game is really fun even if the puzzles are a bit easy"
25659,"-CAN I ASK HOW YOU ACTUALLY FALL FLAT I MEAN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
-YOU AREN'T EVEN HUMAN FOR THAT MATTER WHERE'S MY FACE
-MURDERRRRRRRR
-ACCIDENTAL MANSLAUGHTERRRRRRRR
-2ND DEGREE MURDER WHATEVER ONE THAT IS"
25660,10/10 Amazing multiplayer co-op game
25661,10/10. In tears at time of playing the game.
25662,"Awesome game to play with friends. The controls are a bit tricky. But when you get a hang of it, it will make a lot of fun solving the puzzles."
25663,Fun games to play with friend as the movement of the characters seems to be funny looking while you crack your head in order to move to the next level. Overall two thumbs up!
25664,"Playing this game with a friend (or more) is just hilarious.
Puzzles are fun to solve aswell."
25665,"Silly puzzle game that now has workshop support meaning the creators of the game will keep getting content on the game without actually needing to put any more effort themselves. It's a game that keeps on giving, the puzzles are fun on the original maps and people's creations are a nice cherry on top. One can't simply say no to running around as Sans throwing people off cliffs to make them have a bad time."
25666,love It!!!!!
25667,"Don't ride the electric doors. Your arm with get stuck...like in real life.

I struggled a lot with this game, but also had a lot of fun. It's more fun in multi-player."
25668,"Great fun, though it starts to fizzle near the end. Similar to other reviews, I would recommend for Co-Op and probably not for Solo play."
25669,onz do
25670,5/5
25671,bad
25672,10/10 for grab a friend and make them failed together.
25673,I have 2 hrs in this game and I love it. The graphics are good IMO and it is very fun to play. It is also challenging and rewarding. 9/10 would buy again (got in on sale).
25674,This game falls flat for me
25675,FUN GAME!
25676,the only game where its harder to finish WITH friends. Like ffs william throw the box off the edge one more time and you're kicked from the game
25677,Hilarious
25678,"awesome game to play with friends. I love the new workshop, so accessible and fun.





                                                                                        -From a person who plays this game too much"

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34907518/]Review by Games for Lovers[/url] - only GOOD local co-op games!
[/th][/table]

You want to play something with your significant other?

Human: Fall Flat is a rather stress-free physic-based puzzler with a unique style to enjoy together in split-screen mode (or with 8 players in online mode). Multiple solutions are possible for almost every puzzle, you can interact with many of the objects you find while wandering around in the dreamworld.

The controls will make your character look like a drunk person walking on a tightrope. This alone makes the game hilarious, especially if you watch your partner’s ineptitude.

Works fine with XBox 360 gamepads.

[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]
Just fun to play with your significant other to relax after a hard day in the office!"
25683,i loovvveeee it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars plus complete character customization
25684,"Human Fall Flat... where do I begin?  This is probably one of the games of which I am most fond.  I have had so, so many memorable and funny moments playing this game.  My friends and I have played many hours, driving ships off the side of the world, throwing each other off the side of the world, driving trucks off the side of the world, you get the picture.
This game has such a vast array of puzzles that you can either try and complete, or try and bypass by unintended means, by attempting to climb over walls, jump over gaps you know are too big, or launching yourself from a perfectly aimed catapult to try and skip half the map. And the game actually awards you in some places, allowing you to discover all sorts of shortcuts such as ziplines, to aid you in your endeavour to complete the level via your own unorthodox means.
The game's cute style, with its simplistic yet detailed design and its at times hilarious ragdoll physics, just makes Human Fall Flat what it is... a masterpiece.
This has to be one of the greatest games ever made, and is in my opinion, definitely a must have."
25685,Turns out you can't shove the battery wires up your a**hole
25686,Yeet.
25687,A really fun and innovative game that is especially enjoyable with friends.
25688,Horrible
25689,Imagine playing a problem solving game like portal but having the dexterity of a 3 year old child. Best enjoyed with friends this game has gotten so much better after being added to the steam workshop.
25690,"i can be borax!
levels are very simple to do"
25691,"completed 100% achievements and gotta say that those achievements are REALLY NICE. Dont play this game alone, find a friend or go online with mic. This is a really fun game because its easy to die and laugh about it. with a another friend its 2x fun hihihi. you have for at least 25h for all achievements if you take your time. <

J'adore ce jeu !!! <3 <3"
25692,best
25693,yes
25694,This game has cured my depression
25695,Why does is not respond once I open the game??? Please Help
25696,Pretty fun to play with friends
25697,"Cannot run on my friend's mac book pro! A lot of people are having this issues, please fix! Fuck Curve Digital."
25698,I dont own this game
25699,"BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY WITH FRIENDS, its worth a lot"
25700,ok
25701,"Human Fall Flat is a fun physics game that at times can be frustrating due to the inherent problems with the character's movement and grabbing, but that's also a source of it's humor, whether I'm being ragdolled across the map by some huge ball or getting into mosh fights with a bunch of other playdough figures.
It is not a game for everyone because at it's heart is a puzzle game and those tend to turn some people off.
Most of it's obstacles are physics based and can feel real satisfying when you complete some that are hard to pull of (or you just cheat by tossing yourself off the cliff and hoping you hit a ledge on the other side to climb up on).
Adding workshop increased the longevity of this game and I'm happy they've done so.
The 15$ asking price was a bit steep when the game first launched but now with workshop adding much more content it feels like a decent deal now."
25702,gang beast con modo historia
25703,"I bought this product because its a good game BUT the game screen does not show anything, only the starting music plays and the screen goes black. I have tried every resolution setting available in internet but the game doesn't work.
Fix this please and also tell me how you did it."
25704,"Drunk fun is what this game feels like to me.
It works solo but multiplayer is what i enjoy the most.
ALSO THE WORKSHOP is a great addition, there's tons of maps to be played now."
25705,Without workshop this game seems very very unfinished but with workshop access this game is amazing! this game's only problem [at least for me] is the lack of maps but with workshop. this game just AMAZIING.
25706,With friends its absolutely flawless.
25707,"It is worth the purchase (to play with friends)
And if you haven't any friends and you are alone in the world don't buy this ...!
Pros : Great Workshop!
cons : I didn't find anything"
25708,Playing with friends had us rofl almost the entire time.
25709,Nice game with decent mechanics but only fun when playing with friends obviously.
25710,Oh my God wooooooow
25711,Hilarious Coop adventure
25712,"if i wanted to have a weird body and be angry at it for not doing exactly what i wanted it to do all the time i'd just look in a mirror



i've given it some thought and it turns out this is more fun. heartily recommend this game slash experience"
25713,"Human Fall Flat is a pleasant experience which proves the potential of the creators and Unity.It is a very well structured game and it is a lot of fun,especially with a friend.The game isn't very long but I think this is for the best.Overall HFF is an enjoyable game which show that even messing around can be a lot of fun!9/10"

25719,One of the best multiplayer puzzlers out there!!! Really enjoyable and with workshop then it adds tons of fun!
25720,"Fun premise, but I can't recommend unless you're playing with a large group of friends. Otherwise, you'll just be kicked from a server before you even finish loading."
25721,"A fun, casual game for anyone to play alone or with friends (preferably the latter). It's really cheap for a game with such a great concept and shouldn't be missed out."
25722,"This game is just awesome. 
[list]
[*] You can grab your friend's head.
[*] You can grab your friend's leg.
[*] You can grab your friend's hand.
[*] And many other things ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[/list]"
25723,"I bought this game long time a ago. But when I played it, I did't have much fun. Personally, it's boring, unchallenging and requires lots of patience. So I don't recommend this game to those who like Borderlands2 :)"
25724,"Great game! Super nice and fun to play with friends. Creative control and gameplay. The only negative issue is the rather unintuitive way of how to start a local 2 player splitsreen game. Took me half an hour to figure out :/  In fact you need to start a local single player game, hit the menu and only then the second player needs to join the game to aktivate spilt screen. Other than that, thumbs up :) !"
25725,This game is scrumptious.
25726,Must try for those who loves puzzle games like portal. Local coop and online coop are awesome to play with friends.
25727,"yeah aight.

This game is very aight imo. The most challenging part was trying to drive the big yellow scary trucks. The most fun part was skipping 80% of the level just by climbing one wall lmao. Dont let my whopping six hours of gameplay deceive you, I am a true gamer at heart and this game gave me a heart attack (if you know what i mean) yuh. Game was beyond all else, on a physical and mental level (maybe even possibly a spiritual level too). A young birdie once told me that there is great replay value, even though there is ten-ish WHOLE levels to play. If you are an achievement hunter, buckle up, get yo dog, play yo kazoo, and good luck soldier. My favorite moment in the game was when my doiks would try and climb a wall, and I'd grab them and violently hold my other free hand to the ground. They proceeded to unfriend me and sent a hitman on me after the sesh. I've exiled myself from America and now I'm living off the grid somewhere in New Zealand (Not going to say exactly where cuz my friend might be reading this). If anyone is reading this review, god bless your sanity."
25728,"Really Fun Game.
I like how the devs let you brute force your way thorough most of the levels instead of forcing you to do mundane tasks."
25729,.
25730,"I've seen some people talking about beating this game in 3 hours. That's not my experience at all. The first few levels were really quick. But after what feels like the tutorial set of levels (I say this ends with the one where they teach you to climb), they take significantly longer. That next one was probably 1-2 hours for me. The one after that was probably 3-4 hours. That longer one did include playing with objectives that were clearly not important for progress nor achievement stats, as well as getting seriously stuck for a long time but eventually figuring it out without the aid of guides. The particular review I read did mention a technique to cheese past the levels fast. I won't mention that way here, or look up how to do the technique because I don't want to know it. So like many puzzle games, your time will depend a lot on if you naturally figure out the puzzles quickly (through luck or skill), look at guides, stumble upon or look up ways to cheese the game. In addition to normal puzzle games, how well you grasp the physics will impact things too. My skill in games like these are usually better than average (both puzzle solving and physics control), but not pro. However, my time investment for fooling around with unnecessary things is probably a good deal higher than most. So take it as you will. I bought the game on the promise it was coming to workshop, because I heard it was a short game. But I'd say workshop or not this was worth it. But now with the workshop, just infinitely times better!"
25731,"Amazing both multiplayer and singleplayer. The puzzles are a difficulty of 4-6/10 with 10 being really hard. Never ending fun, and never got bored with it."
25732,"Best buy I think I may have ever made. This game is so fun however, I recommend you only get this game if you know that a couple of your friends are getting it too. The first time I played this with my friends, we laughed so much that I cried. Absolutely love this game, and I very thoroughly recommend it."
25733,"Funny game, Its like you are drunk while playing this game. Many fun and challenging stage and hope they continue to update or create a new map"
25734,:)
25735,"add horizontally split splitscreen pls
also it sorta would be cool to see a pvp element added
(at least health bar and a comically large sword)
also when is the point where i start drowning/dying 
other than those clap clap amazing job 
i rate this 5/5 flat humanses
amazing game"
25736,Fun overall amazing with friends
25737,"Really great game it's soundtrack is great and it's overall fun. Don't play alone, it's more fun with strangers. Hope this helped"
25738,"If you have asthma or any respiratory illness, don't play this game with friends. You'll laugh so hard you won't be able to breathe properly, then you'll die... but you'll die happy xD"
25739,literally the best game ever with some friends. You can either endlessly screw each other over for fun or work together to complete the levels for fun.
25740,I downloaded it and it kept going to black screen?
25741,funniest game ever seen.
25742,"Awfully iritating. Then rewarding. Then fun... and now with workshop!
Couch coop is great, too.

One of the most fun games ever.

25750,"A puzzle game on your own, and absolute chaos with friends. Great either way. As an added bonus, the developers haven't ditched it, and new levels are still being made!"
25751,"Had fun even with only 3.6 hr playtime
"
25752,"i cry its so funny game if u alone dont buy it 
it need funny stupid friends"
25753,good fun for anyone
25754,"It's goofy fun similar to Surgeon Simulator, only the controls in this game aren't frustrating. They're actually surprisingly solid. The puzzles are neat and the platforming is fun. Great little game, easily worth the price when on sale for $7.50."
25755,"This game is a great example of why you can't trust Steam reviews. It gets very good reviews but if you check out the reviews on Metacritic they are no where near as positive.

Unfortunately I relied on the Steam reviews and wasted my money on this game. The physics are terrible which completely spoils the gameplay. Moving around is very slow which combined with the frustrating physics ruins my enjoyment of the game."
25756,Loads of fun solo or with friends recommend this game a lot
25757,"pretty good and fun i reccomend if you have good computer ,very funny 55/5
"
25758,if you have 4 or more friends Just force them to buy this Game :D
25759,"This game is much more fun with friends, so i can tell you're gonna have a lot of fun with friends on this game so you literally should buy this game. I had the best laugh in ages while playing with my friend for 1 hour and 41 minutes. Lego man approves!"
25760,"Most fun I've had with friends in a game. The waddling, finding the solutions, the accidental grabbing and not so accidental throwing of friends outta the map. I highly recommend it."
25761,uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuussssssssssssssssssssssshould bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuy iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttt
25762,Nice n fun for fellow soft gamers like muhself
25763,"8.0/10 
Interesting map design and puzzles to solve. Hard to enough to interest you and easy enough to continue.
good save point placements saves you from the stress of starting over.
Great casual game for coop or to play with your close friends, with barely no skill gap.

Greatest part is, anyone and literally anyone can play together."
25764,"I have only played this game for 4 hours now, but this game had already surprised me. It is a wonderful choice for playing along with friends, but not quite suitable for playing alone. This game has: an amazing physics engine, optimistic and detailed map, interesting stage settings, and ""easy""  operations. This game also supports the steam workshop. It totally worth the price. Thank the developer for producing the most joyful game i have played in a long time."

We were 6 playing online together on 3 PCs and that masterpiece was by far the game we loved the most! Cool physics, customisable characters and OUTSTANDING LEVEL DESIGN makes it one of the best party games on the market.

A big fat THANK YOU to all the developers who worked on Human Fall Flat!"
25777,"Great co-op fun with lots of laughs. With about a 7 hour playthough, it was well worth the $5 I got it for on sale."
25778,Fun with friends.
25779,"This game is best to play with friends, can play a whole day, very NICE"
25780,"Love It, I cried xD"
25781,cool game
25782,great game alot of fun with friends. only downside is that the standard maps can be completed quite fast.
25783,it is a pretty good game overall. but it is sorta boring.
25784,fun
25785,The game is like a floppy Portal without the Portals and without the storyline. It gives me a headache.
25786,good
25787,Great game... played it a bit
25788,fun with friends
25789,recomendo bom jogo
25790,idk
25791,Very interesting if you play with your friends! 😊
25792,gg
25793,"Great Coop Game, loads of fun and now they added workshop support for custom levels, even better!"
25794,"This game is based on a cool idea and is backed by a nice physics engine. But the gameplay is just terribly boring. Every single thing requires so much time to be done. And the puzzles I saw were painfully simple, so there was no feeling of accomplishment when solved. Even local co-op was a chore, everything was so not-dynamic. This doesn't bring joy.

Keep in mind that this oppinions comes from someone who liked BattleBlock Theater which has much faster pace and more ""instant"" interactions between players.."
25795,Game of the Century
25796,Fun and Addictive.
25797,good game. levels were to short witch was the downside when you first bought it a while ago. Insanely fun with friends and super happy they added workshop. overall fucking fantastic game [spoiler]buy it retard[/spoiler]
25798,it was a good game i like it but levels are too short and sometime online doesnt work because it reuires higher ping i refunded
25799,"I have mixed feelings about this game. When it works, it is super fun, but it is also somewhat buggy. Required items don't respawn in some levels. Other things get stuck. Things just stop working from one game to the next. 

On Linux (Steam Play) the mouse bugs out on the second game, so if you leave a game you have to quit out entirely and go back in just to avoid that particular issue. I haven't played on Windows so I cannot confirm if that bug exists there too. I realise that any Steam Play compatibility issues may not be their fault, but the game used to support Linux natively (and badly) and I'm mentioning this in case people want to play on Linux.

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ON LINUX:
* Make sure you enable Steam Play otherwise it will download an older version of the game (also very buggy!)
* Set the PROTON_NO_D3D=1 option in the launch command setting.
* Beware that your mouse will probably glitch out on the second game you join, so if you exit a game, exit right out (Alt+F4) and then launch it again.
* Good luck - check protondb for more tips.

Overall we had a lot of fun with it but the continual stream of bugs encountered did detract from the experience a bit.  One of the main reasons it is so satisfying to finish a level is because the risk of a bug making that impossible is ever present. You get very good at scaling walls. One of the best (redeeming) features of the game is that there are often multiple ways to complete a level, so even if things don't respawn you're not completely stuck."
25800,"I have the game, now I need some friends:)"
25801,I have had this game a while and found it really fun! But the recent addition of steam workshop makes this game a great value. Recommended!
25802,Great Fun playing with your kid!
25803,What the fuck is this crap??
25804,"Multiplayer ragdoll physics, enough said."
25805,this game is super fun and you can do crasy thing in it. Realy good game
25806,AMAZING GAME ALWAYS LOVED IT!
25807,yay workshop!
25808,"amazing
"
25809,A great game to play on your own and the best game ever to play with your friends!
25810,Befor Workshop this game was fun for a short while. Now with Workshop this game is aweseome
25811,Wunderbar
25812,"Ja ir ar ko spēlēt kopā,tad tiešām ir jautri kompānijā!"
25813,nice
25814,Great game and super fun. The developers are also really active and fix bugs really fast. The workshop is the best addition to the game.
25815,its funny to watch the humans fall flat
25816,"4/10 latency (cuz p2p)
5/10 play with stranger a bit fun
1/10 its make me want to vomit i donnu why
2/10 if i playing alone :( (i got no pren)
"
25817,"very good game , if you have friends.... but its also fun alone! now that theres a workshop the singleplayer experience is amazing"
25818,"Dropped Linux support, for developing more cosmetic shit in Windoof. I'm very dissapointed!"
25819,"incredible to find a game where my character is clumsier than i am irl

10/10 for self esteem boost"
25820,"If you have at least one friend to play this with, go for it! Clever and hilarious!"
25821,"I was trying to play a map with my friend. Their screen was just loading, but something weird happened.

Their character was moving.

It wasn't a prank cause I saw their screen.

They said weird stuff like ""Closet, Window, Door"" and ""Vous, Goodbye, Jamison""

I don't think I'm gonna play Human: Fall Flat for a while.."
25822,"I cried of laughter, so good with friends"
25823,"Funny as heck but needs more maps and player creation editors for maximizing maps, models, and possibilities."
25824,yes i like a ragdoll that teached itself how to stand and climb and destroy a fucking wall
25825,Awesome! New Workshop Update is amasing.
25826,"The clunky controls ruin the game! They are so clunky that I am unable to pass the stupid tutorial! Let us JUMP!!! Climbing is terrible and is virtually impossible with keyboard & mouse! What were you dev's thinking??? 

Not recommended if using keyboard and mouse! Not sure about using a controller, but forget using K&M! Every move is so slow and clumsy.  This is obviously done on purpose to make the game funny, but it's not. It's stupidly frustrating!!!

EDIT: I watched some YouTube video's on how to climb and it is pretty stupid if you ask me! I'm going to waste my game time trying to freaking climb and won't be able to return this game!!! I want to like this game, but it's not going to be easy! I'll try again... I'll Be Back!!! ;-)

EDIT: Tried again... Can't climb! So lame! REFUND!!!"
25827,my daddy drags and punches my body
25828,"Best multiplayer puzzle game EVER. They fitted the multiplayer perfectly, and the levels are great! super fun, it makes you wanna play one last level. the only minus is that it doesnt have a lot of levels. but you can play rthem over and over, never gets old. 10/10 would advice. now with the public workshop, it will have loads of things to do."
25829,"Hilarious on 11/10! Will help to improve your teamwork skills :D
No fun to play alone tho."
25830,"This game is hilarious with friends, you can laugh all day. Amazing game and now with Workshop it's endless fun."
25831,so funny game
25832,its very epic
25833,Absolute fun game to mess around with friends.
25834,My dog plays this game.
25835,good game
25836,"Right, review time, lets start with gameplay,

 its fun to move around, grab another friends buttock, and lift him sky high, its almost like you are playing as a drunk toddler, yes, that's the right analogy for that, sometimes it gets a little annoying to play.. but after you get past that, just think with the mind of a hammered toddler, and think to yourself, ""where can i launch myself with this catapult,"" or ""i wonder if i can drown"" or ""i want to use this rope to fly across this large gap in the middle of these random floating islands""

and then get on with your game, and use that catapult, no matter what anyone says, 

the audio, i like the added sound effects for headbutting a train. it might a loud sound like you are hitting a hammer on a train almost, you have a few voices ingame, but they arent all that common, unless you are grabbing all the hint boxes, overall i think the sound effects are good,

the regular maps are quite long and challenging to play, definitely replayable, i love the addition of workshop maps, and the updates in the game,

its worth the price at around £4-5 and i highly recommend this game with friends"
25837,"Get this game! I want to review this game twice so I can recommend it again. While it clearly draws inspiration from games like QWOP with it's wonky control scheme, this game takes the concept of weird controls to a new level and sets a new standard for physics-based puzzlers. Most every puzzle is challenging while still giving players plenty of flexibility in solving the challenge, making it fun to go through each level again to try different approaches. With some solutions (both intended and not) allowing players to bypass entire sections of levels, this game has a lot of potential for people who love speedrunning. While it can be difficult (sometimes brutally so) at times, frequent checkpoints and (usually) forgiving level design keep the game from getting frustrating (most of the time).

There are a few puzzles/sections that are frustrating to do alone (most notably the coal collection/truck driving in the Power Plant level) but most just take a few tries or some creative workarounds. The third-person camera can sometimes move into positions where it becomes difficult to see what your character is doing/grabbing, but that usually felt less annoying and more like an extra layer to the challenge. Sometimes your character's hands will get stuck or you'll otherwise have trouble grabbing what you're aiming for, but once again, this felt like an intentional part of the game and merely another challenge to overcome.

This is probably the best puzzle game I've encountered since Portal 2 and one of the more enjoyable games I've played recently. It's a lot of fun to play alone and I'm sure even more fun to play with friends."
25838,Issa Good Game.
25839,I died of laughter. So funny love the physics. Neet puzzles too
25840,10/10 Would fling self into abyss again
25841,Beautiful game.
25842,"Strongly suggest this game. Play it with a friend though, much more fun."
25843,funniest game i've played in a while!
25844,"This is a review
"
25845,"Good game. I like the ragdoll physics, the levels, and the creativity."
25846,"OH heck yeah. 10 outta 10 would drag friends of cliffs again.
"
25847,It's what you have been looking for.
25848,"best game ever

EDIT/UPDATE: Very good updates!!! still best coop game!"
25849,Very fun puzzle mechanics. A game that can get you both relaxed and angry at the same time.
25850,"It´s fun with friends, but to expensive on steam."
25851,It is a fun game and more levels are coming also in the steam workshop you can download levels and character. It's great fun.
25852,feelsbadman
25853,"gg
"
25854,"best multiplyer game ever, period."
25855,"very good game, nice physics and very fun to play with friends, 10\10"
25856,its good
25857,"i had so much fun and im playing it over and over
"
25858,THIS GAME IS SO GOOD WITH THE NEW WORKSHOP!!!!
25859,"Everyone else when the play this game: Why is this so weird.
Me when i play this game: BOX!, BOX!, BOX!, BOX!"
25860,"Fun 'pick up and play' game for short co-op sessions. Some levels are brutal though, looking at you chain boat...."
25861,Nice w/ friends but very short!
25862,"HFF was already a nice little package before the workshop support, but now with the workshop support it's simply brilliant. Multiplayer is fun, generally even with strangers. 

Biggest minus perhaps is that there's no ping indicator anywhere, so you'll just blindly need to join servers and hope for the best. Network latency affects directly your own controls, so high ping isn't really an option for enjoyable gameplay."
25863,"could have been great , 
graphics have some weird glitches that make me feel nautious
the game pad controls are broken."
25864,"Blobby
"
25865,hate it
25866,"So many fun times and late nights of dying laughter with friends, and so many fun workshop maps!"
25867,"good is an understatement to describe homo sapiens moves unexpectedly and abruptly down and finishes in a position that is not perpendicular to the ground as the initial state, but that of a condition that is horizontal or parallel to the ground most commonly described as ""flat"". i thoroughly enjoyed rayping my friend in this game as a completely stark black person. i think this game deserves a thorough peepeeholehurting/10"
25868,"Fun game to mess around in for a bit 

Pros: fun to play with friends for along time 
Cheap
Fun customizations for characters 
Awesome community 
SUPER EASY TO RUN
Cons: 
Too short of a campaign 
No workshop levels
"
25869,"I don't know how I played this stupid game over 1000 hours. It is a really simple game. You will have a really good time play this game with your friends. I started play this game in 2019, but I missed a lot of my friends which played with me at that time. You can get a lot of maps in workshop. Hmmm... Invite me if you wanna play with me. Lmao
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
怎么说呢，不错的游戏，游戏模式也很简单，我也玩了有1000多个小时了，最好是有朋友能一起玩，但是之前很好的几个朋友都好久没一起玩了，唉。创意工坊地图挺多的，但感觉没有一起玩的质量那么高了，加油吧，想玩的可以找我，hhh"
25870,Very good game!
25871,i want refund of this game please.
25872,one of the most silly yet funny games to play you do coool puzzels like connecting to cables to a power box or find an axe and chop a tree down but now with steam work shop support we can now have more fun then normal if you are buying this game then do it its the best thing you can but with your money
25873,grab
25874,This game is just overall wacky and fun!
25875,"Very cool and fun game especially in coop. Super excited about Steam Workshop launch, because it should give that wonderful game a second life."
25876,Great physics. Intuitive controls. Levels with hidden secrets and challenges. Wobbly people. Hilarious costumes. Enormous amounts of laughter. Awesome in multiplayer (!). Great support and content updates even now (almost 3 yrs after release)!
25877,"Workshop support! Finally!

This is a really fun game to play with friends and often leads to some hilarious failed attempts at teamwork
the only thing missing was content.. We dropped it for a few months but now with the workshop support update this game has gained so much more potential..

Definitely re-installing this one! For around 10 $/€ sure worth your money if you can play with friends!

"
25878,"Absolute FAN FRIGGENTASTIC of a game 

Definitely a blast if you have someone to play with as well"
25879,"Enjoyable and frustrating game at the same time!
But nothing beats trapping your friends or dragging them to the edge of a mountain and watch them fall. <3"
25880,yes
25881,"This game is ridiculous and had me crying, I was laughing so hard. Don't let the simplicity of the look fool you, as the game will definitely have you questioning your sanity. All in all... Great buy!!"
25882,"Human: Fall Flat oof where to start.

This game is freaking awesome! I would say to get the most out of it you must play it with friends!

Game works fluently - graphics look very calm and nice. Did have no issues. Achievements were not difficult to unlock either!

I haven't laughted soo much for a while so thank you very much this game developers. The physics in the game are just so hilarious.

I'd say this game is a must play!"
25883,"Very epic, needs more levels but fun and unique mechanics."
25884,Very fun game.
25885,"this game caused me to whack my phone on my desk which resulted in it shattering which was fun

but yeah this game is quite fun especially with friends"

25888,"A ok game if you play alone, but amazing if you play with your friends"
25889,"WORKSHOP SUPPORT, YES!

GET IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."
25890,This is a great game to play with friends and family! Never ending fun and challenging puzzles. My favorite feature would be the painting and customization options for your character. :)
25891,"My friend gave me this game and it's absolutely hilarious. I love slapstick and ragdoll physics, so this game is perfect."
25892,"Great party game! Became even greater with the new public Steam Workshop update. Thanks, Curve!"
25893,"This game is fun cause you can throw your friends off the edge while you get thrown off the edge by your other friends.

In this case failure can be an option if you bust a rib laughing at ruining their progress to make sure you're first."
25894,This game is a great laugh with friends. The physics alone make it for a fun time. I think there is potential for people to make some really cool stuff in workshop too. Would def recommend if you and some pals like to goof around.
25895,"A great game to have fun with friends. You spend more time trying to ****block your friends rather than trying to solve the missions. Minimum 4 people to really enjoy as you need 1 person to actually try to progress through the game. We finished the game as 5 friends and got a really good laugh out of it. There are a few bugs where you can progress in the game without actually having to clear the obstacles. I would recommend you to try to beat the game conventionally rather than trying to find shortcuts. 

"
25896,"not worth $15. its fun and fantastic with friends. workshop support will mean this game will be around a lot longer than similar games that are JUST a physics engine to mess around in. that's what this game is, a physics engine to mess around in. i only put not recomended because the price tag is WAY too high for this game. it would be PERFECT listed at $5 with options to buy 4 packs mildly cheaper."
25897,"Its a fun puzzle like plat former that just got a update that has steam workshop support. While the game alone is beatable in a couple of hours, the amount of downloadable maps that are going to come are going to make this game a masterpiece."
25898,"sucks
"
25899,"Hilarious Game, best enjoyed with friends. Amazing character creation tool!"
25900,"So much fun to play with friends my only complaint is I NEED MORE!
but now that the public workshop is up that problem has been solved so we all good."
25901,"I can't seem to launch the game on my mac, each attempt to launch the screen goes black and the titles appear on top all pixelated and don't respond at the main menu, any help?"
25902,Friendly game.
25903,Im always lagging  but I have a decent pc ive  played for 2  hours and it is boring and also there is some bugs with things and it gets annoying
25904,"Excellent to play with friends, if only I had some to play with..."
25905,Great physics platformer. With the addition of Workshop levels you should definitely pick it up. Better with friends but I definitely managed to have fun alone as well.
25906,Best Funny Game For ever
25907,Great game :D
25908,"I've played with my friends and couldn't stop laughing of all the silly things we did together, good and bad. 

So grab some friends and watch the chaos unfold! From teamwork going wrong to wrong kind of teamwork. There is never 1 single solution to the 'puzzles' which makes it a big plus in my book. Creativity is key!

Steam Workshop added is a massive upgrade to the replayability and supporting up to 8 players (online) will make sure that you will die of laughter or hate your friends.
"
25909,"The devs forgot about this game for two and a half years before suddenly updating it a few times, 11/10 it still gets more attention than TF2"
25910,Dis some real shit
25911,Well.... It was a game buuuuuuuuuuuuut wait till it goes on sale! Actually same for rust! It is a very fun game! If you played any type of minecraft survival/factions then you will love rust. Rust like many other great games has all sorts of things to do besides just surviving. You can play with your cousins (Well.. If the play with you back).
25912,is xbox able to play with pc
25913,"Don't bother buying if you don't have friends
If you do, force them to buy"
25914,This is a great game if you're looking for a chill game night with some friends. Though the vanilla maps get old really fast so it's best if you download some off of the internet.
25915,"Whis game is sucks but i like it
"
25916,4 euro on g2a. A game that seemed to be lost at first. But if you spend time and who you play with is very fun
25917,This is big fun with friends for a few hours
25918,"Is this a game where you can throw your friend  in the map void, make human bridges, think outside the box, have ""Ricardo Milos"" as a skin, experience real physics, throw your friend in the map void again and spend hours laughing at all the nosense going on?

Yes, yes it is. 
(Btw I just purchased the game on steam, but played a lot in Xbox, because U don't want a review of someone who barely played a game *cough*)"
25919,Pretty Good
25920,"This game is clearly made for kids, yet there's no block feature, no swear filter no protections at all. Cannot recommend this game for kids at all. It's simply unsafe online. I've watched my daughter play this game and just be followed from lobby to lobby by someone who clearly isn't a child trying to get her to follow links and add her. There's a mute feature however as soon as you leave the lobby and join another one the mute feature is switched off. Unsafe."
25921,"Controls, including looking around, are noticeably delayed, making this game quite nauseating to play.
The delay did not vanish even at over 100 FPS. It is probably a buffering issue, but due to how short this game is, I did not find a solution before I finished it."
25922,"A splendid little game, that is - above all else - fun! The recent addition of steam workshop support prompted me to add this review - there is now no upper limit to the levels and fun to be explored. A great purchase for the price!"
25923,Played with my daughter. We laughed till we couldn't breath. So much fun.

Hey I've run into a problem with my game, so i start the game and it doesent start, it starts but the screen is like stuck on 1 screen please help"
25928,Epiccccccccccccccccccccccccc
25929,"This game is fantastic.
A physics puzzler, and a damn good one at that.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list][*] [strike]Possibly the greatest jiggle physics known to man[/strike] they changed it slightly (reduced number of jigglepoints), which I dislike.

[*] Multiple paths around the level

[*] Multiple solutions to each puzzle

[*] Soundtrack is gorgeous[/list]
[b]Beautiful orchestral score, juxtaposed with jelly people walking into walls and falling off things.[/b] [i]Absolutely breathtaking. [/i]
This has one of the most fitting soundtracks of any game I've played. The game knows exactly what music to play in the background (sometimes event triggered) from the inspiring ""victory"" tracks, gripping ""suspense"" tracks and goofy ""tutorial"" tracks. The bit where you get the coal (you'll know when you get there) was flawlessly executed.

[list][*] Physics is pretty consistent [/list]
Better than any other unity game I've ever played (very rarely you can get props [spoiler] or yourself [/spoiler] clipped through the floor, but you can reload a checkpoint)[list][*] Rewards exploration

[*] They added more levels to the game, for free. 

[*] Workshop support! 
All you avid level designers can create new masterpieces to parkour across.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*] They increased the number of points to make your character more wobbly
This means that if you try to get around by swinging you lose momentum much easier, but it is still possible (it just requires more skill).

[*] If the pc multiplayer is anywhere near as laggy as the console multi version, it's approaching unplayable 
[strike](possibly due to the number of the objects [strike]jelly baby[/strike] joint positions and their velocities it's trying to send simultaneously?).[/strike][/list]"

25940,Human fall flat. I have never played a better game. It is amazing. all the devs should probably get a ticket to germany and hug my fat ass. mmh mmh mmh. It's perfect. I CAN NOW PLAY AS RICARDO? im hooked. You've got me now. Let's go. where to? Ricardo land of course. ahahahahha. Ive never been this happy before. Ricardo is my dad

25949,Well yes
25950,"This isn't a Review i was wondering if in a update could you add Editing, Loading and Saving presets during a game, more editing clothing, models, accessories and more maps"
25951,"good game, play it with friends then it'll makes your day better!"
25952,fsa
25953,"Awesome game, fun with friends."
25954,"Short, but extreamly fun game to play with friends."
25955,+1
25956,"This game is a blast- you can beat any puzzle however you like, using only your body and two grabby hands. I get a kick out of climbing *over* the levels, if that tells you anything about how free form the design is of this game."
25957,Fun! JUMPING AND CLIMBING AND RUNNING AROUND.walls can be smashed AND CO-OP! (but no one plays it with me at the time of writing this pls friend me) and i like the design of the bobs/avatars because it reminds me of gang beasts so i recommend playing this game if you feel like it.
25958,bets game ever tan out of ten
25959,humian fat
25960,Good game tbh and finally they bringed out workshop maps feature because then you don't have to wait for new maps.
25961,"Fun take on puzzle/platform. I played it with my boyfriend and it was hilarious to try and throw each other off cliffs. Once we decided the cooperate, the puzzles were fun and challenging, some requiring creativity to complete. the worlds are beautifully thought out, leaving a lot of 'decoy' items and leaves you wondering. I recommend this for a really fun and surprisingly relaxing experience."
25962,"This game is good for new players like me.  And when friends play as a team, amazing things are bound to happen..."
25963,me and da boys hangin around
25964,Hinnang: 7/10
25965,This Game is so fun.I recommend it if u have friends to play with ;) its only fun with friends.
25966,"this is a very bizzare yet fun game that involves puzzle solving and fast thinking.


would not recommend for people who hate parkour


LOL"
25967,"Very fun game, especially with friends! Would recommend taking time looking into all the new workshop maps. Most are very well created, and offer easy, quick, fun maps or more in depth challenging ones!"
25968,yes
25969,Great Physics-Based puzzle game! My sister and I love playing splitscreen together.
25970,VERY GOOD
25971,It is really good
25972,"Funny game, best to play with friends."
25973,"very fun! i would reccomend! great graphics and really funny!
"
25974,enormous fun with pals
25975,"You don't need alcohol to feel drunk. Just buy this game :]
Good puzzle game, lots of fun with friends. 
10/10"
25976,"very fun game with friends, alone not so fun"
25977,"What a charming little game.
Looks beautiful, and the physics-based gameplay is a joy to master.
Sure, you'll faceplant a lot at first, but once you get to a point where pole vaulting across a massive gap is a breeze, it's all worth it.
Bonus points for all the secret little activities and things to discover scattered in every level, and it gets even better with friends, too.

Two thumbs up from me!"
25978,Fun!
25979,"Very good game, Enjoyable to play with friends or alone."
25980,.
25981,the most fun game :D
25982,My friends stopped playing this game with me when I figured out you can climb the walls to skip most of the levels.
25983,Five stars
25984,"Gang beasts with puzzles. The game is brilliant fun with friends, with some well-designed levels to play around on. Takes a while to get used to playing as the pillsbury dough boy but is well worth it!"
25985,"yes i do recommend this game, all around fun enjoyable however they don't add maps very frequently witch ends up making the game somewhat ""stale"" and boring, but overall recomended!"
25986,"If you want a fun game to play with friends, or a calm experience alone, this game is good for that. The music is good for the scenery, and the physics are comical. I would definitely recommend."
25987,funny game
25988,A 3D LittleBigPlanet made in unity. Brilliant
25989,fun with friends
25990,nice
25991,This game is stupid and I love it
25992,Flinging yourself across a wall is pretty cool.
25993,Me likey
25994,"One of the best multiplayer games I have, and thanks to the recent workshop release it now has endless replayability. I am looking forward to what levels the community can bring to this hilarious and fun game."
25995,"Amazing, funny, challenging. Workshop support makes it perfect."
25996,"An incredible fun game solo or for as many friends as you can gather up. Janky and weird, so much crazy stuff can happen. It's a blast. Workshop made the possibilities endless."
25997,"It's the dumbest game ever but that's the best thing about it (I mean that in a good way)
Overall a very good game
I recommend playing with friends"
25998,"Very fun concept. Only regret that all servers i find which are most likely locally hosted by players are laggy A.F. Otherwise only wish there was more often content released and actual servers. 
Overall a fun experience that opens your gaming horizons."
25999,"With the addition of workshop, this game has become one of the games i'm happy to recommend to anyone. For puzzle and physics games, this is among the best for pure messing around and fun, and with workshop the replay value has gone up dramatically."
26000,Fun game to play with friends love it to death.
26001,boring
26002,"This game made me cry. It's such a funny game. 

FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS !"
26003,"I am dead because of the controls! More please!
10/10 innapropriate touching"
26004,ABSOLUTLY aweful.
26005,"This was a worthy purchase. It took nearly 6 hours to beat it, with help from a couple of friends mind you. I recommend the game because it's guaranteed to make you laugh. I started playing this with 2 other friends on a night when I wasn't really in the best mood, but this game instantly lifted my spirits. We worked together, we messed with each other, we literally drug each other down sometimes for the fun of it. There's plenty of achievements and multiple ways to beat most of the puzzles.

The physics, the mechanics, the fact that you can play solo or with friends - and how freaking hilarious it can be makes this game a definite recommendation."
26006,"Extremely fun game to play with a friend, it's full of hilarious moments. Mastering the controls of this game is a bit tricky, but extremely rewarding. There's quite a lot of content for the price, and the puzzles get quite clever. There's also no single right way of doing things, it's a pretty open game that rewards creativity."
26007,good game if you have friends more friends more fun
26008,"I really wish it wasn't strictly a pass or smash rating on these, really I do.  There are aspects of this game that are funny, but it just doesn't function well as an actual game.  I played this with one of my buds for my channel and we did have fun, but I couldn't see myself having fun with this alone and we simultaneously got bored with it at the same time after about an hour.  It's not terrible, but there are more fun ""wacky physics"" games out there that I would recommend more highly.  I'm glad I got it on humble bundle because I couldn't see myself paying full price for this."
26009,"So squishy, need more physics. Great with friends! If you are lonely as me, then do not get that SAD2"
26010,Great with friends
26011,Such a fun game!! Its even better when you play with friends! Highly recommend!
26012,you should
26013,"I loved it when it was only 3 levels and simplistic as hell with only 1 or 2 hours to complete the game. Because you could waste 40 hours just exploring the levels in a sandbox gameplay environment that rewards you from learning new mechanics like side climbing on walls, swinging with one arm, etc.
Imagine now that we have full Workshop support and an exponentially growing library of community made levels and models."
26014,"really A good one,
with friends will get more fun,also be able to play in split screen"
26015,They finally released Workshop so it is well worth the price
26016,"When you fall from a higher ground, you really don't bounce. you go SPLAT...

This game increases FUN when MORE people join!
Score = (# of players * 10 + 10) out of 10

Went through all the basic levels with another friend and it was awesome. Grabbing your friend's BUTT just to hang on and not fall is amazing scenery. The developers are continuing their effort in making each level challenging, yet provides multiple solutions to get through the exit. (such as squeezing your unproportional body into a small gap of cage...)

I have explored several workshop levels and so far they definitely kept me engaged and are challenging. Looking for more level updates in the future!!

"
26017,"One of the funniest physics based games I've ever played, and it's still really good even if you play solo.
Now with Steam Workshop support, this game is 100x better.
Player created levels and skins, the possibilities are endless.
This is such a fun game to sit back, relax and play, it doesn't demand much of you, but the outcome can be absolutely hysterical.
Multiplayer with friends is always great also. It works pretty flawlessly, as long as there isn't lag.
Human Fall Flat is a fantastic little physics game that deserves to be in everybody's library who enjoys these types of games.

9/10"
26018,Fun social game to play with friends.
26019,"i wanted to love this game i loved the vids that ppl made from this game i got the game today and my god to many toxic players and players taking the game serious  over all im really up set about it coz the vids on it had no toxic players so maybe thay are old vids anyway i dont recommend this if u want to get craped on by players that take it seriously i hate toxic players and some are just to much like this not shiting on the devs im shiting on the community that has became toxic coz thay cant take a fucking joke bye also 3 /10 bye 
"
26020,"Very frustrating game, and especially frustrating if you're going for 100% achievements. But if you're up to the task and challenge, it is an absolute blast!

Similar to Octodad and QWOP, Human Fall Flat uses a unique set of controls and mechanics to tackle odd and interesting challenges. There is always something new to be accomplished, and the achievements range from trivial and story-bound to mind-bogglingly difficult and terribly frustrating. The game always has me coming back to try and reach the next achievement or tackle a puzzle in a different way, thanks to unique layouts and physics.

Personally haven't tried any multiplayer beyond joining a couple random servers, so I can't speak much about it. The little I have played has shown tons of potential. Hope with the new Steam Workshop support that people can use this to make Portal 2 Co-op style maps/puzzles to further strengthen the multiplayer experience.

My one gripe is Controller support for the Mac is shoddy at best. However, this was easily remedied by making a custom profile that fit the developer's recommended configuration and using my controller as though I were using a keyboard/mouse.

Ratings:
Graphics: 4/5
Level Design: 5/5
Achievements: 4.5/5
Mechanics: 4/5
Controller Support: 3/5 (but 5/5 when working)

Overall: 4.5/5"
26021,"If you can't even clear the customization screen without guaranteed  crashes, that's enough for a nope. Sad because it's an amazing little party puzzle physics game otherwise."
26022,"You know, you look at this game and it seems like a fun, silly game. And it is, it most certainly is. But hidden beneath that silliness is a tepid madness. Don't let the plushy exterior fool you. This game will quietly tear you apart and force you to put yourself back together... if you can."
26023,Funny
26024,"Great unique game, fun to play with friends and now they've released the highly requested steam workshop, can't wait to see what content the community makes"
26025,"This is the best game
If you find something for friendship
You need it!!!!"
26026,HIGHLY RECCOMENDED IF YOU GOT FRIENDS. BETTER THEN TIM SCHAFFERS GANGSHITS
26027,We got it bois. Workshop is finally here!
26028,10/10 would fuck up my friends again.
26029,"They listened to the community and gave us the workshops, top notch."
26030,"Ok, it's time to update my review. 

In the words of my friend, this game is like playing a drunk toddler stumbling around trying to solve physics puzzles. 

If that doesn't sound fun, I'm genuinely sorry for you."
26031,"Since the last time played the developer has changed how climbing works to break advanced climbing methods because apparently they didn't like people finding work-arounds to the way you're supposed to play the game. Where's the fun in that? Now when trying to climb walls my character simply won't grab on even though he clearly should be able to. In changing things, they've also broken normal climbing a bit. Even when climbing normally my character sometimes misses grabbing on causing me to fall and have to redo a section... which is of course infuriating.

I also had an issue with one of the achievements not popping up in the new level (Dark) even though I'm quite certain I did what I was supposed to. Either it didn't work or it's wording is misleading. Whatever the case, I had to waste another 45 minutes replaying the entire tedious level to get it. Not fun.

I remember really liking the game before, but this is just obnoxious now."
26032,"SO CUTE. 
Not that difficult and really fun to play if you are playing with others. 
No reason to hate this game. 
If you hate this game, you are advertising yourself that you don't have any friend to play with..."
26033,"Will change review when you can play workshop maps online with friends.  Too little content.. This is a no brainer to keep the game alive.


EDIT* Workshop is now available for online play. Much more to do with friends.  Well done."
26034,"awesome game hehe me and friends love playing this
"
26035,Fun game with multiplayer. It gives you some connection with other players. I hope it will be some new levels.
26036,Just plain fun! Highly recommend.
26037,FUN GAME!
26038,Awsome game. Lags a bit but not alot. Great Job
26039,It's a shame more people don't play this game... it really is one of the most innovative games out there and it is loads of fun with friends. I am eagerly awaiting online multiplayer for workshop levels
26040,"so fun game lmao
"
26041,"What I expected was some sort of sandbox game.
At first it looked fun.
Then I realized this is a platformer puzzle with broken controls. I like platformers, played a lot of them and I'm decently good in the genre. I like broken and silly games from time to time. The combination of the two, where you need to make pixel precise jumps with a drunker Mario-wannabe tripping in its own legs is not fun."
26042,great game to play with friends
26043,"funniest game ever
Best To Play With Friends"
26044,"I would mark this as one if the best games I have ever played in my whole life. The music is FANTASTIC! the graphics are AWESOME! And I have put my heart and soul in to find every easter egg, acheivment, and more. And I am sad to see myself run out of levels to play. But I will always be there until the next level release!

WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING, BUDDY?"
26045,Really nice game but its more fun with friends
26046,it is ofajfnkaeflk;
26047,"Very enjoyable with friends.

You run around solving mini puzzles to progress through the levels.
The gameplay mechanic is something very creative that adds on to the level of goofiness of this game.

Would definitely recommend."
26048,"Really nice game to spend some time.
Nice mechanics, nice gameplay and good game in general.
Recomend 10/10"
26049,"Interesting concept but way too inaccurate to be playable. Like those Goat games, its likely made for YouTube gamers to scream over to grab a quick cash grab for the Devs 15 mins of 'fame'!"
26050,"It's really fun, and even funnier if you're playing with friend online or multiplayer."
26051,"A fantastic game to play with friends, challenging puzzles, and fun at every corner"
26052,This is just the most fun you can have with rag doll physics. This game is incredibly creative in its challenges.
26053,Good game
26054,"It's a good game.
But it lacks content which makes sense since its a single developer"
26055,"This game doesn't work, not as single player or co-op. You can't get your friends into the game without a massive amount of hussle. There aren't any save game.If you have to pause in a middle of a level. You have to start from the beginning again. Which results, is that you have to the same s--t over and over again. And it's full of bugs, that will render your progress  impossible, The controllers have very slow reactions, which makes this game very hard, to almost impossible."
26056,"I want a refund, it never uploads new levels. I’ve beat the whole game and it’s boring now."
26057,Its a great game although sometimes it glitches and makes me able to fly.
26058,I'm Gonna say the W-Word.
26059,lol
26060,"Stupid game .It drive me crazy！
God damn！"
26061,"It’s not about the destination, it's about the journey. And man, oh man, how true that can be. Human: Fall Flat is not a game that requires real skill or even real thought. It’s a game with simple mechanics and simple puzzles. But you don’t play this game for those reasons. You play this game to chill with new or old friends, and do dumb, but fun things. Could this game use more content? Sure. But I say that about most games. I’ve spent 20+ in a game that takes less then an hour to beat because of the shenanigans that ensue. If you’re someone who likes to just screw around in a game and have fun with no purpose. To explore maps for the express purpose to itch that investigation tic. To maybe pick up a friend and throw them off a world with no remorse.  Well then, I think Human: Fall Flat might be the game for you."
26062,yeet
26063,HOw are u supposed to play local co op?. It doesnt say u must have a controler and there is no option to play withouth it.
26064,good memes
26065,"very fun game, easy to play, like to play it with my friends, cool puzzles"
26066,FUNNY SITH
26067,Good Game
26068,"Saw Gavin Free and Michael Jones play this game and completely flipped out like: I GOTTA HAVE IT!!! So now that I have it I just have to say thanks to devs for making it and to Play Pals for showing me this glorious masterpiece of a game.

11/10 would buy again."
26069,"Much like Goat Simulator, this game's charm and brilliance lies in flat-out ignoring the largely simple ""quests"" and ""objectives"" it presents you.  You can spend multiple hours in each of the beautifully muted levels that range from mountains to factories to a haunted mansion just completely dicking around.  You might even find yourself accidentally progressing the level just by being fucking stupid, it's an incredible feeling.

You can play through this whole game alone and it's somewhat enjoyable that way, but the foolishness really shines when you hop on with some of your worst friends or the many nefarious randos that populate Human Fall Flat's online community.  It's a blast either throwing each other off the side of the level dozens of times or futilely working together to beat one of the massive levels.  You ever work in a place where you've actually been overstaffed?  And things get done more poorly than if you were running a skeleton crew?  That's how this game works, and it's ridiculous fun."
26070,amazing game with a  group of friends
26071,"it is a really good game, well made and really funny with friends"
26072,"helps of fun to play with friends, don't play by yourself."
26073,"Human Fall Flat is a really nice game.
 
If you like pushing people to the edge, solving puzzels, climbing, jumping, daring, or even doing some yoga, this is the game for you!
First, you get to make your character. Dress them up with cool skins. Once your ready for advanture, get ready for a bumby ride. First level is pretty simple, and easy. But when you get on other levels, it's even more confusing, but cool. I played it a whole day straight since I wanted to do all levels! It's also nice because you can play with your friends. Human Fall Flat was how I got the friends I have now. I wanted Human Fall Flat for a long time, and having it is really an acheivement. I recommend it to people who love crazy experiences."
26074,i dont know how to row a boat still but its fun
26075,"A great game , it could use some more updated here and there but the game is fun , i'm dying when i play this , it really gets you out of a bad mood , i'd say wait for a sale and buy it!"
26076,"Great game by itself, even better with friends."
26077,i m always have a lto of ping while playing this with my firned and it mKSES me mad
26078,"such a fun game. good as a puzzle game if you're by yourself, but it's amazing if you're playing with friends"
26079,morph: the game
26080,is good
26081,Epic.
26082,JHGFDAHGDNBDFVS
26083,i love the game but wish it had more to play
26084,Hilarious gameplay and super funoverall. Absolutley worth the money
26085,I cannot play new version on linux.
26086,"incredible multi player game, i have no idea what youre waiting for to release workshops, it will take this game to a whole other level. like seriously....... YOU MAKE NO SENSE!"
26087,So much fun playing friends but all what is left is to add workshop please!!
26088,Like to beat people up. ;)
26089,I really didn't like the game. It was just boring.
26090,really good game recommended
26091,"Considering picking this up, I'd give this a read :)

Well.. cooperative puzzle solving games have always been my thing, each level presents new challenges, and most definitely encourages team work. As you progress, the levels keep you focused and thinking. there are 17 levels all in all, I've updates this review as a few more have been added since posting, and have quadrupled my play time, I'd say you could spend a solid couple days bashing out these levels with a friend, it's honestly great fun :)

However, the game does kind of loose it's touch once you've finished all the levels which is a bit disappointing. And while there are always more levels you can download from the workshop, they generally don't feel up to par with the originals in terms of the thought put into them and their layout, plus many are quite buggy.

Multiplayer is absolutely the way I think Human Fall Flat should be played, this should really be quite obvious though, the more the merrier! It's easy to setup a multiplayer server and you can configure it how you like.

At £15.99, I'd personally recommend this game when it's on sale, I don't tend to spend any more than £10 on a game, however I'm aware a lot of people are quite happy shedding out £50 on a game, look at the price tag how you will, I'd say it's more than worth the money if you've got friends who own the game, give it a go :)"
26092,"10/10 Would fall flat again xD

Hilarious game, Play it with friends while on voice coms. Worth every penny. Would had paid another 14 dollars for the amount of laugh i am getting out of it."
26093,Pretty fun game to play with friends!!
26094,Best game with Troll friends.
26095,10/10 can recommend
26096,+2 Local Co-op
26097,It's a really fun and interactive game to play with friends and the game keep getting updates with more fun added to it. I highly recommend this to anyone who just wanna have a blast
26098,:)
26099,"Yes, even works with PS3 controllers thru the steam link in couch coop.  More devs need to do this."
26100,"If you have some hours to kill and 2-3 friends, go for it. This game is extrem fun. I had some of the best laughs in forever in this game. You can cooperate to get things done quicker or you can fuck up your mates. A really nice game, and they even added free content of a whole new map after the release."
26101,"Awesome Game, but please add A WORKSHOP for Multiplayer in the Offical Game =("
26102,"Best $15 I ever spent! This game is amazing, fun puzzles and really great with co-op. Highly recommend if you and a friend are looking for a puzzle game to co-op."
26103,"A great gaming to FRICKING goof off in. Maps are fun and overall a great game. More fun with friends. 
"
26104,My arm got stuck in a puzzle and that was the time to uninstall.
26105,I love this game it’s so funny I die of laughter when I play it 😂 please make baby hands on steam if your seeing this please I love baby hands 🥺 pleaseeeee
26106,There is a reason I don't have more hours in this game.
26107,"Great singleplayer and multiplayer game.  Great game mechanics and challenges.  Unique level design.  Yes, the textures aren't the most state-of-the-art, but it adds to the beauty of the game too. Would recommend."
26108,fun with friends

26111,"Wouldn't say it's worth it for the price tag, isn't updated enough and you can only play the same levels with friends before they become dull.

Otherwise if you got friends and at least half of a working brain you can have hours of laughter and fun messing around in this puzzle based sandbox-like co-op game."
26112,lol
26113,this game is nice and fun lets go and play
26114,THIS IS THE BEST GAME WITH WORKSHOP SUPPORT NOW.
26115,racist
26116,Amusing game to play with friends
26117,Do you enjoy puzzle games? How about games that will test your patience? Well if you get this game and play it with your friends you will both love and hate this game! It's actually quite fun but can be one to test your friendships when they are being annoying nitwits. Lots of different puzzles to navigate through and the animations of your character make it even funnier.
26118,"Its a great game which brought a lot of laughes 

the only bad thing is that its too short
and the fact that there isnt workshop option for coop mode

26122,"Really enjoyed playing this game with my wife. Gameplay is simple, funny and somewhat addictive however the game needs new levels, can't stress this enough. We were able to barrel through the levels relatively quickly and haven't launched the game since."
26123,"It is a really fun and derpy game and also makes you laugh a bunch

Highly recomend i"
26124,"It to hard
"
26125,Workshop pls
26126,"[b]Play this game alone:[/b] [i]You'll have a lot of fun and a bit of a challenge.[/i]
[b]Play this game with friends:[/b] [i]You'll die from laughter and your friends will make it a harder challenge.[/i]

On a serious note,
It's a fanatstic game.
Map designs are great with many different ways to complete them.
The achievements are fun to collect and will provide you with a bit of a challenge and some replayability.

The devs are also on top of their game with frequent enough updates to keep coming back to this game.

I would highly recommend to play this game by yourself.
I would oblige you to play this game with friends, it will be the best laugh you've had in a long time.

26127,"really cool game, you can play it with your friends.
But unfortunately too few levels.

edited :

in the workshop much cool skins and maps."
26128,"Very good game. I enjoyed all of my hours on it. My one gripe with it is the price tag, they're asking 14.99 which is pricey for what you're getting. The game gives maybe 10 hours of d*cking around and having fun with friends, but after that it's pretty barebones with not many levels. Each level is a new experience but they're not too difficult. It's very fun while the fun lasts, would recommend if on sale. :)"
26129,Falls flat. 10/10
26130,"I liked it a lot, Multiplayer did get some annoying fps and stuttering issues but not any delay like some others has had. It does feel like there's a lot of missed potential with this game though, I'd love more levels. I think it it could become huge if it had proper workshop support. I bought skyrim 3 times because of modding support on PC platform. It's a huge selling point for some."
26131,Divertentissimo se giocato in compagnia!
26132,i think its pretty good but i got bored of it but its fun with friends if a i had any
26133,"The singleplayer aspect and performance is spot on. The game itself in terms of uniqueness and quality is perfect, I absolutely love these weird physics puzzle games. The ONLY thing that really makes me absolutely hate this game is that in multiplayer, it is literally the epitome of cancer... you can barely play it some times, and it is bound to break at some point. It is the glitchiest MP game I've ever played, and the devs can't fix it. What a disappointment."
26134,Bought it for 1 dollar. Its fun with friends but this price on steam is so highhh. Bought it from G2A. But its fun :)
26135,Little fun game i guess
26136,"Great game to play with your girlfriend, if u have one."
26137,"Ban danny
He threw me off a cliff"
26138,"if you have friends who you are very active online with, id recommend it

if youre like me and dont have any friends, dont buy this game"
26139,LOVE IT!!!!!
26140,"Human: Fall Flat is a puzzle game developed by a Lithuanian studio. The premise is simple, you’re a customisable mannequin called a bob and you’ve got to use physics and possibly teamwork to get through different fairly open levels.

The gameplay is really fun and addictive, I played through a couple times with my girlfriend and different groups of friends of mine and I’d definitely recommend playing with others. The game supports up to 8 people online which can cause some absolute chaos and brilliant memorable moments. The physics in this game is what causes most of the stupid moments, flopping about like a Uni student on a Friday night sets the stage for some pretty funny antics.

The actual levels you have to get through are slightly surreal and will leave you with a sense of wonder like you’re in a weird dream, every level also has multiple ways to solve it and lots of potential for exploration. I have to admit to stopping and staring at some of the backgrounds or cracking some Sharkboy and Lavagirl jokes along the way. For those of you who don’t know what they are, jokes are a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter.

Jokes aside though, I need to discuss some of the downsides to this game, actually maybe not downsides but more like additional information that may change your mind. I got enough entertainment out of this game to say it is worth full price but I have heard some people say they’ve only gotten around 4-6 hours and it wasn’t worth the full £11.99 on Steam and while the support has been immense for the game considering it’s nearly 3 years old, Linux support has been dropped and there has been no sign of getting the steam workshop working which would seriously unlock a lot of potential from this game.

Overall, it’s almost like bottled fun with a slight sense of accomplishment and a dash of acid trip. I’d rate this game 11 jokes that may not work over text out of 14."
26141,"Very fun Co-op game to play with friends, well worth $20 but buy it off of G2a or somewhere other than steam for cheaper."
26142,Awesome game to play on your own or even better with a friend. Devs thought of everything and made the game perfect. 100% worth the price
26143,"The developers have, without prior notice or even an announcement, dropped Linux support for this game. And that after [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006172141/http://www.nobrakesgames.com/human/]claiming on their website[/url] at the time:
[quote][b]I have a Mac/Linux, can I play?[/b]
Mac and Linux versions are available and are first-class citizens![/quote]
(At the time of writing this review, the [url=http://www.nobrakesgames.com/company/]company page[/url] even wrongly states that there still is Linux support.)

So how do us Linux gamers have to find out? Get a cryptic ""incompatible versions"" error when trying to play with friends, and having to go to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/477160/discussions/0/1735468693704602016/]the game's Steam forum[/url] to find a half-hearted response from the developer. I mean... what is ""we appreciate the frustration"" even supposed to mean?

Why this is a big issue? Because some of us want to support developers that put in the effort to make and update games that run natively on Linux. Heck, I bought the game for multiple people! To deceive Linux gamers by claiming they're ""first-class citizens"" and then go back on that very clear promise, in favor of other things such as console support (yuck) is a pretty big punch to the face. I've tried contacting both the publisher and developer, outlining this issue and asking for a refund, but I haven't even received a response in a month."
26144,"I'm in the difficult position right now of having to be very blunt about a game that, to tell the truth, I still enjoy playing.  But here goes.

I purchased the game early on, without knowing much about what it was, to support linux gaming!  I have friends who game exclusively on linux, and I look forward to being able to do the same myself some day (though currently I maintain a windows gaming rig).  Not only did they support linux, but they advertised the mac and linux versions as ""first-class citizens""!

Several months ago they dropped linux support, though.  They have some excuses about being a small dev team and it being too much trouble...  and it's sad to see such lazy priorities from an indie developer I had respected, but they could have made things right by proactively offering refunds to people who had purchased the game for the linux support.  I would not have gotten the refund myself, but I have friends who need it.  As it stands though, my friends have been denied any attempt to get refunds, and ignored when they contacted the developer.  They have been, for all intents and purposes, defrauded.

I have seen excuses floating around like, linux users can still play, just not the latest version... however this is a game that shines as a co-op game.  People who purchased the game specifically to play with friends, now cannot, and obviously convincing the 90% on still-supported platforms to downgrade their game version is a non-starter.  I don't know if the developer has endorsed this as an excuse or explained why linux users should not deserve refunds...  based on the way they are ignoring my friends, it seems that their attitude is simply that they already have the money and it's not their problem.

I will be honest: the game is fun.  But given the situation, it does not deserve me going into detail about that.  It really only shines in multiplayer, and the developer cannot be trusted to concern themselves with whether you can actually play with your friends.  If you only use windows and don't care about friends on other platforms, this might not affect you.  If you play on mac, you should operate on the assumption that you might be next.  Either way, they have shown that they are willing to leave paying customers behind, and they will not do anything to offer refunds or make things right.  If the game hadn't originally supported linux, it never would have made it onto my radar...  but I could still forgive the change in supported platforms if they extended affected customers a chance at refunds.  They did not.  I'd be lying if I said this isn't a fun game to play with your friends, but you are entirely at the developer's mercy when it comes to still being able to play with your friends next month, and you can expect no compensation if things change again."
26145,"Pretty frenchy, would reccomend, 7.68/10 fries"
26146,ragdoll yes
26147,"They have dropped Linux support, so I can no longer get updates.

I paid for their game, and they stopped supporting me.

I am very disappointed."
26148,No Workshop.
26149,"Fun, Funny... would be good with more friends that play it."
26150,.
26151,"Very fun game to play if your friends also have it. Playing alone might be your thing, but personally I think playing this game with friends is way more fun.
"
26152,This game is cool in its own ways and even better to play with friends :D
26153,"This game is great, especially with friends. there are a few bugs that need fixing such as mouse and keyboard not working alongside a friend using a controller. Other than these miner bugs this game is awesome. You can play the game properly or you can find your way around it (which is what i enjoy doing) Great for the price, especially if you wanna play with a friennd."
26154,"[h1]Most fun I've had playing (couch) co-op with a friend since Portal 2.[/h1]

This game is like a mix between Gang Beast gameplay and physics-based puzzles.
There are surprisingly few bugs and the puzzles have just the right difficulty.

The enjoyment comes from the funny controls, physics, creative puzzle solving (and cheesing some) ... and playing with at least one friend!

Downsides are: 
Once you know a puzzle, there's little interest in doing it again. 
The early stages seem eerily quiet with zero background noises or music to accompany the gameplay."
26155,"absolute piece of trash, I dont understand why so many people enjoy playing this"
26156,Funny game
26157,"Awesome game, no friends not that much fun, with friends 69 tons of fun"
26158,it's good
26159,removed linux support :(
26160,Great game! Can't wait to try the new update
26161,it's ok
26162,"Game has the potential to end any healthy relationship, 9/10 would not recommend playing with a partner. Alone however, challenging and frustrating at times but fun nontheless"
26163,I LOVE THIS GAME
26164,hayatımda gördüğüm en iğrenç en leş en kötü oyun allah kimseyi bunu oynamak zorunda bırakmasın
26165,amazing fun! Fully recommend. It's lol non stop. really cool to play with friends. It's worth every penny.
26166,Weird character. Just cannot stop playing. Thxs to my frd saving me several times beside the cliff. 毫无感情的爬墙机器
26167,"This game is hilarious. Most fun with a good friend. Really interesting was the fact that we could´nt talk to each other. That made it even funnier than expected.
Highly recommended."
26168,a really fun game to play with friends
26169,Loss of Motor Functions Simulator. Would play again
26170,"Very fun to play with friends, but half the maps are quite small, so you'll get them done pretty fast, but still, this is a pretty good game."
26171,"It's a great game but it would be way much better with multiplayer workshop stuff 
"
26172,"Linux support has been silently dropped, so I guess no more updates for me."
26173,really good game pretty fun the workshop is great reccomend to play with friends 7/10
26174,"Seen Kotton playing this, and died laughing. So I bought it for me and my friend."
26175,That game very nice.
26176,10\10
26177,The most entertaining game on steam
26178,"Game is very good, recommended.
"
26179,"Good few hours of fun with friends, can't wait for new levels to be introduced or a workshop to be added!"
26180,Fun.
26181,"My 11 year old boy got this game to wrestle around with what he calls his ""boyfriend"" on the game.He seems to enjoy the game a little too much,I come in his room every once in a while to him spazzing out on the floor.Overall its a nice piece of ass"
26182,"A great and adorable game, hours of fun wether you're exploring alone or messing around with friends"
26183,1 word: GOOFY
26184,"Had a great experience with this game. The potential for frustration, hilarious mistakes, and ridiculous partners are extremely high which all lead to great memories and a fun time. The game was fantastic. 10/10"
26185,good game!! fun to play with friends make more maps ples!!
26186,"Interesting game, but on Linux it crashes after few minutes of play. Would only recommend for windows machines :("
26187,"If you like playing games with your friends , thats awsome game for play and for extra good stroy in game . 
I hope they upload new level :)"
26188,"+Soundtrack
+Chill out
+Fun with friends

-Camera is somethimes weir

Still i can recommend this game. :)"
26189,"I get it.  It's a game that makes light of the terrible physics that some developers make, aka Goat Simulator.  However, I'm a strong believer in if you don't have play control, you are merely watching a bad interactive film.  Regardless, the game is a fun game.  Plenty of challenges, humorous physics, etc etc.

The game does have bugs.  Client freezes at times.  Random crashes.  This is going to vary based on the hardware one uses.  (This verified on different operating systems and computer platforms as well).  So your mileage may vary.

However, the developers made the choice after selling a Linux version to completely drop that support in the Store.  It no longer lists a Linux version.  Game developer or not, that is a terrible business practice.  This is the first company to pull such a stunt as Trendy Entertainment has done similar.  So the bottom line is, ignore this review if you use Windows or MacOS.  I can't give it a good rating. More importantly, I certainly will not purchase any more of this developer's games.  No hard feelings, but I can't support efforts like this."
26190,"Hours of enjoyment and giggles. Could do with a custom map maker though, replaying the puzzles is kinda boring."
26191,very fun physics game to play and gameplay is good too
26192,keep crashing when i play it due to my pc being old but it's a good game
26193,Pretty fun ！
26194,"ok was playing it for a solid week so i know what the characters are supposed to feel like, but all of a sudden they feel allot more topply and less stable has anyone got any news if the devs updated the physics engine because if so it feels crap and they should return back to the previous. if not then i dont know


btw brilliant game"
26195,THIS GAME NEEDS WORKSHOP MAPS PLS DEVELOPERS
26196,Bruh sound effect #3
26197,"Man, This game is more epicer than epic games' game called fortnite so this gets 10/10. Graphics are muah aka high quality and it's pretty fun."
26198,Recommended.
26199,"Love the physics and game mechanics, i've had a ton of fun with my friends playing it. Would recommend"
26200,Terbaikkk
26201,This game is hilarious. Best played with friends with a sense of humor.
26202,"The only game that physically hurts me. Can't stop laughing when playing with friends. Can't breathe and then your abs just hurt from giggling way too much. 

"
26203,"This game is fun, if you have couple of friends and it is on sale, GRAB IT!!! You won't regret it.

UPDATE: 

As of 2019 2nd April, this game has finally workshop which makes this a GREAT game once again! If you still haven't bought it go grab it! The game is often on sale and now it's a must!!! Even if it's not on sale I suggest you buy it, and make your friends get it, you will have a great time playing trough all the custom levels with your friends!

RECOMMENDED!


OLD:

This is another sad story of a game being deserted by the devs, we waited for a new map and been begging for workshop map support since early 2018 (That is when I bought it)
Since then we got ONE new map on halloween / new year 2018, not sure when exactly it came out kinda missed it.

Long story short, they been adding skins, and other useless things to make the game look alive, and keep the game selling.

So far it does not seem that they are planning to make any large changes for this game, i believe they are working on part 2 which might have workshop map support and more maps. So just wait for a sale."
26204,"Really good game, especially for 2-3 players coop! I wish there were more levels!!"
26205,its so good  i play it and laugh every time and thanks for making such a good no brakes games
26206,Awesome game. 10/10 fun times with a mate.
26207,"This game is hilarious, but overall very amusing/fun to play. 10/10"
26208,This game is so much fun but the devs keep adding new bobs NEW BOBS? What do we need bobs for ? Jesus just all work on workshop or new maps
26209,"Hi !

I put a red thumb here not to ""bash"" the game (who have a lot of good reviews) but to make a warning visible for players that might be a little like me.

I've beat the game once (plus the nice free DLC that as a better ""ending feel"" IMO compared to the last level) and I enjoyed it for the most part ... but I might not replay it for success or whatever.

I mean, this game is really fun to be played with friends ... yes ... [b]WITH FRIENDS ![/b]

The goofiness of the character is real fun when you're messing with you're friends and trying to put them of map ...

... but this is also a puzzle game and it can be a real pain when you're alone and making like 40 attempt to put a damn log under a damn rock !

To say it in another way, it can be really frustrating IMO when you need 30 seconds to understand what to do but need 30 minutes to manage to do it !

I know it come a lot from myself. I'm more confortable with understanding puzzles that doing agility tricks (it always bugged me) !
But I really wanna warn you about this ... in case you got the same kind of ""skills"" as I do (or more like an absence of skills I might say >.<).

[u]Then, a personnal list of pros and cons :[/u]

[u]Pros :[/u]

[list]
[*]Fun with friends.
[*]Beautiful most of the time.
[*]Lot of options for personalised character.
[*]Nice free DLC level.
[/list]

[u]Cons :[/u]

[list]
[*]Might be really frustrating on you're own (for reason said before).
[*]Some assets have an ""unfinished"" feel IMO.
[/list]

Lot of people seems to think this game might reach a whole new level with customs maps and other workshop possibilties, I can't argue with that, please make it happen !

Tanks for reading,
Leliot."
26210,"Would be nice to have friends, this game is so funny"
26211,"After They Added a Workshop Support, It Deserves a Good Review."
26212,"My friends and I bought this game planning to play it together. But as we all got into the same lobby, all non-host players were met with an awful surprise. A 2+ second delay on input, making tasks previously difficult near impossible. We struggled to complete the first real level, until the host simply finished it by themselves. Due to what I presume is poorly implemented netcode, this game clearly designed for multiplayer is best played alone. For this reason, I do not recommend purchasing."
26213,Great game but limited replay value as map pack is small. Once they open this up for workshop maps it will be amazing! Until they do it gets uninstalled.
26214,fun game but you might want to do it with friends
26215,"Great with friends, if I was forced to choose a game to play with my friends I would choose this."
26216,flippity floppity get of my property
26217,"The game is simple and fun, even more fun with friends. Sadly that fun runs out after the first couple of hours."
26218,good game
26219,"Ebic
"
26220,Much fun! =)
26221,enhale the memes exhale the memes
26222,very good graphics. puzzles are very nice. and feels good to keep doing the levels over and over again. there are also other ways to complete every puzzle in the game.
26223,good game
26224,Greatest game of all time
26225,if you dont have any boyfriend /girlfriend..play this game...
26226,"Buy this game now! It's actually called drunk babies FYI.



What are you waiting for?!? Get it now!"
26227,its better then i thought it would be
26228,goofy good time
26229,"If you like controlling avatars that are drunk while trying to solve puzzles then this game is for you.  Frankly, after about the an hour, this game became boring as hell. Sorry, but the game fell FLAT for me."
26230,"One of the biggest disappointments I've ever kept... its slow and tedious, and really I just didnt enjoy it much. It was fun at first but theres so many other things Id rather do than spend so much time wandering aimlessly trying to find the path or method to get to the next level."
26231,"EH its average, nothing special

5/10"
26232,"The physics are hilarious and half realistic. The game is really fun with friends, though it can be frustrating if the physics break for everyone."
26233,"10/10 would kill my friend again.
Wish they would bring new levels more frequently tho."
26234,Great game extremely fun but needs a workshop so we can create our own maps
26235,great fun
26236,well its best game for fun and make you happy :D
26237,This is the best throw-your-friend-off-of-the-edge-of-the-map-and-listen-to-their-cries-of-anger-and-laugh simulator ever created!
26238,Really fun game to play with friends! Just feel like this game would be so much better with a system that allows people to make their own maps and post them public. Or else just have constant updates of new maps! Feel there just isn't enough to do! ITS FUN I JUST WANT MOREEEEEEE! Pretty much beat all the levels once and now im done. Add more levels or make community map builder kind of system pleaseeee then this be such a good game!
26239,"Very good and fun game for single, coop or multiplayer"
26240,This game is absolutley fantastic! So fun to play with friends but... like everyone else has already mentioned.... add a workshop so we can build our own levels because as amazing as the game is its far too short.
26241,amazing game :D
26242,Game is very good and very affected
26243,This is game is 48 in chinese rmb but 99 in hong kong. This sucks. 48 rmb is 56 hk
26244,"Very fun with friends, entertaining for some time, the puzzles are decent, and the physics make the game.
The downfall would be how fast the levels can be completed, and how slow the workshop is taking to be open to the public.
Worth buying on sale, I've dumped 15+ hours into this game- so that's... something."
26245,"Amazing game. Needs a workshop though.

Edit: It now has workshop. The one problem this game had is now sorted. Grand aul job."
26246,"It's a really fun puzzle game to play with friends or your significant other. I was laughing non-stop--too much that it made me feel like I was going crazy. The only problem I had was that the camera movement makes it difficult for me to play for a long time.  Everytime you need your character to do something, the camera shifts making me feel motion sickness."
26247,Fun jelly physics puzzle game.
26248,"I liked the game a lot, I really did. [strike] But I cannot recommend this game until workshop is introduced. [/strike]

[b] YAY WORKSHOP!!! [/b]"
26249,"I really think this is a great game to play with a few friends but we need more maps. You could just let the steam workshop help you to make them, it would be a game at least twice as good as it is now."
26250,"Great game, my two sons (3 and 6) love playing split-screen co-op... until they start yelling at each other for messing up."
26251,Best Game also see octodaddy.
26252,good gam
26253,The game is great however i finished it in 5 hours with just 1 friend. Its sad that this game has no official workshop and even with the beta acces key which you can get from unoficial group the workshop is not working properly. I wish that the developers add more maps and do official workshop. Overall it was a great but short experience.
26254,Funny!
26255,"the mountain is as difficult as calculus, it didn't give me any happiness. however, it made me angry!"
26256,"I've played like 6 hours and finished the game. It starts of really funny but very quickly your tasks become tedious and drawn out. Lacks content. More fun with friends. It's okay, if there was an inbetween for yes or no I would give it that.

Edit: Now it has workshop the content is infinite. Thus making it a positive! However the base game itself does have its criticisms."
26257,"Excellent puzzle/physics game to play with your friends. It's way less fun if you go at it alone so I suggest to have at least one friend with you.

Each level is a snadbox and you can approach solving puzzles in a variety of ways. You can even ""cheat"" and bypass whole sections of the map if you so choose. While that might come handy in a speed run I would suggest that you try at least one ""full"" run of each level to get the full experience.

What makes this game so much fun are 3 main things: physics, your character movement and the quirky controls. Together they create a unique experience that no other physics/platforming game has (that I know of at least). The more you play and experiment with those 3 main pillars of the game, the more fun you'll get out of it."
26258,best game eva.
26259,Nearly pissed myself from laughing. Hopefully there are more maps on the way
26260,"good times, played with these two guys online, we finish a whole stage on ""castle"" map.
the only problem that i hate in online is the lag, especially when doing a jump

11/10 would carry a person with my own two hands again"
26261,"Haha sofa go through the window



This is the funniest game i have ever played with my friends"
26262,special and unique~
26263,you play as a rag doll and it's encouraged to brake the game and the open end  puzzles make it that much funner to play
26264,"Well I think this game is great, I love the puzzle solving and character customization that the game offers. The only thing I don't like is that there isn't a friends only/ private servers option on the screen that shows who's currently hosting a server. I only say this because it's rather annoying trying to play with some random people online, only to be kicked by those who are playing with their friends and don't know that there's an invite only option. I would say these people are dumb but to be fair most are probably just kids or to lazy to check the options.
So yeah great game, there just needs to be a clearer option for those who'd rather play with people they know."
26265,So i bought this and expected to maybe get a few hours of fun and then get bored but me and my friend loved it! best 5 hours ive had in a while
26266,JUST NEEDS WORKSHOP TO BECOME PERFECT!
26267,"Have nothing to say about this game more than alot of hopes and no fucking joy, first u get no real option to split screen but some random key to press :S Once u figure that out and u manage to get ur friend in using a controller ur keyboard and mouse shuts down. GG refund plz..."
26268,decent game
26269,help
26270,Fun :D

26272,"Gathered about six people, played for about 5 hours, best time ever! 

All this game needs is a workshop, let us make the maps and it will entertain us for much longer! 
-All the more reason to buy this game
-Becomes streamable
"
26273,i love the jiggly psychics
26274,It's a fun game with friends
26275,"Really fun with friends. Perfect for just goofing around.
Maps are nice to explore. There are usually multiple ways to proceed. Puzzles are generally not tough to figure out, but you can always mess up the implementation with your wobbly dude (which is half the fun anyway).
Bob (the rag doll) is adorable.

We once spent 40 minutes hanging from the bottom of the map trying to gain height by swinging and climbing on each other. Didn't work out at all :D
Each session ended with us trying to throw each other out from the lobby platform for like half an hour."
26276,"Really great game if you like puzzle games, fun to enjoy all the maps over and over again. Just wish there were more maps to play on."
26277,"Good with friends, but the early levels feel very empty and boring, it takes quite a long while to get anywhere that feels even remotely non-linear or non-handholding. 

It's tedious, and the amount of time spent to get to the enjoyable bits was less than pleasing for my friends and I. I wish I could give this a *maybe* review, as the fact that it's really linear makes it feel a lot more empty than I would like.

Pick it up on sale."
26278,I laughed my ass off in the 1st 2 minutes. worth every penny. Devs care greatly and updates are regular.
26279,I love this game. except when my friends yell at me...
26280,Received game as  a gift from a friend and it's really fun
26281,Yes
26282,"I've only put in about an hour and a half so far, but I absolutely love it! It's so goofy you can't help but laugh when you biff something trying to solve a puzzle. Makes it even funnier when there are lots of people trying to solve and failing miserably."
26283,Great co-op game.
26284,This is my favorite game so far! Very dumb and entertaining game
26285,Must try pure fun !!!!
26286,Very nice
26287,Funny
26288,pmsl. thats enough said
26289,i gave janey the ol yoink and yeet for aboot 3 hours. first you yoink her by the bum then you yeet her like shes scum.
26290,"great game, although my its annoying when your friends just grab you and the ground and wont let go for the next 20 mins"
26291,Yes please.
26292,"It's a cute puzzle game and I could see this being really fun with a friend.  The mechanics of movement are novel, but the wonkiness of the movement starts to grate on me after a while.  The graphics are really nice.  Grab it on sale & give it a try.  If the movement doesn't aggravate you, you'll might dig it."
26293,How i describe this game: humans fall flat.
26294,New Maps Workshop Content!
26295,haha flat fall
26296,AYYYYYY
26297,"I would rate this game average.
The game physics, mechanics are pretty fucking awesome, as well as the graphics, pretty nice style, changes alot from an usual game, although.. if you want to spend more then 1 freaking hour searching for a server to play on, then good luck, or you get kicked once you found one, or you have alot of lag, or else there isn't any server at all..
Pretty dead game to be honest, it's really too bad.
If you want to play this game i recommend you have friends with who to play it, or else you get bored pretty quickly once you finished the game and seen all there was to see.
I would rate 8.5/10 for the game in question, and for the community and servers, etc, etc i would give a solid freaking 0.1/10."
26298,.
26299,"Bretty good
Hope they make more levels in the future"
26300,"Nice and funny game,especially if you play it with friends.
Update: They finally added workshop."
26301,hahah funny game!! can't wait for the workshop update then it would be even mor fun haha!!!! :D
26302,+1
26303,if we can create maps by ourself ，it would be very good you know，so workshops and map creation kit plz.
26304,"Amazing game, with friends! I, a test dummy cop on a holiday, along with SI, a chicken with a helmet, used our magical spiderman abilities to shimmishammy around the map, and hardly ended up actually solving a puzzle! A lot of great laughs along the way"
26305,Amazingly fun :)
26306,一个很棒的合作游戏，建议高强度更新
26307,shit game
26308,spent 2 hours throwing friends off the map very nice
26309,VERY FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS.
26310,I think this game is over rated. It is fun at first then I realise this game just not for me
26311,Can't open this game on Mac os
26312,"This game is amazing. Played this on local co-op with my girlfriend, and it's honestly the most I've laughed while playing a video game. We had so many weird side-projects and off-the-road adventures. I love how the levels are designed with shortcuts, dead ends, and pointless detours. I really do - because it's hilarious when you fail, and it's only matched by the sense of discovery and accomplishment you feel when you succeed. The times when we spent like a whole season arc on some crazy adventure that brought us right back we started are just as story-worthy as the times we had stupid terrible ideas that ACTUALLY WORKED... and we had those often. In fact, this game had us going ""hoooly shit, you can DO that?? that's awesome"" like every two minutes.

Also, I think it's really cool that the devs continue to add free levels every few months. They have my respect."
26313,"Great coop fun, and seeing as workshop is now public (thats if you find a level that is an actual level and not some weabo paradise) it adds alot of play time with some friends"
26314,Goofy blobs with a knack for puzzle solving is a great way to spend time with your buds. Recommended for the weird and fun!
26315,"I bought this game to play in couch co-op mode and it sucks. This is not a co-op. It's a single player game with two players. You could finish the game by yourself, there's no cooperation between two players.
Although, 1 player mode is great - I wouldn't recommend this game to someone looking for co-op game."
26316,This is incredible! I honestly really love this game
26317,"Very Groovy Game to Play with the Lads

you heard it on therigbystream first
"
26318,yes
26319,very good
26320,"ИГРА ХУЕТА, МЕНЯ ЕБНУЛ БАНДЕРА"
26321,"I think its time I finally review this amazing game.
One of the best soundtracks ever made for a game.
All that needs to be said.
15/10"
26322,"Great fun. Abit short, and needs a workshop function."
26323,again only fun with friends
26324,Its a great game the only downside is that its never updated.
26325,They just dropped Linux/SteamOS support for no sane reason. It's build on Unity for Christ sake. No more buying games from these clowns.
26326,Good leisure game to play with your friends!
26327,Great game. Fun times. Friends recommended. Little bit too short.
26328,"As long as the devs continue to support the game as a whole, I do not mind a lack of workshop. The update/patch/free dlc frequency is amazing. I don't even play it much anymore, but not because it's a bad game. Different preferences. Very creative play. My kid loves it.

As the negative reviews drop the average rating over the workshop feature understand the devs continue to provide content, updates, and fixes."
26329,"I really had a blast with this game, playing it with other friends and laughing because of the silly and goofy mechanics. I thought the game would be a bit more longer, but I still enjoyed it and I'm willing to play some more in the future. The graphics are neat, clean, and simple so if you're looking for a funny game to spend time with your friends, this game right here is definitely a good choice."

I don't like you T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once

[Verse 1]
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea (Uh)
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you India you lose, so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you
We're gonna be completely fuckin' done
'Cause we only just begun
I review you, *clap clap* zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna

[Chorus]
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series just wet themself in their pajama

[Verse 2]
So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
I'm a blue eyes white dragon while you're just dark magician (Oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation, but
I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (Oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it come from a mumble rap community
No Papa, no Papa, yes Papa; Johny
Now down all of the sugar and let's throw this fuckin' party with some—

[Chorus]
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series they just wet in their pajama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna

[Refrain]
You got a population of one point three-two billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
"
26331,"Fun game! Worth the price on sale, otherwise you might want to wait since the game is pretty short."
26332,Workshop plz
26333,Im recommending it
26334,workshop!!! есть можно и поесть
26335,shits insane
26336,"Happy Lunar New Year 2019! Thanks,Thanks all."
26337,Great Enjoyment for a group of friends to just goof around.
26338,good
26339,best game on steam it very good
26340,"Most fun I've had playing a game since I first got a WII. Honestly get some friends together and play this game, hours upon hours of fun"
26341,FUN
26342,"never before was there a better game to play with the dudes

many men died to bring you this review"
26343,"10/10 With your fellow amigos

Either have a blast and mess around in levels or ruin their day by clinging to their head and tossing them off the galaxy.
It's an amazing game"
26344,"Such a fun game, spent a month playing it, really nice way to spend time with your friends, and, you can find achievements everywhere in this game, loved it, wishing for some more free levels"
26345,Best physics and mechanics with Fun puzzle based game  . Character movement of this game is sexy .
26346,this game would be compleate with workshop :D
26347,"Great fun with friends, too many laughs to count, messing around WILL HAPPEN! 

I would recommend on sale, $15 is a lot for probable 7-10 hours. 

That is until they add mod support or custom map building. 

7/10 price
10/10 fun
7/10 time"
26348,"fun game, one of my favorite coop puzzle game"
26349,"interesting game!
have fun with your friends!"
26350,"Very frustrating, yet fun. Using real world physics as a game was a pretty unique idea. I hope there will be even more levels in the future. Finishing the game in 24 hours is a little bit...fast(?). At least there are lots of achievements you can get. Well done!"
26351,"not my type of game, but still good"
26352,"انها لعبة جيدة وممتعة ولذيذة هههههههههههه
"
26353,Simulator of cripple
26354,"A unique and fun game that's as equally rewarding as it is frustrating. If playing it, it's much more fun with a few friends. Totally non serious game that can frustrate a little but more often than not will just make you laugh"
26355,"Not enough fun levels, nothing's changed in like a year"
26356,"Human: Fall Flat is one of the best coop games I've ever had the pleasure of playing with my buddies.
Each map with it's very own individual theme seems to be telling a different story while you are progressing through the game.
Similar to games like Magicka or Viscera, this game gives you a cool sandbox feeling where you can troll around with your friends while desperately trying to get your  shit  together and solve the game's physics puzzles but takes it a whole stop further with the ability of being able to constantly discover new things and places solely driven by your own curiosity.

But for the sake of everyone, just release that workshop update finally, we have been waiting for over one year and the game only sticks with you during the first playthrough!"
26357,"POSTED: JANUARY 3
Sonic 3D Blast, also known as Sonic 3D Flickies' Island in Europe, is isometric take on a mix of Sonic platforming, serving as a spinoff to the franchise, and Flicky collecting'n'leading hot action. It was developed by Travellers Tales and Sonic Team, former doing main programmer job while latter came with game design ideas and some more. Well, they did want Sonic 3 to be isometric to begin with. Also riding on whole pre-rendered trend that went hip with Donkey Kong Country. Published by Sega in 1996 in the West only. 32 Megabit ROM, the biggest that Sega Genesis can see at a single time.
There also were Saturn and PC versions, made near the end of development of this supposed “Genesis swan song”, replacing the cancelled Sonic X-Treme. Saturn had improved graphics, redbook soundtrack, different actual 3D special stages, analog input. It's technically the best version. PC version was similar but lacked few graphics and had 2D parody of special stages, yet had autosave feature.
Sonic Blast on Game Gear is a different game despite fitting in marketing-wise.

The game that you have here is nothing more than emulation of Sega Genesis version.

I don't usually talk about mods, but Director's Cut exists and it was made by game's main programmer so it's sorta semi-official. None the less, back to what Sega gives us there.


Now, technical part about Sega's emulation here:
The Sega Classic games that you purchase on Steam count as DLCs for ""Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics"" game that should appear in your library.
It has Bedroom HUB which is the one with many features yet lags for many and Simply Launcher which lacks Workshop and Online but at least it works just fine for everybody.
However, Simple Launcher has it's fair share of glitches as well. It can crash. And it does the second time you go to main menu, so always quit after saving there so it doesn't crash when you want to save next time!
Emulation itself, mostly sound, isn't that good but it does it's job. Also, yes, emulator supports quick saves.
As alternative, you can use external emulator to run games that you purchased. Sega kindly placed in all games that you purchased in ""uncompressed ROMs"" folder that program itself doesn't use, just change file extension to "".bin"" or so. The file for this one being ""SONIC3D_UE.68K"".
I also demand you to read digital manual of this game first. You can find it here on store page or go to ""manuals"" folder of game root and open ""S3DB_MG_EFIGS_US.pdf"".


Robotnik has discovered that Flickies on Flickies's Island can actually travel between dimensions by using huge rings. So he trapped them all in Badnik robots to search for Chaos Emeralds. These robots aren't any different, no dimension travel there. Sonic is back here and ready to save em all while his two gang members chill around.

The core gameplay keeps the Sonic formula going. You can run around and you can jump. Seeing how it's isometric it has a separate button that you can roll with. Or spindash if standing still. You still defeating enemies by either jumping or rolling. Albeit using slopes by rolling doesn't play a big role here at all, these are weak slopes. The controls have some inertia to it, pleasently. Too bad Sonic can't immediately turn 180 degrees around, he does a small circle. Still uses rings health system where as long as you have any rings you will survive a hit but then you have to recover all the scattered rings.
It's a rather forgiving pleasant take on isometric style. You can run in all 8 directions. It hides nothing important behind walls. There are shadows for everything. The floor always has checkered tiles so you can measure, borders are clearly defined. While Sonic is a bit too fast, the game doesn't require much precision platforming. Well, there are few but you can cheese most of them by using nearby spring pad or so. The levels are varied as well, some having sorta puzzle elements. Spinning pads are great on the second zone.
Protip: You can break ice spikes in Diamond Dust by rolling into them.

Powerups are back through breakable monitors. Invincibility, extra life, speed up, so on. By the way, Sonic icons that aren't in monitors aren't extra lives by medals. Collect 10 of them and you will get a continue. There are shields, each giving you extra hit against normal stuff. Blue one is immune electricity, red shields protects from fire, golden one gives you active ability where you do 
Protip: Get a red shield in a Volcano Valley or die.
Each zone has two acts, along with a boss one. The first two acts are divided into two-three stages. And in each stage you have to save five flickies. That means there are only five badniks in a stage and most of them are static non-threats. Not too exciting. At least game somewhat makes up with stage hazards. But the game is still too easy. Then you break those robots and have to grab birds. This is where Flicky inspiration comes in. The birds will follow you in a line and they can be broken off with projectiles after which they scatter around. It worked in Flicky which was a tight 2D game where you constantly get chased by cats, you would die if they touch you and simply scatted lines of flickies if they touch those. With risk-reward applied as you got score by bringing in bigger lines and that would lead to getting extra lives in a tough game. Here? Not a tight design, it's just there. Projectiles may throw birds off but that just happens, not something you pay attention to. Collecting birds over lava is pain. There is too much space, nothing chasing you. Yea. It's just there, just making you spend a bit more time in levels and thus isn't exciting.
There is usual optional quest for 7 Chaos Emeralds. Actually, they look like Halls candies, which would explain why Sonic can't turn into Super Sonic. Super makes games too easy anyway. You do get an extra final boss and good ending however, that's good. To get an emerald you must find Tails or Knuckles first, just chilling. Both of them appear in each act, hiding or appearing somewhere in previous stage once you progress, feel free to backtrack. Last appearing in Volcano Valley. It does mean you can get two emeralds per act, one from each. You get extra life on repeat. Just give these fams 50 rings. Though they will take and store any amount so don't bump into them.
After that you get into a special stage. You run over bridge, collect rings and avoid bombs. It looks incredibly smooth, the best on Mega Drive. Albeit gameplay is a bit plain and is too easy. Still fun.

There are usual bosses. Robotnik every time. Most often you just wait for him to get down and hit him, then avoid his stuff, repeat. Varied health. Not bad but not too cool.
Protip: For Volcano Valley boss instead of trying to get into pipes first, you should curve your jump off side floor to hit Robotnik then you will be bounced backward onto pipes.

Not much options. Just sound test and controls. Bare minimum!
As for graphics. Well. They tried to do DKC thing with prerendered sprites because it was still cool, albeit 1996 was somewhat late. Which isn't the smartest thing to do on Genesis, as compared to SNES it has low amount of colors. Still, devs deserve some love for managing to create smooth vibrant world. And fitting intro FMV into Genesis cartridge is just awesome. Too bad that ending is just a bunch of images with text.
Music is great too. Chiptune goodness, the best from few composers on the project.

Overall, eh. Mixing Flicky and Sonic is a nice idea, as evidenced by game like Wiz'n'Liz, albeit that one was only somewhat Flicky. But this isometric execution of it is weak. I still wouldn't call it a bad game. Pick only if you want some chill isometric platformer."
26358,"yeet
"
26359,My p3nis is more sloppy than this game's physics.
26360,"Absolutely hilarious to play, both single and multiplayer."
26361,"A great game to play with friends, but the price point is a little high so it's a stretch to get them to buy it. Also, this game doesn't work with a trackpad. Other than that, a basically perfect game."
26362,"Very very funny 
A game to play with several people
People you know, you're going at to laugh XD"
26363,"Nice Game. Challenging when u play it alone, gets a lot easier and funnier when u play together."
26364,<3
26365,Actually the best troll game I have ever played
26366,"Human Fall flat, I love it! My friends love it! Just one of those games we continously return to for a laugh. Between the fun well designed maps and the hilarious glitches and bugs to the ridiculous painted avatars, mine being (a pirate princess!) Let your imagination run wild with the avatar creation, it adds to the amusement of this game which contious to be a joy.
The game controls are easy to master just what you need in order to grab ledges and objects, or swinging to your death, you often end up grabbing a friends leg or hand by mistake and pull them over the ledge with you or perhaps test our your contortion skills! This can also result in an infinate loop of falling.... Or you can just smash things, the choice is yours!

Overall very enjoyable, I await too see what other content is released. (Many nights spent howling with laughter.)"
26367,it good
26368,X
26369,Fun when playing with friends
26370,so tired
26371,"no matter how interesting this game is, i cant play with my firends online at all!!
It's so laggy that made me felt dizzy.For this game i bought the Global Accelerator and still didnt work.
For same price,i prefer several packages of chips to this one-time game."
26372,multiplayer workshop yay (ree)
26373,Really good game to goof off with your friends but if you or your friends are serios about finishing a game dont buy it because no matter what there is always a friend in the game that LOVES to goof off.(me)
26374,"A ton of fun to play with friends, almost broke my lungs laughing tbh... I played through once to mess around and get through each level, a second time to acquire all of the achievements, and a third time to complete the game as fast as possible...definitely not world record that's for sure. 
The mechanics are just perfect and absolutely hysterical. The maps aren't made to perfection whatsoever, but that allows for many ways to mess around and find stupid ways to do things and that's part of the most fun. If you've got a friend to co-op this with,  100% pick up this game and give it a run.
Not to mention the player customization....I made a watermelon man, 'nuff said. Those....31.4 hours of playing was worth it."
26375,"I haven't played this in a while with friends, but I highly recommend this game. It's so much fun to play with friends, it can be enjoyable alone but much better with friends. Also WHERE THE FUCK IS THE WORKSHOP FOR THIS GAME!!!"
26376,A great and funny game to play with your friends or with your family.
26377,You can do so much crap and even for adults a must have!
26378,"This game is great fun, even just playing by yourself. Once you master the controls and figure out the puzzles in each world, then you can replay them and see how quickly you can move through each world. The controls didn't feel like they were working against me either, as some might assume.

The online multiplayer was fun as well, once you kick all of the people who just want to throw you off of a cliff.

We need a public steam workshop and more levels to explore! Huge thank you to the devs for an amazing game despite this, though!"
26379,You can throw both yourself and you're friend off a ledge committing play-dough man suicide. 10/10 would die again
26380,"This game is very fun to play if you have friends. Luckily, I have friends."
26381,the game is funny and good
26382,"very intuitve game, fun, more fun with friends. throw them off a cliff. its fun
"
26383,This game is too funny
26384,"Stupid fun game to play with friends. However, do not spend long periods of time on this as it may lead to nausea and headaches."
26385,"funny game, makes you want to kill your friends even more than yourself"
26386,"Awesome game to play with friends, lacking a workshop. 

If a workshop is added this game would have endless options, lots of fun."
26387,"fun puzzle game with more than 1 exit...definitely more fun with friends as you can either help or troll.

there is a bit of thinking involved so not recommended for people who are action puzzle types only. theres no timer, no health, just you and your friends.

from what i understand, each level can be completed solo so theres always a way out without help. 

for a puzzle game 8/10 - character customization is bonus too"
26388,grab a friend or two and don't never let go.
26389,"human fall flat has puzzles that lend themselves well to the weird physics. One of the things that I wanted when I bought this game was a workshop and that was added! A lot of the puzzles in this game are able to be cheesed which is a good thing in my opinion. (Im not great at puzzles,)"
26390,"Great game, some of the most fun I've ever had in a Co-op experience.    The shennagins you can cause with your mates whilst enjoying the game are endless."
26391,yes
26392,this game makes you feel like a human
26393,its nut
26394,"This game is awesome! fun to play and even better with a friend, my only problem with this game is how short it is, it is very short I think it would be better if you could create your own level and view other peoples created levels, something like that, overall I give this game a 9.8/10"
26395,"its fun for 10 houres but next of that you played evry level and than its a SHITY GAME
"
26396,Really fun. You need to try it man.
26397,"extremly fun with friends, if you can get 2 or more friends to get the game with you i can garentee youll have a great time"
26398,"I would definetly reccomend becuase it is a great game to play with your frineds. I asure you will laugh like never before. But dont buy if you just want to play it alone and do achievemnts and speedruns.

The game still has a low amount of maps so I would dereccomend you if dont like games like Uncharted. It is shorter than Uncharted but it is a lot of fun."
26399,"Really fun game overall. The controls are just right (not too hard, but not too simple). Would totally recommend for anyone that is interested in puzzle games with silly physics. It's even better with a controller and if you have a couple friends to play with."
26400,Pretty nice Co-op game!
26401,Love it! I wish there were more maps!!! DLC!!!!
26402,"8 player coop. hilarious doughy physics. endless laughs. you can plaster your face on your dude.

give us workshop pls."
26403,"great game, needs workshop tho"
26404,"Awesome game, but honestly the replayability can go down VERY quickly. None of my friends wish to continue playing with me because of the lack of content. There are very few levels. This game could be easily immortalized with one VERY simple addition.

THE STEAM WORKSHOP

If this game has Steam Workshop integration and player created maps, it would end up being one of those games I end up throwing on my taskbar. Because it is a seriously hilarious game, it just gets kinda old with how few levels there are, and how long it takes for new ones to come out.

STEAM WORKSHOP PLEASE."
26405,10/10 So funny idk how they made it just more players = for stuip and funny things BYE
26406,"Pretty Decent Game, have had tons of laugh's with friends. I'd saying it's definately worth your money, even if you own something like Gang beasts already"
26407,"10/10, would accidentally choke my girlfriend while trying to push a button again."
26408,Linux support dropped
26409,"good
"
26410,Overall a pretty chill game to play with friends.
26411,"The new update needs to be on ps4
"
26412,its very fun trying to find different way to finish a level or finish it very fast climbing is awsome too i recommend
26413,"It's like QWOP grew a GPU. The Pillsbury Doughboy got his own game! It's very hands-on. This game is a trip. If video-games inspire violence, this is the kind of game that will soon have your kids rolling their infant siblings down the stairs. You've been a terrific audience, really; I'll be here all week."
26414,"The game is REALLY fun, however there should be a easier way to play community maps. The amount of levels can be completed in ~2-3 hours. Other than that, this game is great."
26415,"Very nice game, had a blast playing it with my friends. Altho it needs more maps/workshop."
26416,"I've copy pasted this from another review because it says exactly what I want to say:
""The game content is generally alright, however, they stopped supporting GNU/Linux (without prior notice!), which makes it impossible for me to play with friends. I find this move a complete betrayal of my trust and support, and would honestly rather get a refund than support a dev/publisher that thinks this move is an option, especially when they build on an existing Linux friendly engine - Unity."""
26417,"Great game to mess around in with friends, I loved every second of it!"
26418,"the only thing i dislike with this game is the numbers of contents and levels, there are only 10 leves :(  , maybe making contents are too hard for developers , but this game have potential to have many levels , too many ! 
Anyway it is really funny specially if youre playing with you close friends , i never laughed at any game like this , it really worth to buy"
26419,"I had fun and had alot of rage trying to do the same stunt over and over again.
If you are a kind of person ( like me ) who doesnt do online multiplayers with strangers. get some friends in on this too.

The only thing i can say is bad about this game is that there isnt enough levels to play. all you can do is just repeat levels.
it needs a easy level editor that allows us to make, place, attach, and erase shapes, and more. it should even be able to let you place down vehicles like a bulldoser or a crane or even allow you to make your own while keeping the same driving format. 

all in all it is a prietty fun game."
26420,You know a game is good when the credits are fun.
26421,"This game is worth $15. The wacky physics combined with the amazing puzzles (and oddly placed dumpsters) really make for a great game. There are a few secrets, and an inumerable amount of salutions to the puzzles. It's one of the better games on Steam, and I can tell that the developers spent a long time preparing this amazing experience. The developers are (to my understanding) working on a workshop which will allow players to upload skins for their Bobs (and maybe maps)."
26422,"Very fun puzzle game. But once u beat it, going back and playing it is not fun. Needs DLC or released to the workshop."
26423,verry really nice xDDDDD
26424,Very nice game to play with friends.
26425,Good Game just need workshop
26426,"Character physics are awkward, wacky and unconventional, but I'll be honest - As a co-op player, I fail to not laugh on every single level in this game. There's always something that forces us to do stuff together and there's always something different about each puzzle. We never got stuck anywhere during the gameplay, and I truly had fun going through the game. If only I had played games like this a little bit more, it's a way to escape from stress or winning-pressure, or simply things that derives video games from being fun - the desire to win.

It makes me feel a little bit old."
26427,Super fun and I can easily play it with my 7 year old brother so thats a huge plus
26428,Controls are purposefully garbage and I can only recommend it if you're playing with friends. Lotta laughs to be had.
26429,Pretty fun.
26430,Friends required
26431,"I just started playing this game with my wife and another friend, and we have never laughed so hard in our lives!  At several points we had to just stop in the game, and get the laughing over before we could continue.  There have been multiple times where we were laughing so hard we could hardly breathe!

If you haven't already played this game, or you played it, but not with 1 or more friends, I highly encourage you to do so!  It is some of the best fun you will have in a video game!"
26432,terrible physics
26433,"I enjoyed the game, mainly because of my friends that got it too but also because it has the sensation of goofiness. Playing with my friends made it even better and we had great times, at least in my opinion, but the only thing that this game is kinda boring is the maps. There's only, what, 7 maps? Like many others have said, so shall I. We need workshop maps. Let those who are creative map makers do their thing."
26434,this is good game
26435,"played it at pax it was alright
"
26436,This Game Is a very fun game. Especially with friends because it can create some of the most fun times. I like the genre combination of a puzzle and a platformer because these types of games really make you think.
26437,"Silly. Simple. Devilishly clever. After some initial frustrations getting a handle on the physics mechanisms it's an absolute blast, especially with friends. The most fun I've had playing a co-op game in a very long time. It's hilarious and rewarding! Highly recommended!"
26438,I played this game with a severely mentally disabled friend Tom and we both had a lot of fun. I have personally never laughed more at a game in my life. top class entertainment. My friend laughed so hard he pooed in his chair. As I cleaned him up he remarked how he has never laughed so hard he had an accident. 10/10 would most certainly play again.
26439,Please buy this with a friends. I farded and shided due to laugheter as did my friend. buy with a friend
26440,Great Game to play with a friend.
26441,gve 15 at air
26442,noice
26443,"great game
"
26444,"An absolute blast of a time playing this with friends. The art style is easy on the eye, simple but to the point. The whacky controlls adds to the experiance and it's hilarious.

Never got really stuck, and the maps are a lot of fun. Can't wait for more in the future!"
26445,it fun
26446,Fun silly game to play with friends or just anyone. If you like puzzles you may like this game.  You have to figure out ways to get through the game while falling the whole way.
26447,Perfect game with WorkShop
26448,"It's fun!  It's ridiculously goofy!  It's got online coop!  I am utterly in love with Human: Fall Flat.  My only wishes would be for more levels and for it to be Steam Workshop compatible for possible player made maps.  This game is great on its own, but I like it best at the end of the night.  Playing it with friends when everyone's approaching dimwit levels of sleepy and motor skills are waning brings out the finest in this game!"
26449,very fun with friend and it has split screen
26450,"Best game to play with friends. Always hilarious, and the levels are surprisingly engaging and fun."
26451,♂♂
26452,very enjoyable fun co-op game
26453,"Played this game for the first time last night and it was one of the most enriching, rewarding, and hilarious times iv ever had in gaming. I played co-op with some buddies who had never played and then joined online lobbies with random people as well.

100% worth the buy."
26454,"Have been played with 2 friends and have much fun, but the server randomly kick us out every 1-2 hours and we must restart over, there is no checkpoint in the multiplayer game, this really sucks."
26455,would be nice to have friends
26456,"My throat is sore and I have a headache from laughing so much.

I played through this with a friend (on Linux) using local co-op (split screen) with steam controllers. It worked perfectly and was so much fun. We did it over 2 or 3 gaming nights. We spent hours on many challenges trying to do the most stupid things or sabotaging each other's attempts at problem-solving.

Hilarious!"
26457,I love this game and it concept but it make me feel dizzy and very sick. The way to control by moving screen is really not ok for me.  I hope it could change somehow and i will be back.
26458,"Was fun, got to grab my friends asses and drag them off the maps"
26459,it was cheaper than gang beasts
26460,"This has to be one of the best and most unique indie games I've played in a good while. While at first the game may seem very simple and easy, it slowly introduces new mechanics and ways to manuver around each level. I'd reccomend playing this with a friend, in either local or online. Co-Op is the best way to enjoy this game. However, this game is also extremely fun in single player mode. Along side being able to create your very own character, this is a great gem that deserves all the praise it gets. If only we had a level creator, then this game could get even better...."
26461,"Human: Fall Flat is a fantastic game. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys puzzle solving or exploration games. The simplicity of the mechanics gives it so much freedom in level design, and the designers clearly put in tons of effort to each level. 
Having played over 2 hours, I have enjoyed every level and challenge presented to me. I haven't found any puzzles too difficult, and the progression of difficulty is dare-I-say perfect. 
My favorite aspect of this game is the openness of the levels. In the construction level, I spent half an hour climbing various pipes and exploring the destroyed concrete structure. By going out of my way, I got to look at some of the puzzles and get new perspective on them (When you get to the castle, try to find a way to ring the bell!). The levels have tons of areas to explore and even has achievements for going off the beaten path!

Now for some scores
Gameplay: 9/10 Super simple, super fun! 
Level Design: 10/10 Each level has hidden areas to explore and flows with their theme well.
Story: NA Not all games need a story. This one is fantastic without it. 
Difficulty: Moderate, This is a game that will stretch casual players without breaking them and satisfy hardcore gamers without boring them. 
Worth Full Price?: Yes, this game is worth full price.

As a note, I am only a few hours into the game. I have been enjoying it so much, that I had to write a review and give this team the praise they deserve. My opinion may still be incomplete, but based on what I have seen so far, I recommend this game for anyone looking for a good time."
26462,Yes
26463,very funny game :D
26464,"it great
"
26465,Mamalón. Pero Son muy pocos Perros Niveles :v
26466,"Gut gejm, +rep"
26467,"This is the funniest game I have ever played, however this game is so much more than humor, the levels require some thought and a great deal of trial and error when you start. The physics are well programmed and i've never had any glitches. Once you get familiar with the controls it becomes a blast to play just for the sake of speed running each level and doing all the achievements. As of rn I have 100% beaten the game and got all the achievements, the first game I have ever done that on. If you love physics games than I highly recommend this and to challenge yourself to see how fast you can beat the game(Record is under 7 minutes). If you want a game to laugh at with your friends? Then I also highly recommend this game. If you don't like puzzles, have no friends, and take life too seriously then this game is probably not for you.

10/10 [spoiler]would pull my friends off a ledge again[/spoiler]

Also the developers released a free new level as part of the game, not a paid DLC and that's nice to see

Edit 1: Workshop just got released and there are a ton of quality maps out there to try, expanding this game indefinitely. Worth the price and then some more!

Edit 2: The developers have released even more official levels for free!"
26468,I dare the developers to try and charge for a new map
26469,Definitely fun with friends.  Quicky puzzle game where levels can be completed in a variety of ways.  I would definitely play it again with the right group.  Probably would be both hilarious and difficult to play in a larger group of say 8 players.  Just don't take it too serious and you can have a lot of fun with this game.
26470,amazing game luved it needs more content though
26471,SO GOOD YUM YAY BOO YAH!
26472,i love the game its so fun
26473,Big Dab
26474,"Very Fun Game, Especially When Me and my Friends 'Initiate' New People..."
26475,This game is freakin great
26476,"This game is hilarious and at times frustrating. There are a million different ways to solve each puzzle. Sometimes you'll just sit there scratching your head and other times you have to do the same thing over and over again until you get it JUST right.
I like playing it on my own, but it's really the most enjoyable with a few friends. I couldn't stop laughing when I was either rolling solo or playing it with friends."
26477,Awsome game 10/10 i suggest buying this if you like puzzel games or just wanna mess around with freinds
26478,"Played every together in coop mode in vertical splitscreen and nvidia surround with 2 monitors.
Everyone got their own screen, everybody happy.
I was happy because i got to throw my girlfriend of a cliff."
26479,Local playdough crackheads solves puzzles
26480,Real pointless like my life
26481,"Very fun, had a great time, but sometimes gets annoying"
26482,This halarious strategy game is a mixture of funny co-op and confusing puzzle-solving. I recommend any age to play this game and enjoy it's vast variety.
26483,"This game defines what fun means, especially with friend. The only thing missing is STEAM Workshop integretion, come on Devs, give us the WORKSHOP!!!!!"
26484,"Nice and fun game,but not enough of levels :("
26485,"Great Game 10/10 Would PlayThrough Again
"
26486,skeeyee hell yeah brother
26487,So imagine this. Your eating some chicken nuggets and then you start up this game and its a good time.
26488,[spoiler] Yes [/spoiler]
26489,The most fun I've ever had with a puzzle game.
26490,The funniest puzzle game I have ever played in my entire life.  It's pretty short though.
26491,Stupidly funny
26492,good game for family
26493,It s such an amzing fantsy imaginative game.  more map and steamworkshop support plz
26494,"Gathered about six people, played for about 5 hours, best time ever! 

All this game needs is a workshop, let us make the maps and it will entertain us for much longer! 
-All the more reason to buy this game
-Becomes streamable"
26495,Add more levels please. Lol.
26496,pls add more map
26497,really fucking enjoy it
26498,"it dont wrk i cant play it opens to a black screen i just want to play with my friends plz devs help me with my problem
"
26499,"Fun, challanging, frustrating, this game has it all.
My daughter laught till her jaws hurt.
Its amusing trying to build something with a man without one single bone in its body.
I recommend this game."
26500,only CO-OP with friends and this game is tons of FUN
26501,good game
26502,"I haven't had such a great fun for a long time! If you're bored playing GTA V, PUBG or any other game, take this one, you won't regret. ; )"
26503,"Great game, lots of fun with friends. 
But it is short, takes about 4 hours to complete (max).
Needs more levels, a level editor, and workshop support."
26504,"My autism & me, we get anxious every time we play this game. Makes me feel dizzy af man, idk. But the game is okay. Puzzles and stuff. 

Oh and its also fun to pick someone up and throw them off the map. I would definitely recommend doing that for a good laugh."
26505,noice
26506,This game is a great game to play with friends. Plenty of puzzles and other humerous things to due. Would reconmend for people that want to buy this for there self and their friend.
26507,Different and hilarious
26508,The co-op is so fun omg
26509,Love this game. Way more fun with friends
26510,"Considering you pay almost 20 euros for a 2-3 hours of content, no thanks; this game is worth 10 euros at most. Few levels are fun but uhm, that's it there's literally no content. Why no workshop for player maps? It would literally solve the dev's inability to create new levels."
26511,great love this game!
26512,"Don't Play this game whilst drinking anything - you will end up with it all over your keyboard!  A great little game for a few hours of fun.

Imagine running around with Play Doe Charactors, trying to solve puzzles and not be tempted to throw your mates off the side of any and all large drops!

I can find only one downside to this game.  It is far too short.  

Get it, play it. Laugh and have fun.

"
26513,"This game is insanely funny. I have so far played this game for a total of 14.5 hours with friends and I am sure that I will play more just to laugh, be silly, think a little bit and go for the achievements. I forsee this game being played and enjoyed by millions just for the fact you can laugh so hard because the characters you control are jelly and act somewhat drunk. So my advice to you is that if you enjoy games that are extremely silly and makes you think, then take the time to pick up this game and enjoy it!"
26514,this is a rilly good game and i have a ida for the next update i was wundring if you could put custamizabule levels in ihe next update so people could make there own levels. thanks i hope you can put this in the next update it would make Human Fall Flat evan more awsome.
26515,HILARIOUS. Great game to play with friends.
26516,"its good
"
26517,100%
26518,"It was a nice game, but they removed Linux support afterwards so I cannot play with friends anymore. Cannot recommend this developer anymore."
26519,Yes
26520,best game of 2018 so much to do and have with an insane story line
26521,"Physics are amazing in this game
You can even dab backwards"
26522,"Really good fun to play with the kids. Its downright hilarious. 

Do be advised that its very short and that you might not play it very often, so I'd suggest waiting for a sale and picking up a bundle."
26523,Yes.
26524,"Human: Fall Flat has been an interesting experience so far- and from such an innocent game I have managed to stuff a buddy (a jew)into the oven, and repeatedly throw my hand into the air resembling a nazi salute. This game really does make you create your own fun to some extent as the puzzles are more tedious than other puzzle games, that's on the count of the game using physics for almost all objects, and for destructive scenery.

Do I recommend it single player? Probably not, but with another person, the experience increases drastically in quality."
26525,"This game is great fun. Its unique and the physics can be hilarious.
You need an imagination. Explore the game, do random sh@ and then youre good.
Dont expect a huge amount of hours. Think the game currently caps out at around 10-15 hours maybe. 
Looking forward to workshop level creation and devs adding in a few more levels for the base game.

As soon as this gets workshop support, this game would be gold. 8 player MP is a good step though"
26526,interesting game. But there's not enough maps.
26527,I believe that it well be good until i have friends playing with me
26528,Damn so much fun boi
26529,"Lot's of content, great game to play with friends."
26530,"Really fun to play with friends, alone it's a bit boring. I definetely recommend this!"
26531,eh.
26532,Game is great but he need more levels...
26533,cheesy weesy succ my yeezy
26534,Pretty cool and fun to play with friends but no workshop support. Why?
26535,this game so fun with multiplayer...sadly the game are too short..beat it in 6 hours..i hope they make new levels soon
26536,"intense gameplay, epic strats. ggs"
26537,rlly nice game...cool...lot's of fun :D reccomending to everyone...yeaaa :)
26538,Dont get they dont ahve that many level if you want you can finish this in a few hours.
26539,its a good game
26540,I can't get enough of introducing this game to friends. Everyone has a great time playing it and it has enough replay-ability for me to repeat levels with different people. Online multiplayer would be nice.
26541,"Freezes every checkpoint, but still fun. Please fix freezing when checkpoint is hit"
26542,The best part is throwing your friends off the ledges.
26543,Great fun!
26544,"Great Game, much fun.
I recommend it."
26545,"Alright, this game is tough. It's foolishly clumsy and hilariously inaccurate. Playing with friends is best. Here is my first hour condensed. LOL

https://youtu.be/x4MzSS9c3g0"
26546,SSWEDd
26547,"+ Funny with friends
- Few levels"
26548,"Overall pretty fun, I like it. 

BUT

I'm losing faith in humanity."
26549,Veri nice gmae
26550,Really fun time to play with friends. I'd say playing with friends is a must. Also wish there were more levels. Still worth your time!
26551,Great game  jsut needs more levels  or some news of future levels eg a new level every month worth playing this with a group of friends is deffently worth the money
26552,"Really good game to play with friends.

Now it just needs Steam Workshop support so that we can create our own levels."
26553,"My friend beat me to a pulp as we played split screen because I kept throwing him off the edge.
very cool.

10/10"
26554,Funny game. Love it 10/10!!
26555,It's very fun. I would definitely get this on sale. It's totally worth $7. I highly recommend playing with a friend because it makes it even more fun. Funky game. Think of Portal with really funny mechanics instead of funny commentary.
26556,"The game is good but, the pause menu doesn't work. So, to get out of the game you have to open your start menu to be able to close the window.  7/10.."
26557,Buy it its h3iia fun.
26558,how much money did i spend on this shit game again
26559,Needs more levels but vary fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
26560,"This is one of the funniest game I’ve ever played. I usually hate games were the controls are clunky – but in this game the difficulty in controlling the wobbly character is more than half the fun! Dying a couple of times because you mistimed a jump is also not that frustrating as you respawn quickly and save locations are quite generous. The slightly crude polygon world works really well with this type of game, and gives it a cartoonish atmosphere and makes the character that much more loveable. The sound track is beautiful too.
The game reminds me of Grow Home and Grow Up (which in my book is a good thing).

Some criticism:
You need a pretty decent frame rate and a strong stomach if you want to avoid motion sickness. Or perhaps just take a big dose of Dramamine…
Perhaps it is just me being stupid, but I found the game very difficult to play using an XBOX controller – using the keyboard + mouse is much much better.
The biggest drawback of this game is the rather small number of levels available. I had played the original game over a year ago, but after learning about the new Dark level I installed it again. The new level was just as fun to play as the other levels.
It appears that virtually all recent negative reviews are from users disappointed because suddenly and silently linux support was dropped. I originally bought this game when I was still exclusively on linux, but I now have access to a Windoze box too, otherwise I could not have played the new Dark level.
In my opinion the devs should remove the ability to scale vertical walls by swinging back and forth– that just feels like cheating and all puzzles can actually be completed without climbing."
26561,"great game, I was writing a longer review but my dumb left hand hit a button and deleted a chunk out from the middle so whatever. better with friends and I enjoyed skipping puzzles by climbing and running along walls, the amount of strain it put in my hands and my friends, every shortcut we done felt like an accomplishment. The pain was worth it and so was the money.

only thing I'd like to see made possible is player made levels for more playable content.

have a good day peeps.."
26562,"Great game, super fun, wacky physics, awesome graphics. Only downside is not very frequent updates and not much levels. 8/10"
26563,"Don't play alone, too borning. 

With friends is where fun begins! Move through levels, complete them in various ways, fool around a little here and there, fun to get achievments together and throw your friends out of the map - 9/10"
26564,"Wouldn't reccomend buying from No Brakes Games in the future. Great game, but they dropped Linux support after marketing and selling it as a native Linux title. You can't run it with Steam Play because Steam still counts it as having native Linux support even though it's stuck on an old version which doesn't have multiplayer or new content. They should have atleast gotten the game whitelisted for Steam Play and made sure it was installable before dropping support."
26565,"The Game Is Great But Its Need (Workshop)

Add The Workshop Plz So We Can Play More :)"
26566,good game
26567,I bought this game out of bordem and had a laugh its a funny game especially with friends but definitely needs more maps.
26568,"this is a rip roarin' good time for the patient. if only they'd release a level editor and so have an infinite supply of player-made maps this would be an absolutely must buy for everyone on the planet

e: they did it, they released a way for players to make an infinite supply of maps for this thing"
26569,10 out of  10 >:3
26570,420 Blaze it best game when youre danked
26571,"funny game, louzy controls, doubt I will ever play it on my own, but lots of fun to play with friends.
The puzzles are not too eazy to solve, and even if you think they are, the controls will make it hard anyway ;)

EDIT: there are more and more levels and they're all added for free, and in spite of what I said, I played it alone as well and then it's a lot of fun too. The achievements make nice extra challenges and if I could I'd recommend this game twice."
26572,"wheres workshop

edit: workshop has been added, i am happy"
26573,"Highly recommend this game, very funny and interesting especially when playing with friends."
26574,If you desire to cry laughing with your friends... Just play this. MAKE MORE MAPS PLS... Thanks!
26575,I don't think I've ever laughed so much while playing a game co-op. Highly recommend!!!!!!
26576,GOOD VIDOEO GAEME
26577,"Bought it not for full price. It's totally worth it if it's marked down. Took me and a friend about 8 hours to complete all maps the first time. Second time, less than 3. There are so many different ways you can solve the puzzles which adds to the fun.

What would make this game great is officiall support for workshop maps and a map creation tool, instead of having to get hold of a modded version of the game and create maps in the unity engine."
26578,boring when on singleplayer and lag just SUCKS
26579,The game feels like you're controlling a baby made of jello with no spine. That said I love that you are controlling a baby made of jello with no spine
26580,This game is awesome and I recommend it. 10/10
26581,"When you fail, you don't fall flat. You try again.

Helping teammates up is really satisfying in this.

Wrestling against each other is fun too.

Some really boring stuffs irl can be very fun and challenging in this, like making a knot out of a cable, hooking a giant shipping cargo onto the crane, and hoarding items from previous puzzles to make the next ones easier.

Ask your friends to join you in this or make new friends as you play. Enjoy this crappy little game as you would enjoy your crappy little life."
26582,This is the best and funniest game of all! You can also customize your character! How does that sound?
26583,"Playing Dark was so much fun, just please add user created levels even if they aren't fully tested. I have completed all missions twice and its quite fun the first time but I don't really feel like playing it again. 

If there was a feature that told us these are not fully tested user created levels that would be amazing even if some don't work as well as they should."
26584,Most Epicest game ever 10/10
26585,"Wanna know why this game is called Human: Fall Flat?
Its because the Earth is flat.
Thats why you keep falling off the world.

~Stay W O K E my bröthers!!!!"
26586,we need a lot new stage . play 4 hours can end all stage and nothing new LOL badass
26587,"garbage game alone, need vc and friends to be fun. need more levels"
26588,+
26589,"Its a pretty fun game. I have already beaten all the levels and honestly im a bit bored of them. Buy this if you have a friend to play with but dont expect to replay it multiple times. Its pretty fun but it really needs levels. Definitely not worth 14.99 right now.
"
26590,"Gather your friends, or stay lonely. Whichever situation you're in, this game ought to get you in the mood.
Human Fall Flat looks like your generic puzzle game, but beneath the surface you have a beutiful environment with incredible physics and beutiful landscapes. I highly recommend you play with 1 or more friends."
26591,cant stop laughing while playing this with friends... such a goffy game
26592,"Good fun with friends, no matter what. Local multiplayer using a keyboard and controller, or just two controllers is possible. Have had too much fun watching my Microsoft Paint character wobble around drunk on swings and cool physics puzzles. BUY IT FOR YOUR KIDS"
26593,"really good game, I have played it for 1,000 hours on the main lobby.  Buy it for ur kids."
26594,OMG funniest shit ever
26595,AMAZING ASSS GAME!!!!!
26596,is good
26597,"Bought this game tonight and also for two friends, because i knew from videos we would have such a fun time playing it, and we did. Laughing to the point of crying and sore stomachs :)
Great fun for anyone and their friends, the ragdoll effects provide hilarious falls and some pretty interesting positions you find your character in.
I do agree with most of the reviewers who have said a steam workshop being implemented would extended this games life span by a ton, similar to golf with friends. Once that gets added 10/10 game for sure (personal opinion)
Solid 7 though.
Thanks Devs"
26598,Unless workshop is added I highly advice spending your money elsewhere. For the same price you can get 16x the hours out of your money from Hollow Knight.
26599,"1. I like it
2. I love it
3. I want some more of it"
26600,A fun game.
26601,"great game if you like puzzle games
"
26602,"Amazing game! Hope new levels get released, would definitely pay for an expansion of more levels."
26603,"Hilarious game, made to be played with friends
If you don't like physics based games/platformers/puzzles, this is still a great game to mess around in

All it needs is a proper steam workshop/sandbox mode, and you could probably get thousands of hours out of it (though the dev has said they are working on implementing a workshop for steam, but nothing else has been said about it since June of 2018)

Other than that, I would strongly reccomend it as a game for friends

"
26604,"Great game


黑鬼"
26605,THIS GAME IS AWSOME
26606,"I bought this during the Winter Sale.
My kids and I had a blast with this game.
It's funny, sometimes very frustrating, challenging at times.
We laughed a lot.
It's too short though, so please give us more levels.
We want more of that."
26607,"Amazingly fun game to play if you have a friend to play with you. Main issue I have with the game is its lack of content. It only took us ~5 hours to beat all the levels (including the Halloween 2018 level) in the two-player mode. With a couple more levels or a whole custom level editor it would be a solid ""Recommended"" game for me, but right now it feels like unfinished or something. Maybe get it on sale."
26608,"My friend pushed me off cliff saying ""Long Live The King""
I became not alive."
26609,My friend threw me off the side millions of times
26610,Dead game no content
26611,Its funny and frustatingly challenging at the same time.
26612,"Good game but a massive lack of content, at least add a workshop rather than adding a single new level after half a year of no updates"
26613,"It's a fun game with quite an open ended approach to solving the puzzles it throws at the player that becomes even more fun the more friends you have playing it with you. There are very often nooks, crannies and alternate routes to be found, which is also fun to explore as I did. 
However the game can be finished in a day and I personally don't feel it has too much replay value if you've already thoroughly explored the maps you play on. Take this with a grain of salt though because I don't often replay a game once I finish it.
If it's on sale, definitely buy it because it is a fun experience overall, it's just a shame it's so short"
26614,"Man this game is really funny. Can really hold your belly while watching other people sturggle to do something. This game is quite interesting to play solo, but definetly better with friends."
26615,Did stretches. 10/10 would not go to the gym again
26616,dis game is rly gud play it if u r not a drolyag
26617,"Good graphic design. However, terrible gaming control experience. Designed for time consuming instead of for fun!"
26618,great to play with family
26619,If you sit down to play this game grab a tissue because once you start launging you cant stop.
26620,"is good, needs workshop support tho."
26621,"This game butters my biscuits, however it really requires friends to be fun.

8/10."
26622,"Another amazing indie title. I really enjoyed playing this with my friend. Playing solo aint so fun and i would not recommend it in that way but, with friend (up to 8) it's amazing. We had so much fun and laugh in the levels cz of atmosphere, silly character animations, jokes, puzzles, etc.. game is not very difficult but that does not matter anyway. 


[h1]The good parts:[/h1]
+ A blast with friends
+ Quirky puzzles
+ World design seems cute
+ Workshop

[h1]The not so good parts:[/h1]
- Game is too short, we need more stages
- There is no point of playing this game alone

It's something unique in the field of gaming industry."
26623,"==INTRO==
Human: Fall flat is a strange puzzle game with an even stranger name. It's main appeal are it's intentionally wonky controls, which allow for some interesting physics-based puzzles.
==GAMEPLAY==
Pretty straightforward. There's a bunch of levels with different themes, that are filled to the brim with various physics-based puzzles that require the utilization of the intentionally wobbly and weird control scheme to complete.
==MULTIPLAYER==
Multiplayer is literally just the base game + second player. It does break some puzzles.
==LENGTH==
Short. Around 7-15 hours, greatly shorter when in multiplayer due to the ability to break certain puzzles by standing on pressure plates, etc.
==DLC==
Not really a DLC, one free map added for halloween.
==MODS==
None that I know of.
==PROS AND CONS==

Pros: Silly and fun, very unique compared to other puzzle games.

Cons: Graphics are pretty much default unity stuff. very low poly and solid color. To me that's not a turn off, but to others it is. Biggest concern is the length of the game, it's rather short for its price, although it goes on sale often.

==RECOMMENDATIONS==

Who I would recommend this game to: Puzzle game fans, those who enjoy wonky physics games like Octodad, and the controls of Gang Beasts.

Who I wouldn't recommend this game to: Really just anyone who doesn't like the genre but that goes without saying.

==FINAL SCORE==
7.2/10: My player probably has a shattered spine."
26624,no steam workshop
26625,gudddd
26626,"Amazing game. Gameplay is fun and it offers lots of laughs!
One big problem is there are only a few levels which were beat in 6.8 hours.
This game needs Workshop and more levels."
26627,"Got this game with friends, proceeded to hit friends with objects and toss them off edges. 10/10"
26628,add a fucking workshop!!!!1
26629,Exciting game for playing with friends
26630,"This game has real potential, but unfortunately, it remains untapped. The core mechanics work incredibly well, and it's hilarious to play, especially with a friend (or several friends) - but there quite simply aren't enough levels available. I finished every single one of them in under 6 hours. Of course, this'd be fine if you could download and play custom maps online... but for some reason, you can't. Until something's done about this, I'm afraid I can't recommend this game, even with how brilliant it is."
26631,it was very fun but little amount of levels
26632,Veri gud and ice geim buy wen on saile or rich
26633,its aight
26634,"Good game for couple hours, if you have someone to play with it makes the game 100 times better"
26635,This game is hilarious to play with friends.
26636,I like
26637,"Human Fall Flat is a fun game to play on your own but all the more funny if you get together with some of your friends and do al sorts of shenanigans. Overall, I would say the price to fun/playtime ratio is perfect and I think it's totally worth the money."
26638,"Very funny, Best to play with friends"
26639,"Worth it! Very much worth it! I played it with one of my friends for hours and its still not boring even if you've done all the puzzles! I love the game so much and I've not even played it that long. Controling your character is challenging which is part of the fun! I recommend this game to anyone who likes a funny, multiplayer, and challenging experience."
26640,a real fun game ..needs more levels ..lots of fun with friends
26641,"Had a blast playing this with my friends! Very teamwork orientated which I love, also love being able to add cutom skins and such, even better seeing the assortment of retarded shit my friends came up with.

7/10"
26642,"Great game, is only fun with friends, makes you laugh none stop"
26643,"Very fun game! A bit hardcore by yourself if you try to solo all levels one try. (That’s an achievement) Game is very fun with friends and literally lots of laughters, especially when you get your body stuck between doors, hahaha or if your leg glitched and start jumping around with one leg.
This game actually have lots of hours to spend on if you try to achieve all achievements. (Man that “Rolling” one is frustrating)
"
26644,"Brilliant fun with friends or on your own, it's great that there's specific ways to do things but out of the box thinking can accomplish them too."
26645,Had so much fun and laughter plaing this game with friends
26646,One of the best local splitscreen games available
26647,"Got it on sale. Great game. If you played portal, you will like this game. Finished solo in 10 hours. Really, really funny with friends."
26648,Fun game especially when playing with friends or family. Brings joy and laughter whenever you're having a bad day. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
26649,trash
26650,"This is a lovely fun game with friends. I find a lot of the humor comes with playing with a group of people. I got this game literally on sale for 2 bucs and felt it was worth twice my money at that.

The only reason why I cannot recommend this game is the lack of content for the price tag. I honestly feel like for 15 dollars there should be more content to the game for longer play time. I would maybe pay 8 bucks for this game as it stands."
26651,"I literally had the funniest moments in this game, it's not that the game is joking (it's beautiful), but when your friend is doing something dumb, you both die laughing. Don't play it alone it won't satisfy, but with your friends it's definetly worth the money!"
26652,"Playing this with a friend and you will have a blast, though you will complete the story in 7 hours (at least that what it took us). Great game, not worth 15€ though get it in sale."
26653,lol
26654,Amazing game to play with friends while you all have drink!
26655,"Dropping support for Linux isn't cool, guys."
26656,best game to play with your partner
26657,"nice, they added back linux support and workshop support

also whoever designed the elevator level in Aztec should be slowly electrocuted in an electric chair"
26658,the only puzzle game that encourages you to cheese the puzzles
26659,lol
26660,"I feel like this game is dead for not being negative or anything, but when I played it online nobody was in it"
26661,"It's.....pretty okay. The game gets pretty monotonous. I played it for a while by myself, online, and with others with local multiplayer.

[h1] Gameplay Mechanics [/h1]
The mechanics are [i] HILARIOUS! [/i] I love this aspect of the game. It's fun to grab other people and throw 'em off edges. Take their objects and mess around, and even experiment with the ragdoll functionality.

[h1] Core Gameplay [/h1]
The CORE gameplay is really fun, I absolutely fanboy over how fun it is. However, [b] let's focus on the overall gameplay. [/b]
The overall gameplay is pretty monotonous. There's about 8 levels you can complete; Each getting progressively harder. However, when you're limited to these levels in multiplayer, and only being able to have a 2 player split-screen, the game gets  boring after a while.

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]
The game is pretty good, however it's word of the day is [b] monotonous. [/b] If they'd [u]allow more split screen options[/u] or [u]allow users to create their own levels[/u] to mess around in, I'd have not returned it. The game itself is decent, but it needs expanding.

[i] Note: [/i] For the game's price ($15) you could almost get [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/] Dead by Daylight [/url] or get [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/] CS:GO's Prime Status upgrade [/url] (Since the game is free now....)

[i] Also sorry for the short review. This game doesn't really have anything to go in-depth about. [/i]

5.4/10 | Not for me, but if you want it badly sure."
26662,GOOD! BEST GAME WITH PRENDS
26663,10/10 would see frankenstein again
26664,"Such a fun and hilarious game. Played through almost the full game in 1 sitting and laughed almost the entire time. Unique title, must play with friends for a full experience. Throwing your friends over the edge of the map, and helping them climb back up never gets old."
26665,Unfortunately this game no longer supports Linux. Because of this new updates (which looks like a lot of fun) are not available for Linux users. I am dissapointed and can no longer recommend this game or developer. I wish the employees of “no brakes games” (who I assume are struggling...) the best of luck with their futures.
26666,amazing just breathtaking!
26667,its easy enough to complete but most of the fun is in finding the quirky unexpected ways to finish the levels
26668,"pretty good game i think, very many laugh but sumsin happun :(
https://plays.tv/video/5c2d8c9472dbae5d41/we-broke-the-god-damn-game"
26669,yee
26670,Really good game
26671,the best game with friends
26672,"One of the best games you can play with your friends. I never got bored of it till the levels were all completed. 
the music is nice and not really loud it fills up the game just about it.
the puzzels are sometimes difficult for others if they don't know how to function with their character. But you can cheat your way out going different sides or climb on eachother's back. I love this game."
26673,"Great game, I love it!
Alone and with friends, you can get super funny moments :)"
26674,Zevkli
26675,"Man I love floping around the place as anyone I can make like Big Smoke or Thomas The Tank Engine. Or my favorite white person.
10/10"
26676,The BEst GAME ive played in a long time
26677,Adding Steam Workshop would make this game perfect.
26678,:-DDD
26679,These 5 euro spend are the best i had ever done....Awsom game for playing with friends together
26680,"Play it with friends! Had us laughing the entire way through. Desperately needs a workshop mode, otherwise you have between 5-7 hours of gameplay (depending on how much you fuck around while going through the levels). 80% recommended right now, with a workshop mode/map editor/etc., would be a game that you can waste hundreds of hours on."
26681,"The game is fun and I enjoyed playing it for a little while with a friend through multiplayer.

My negative review stems from the fact that they seem to advertise Linux support when, in reality, the Linux build of the game is very very old and does not work online with users on other platforms. I wasn't able to really play the game at all on Linux, and I think this is pretty crappy practice, since Linux support was a big selling point for me on this one."
26682,trash
26683,ridicoulously funny
26684,"human: fall flat
human : flat
flat is human
flat is justice
kiwi"
26685,Awsome game! most fun with friends
26686,"It's not a human, but he definitely falls flat."
26687,I can finally achieve my dream of having no bones.
26688,good
26689,"The game is an absolute joy to play, it has the controls of games like QWOP but not as bad. My only gripe is that the devs have yet to implement a map maker or something of the sort. The game is especially enjoyable with 2-3 friends where you can laugh till it hurts."
26690,Absolutely love this game. Great local play.
26691,Game of the year for me!!!
26692,"This game is awesome!
- Good with friends;
- Fun to play;
- A little buggy / funny...

Overall it's a good game and I recommend buying it :D"
26693,"This game is absolutely hilarious when playing with friends. Even though it is quite short, there's many ways of going through each level, all equally hillarious. Can be played over and over, would definitely recommend."
26694,"i raged hard but then i found a glitch so i could fly wherever i wanted to, so i recommend"
26695,"Absolute piece of shit game! Never buy it! They are patching it, and make it worse for every patch. I don't recommend it at all."
26696,"Human Fall Flat is a wonderful, if short, physics puzzle game.

Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I completed this game in just a few hours, even though we goofed off half the time, grabbing each other by various body parts and throwing each other around. We're looking forward to more potential puzzles, because we had a great time playing.

My advice would be that if you do play, go into it with a light heart and don't expect to succeed immediately. Some puzzles require a lot more dexterity that you're immediately prepared for as a blob monster. Just relax, have fun, and laugh. I think it's worth experiencing at least once through."
26697,Haven't laughed so hard since forever
26698,Fun with Friends but needs more levels and less climbing and little more puzzles.
26699,Need to play with friends for maximal fun :D
26700,Kappa
26701,my tummy hurts after playing this with my friend
26702,would recommend on sale and if you have people to play with
26703,"Absolute trash. No indication of where to go or what to do. First few levels are bearable, almost fun. The latter half is  horrible and feels just thrown together. I usually like these type of games( I am bread, surgeon simulator) bit this one is unfun garbage"
26704,"ive spent around 50 hours in total doing nothing but holding onto my friend with one arm and the floor with the other, rendering them incapacitated. would do nothing again 10/10"
26705,"Neat little puzzle game with a goofy aspect, this is a keeper if you're looking for a game similar to another title, gang beasts, as it has almost the same type of characters with its funny ragdoll physics."
26706,Why is this game suddenly no longer available on linux? wtf?
26707,"Fun game to play with friends but the devs haven't released much content and don't care to make their game more than 5 hours long. You can get through 100% of the content with friends online in one sitting. The community for this game has been begging the devs for more content for what feels like YEARS? Give us workshop, give us DLC, just give us something!

[strike] Because of the lazy devs I don't reccomend this game. [/strike]

Workshop update date finally!! Great job devs for listening to the community now there is tons of replay value to this game"
26708,"Extraordinarily hilarious, found myself for the first couple of hours just trying to throw off other Party members to there death. Once you get past the murderous rampage and understand the controlls the game shines, with its chalanging problem soving puzzles and team building. Would love to see more of the surreal maps. 

Overall its a solid game with its easy jump in and play co-op local or online and its ability to leave you crying laughing. Would definitely recommend with friends."
26709,gud Gaem :D
26710,"As Demon-kin I find it very offensive that this game is strictly for humans. I wait with bated breath for the sequel, Otherkin: Fall Flat, but until then I will have to continue to possess the body of my neighbor Paul and use him as a vessel to play the game, as my computer automatically explodes whenever I try to play it without containing my demonic energy. Other than this, great game, 8/10"
26711,"Quirky physics based puzzle game with kind of crazy controls. It's even more fun in co-op and just the fun things you can do with other players. The game was definitely a ton of fun and if you want something light hearted with some unique physics based puzzles, give Human: Fall Flat a go. Bonus points that it's a ton of fun to play with friends but I think even without friends, it'd still be fun as a pure puzzle game."
26712,"I bought the game with mac, installed game with mac, yet no work with mac?"
26713,Fun to screw around in
26714,"This game is super fun with friends. Fun maps and all, only thing is it needs a workshop for people to add maps. It would add to the fun once you have completed all the maps :D"
26715,"honestyl awful game, impossible to do anything frustrating and delayed responses. all it made me want to do is play in a motor way."
26716,This is art
26717,"This game is pretty sweet to play with friends if you wanna kill around an hour or two. if they add maybe 5 more maps or add maps FOR mulitple plays at once the game would be a lot better. As it is, all maps can be finished really quickly and cheating with more players. each map is intended for one person puzzles."
26718,"Good Game.
Glitched and cheesed my way through all the levels."
26719,Great game with great future ahead. Especially if they add workshop multiplayer and if they keep bringing maps to play.
26720,funny game
26721,"very funny, i love this game!"
26722,Well worth the price.
26723,One of the most fun games ive ever played
26724,什么比游戏，能好好做做联机吗？
26725,"One of the best coop games, worth buying."
26726,"note: AOW = as of when I'm typing this: 'within 05:00', 30/12/2018, dubai, uae, earth..

A nice, whimsical, funny challenge that can be frustrating plus the alike for some users do to the clumsy movements..

There is online multiplayer (AOW), but, high ping, for me, is quite a poor experience due to responsiveness; in addition to the clumsy movements, it really is not a pleasant combination..

There is modification support (I don't know to what extent; as well, AOW), but, just let me know if you want to know how to set things up, at least when it comes to playing with others user created content (levels, character models)..

To be honest, the developers or whoever is in charge in making the needed decisions should fully release 'Steam Workshop' support for the game with proper documentation on the tools they release, if any, but I assume so..I believe that it would possibly boost sales in general for the game and boost community activity plus a flurry, so to speak, of other benefits:))..

Overall, this game, for me, is whimsical, funny, fun and more of the alike, I recommend this game:))..xD:D:))black_heartx2*..

Another thing worth mentioning, recently, I've read negative things about 'Linux' support for this game..I just wanted to let you guys know..

much love, take care, brothers and sisters:))black_heartx2*.."
26727,"If u have friends to play with, its most fun expiriance you will get. Totaly worth buying it but there is 1 con to this game there is no WORSHOP to work with and needs to be added ty :D"
26728,Game is so much fun  i would rate it 8/10... just cause the game lacks levels you maybe get 6 hours of fun laughter and floppy wrestling with your buddies i would recommend a workshop so you can play with friend.I suggest you buy it while the game is on sale cause game isnt worth 15 euros =( if it had workshop for custom levels then sure its 15 euro and its worth it.Hope this  review helped you
26729,"This game is weird and woderful.

Grab a friend and prepare for a good time."
26730,"its alright
"
26731,if you got friends up to try this give it a full go!
26732,apparently i've played for almost ten hours writing this review
26733,Good game. Both fun alone and with a friend.
26734,"Great fun with friends. Levels are nice with multiple ways to finish it. There are lots of intricate achievements to get.
It's quite short though and could really use workshop support for user levels.

In current state I recommend it in 50% sale, if workshop support was added, it would be well worth the full price."
26735,Its a very fun and thinking game!
26736,"A super fun and retarded time with your friends!
My only complaint is the game is pretty short and I would hope to see more levels to screw around in.
thanks for wasting 30 secs of you life reading this."
26737,human fall flat is a description of my life in a nutshell in a cranberry.
26738,"I really enjoyed this game. Its another one of those games where the actual gameplay is just the difficulty in controlling your character like Octo Dad, and I Am Bread.

The levels start off boring but get large and complicated. There are multiple ways to complete the levels. Its using true physical simulation.

Even after you finish the game, its still fun to play the levels online with friends or strangers, and even now, 2 years later, its easy to find an online game."
26739,"some of the funniest stuff i've ever seen has happened in this game
"
26740,"Very Fun and  enjoyble to play with others

Only downside is that you will constantly be kicked even when servers are public instead of invite only"
26741,"It's a hilarious game when u play it with your friends, but I wish there were more stages..... it took me only a day to complete all the stages on multi. Excellent game tho"
26742,Open ended co-op puzzle solving and some of the most ridiculous fun I've ever had being thrown off of a cliff by my friends.
26743,It's very fun to play with your friends.
26744,"Yeah so basicly, you fall flat. 

That's it, what'd you expect?


10/10 though would recommend."
26745,"too few new content, player base is toxic, and even when u get to stay in a game generally lags so have fun playing a platformer with delayed controls. who thought it would be a good idea to make your own controls serverside should be fired. nothing competetive in this game, no reason to make it entirely serverside to where jumping is seconds delayed"
26746,Mmmm very nice
26747,this game is so fun
26748,Loved it. I havent laughed so hard gaming in a long time.
26749,this is so much fun with friends!
26750,"This game is probably best enjoyed with a friend or a group of friends, so better get your friend/s a copy when you get this game!

Hilarity ensues as you play through a very ragdoll physic game! Try to cooperate with your friends as you progress, or fail miserably and end up laughing about how your characters look!"
26751,"cute and enjoyable
is good"
26752,"The most fun i had in coop was in this game 
nothing more to say 
"
26753,Funniest game I've ever played
26754,Yesterday I tried this for the first time with 2 of my friends. We're all 30+ and we were literally left in tears of just laughing non stop. Nice job devs!
26755,"Very fun, wish it was longer but they do add more maps occasionally"
26756,why you no win
26757,👌
26758,"its a really mood dependant game. if you wanna accomplish something today... you are better off not touching this. if you feel playful and just wanna play something funny, this is certainly the way to go.
better with controller tho."
26759,i like the part when you accidently grab your friends peener
26760,"its good
"
26761,"Absolutely love the game, but there isnt much to do after you beat the main maps. Adding a steam workshop feature where anyone could make their own map and share it with the world to play would be glorious!"
26762,"this game is awesome, but it needs a workshop badly. if that would happen one day my dreams would come true!

Edit: my dreams came true!"
26763,Dressing up as anything you want then having to grab thing to getaround the map is a little challage
26764,This game is awesome and I hope you like it to.😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
26765,"terrible you cant play multiplayer, difficult controls. Overall its a boring game"
26766,I like it.
26767,Best game ever. Haven't had so much fun in a long time.
26768,most halarious game ever
26769,"Wonderful game, very fun to play with friends, interesting puzzles, good character customization, looks pretty nice, and the developers continue to update it with new levels and they also host level-creation competitions. Very epic"
26770,"nice game, very fun with your friends, confirmed"
26771,This is much fun with friends.
26772,"Do not let go!

Human: Fall Flat is a fun experience with friends. You have to complete a numerous amount of puzzles on different levels to pass the level. You have to work together with frienda, but be careful: some of your friends just want to watch the whole world burn.

The gameplay can be a little rough at the start but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easy and fun.

Setting up a multiplayer game takes less than a few seconds and the game provides a ton of fun.

10/10"
26773,"Great game but filthy developers.
I'd bought this game because it supported Linux. Developers just dropped Linux support recently. I can install the game but I cannot join the multiplayer game with Windows and Mac users.

Beware, Mac users, they can easily drop you too."
26774,Great game! is annoying though when you play with randoms all they do is throw you off the edge

26776,"Best game for playing with your friends
incredibly interesting experience
keep fail & fail
then success
that feel is so good!

but DON'T play it alone,boring."
26777,"Having a great time playing both solo and with my other half. Laughing so much it was totally worth getting. I doubt anybody could really feel disappointed playing this game, I do not know what more anybody could expect from it."
26778,"One of the most charming fun games I've played in a long time, well worth a look and I can't wait to try out some CoOp! 8/10, would be 10/10 if we had a workshop and map editor."
26779,nice game
26780,"super fun, short, but fun, looking forward to more levels"
26781,parkour
26782,Garanteed satisfaction.  This game made me laugh for 4 hrs straight.  Must buy.
26783,"Really fun, requires a brain tho"
26784,incredibly fun game with funny but logical mechanics. 10/10 to play with friends :)
26785,"This game is great, but it runs very poorly online, even with all settings set to very low."
26786,I broke my mouse playing this game. 10/10 would break mouse again.
26787,this is a funny floppy physics game with amazing puzzles to solve endless fun with you friends!
26788,"The game content is generally alright, however, they stopped supporting GNU/Linux (without prior notice!), which makes it impossible for me to play with friends. I find this move a complete betrayal of my trust and support, and would honestly rather get a refund than support a dev/publisher that thinks this move is an option, especially when they build on an existing Linux friendly engine - Unity."
26789,Unbelieviable. Never thought I could laugh so hard in a video game. For sure best played with friends. Maybe even enemies.
26790,I love this game!! it is very funny and it is......MULTIPLAYER WHOOOOOOOO!!!!! only one downside...WE NEED MORE WORLDS!!!
26791,The new assassin's creed game is looking prety good.
26792,It’s a mental breakdown DO DO DO DOOO DO DO DO DO DO
26793,nice game
26794,"Fell flat, would recommend 👍"
26795,the earth is flat
26796,"有人一起玩吗，一个人玩好无聊
anyone wants  
to play with 
me？"
26797,"Well made game, but It isnt very fun for me. I guess you can buy it if you love slow puzzle platformers. Other than that I can't say I enjoyed it."
26798,"This game have the most hilarious moments when it comes to team building. The physics is so hilarious that every youtuber should try it. Personally, this game can be greater if there's workshop or many maps in the meantime. It's fun to play alone as well as you feel freedom when playing it."
26799,Fun while it lasts but ends too soon. Be sure to play with friends. Probably not as enjoyable on your own.
26800,"One of the best games of the recent years, hours of fun with friend, so simple but yet so funny!
Very reccomended to play with friends or with random people online!!!
Kudos to the developers! Great job guys!"
26801,cool game
26802,The best funny puzzle game that i have ever played! Recommended!
26803,Very funny and fun puzzles to solve
26804,"PLEASE add more, or at least a workshop."
26805,"Great game! 
The game's atmosphere and soothing music is great when playing alone, and the physics just make playing with friends an unending laughing track."
26806,Best game 10/10
26807,Fun to play with friends.
26808,"This is INCREDIBLY LAGGY ON MAC.Other than that it's pretty good.
"
26809,"One of the best co-op games in the market, with the potential to rival the likes of Portal and co if the devs add online workshop. 9/10."
26810,"If you got sense of humor and a friend , well what are you waiting for ?!"
26811,"This game is just fun if you play it with friends if you play it solo like me get ready to frustrated alot because all the pyzzle is made for 2 or more people, you can do them alone but everything is more dragged out , the biggest breaking point for me was of course the boat level, try to row that boat alone was just dragged out frustration.

Buy only this game if you have some friends that is also going to buy it then you will have a blast but alone it will as the title suggest, it will fall flat."
26812,its GREAT  with friends . if u have a bit of humor you can have a lot of fun . but make sure to throw your friends of the map :D
26813,very entertaining and worth the price if you're looking for a light game and not so serious
26814,its good. the physics are fun to bugger around with. wish there was more levels though
26815,yeah boi
26816,Very good game i recommend it alot its even better with friends but they should are more levels and a workshop so we can see community maps and other things
26817,"it's fun, funny and addicting when it comes to play with your friends and need a good teamwork."
26818,"I love this game too much.so cute so funny
But that some achievements was so hard. especially ""Tic Toc"" and etc.
also i liked dark map. especially when i found second battery top of the building or the Far From The Moon achievement XD
Keep it up to date plz. you can add so much funny things to the game, like new maps.
TY :)"
26819,10/10. Needs more levels.
26820,great for trolling ur friend and/or speed running
26821,Edited: Workshop <3
26822,Never felt so drunk... ^^
26823,A must have game If you are bored with your friend(s). Most fun I had in a loooong time.
26824,"hmmmmmm
Well it's good & bad good 2 playthrough a few time's then it get's 2 easy good we have seen 3 new level's added Azteck Dark & Santa Map 
If u have ferind's & a way 2 chat multiplayer can be good without this tho it's just a clusterfuck of poeple speed running & completing the map b4 u can do anything about it 
So overall to sumerise 
7/10 
It's fun untill it isnt I guess ?
if they keep pumping out new level's tho & their normaly preety big too it will be well worth my $10AU $20 is standed price"
26825,Love this game
26826,20/10 would recommend
26827,"This is what you get when you combine deliberately frustrating ragdoll QWOP controls with a physics puzzle, and it's the worst of both worlds.

Walking around like you're drunk as hell is amusing at first, but when you combine it with a physics puzzle, it quickly stops being fun. 

I [i]almost[/i] liked this game, but the trains level was so abysmally horrible that it singlehandedly ruined the whole game for me. First off, you start off with a door to a maze that's blocked by some debris. Moving even [i]one piece[/i] of debris is a chore and takes way more effort to pull off than it ought to. You think one piece is bad? [b]There's a whole fucking pile of it blocking the door[/b]. Do you see my playtime? 25 minutes? 10 of them were spent moving debris from that fucking pile. And even after spending all that time moving it, I still couldn't get the door open all the way, because there was just too much debris. That was one of the most obnoxious gameplay moments I've ever experienced. After that, I had to get a light to light my way in the maze, and in the maze, I found a crate, which I had to drag out from the depths of the maze with the lantern in the other hand, in a maze with narrow hallways. This is supposed to be fun? I sure as hell didn't have fun tripping over that box while trying to escape from the maze. 

Afterwards, I somehow managed to get up the wall using the crate and struggled my way to the end. At this point, I was quite nearly fed up with the game. And after that, on level 3, with the elevator and the crate, after I fell off the high platform with the crate the second time, because the crate is too heavy and it just drags you down with it, I immediately quit, because that was the point where I knew I was fighting with both the QWOP controls and the physics engine.

Never make the player fight with the physics engine, that's bad game design. And I don't understand why physics puzzles are popular, because that's all you do in those games: fight with the physics engine. The whole [b]point[/b] of a puzzle is in figuring out the solution. Execution is secondary and should always be straightforward and not gut wrenchingly tedious. It's a terrible gameplay experience, and it hurts my fingers. If the player has to physically struggle to do something that should be easy, they are not having fun. If the player tries the same solution multiple times and gets different results because the slightest difference in any variable results in wildly different output, then they will begin to resent the physics engine. You can have awkward controls and wonky physics, and you can have tricky puzzles, but please, [b]don't combine them.[/b]"
26828,its a fun game to play with friends
26829,"PROS
+ Fun Puzzles
+ Many Levels
+ Great Co Op
+ Feels Fresh 

CONS
- Takes about an hour to get used to the Controls (So Don't Give Up!!)

Like playing Tomb Raider But Drunk... Love It..."
26830,"I HATE THE CONTROLS SO GOD DAMN MUCH it's so frustrating the puzzles aren't that hard and I know what to do but friggin blubberman over here stumbles around like a vagrant alcoholic and falls off the cliff because you have to angle the camera close to the ground to see what you're doing and can't see where the edge is or what you're grabbing making you have to start the level all over again.

That being said, I will continue playing this, it's pretty fun and interesting when the controls aren't making me violently spaz out and pitch my gamepad at the wall like a crazed lunatic. But for god sake, don't go into this expecting to really enjoy it unless you have the patience of Ghandi."
26831,Dope! Best Couch Co-Op'r
26832,i made sans undertale
26833,"This game had me and my friends bent over double in fits of laughter with the sheer amount of absurdity and stupidity we were able to pull off. The levels were well-constructed and the puzzles varied, with an incredible amount of (sometimes idiotic) solutions to them all. It's definitely the type of game that benefits from playing with others over single-player, but if you can play co-op you will not regret it. 

Thank you to the developers for this, it was just so much fun to fling ourselves about and just have fun. Would love to see more levels, or even workshop levels available. Loved the Dark level!"
26834,"I like, yes"
26835,The game is fun to play with friends but the dev dropped Linux support.
26836,all i can say is that i hope they add more and more maps so i can play more
26837,lol
26838,i like humen fall
26839,"Simple, elegant and brilliant."
26840,"Human Fall Flat is a game for people that like ragdoll physics and puzzles.
It's the perfect combination of an interactive environment and needing to think what you do.

Some of the puzzles are tricky to find and I love the fact that there are more ways to solve one, since this game puts no restrictions on what part of the level you can't come. 

Overall a really fun game, altough it doesn't take long to complete the levels, even in Single Player.
Would definitely recommend."
26841,not bad uce
26842,"This was very fun to play with my friend who recommended the game. I do feel like this game is similar to the Portal series, but more accessible, simpler and easier. Portal felt nice in solo and coop due to its complex nature, but this feels a lot more like a coop game. They made every level soloable, but I think it would be far more fun to play with friends. 

My first playthrough took about 2 hours. I think a 10 euro price tag is a bit much for that, and even the 5 euros I paid are a bit too much for something I feel like I'd play 1-2 times. 

It does however just work and is a great experience. From visuals to music to difficulty, this game is fun and a joy to play. 


I wish they'd improve the game by adding more levels and a custom level builder. If this gets a custom level builder, it will be worth 10 euros 100% of the time. 

In conclusion: I cannot say anything negative except for the price. 8/10 for the kind of game it is. 10/10 for a coop game."
26843,Need friends. Fun. Simple.
26844,fun and challenging
26845,VERY FUN GAME with friends but it needs multiplayer for steam workshop maps.
26846,"fell flat

26848,Awesome!
26849,A lot of fun to play 2-player!

26851,I strangle my brother and throw him off the map on this game
26852,"Just absolutely fun. I have seen fans of every game type jump in and enjoy ""Human..."", it's a unique experience. 10/10."
26853,unbearably laggy on multiplayer. Get a refund while you can

26862,"homans, and they fal flat"
26863,NEED WORKSHOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
26864,THIS GAME IS AWESOME
26865,most fun with friends.
26866,"Really fun game, had a lotta giggles. Reccomend taking breaks. but then you just go back on to it. Amazing with friends because its more fun when you drag them into the depths of hell.

It got a workshop and now its a perfect wanky janky yes"
26867,"it is so stupid, but I like it."
26868,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE. I HOPE SOMEHOW THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN MAP AND PEOPLE CAN PLAY IT. 10/10 PLEASE MAKE MORE MAPS
26869,"I'm going to put a thumbs up for this game, but there are some unreasonably tedius parts of the game.  The game was very fun though."
26870,"Best online CO-OP I ever played, many hours of fun. Huge thumbs up! And keep making more levels please..."
26871,Funny game
26872,help i think I'm addicted to this game
26873,"As a long time fan of human fall flat, Loving the game before 1.00, I can EASILY recommend this truly amazing game to ANYONE.

EDIT: I now have almost 2,000 hours in this game. I still love it.

EDIT 2: I have now passed 2,000 hours in this game. I won."
26874,jelly man: battle royale
26875,"Super fun with friends :D Wish there was workshop maps though.

Edit: They added workshop support! 10/10"
26876,I like this game so much its so fun
26877,"Needs steam workshop support. Lack of custom levels is holding this game from it's full potential.

Great gangbeasts physics engine,
Beautiful surreal landscapes
Great fun to co-op
9/10

"
26878,"is a good game
please do new level quickly , thanks
why my english is bad ,beacuse i am chinese .QAQ"
26879,Very funny game. Highly recommend. A+++ shipping
26880,"heheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh
great game, amazing with pals
very silly"
26881,7/10
26882,"The game currently does not work on Mac, which is a issue because they say it is mac compatible. But i have done research online trying to fix this issue and there apprently is no fix. so Devs please fix this issue"
26883,"The controls might be frustrating at first and the physics doesn't always make the best of sense. However, with a group of friends this is probably one of the best games you can play"
26884,great puzzle game! and very fun!
26885,"Before I start I would like to say that the game has potential to be magnificent BUT,

I bought this about a year ago and played it with my friends. Now when I check back after a year, they are advertising multiplayer as a new feature and have managed to release ONE new level. Most of the updates (of which there have been very few) have been localisation for new languages and skins. REALLY!?!? That's what the devs focus on? Also, still no workshop support, which means that you can expect about 5 hours of content from this game. And the game is 15€ so that's 3€ per hour... Linux support doesn't seem to be a thing anymore, despite being advertised when I bought this."
26886,"best game ever, never have i had this much fun!"
26887,Most fun I've had with friends. Maps have become more fun to play especially city
26888,"This game gives me depression and i think i'm going mad. Public workshop in my ass god dammit those maps are making you feel like a dumbass!
 10/10 Would die again"
26889,Buy this now if you have any friend willing to try it with you.  No matter what you will cry laughing and be genuinely challenged by the puzzles and alternate paths through them - Plus when they get community made steam workshop levels working online (currently local co-op only) then the only downside of limited online levels will be solved and I would happily play this for hundreds of hours.... and pay twice the price.
26890,"Don't try to play this game alone...

And also don't try to find online servers...

So just buy it to play with friends and at this moment you'll be able to have some fun."
26891,ddddd
26892,FUN GAME
26893,"Great fun with friends, controls weird at first, but it's an amazing time."
26894,If you aren't anoyed by your friends in game dragging you off the map and trying to ruin your progress this game is for you.
26895,Super fun to play with friends i couldn't stop laughing and puzzle solving was fun. Character looks so clowny and in 6 hours i laughed more than i laughed in months..
26896,"this game is super lit




ps: WaNt A sPrItE CrAnBeRrY?"
26897,very fun gaem you can have big laugh with friends but it needs workshop so people can create levels and such because you can finish it quite fast
26898,"This is the perfect game to play with friends! You're just goofing around most of the time and the puzzles are quite challenging!

Don't buy this game if u don't have friends!

10/10

"
26899,very fun game. defo worth.
26900,"I truly enjoyed playing this game, and played it more than once, alone and with friends. This game was one of my favourites, but then the developer decided to drop support for Linux. (I assume it was the developer's decision, since a lot of games from the publisher are still supporting Linux).

I honestly can't believe that they did this, since I have paid for this game, and should get the same content as those with Mac and Windows. Just because I can still play the game doesn't make it okay. We (Linux users) won't be able to get updates, and won't get online multiplayer even though we have paid the same amount as those with Windows and Mac who will get these features. We are paid customers. We should get the content that was promised to paid customers. 

The developer answered a post about the support for Linux being dropped ( https://steamcommunity.com/app/477160/discussions/0/1735468693704602016/?insideModal=1&ctp=5#c1735469327933155260 ). It is clear from the comments that many people are as unhappy as I am. 

In the post by the developer it says that Linux was dropped so that Windows and Mac versions could continue updating. This is ridiculous. Linux users have paid the same amount as Mac and Windows users, but are now being refused the same content. The Linux community that has payed for this game did not pay only to have support be discontinued, and new updates and multiplayer become unavailable to us. When we paid for this game, we expected that we would get all future updates and continue being able to enjoy the game the same as everyone else. This was assumed with good reason, since no-one buys a game thinking that in the future they will suddenly be refused content that will be given to others. Dropping support for Linux is extremely unfair towards Linux users, and makes the purchase we made a scam, since we have given money and not received what was promised to us.  

I realise that this change won't make too big a difference to the developer. After all, the Linux community is quite small compared to the amount Windows and Mac users. It saddens me that the developer still deems it okay to do this to us, even if we are not the majority."
26901,WELL THIS GAME SO FUNNY!! 9/10 *make more level!*
26902,"This is one of the funniest games I've played recently. 
Granted, I did it with a team of friends and using our very own discord voice chat, which made it even funnier, but the drunk baby reactions to your commands, the fact that you end up almost physically pushing yourself like you are your character to climb, and the many other silly things included in the game, make it a must try, even if just for the sake of it, despite it being or not your type of game.

I had a blast with it."
26903,Wasn't fun even for a sec.
26904,"10/10
Me and a friend played this game for around 8 hours, we completed all the maps, it was a bit dissapointing that the game was so short, but those where THE FUNNIEST 8 hours of our lives, this game is brilliant!"
26905,"Funny game 10/10 
"
26906,This is easily one of the best game I have ever played. Thank you for the laughs.
26907,"really bad if u have no friends, like me"
26908,"Entertainig  game which can be very frustrating, especially the Aztec level which has one or two annoying collision detection flaws which are hit and miss, once or twice the player fell through the large ball when jumping onto it and for some reason the see-saw can sometimes go through the blocking stick you place at the bottom when your character jumps on it which puts the see-saw out of position so you have to start from the checkpoint to get it level again. Worth a try but be prepared to be frustrated."
26909,"Absolutely hilarious little game, would like even more maps :D 10/10"
26910,"First of all, you may be wondering: ""How has he played 51 hours of this game...?"". The answer to that is to be given within this review.
Pros:
- Multiplayer is awesome.
- The physics add to more fun.
- There are many achievements to fill up all of your time.
- There are many ways of completing levels. For example, after I learnt how to climb things whenever I wanted, I climbed around the whole of Construction and finished the level that way.
- The developer is quite active for a one-man team. It is not easy to create a game as good as this all on your own (excluding the publisher).
Cons:
- Not too many levels but not too little -- takes 5 hours to complete roughly, depending on how you complete it: alone or with friends etc.
- Workshop has still not been added but as stated, this is not easy to implement as a one-man team.
- Quite boring if you are alone.

There is my answer to the question.

I have had this game before it was on Steam, there were only a few levels but still insanely fun!

If you are into games like Gang Beasts or Amazing Frog? then you may feel some nostalgia as this game has the same wacky physics but it is a lot more polished and always fun to speedrun.

EDIT:
The new level is really awesome and I had tons of fun with it, LOVING IT EVEN MORE!!
Also, there should be a new level by Christmas if they go with the same thing as they did last year; lots of content will be present!"
26911,Pretty funny physics platformer. 15/10 would question life choices again.
26912,"It's a straightforward physics based puzzle game with wacky movements and multiple ways to complete levels, as well as great character customization. most enjoyable with 1-2 friends."
26913,Ignore all the reviews that say this game is only for co-op. This game plays great as a single player experience.
26914,fun
26915,"I am sad to say, that I have this game on Linux. I will never get to experience the updates, because the Linux version was removed. I feel bad that I don't get any of the new updates. I still recommend this game, because I used to love it and play it all the time. I just can't look at the new updates, because the Linux version was cut."
26916,"Works great, but requests lot's of update. The campaign isn't very long and multiplayer has no meaning. 

Controls are good. Very simple and great. 
Campaign was good and it has some variation. It's cool to have small open world and to keep it filled with stuff. Not to make huge empty areas. 

In Multiplayer you have be in same places like when im campaign, but with people. It's nice too.

Few bugs occured during multiplayer and made the game not fun at all. Maybe fixed already no idea."
26917,"I love this game! Its fun with and without friends. Sometimes it gets difficult and confusing, but thats nothing a simple tutorial wont fix! The controls are simple to learn and use. This Game Is Amazing!!!"
26918,Cool game really enjoyed playing it with friends
26919,Great game to play with your friends. Each level has multiple solution depending on how many people you have or how lazy you are. I really recommend you play this.
26920,"This game is weird.

You control a clayman through platforming puzzles in a sort of Hard Mode version of OctoDad (sans story, heart or comedy). Like OctoDad, this game is better in coop, and hilariously frustrating with a friend. Alone, it's fine, but loses some of its magic. There's loads of replayability, so if you like weird and challenging 3D platformers, I'd definitely say this is worth trying out."
26921,"If you've ever wondered what it must be like to go outside and interact with the rest of the world on a high dose of psychedelic drugs, wonder no more....

11/10 would trip again"
26922,"+Very funny with friends
+Workshop levels
8.5/10"
26923,"A hilariously fun game to play with a friend. Lots of puzzles to work yourself around with (literally) and different solutions to said puzzles. The flailing/hopping/jumping and grabbing/groping is just the right mixture of handicaps a game like this needed and the perfect humouristic touch to a visually simplistic but pleasing game. 

9.5/10 due to not having workshop (yet)"
26924,is soooo good
26925,"Heck, you play as a muscular rock climber and a pathetic, flailing weakling all at once.
What more is to be said?"
26926,"Really fun game, especially when played with friends! 
It's short and needs workshop and more levels to be worth full price in my opinion. (I only paid £2, so I didn't mind)

So it's either wait for sale and buy cheap, or wait until more content is available.


"
26927,Noodle man makes Banjo happy. 10/10 would floop again.
26928,"frustrating af , game controls are awful but its playable."
26929,"This is so annoying and tiresome, and one of the funniest and most satisfying games I have ever played. There is no way I can describe the feeling of clearing the last map, that just filled me with warmth and the wish to play it all over again. Loved it, and 5/5 stars is nearly not enough."
26930,"best game of all time, needs multplayer for custom made maps"
26931,I like the game but the server sucks
26932,Terrible controls/movement system.
26933,"My goodness this is a fun game. Playing split screen with my wife, drinking and figuring out the puzzles is entertaining for hours."
26934,human fall fat
26935,"Very entertaining, frustrating af game... played with gf 12 hours straight to end. lmfao many times..."
26936,"Really didn't know what to expect when I started playing Human: Fall Flat and I haven't finished it yet but wow, what a fun game! It's the most fun I've had in co-op since the first time I started playing Portal 2 many years ago. Sure, Valve's eclectic (and perfect!) puzzler is a completely different game compared to the mad, sometimes incoherent QWOP-like gameplay of H:FF but for me it had the same feeling of wonder, fun and excitement when you finally solve a puzzle and make a breakthrough. 

Having said that, having a co-op friend to play it with (preferably couch co-op like we did) is the only way to fully enjoy the madness. We were constantly laughing histerically at all the unfortunate fumbling and semi-drunk messing about. Tons of fun! 8.5/10"
26937,It's good.
26938,"Extremely fun, and challenging. Great game to play with friends. Some of the things you'll discover are absolutely comical."
26939,"If there were more maps, I would like to spend more money."
26940,"itsa goed gam

26946,Great game! Good time killer.
26947,Amazingly fun as a co-op game with friends.
26948,"Its a really fun game to play with your friends, but the only prob, is just that the game is sooooo short. Like me and my friend did already complete the game at 3 hours."
26949,I didn't expect this game to be this entertaining.
26950,"This is one of the best games I have played with friends in a while, I was laughing so much!"
26951,This is a great game and i highly reccommend it.
26952,best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!
26953,cuccin
26954,good game
26955,Human Fat
26956,Needs a workshop though
26957,"Lots of fun, even single player. Got it this morning on sale and before I knew it a chunk of my morning was gone. Fun finding shortcuts and finishing levels in ways that weren't the most obvious. Nice change of pace from other games. One thing I can say is that your hands can get fairly sore by the time you stop playing."
26958,Short but very enjoyable for the price my friend got it (5 quid). Good game with tons of ways around things if you can manage to figure it out.
26959,"very nice

gives hoo hoo hee hees when played"
26960,"A good game with a good community. Ragdoll physics never glitch out, and puzzles are perfect. my only complaint is the control delay on some servers, but you can't really do much about that. 9/10."
26961,10/10 would spend hours climing shit with my friends again
26962,"i love this game it has a few mutyplayer glitches though like the fly glitch where if you jump repeatedly you fly
the high jump glitch witch is self explanatory but all in all i love it
"
26963,.
26964,"This game is great, even in single player you can get pretty far, and there's always at least two ways to do a puzzle. I highly recomend it, though controls on keyboard and mouse are a bit buggy."
26965,:)
26966,"This game is FUN but ending so quickly. So, level editor would be GREAT!!"
26967,"I'm not sure I'd ever buy this game unless you have friends to play with.

The puzzles are somewhat entertaining, but the fun of the game comes with playing with at least a few other people; shenanigans will ensue I promise.

The only other issue I have with this game is that there's such little content. They did just release a new level, but the entire game can be beaten in less than a few hours as of now. Only buy if it's on sale, $15 is not worth it."
26968,pretty good game but u will get bored . its good if u play with ur friends . i regret buying this game and i want a refund . so dont buy it from my opinion . its a waste of money
26969,"Great games , good graphics ... BAD CONNECTION  , to the point that my game would flicker green black purple lines . i think im blind now and relying on auto correct . I PLAYED 15 HOURS THE LAST TIME AND NOTHING BAD HAPPEN AND NOW I CANT PLAY IT AND IT IS STUCK AT MY LIBRARY . 3/10"
26970,"This is a bit of a strange little game. The physics are all good and the levels are creative (and the achievements, no matter how hard they sound, are relatively easy for most of them), multiplayer is lit, character customisation is pretty nice, and the price is suitable and affordable. Two thumbs up."
26971,Worst Assassin's Creed ever
26972,"totally recommend this game , fun game , and a good party game for friends"
26973,"Awesome game, the mechanics are pretty good too. Many ways to find the solution to problems."
26974,Amazing game. Tons of fun to play with friends! lots of replay value. Lots of updates ;) I would recommend this game!
26975,FUNNIEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED. Time flies so fast
26976,good game
26977,"Bored with a friend? This is a solution! Awesome game with awesome maps and mechanics


Please more maps! or workshop"
26978,"Beat the game including the new level in 9 hours or so playing co-op with my sister. We beat each level once in that time and had a blast the whole time. Most puzzels can be beat in multiple ways, most of which we didn't end up doing on our run. Look forward to future updates. A Great way to spend 15$ for 2 copies.

Edit: They added a steam workshop for player models and levels yesterday and there is already 9 levels after one day of the workshop being up. This is going to help extend the length of the game considerbly."
26979,Amazing... I have no more to say.
26980,is fun game
26981,I like the game it's a perfect balance between stupid and fun^^
26982,"tbh this game's pretty fucking mental but my friend can't afford it becoz his mam works as a school dinner lady, plz be cheaper thx xxxxx"
26983,"funny af with friends..
"
26984,"The game itself was fun when I was able to play it. after about 40 minutes I shut it down because I had stuff to do. 

When I tried to start it back up I had ran into an issue where the game will not start and just has a very small window which does not allow me to play it at all.

I have posted in the Steam Discussions looking for some help, no one came.

I wrote an email to the support techs, and while they gave me suggestions on how to fix it, ( the suggestions didn't work ) they went silent after I sent them an output log and it has been a week since I last heard from them.

The game may be fun but I don't know if I will be able to play it any more and with the way that support just went silent with no more help I can not give this game a thumbs up.

If I get it working again I will change this review, but for now I just cannot recommend it."
26985,"Love it  <3 
"
26986,enjoyed it a lot had a  lot of fun
26987,ok
26988,"Played alone, Human: Fall Flat is an interesting little puzzle game with multiple solutions to every map.
Played with friends, it's hours of fun haphazardly solving puzzles by breaking everything.  Switch between working together and actively keeping your friends from progressing.  Throw each other off the map and run away with puzzle items.  
There aren't many official levels, but it's worth the price if you're more interested in the experience than beating the game.  Workshop levels can be good too."
26989,FUN
26990,"This cheeky little indie game has no business being this much fun!

Great game to play with your mates for a chuckle
"
26991,: )
26992,my game has broke it glitchs and i just see a static screen
26993,"This game is a diffrent take on your normal platformer it is quircky, fun, and some of the puzzles will take a while to work out. I would'nt say this game was difficult but it will take a while to beat 100%"
26994,THINGS ARE GETTING SP00PY
26995,"Would have much preferred a control scheme like Grow Home. I get that it's supposed to be difficult to move, leading to hilarity, but it's just annoying most of the time."
26996,good
26997,"absolutely excellent, especially with friends on local"
26998,"If you enjoy physics based puzzle games then this might be for you! very enjoyable and sometimes funny game.

the only down side is there is only a few levels. 

other then that it got almost everything correct and for under 10$ it's a steal in my book. and as always these types of games are always more fun with friends!
"
26999,"Really fun to play with friends 



About all"
27000,Pretty fun game. Would recommend you buy it. Maybe its not worth 15$ if you play alone but if you play it with friends you are gonna have a lot of fun.
27001,At first it was fun. But after half an hour the ragdoll physics became a nuisance. Even the simplest jump / climb requires a concentrated effort. This constant struggle removes all joy and leaves you in a state of permanent anger.
27002,Really fun game but it DESPERATELY needs more levels.
27003,"Human: Fall Flat offers a unique puzzle solving platform to cooperate and and communicate with your friends. However that being said, the real enjoyment comes from the; bloodpressue spiking, artery bursting, good time you'll be inflicting on your friends while preventing them to completeing these puzzles. The deafing laughter of the as you get tossed off a cliff for going a little to far."
27004,I made a meatball man.
27005,a relly fun game the is that is diffently worth the buy on sale
27006,"Actually one of the funniest game you will ever find, teh replayability makes this game worth every penny. One of the most unplayed underrated games"
27007,"Even for half price  7,49 eur is alot to ask for a game like this, sure you can have alot of laugh playing it but its very simple and short , Three runs at most. bought cd key for like 3 euros or less, its worth that price, look  for CD keys only , not worth the original price !"
27008,"that is one of the most funny games i played, especially if played with friends! totally recommended"
27009,Funny
27010,Kötü az level çok para
27011,"very easy going, great with friends, char customization has very high potential if you put the time in to make something great, nice soundtrack to add some depth to air humping standing at the top of a cliff

although I do wish I could go return of the Jedi on some asses and dunk other players off the edge"
27012,"awesome game, alot of fun to play with friends, spes if evey one has a bit to drink. should really try it."
27013,"It's a good game. It was very fun and time wasting to play this with friends/randoms or alone. It would be awesome if they added in more levels or even custom levels that players could create and share. I would recommend buying it if you haven't already.

Edit: More levels!!"
27014,"Great Multiplayer game, Loads of fun"
27015,"Played with Friends, We laughed so hard that our stomachs started hurting and tears came out of our eyes. Highly Recommend this game !!"
27016,like it
27017,Weird hilarious game
27018,Yes.
27019,Very disappointed in the developers for dropping Linux support. Will not be supporting this company in the future.
27020,this game is good its just in this update they took out friends severs so now when i join an online game i have a 70% chance of getting kicked because i apperentally wasnt invited overall its really good but just add friends severs back in
27021,"This game was an absolute joy to play until the release of the newest level 'Dark.' I finished it with my friends, and boy do I regret it. I can no longer sleep. The nightmares are too intense. Every time I start to doze off, I find myself waking back up screaming. If you decide to purchase this game, PLEASE do not play the level 'Dark.' I'm begging you.
Good game 9/10 needs more levels."
27022,"good game, play"
27023,"It's almost uncanny how the more friends you play with, the harder it gets to solve any puzzles....but I've probably never laughed so hard"
27024,"Love this game, so many laughs and fun times with friends! Strongly reccommend it to any and all! hopefully they introduce workshop, that would make my day."
27025,"Climbing, puzzles, losing your friends over your differences of who should be thrown off of a cliff.

All and all, cant complain."
27026,it good.
27027,This is a super fun game to play with friends. I'm glad they have a new update with new content. I look forward to playing it with my friends again. They need to add workshop so players can make fun maps while we wait for more official maps + content to be released. I heard that they're working on it so fingers crossed it comes soon.
27028,"My friend gifted me this game and i thought it was going to be a game that we play once and forget about, but to my surprise ths game was incredibley fun and at some points me and my buddies got competitive in it. I highly recommend this game for people who like teaming up and messing around. The customization is extensive and very customizable. The only thing that bugs me slightly is the fact that there is no workshop that would be a great adition and would keep this game fresh and alive."
27029,good game very fun with friends and not hard to 100% ;)
27030,Did you never dream about a game like this in your childhood? Good game 2 play with friends
27031,The puzzles are great! The way you move the way you pick up things the sillines in this game is perfect!
27032,"This game is unique, and offered a silly break from many a competitive game. I would be tempted to recommend it. 

However.

Support for Linux was silently dropped. This has become a different product than originally paid for. One where future goals were listed on game page. 

Please tell me if support is added again, but for now I'll have to ask for a refund."
27033,çok güzel oyun arkadaşlarımı kucaklayabiliyorum
27034,If you play FPS and other popular game this will certainly be a great break. One of the most interesting and entertaining games I have ever played. Especially with friends.
27035,"I sadly had to return this game.
While it is couch multiplayer, and good...
Its physics engine might cause some people headaches (like my gaming partner)."
27036,Game is perfect when you play with your friends. The only thing which is negative: the game is quite short.
27037,"If you like goofy mechanics and something great to play with a friend while simultaneously laughing your asses off, this is a game for you. It's a great puzzle game with amazing floppy models and ragdoll physics. An entire button dedicating to just going limp it's hilarious.

DEFINITELY recommend, either playing alone or with a friend. But, it's much more fun with a friend."
27038,extremely interesting with friends
27039,"Really good, i had it in my libery for a while. however the new level is awsome! :D dark is amazing and really makes you think. i like the way they went with it."
27040,"Super fun game!

Picked it up as it was something i thought my girlfriend and I would would enjoy (she loves puzzles and thinking games) and we absolutely loved it!
Would love some more content, but i imagine thats tough considering it isn't update that much. other than that get it!"
27041,Great game for ~10 hours of unique enjoyment with friends.
27042,10/10
27043,"My favorito glitch is gone
"
27044,"+ fun with some friend(s)
+ takes 6 - 10 hours to complete

- rather boring alone
- some frustrating levels & controls

get it on sale for 3 - 5 bucks"
27045,"""The most fun i've ever had in a game"". This preety much sums up the experience I had with the game, I mean, I almost peed on myself from how much i laughed playing it xD Soo good, totally recommended, also hope they bring workshop support :D
EDIT: They did indeed bring the workshop aaaand it's amazing! <3"
27046,"-struggled to climb the new castle
-finds 2 tesla coils
-finds frankenstein
-gets really excited about waking him up
-spends like 10 minutes finding the cables
-finally it's time to wake him up
-literally launches itself to orbit

11/10 would launch again"
27047,"Human fall flat a tediously entertaining flow of puzzles, with mechanics you don't see but rarely, it's puzzles can be solved in one way or another and multiplayer can be even more tedious yet easier at the same time
10/10 here 
I like throwing things off the edge
(Including my pals in multiplayer)"
27048,"amazingly funny
"
27049,very fun yes
27050,you can literally just keep pressing the jump button for the last two levels and fly throught the entire rest of the game
27051,"Great game with friends but really only enjoyable for a few hours. The levels are fun to play and fun to revisit and see how we can solve them differently and mess around, but the game REALLY needs workshop content.

UPDATE: It now has workshop content and the game is fantastic! :D  Lots of creative people in the workshop and the levels are fun (and chaotic)!"
27052,9 out of 11
27053,"Great game, absolutely requires you to play with friends for the best experience!"
27054,me and my friend love this game its amazing
27055,"This is by far one of the best games I have ever played, also one of the funniest. There were times that I laughed so hard I struggled to play. It was great fun playing this with my dad, as we both were laughing our heads off every 5 seconds at the goofy characters! (I found it very funny how they walked and especially how they fell over on demand!)

The puzzles were fantastic, and also quite tricky at the same time. Each level was unique and had many places to explore, I especially enjoyed the level where you had to collect the coal and take it to the furnaces. I liked how each level looked.

Playing this game with a friend is very good and I recommend it, as it is hilarious pushing your friend around the screen all the time, and it is also quite satisfactory to push your friend off of cliffs haha.

The graphics in the game were pretty good, other than jitters when you panned the camera. It was quite pleasing to the eye how simplistic the game looked. 
 I did experience a bug as I played; there was this weird cube that would appear randomly whilst playing and it would slowly take up the whole screen, making it black! The only thing I didn't enjoy about this game was how short it was! (I would love to see a Human: Fall Flat 2!!)

In conclusion, Human: Fall Flat is such a fun and enjoyable game that is great value for money, I would happily play it again."
27056,I would love to enjoy this game but I have no friends.  SadFace
27057,"This game is simply awesome! Lots of fun when played with friends, especially because of countless failures :D"
27058,WHY THE STORY FOR SPLITSCREEN IS TOO SHORT
27059,"This game is hilarious!! I love their ability to always fall, realistic physics, and the character creation! I did more of a detailed review here https://jaxscorner.wordpress.com/2018/12/02/human-fall-flat/"
27060,yall should really make more levels or open it up to modding/sandbox. game was really fucking fun.
27061,ADD PVP AND WEAPONS
27062,I havent laughed so hard with my firends playing a game in a very long time... just get this game...its hilarious!!!!!!!!!!
27063,"My wife and I absolutely love playing this game together! She's not very mechanically skilled when it comes to games but in this game that makes it even more enjoyable and hilarious as long as you can get some basics down. In fact, much of this game is about solving puzzles first and ""mastering"" the mechanics of your Pillsbury doughboy second.

But this only feels like half a game. Don't get me wrong, the devs have done an amazing job with the game but, in this day and age of Steam gaming, [b]workshop support is essential[/b] for a game like this. Still, regardless of the current lack of workshop support, this game deserves a full 10/10, [i]especially when playing with friends.[/i]

Workshop support would just unlock the full potential of this already top-notch game, which honestly would put it at 15/10 in my book. ;)"
27064,"Incredibly fun and sometimes frustrating, but always amusing.

Needs a Detective Baby Legs costume to complete the experience."
27065,"This might be the best physics game you can find on Steam.  Getting used to the control scheme might take some time but once you get used to it, there is a lot of fun to be had."
27066,"Human Fall Flat is by far the funniest game I have played in recent times!! The number of times I've nearly died from laughter because of this game is unbelievable.

This game definitely plays the best with friends. I'd have to agree with the majority in the sense that the game is a bit short, a few more levels built to the same standard as the rest would make this game unbelievable.

I'd recommend this game to everybody."
27067,"super fun with friends and stupidly good physic probably my only complaint is that the game is short like really short, if you knew what you were doing then you could easily beat the game in under 10 hours.  that wouldn't be so bad but you cant really keep playing the game a lot because after the first time you beat it, it becomes really boring and repetative"
27068,shitty game
27069,"This is a great game, absolutely hilarious to play with friends - just needs more levels and this would be a masterpiece! major thumbs up 9/10 - would be 10/10 if it had more levels!!!!"
27070,Jerry!
27071,it is really fun and so so so so so so so so SO SO SO SO SO SO ............................................................FUUUUUUUUUUUUNYYYYYYY
27072,"good, but give us custom maps pretty please :)"
27073,"It is very fun to play with friends, though I find that there is a hint of input lag online. The physics are fun to mess around with and it is an all-around enjoyable experience. It is also worth noting the customisation on your character, you can customize your human by painting him, which is really good for expressing yourself. Great game."
27074,"The game is pretty short, but it is very much fun with your friends.

Sadly the Developer decided to silently drop Linux support, So we won't be getting Online Multiplayer.

Appearantly they chose easy over right, and give the finger to customers that already paid because they can not deliver on their promises.

They do not care about the future of PC gaming, With actions like these you work against a free (as in freedom) gaming market for the future. Whats next, future games only released on the Windows Store?

I applied for a refund, But the Developer and the Publisher are straight up ignoring me.

Not a single response on my Emails. Do yourself a favor and steer clear from this Dev and Publisher.

If any more people have the same refund problem as me, let me know, i will help you, Because i will get my 15 euros back.

I do not care about the money, But i rather give it to a hobo than to scam artists like these."
27075,"Autism Simulator 2018

Damn fun with friends. 10/10 would do autistic stuff with climbing"
27076,Played with 3 friends and had the most fun ive ever had in a game. Absolute joy.
27077,"it's good
"
27078,You can make blacksypticeye
27079,"Frustrating controls and game mechanic that is fun due to novelty factor for 20 minutes. After that, it is just annoying."
27080,Just idiotic and way too much fun :D
27081,Fantastic game!
27082,"Broken Controls, boring repetitive puzzles. All around not a good game."
27083,"This is a great game, there should definitely be a sequel or more levels via DLC. If you enjoy puzzle games this is a must have.

Pros:
- Levels start off easy and brief, but gradually get harder - the difficulty curve is good.
- A unique concept in my experience.
- Most of the puzzles aren't *too* difficult until you get towards the end.
- Playing local co-op with a friend is a lot of fun.

Cons:
- Particularly difficult parts can get frustrating enough without having to wait 15 seconds after a respawn for your marshmallow man to get up again.
- If you get stuck in an area too long a general indicator of where you should be headed would be helpful (e.g. 'go to this point' could help you figure out how to cross the gap, etc).
- I get why the climb mechanic was removed, but another shortcut in the Water level (the worst one IMO) would be nice, especially for those trying to get the head-first achievement. Having to play all the way through the level 4 times takes the fun out of it.

Verdict: 9/10"
27084,Awesome game to play with friends. Needs workshop support beacsue there isnt very many levels.
27085,"Laughed for 5 hours straight I got a six pack and asthma.

Edit: Closed the game and I'm still laughing."
27086,I grabbed my friends butt
27087,Deez Nuts
27088,"if u speedrun the game its like 7.4 minutes long 


0,49/π"
27089,its a nice game (also if you want to play this game u should play with a friend)
27090,laughed so hard that I forget I was in a bad mood. 10/10. Best with friends!
27091,"First of all i have to say that i think this game is really fun. All the maps are well made and had a lot of fun while playing them. But the reason i rate this thumbs down is because there are no variation in this game. There is litterally 1 goal with every map(to get to the finnish line) and its only like 8 maps available. It took like 3 hours to complete the whole game wich i was okay with when i bought it because i got it when it just came out. But now, when i return like 2 fucking years later NOTHING has been added. No workshop or anything. This could be such a nice game but i dont know what the developers are doing. I think its a scam selling this for 15 euro when it takes 3 hours to complete."
27092,Hilarious game with friends. The controls are very intuitive and original.
27093,So much potential for everything to go wrong. I love it.
27094,The game is amazing but something that would be amazing would be if there was vr support just imagine it ziplineing through the sky rideing the gondala it would be awesome
27095,this game is good for people that has patients
27096,Really fun to play with friends or your S/O.
27097,honk
27098,Really fun game! Lacking content and I've been waiting such a long time for it...
27099,"This is one of my favorite games I have on steam. I played a little in single player and enjoyed it, but the real fun is with friends! I love just grabbing another person and messing them up while they try to do something. I enjoy trying to get somewhere where you do not belong, or at least have to do something else to get there. I like the platforming and puzzles that make you think. It is like Portal only funnier! I suggest to pick this game up if you enjoy puzzles, platforming and just all around hillariousness! Good in solo, but great in online! Get this game if you play online with friends!"
27100,The best 10 out of death
27101,"A drunk simulation game haha. Fun and charming. Has a few bugs if anti-aliasing is turned on you get a black graphics glitch that can only be fixed by restarting the game, so turn it to none and bug doesn't happen. The climbing controls take some getting used to but practice makes perfect."
27102,"This game is pure garbage don't waste your money for it
go get gang beast 
this game is boering full of bugs and only 4 maps 
don't waste your money
just send me a friend request and buy me a game that i would ask 
"
27103,wow gang beasts lookin different
27104,human ball fat
27105,i only know laugh when play this funny game
27106,"It's a fun little puzzle game with a cartoony style and a reasonably functional physics engine.

It's not really to my taste, but for what it is, it's decent. If the trailer appeals to you then you'll probably like this game."
27107,PLEASE ADD A WORKSHOP AND MORE MAPS!!!! im putting a no so devs and creators can see this review although I give this game a total YESSS!!!
27108,Extremely amusing and entertaining combined with interesting physics based puzzle design!
27109,its nice
27110,"It's fun to play it with friends, but I don't have any...
"
27111,"i love it
"
27112,"Be sure to drop your friends off cliffs as often as possible, because they will most likely do the same."
27113,"Really fun game when you play with friends.

Only thing missing is Workshop with more Maps."
27114,"Great fun with friends, character customisation has near endless possibilities."
27115,fantastic game
27116,"Crazy fun to play with others. Similar to Gangbeasts and the like, but the fact that it's co-operative elevates it to another level."
27117,"I picked up a copy of this game for my girlfriend and myself to try out. I was hoping to find a co-op game that wasn't too hectic and that would not have complicated controls. Pretty much so my gf wouldn't feel overwhelmed. Human: Fall Flat did a real good job fulfilling that for me. The completely dumb ideas we tried to traverse the maps and the hilarious ragdolling responses the character models did gave us so many hours of knee-slapping laughs.

We had played other games with a similar style to this such as Gang Beasts, and while I loved that game as well I just wanted larger maps and more platforming. Well Fall Flat definitely had that covered.

If you are looking to just mess around with friends and grief each other while trying to solve platformign puzzles then this is the game for you.


"
27118,"Very enjoyable with friends, and you will probably spend a big chunk of your time trying to drag each other to your deaths. Levels are interesting and unique, and provide multiple ways to complete them."
27119,come on do smth more !!!!
27120,"fun with trucks, and fun to just jump artound"
27121,"best game ever to play with friends, simple and fun to play"
27122,I recommend play with friends
27123,"很有意思的游戏，搞笑，但又不失正经。简单的游戏中包含着丰富的物理知识，同时充满了对人性的思考，反映出社会的种种现状...（我TM在瞎BB什么）
操作还是挺有难度的，手残党慎重，小心坑队友，不过好上手。很喜欢软软的样子。"
27124,"Fun game, fun controls and physics"
27125,Stupid fun with friends. A physics-based puzzle game that offers many solutions to every puzzle. Most of my time spent in this game was just messing around with friends and finding creative and silly ways to solve each puzzle. Think outside the box and break the game as the developers intended you to !
27126,"The game is a lot of fun with friends, especially if they are playing it for the first time & trying to learn the controls."
27127,"most fun with friends ever.

maps are really open, you can do whater you like!"
27128,"Waow pls recommend 
play with friends"
27129,":D very fun game, looking forward for the Custom Maps on the workshop to play"
27130,"+ A lot of fun with friends. 
- Too short
- Some random bugs"
27131,"this is one hell of a game! you have ragdoll physics, buttons, boxes andnaivity and youve got a great puzzle game! I highly recommend this game. 10/10"
27132,"FUN GAME!
BETTER WITH FRIENDS!!!"
27133,"I have only put a few hours into this game but its pure simple fun, great for parties and best with a partner or team. Its dumb its simple and I would not change a thing about it!

Buy it on sale! Have freinds to play it with! No money, No freinds... well your SOL my dude!"
27134,Had fun solving puzzles with friends and throwing them off the edge of the world. When I played though there were only a few missions.
27135,Fun game to mess around with putting things together and falling off cliffs but it has a glitch where you can keep jumping then easily go anywhere on the map. so that removes all challenge.. Needs more refinement
27136,10 sweet and supple bods out of 10 sweet and supple bods
27137,"Fun, played this game as a duo, I can Imagine chaos where more than 3 more people are involved."
27138,"Honestly an amazing game. My friends and I got it while it was on sale, and we had a blast jumping, flipping and just derping around each level. We had even more fun on the Aztec level, where we spent at least an hour attempting to ride the boulder to the end."
27139,"Fun as all hell, way better with friends sometimes bug happen but they are at least enjoyable"
27140,"Whilst the worlds themselves are very entertaining in themselves due to their character and interactivity, it's the amount of (unintended) sabotage and whimsiness multiplayer allows that makes this game one of my LAN favourites.

I can thus heartily recommend this game as a great choice for a gaming session with friends."
27141,flop flop i am human yas is gud game
27142,<3
27143,Meh. Funny to watch but annoying for a casual game session.
27144,Most hillarious game I have played since a long time !
27145,"Very fun to play with friends, alas i hab no friends. One day i will find a friend to play wif me"
27146,"Most fun you can have with friends for a couple hours. 

Lacks content tho.

If they can get a workshop going for this game it would be huge."
27147,Best game for multiplayer i've ever played. bring a friend or 2 and you will not be disapointed
27148,"Love this game, play it with friends and you might just rip their head off trying to solve some of the puzzles."
27149,Had loads of fun in this game until the infinite jumping glitch. Killed the vibe of the game completely. Not worth to play until the glitch is fixed.

27151,This game is truly fun when you playing with friends
27152,this game taught me what true friendship and betrayal is
27153,The 4 copies I got for $6 something was worth it for all the glitches alone.
27154,"A wonderful game that emphasizes how the puzzles are solved more than actually solving them.  Due to simple mechanics, a well-designed physics system, and numerous puzzles, this game is remarkably entertaining and humorous.  I found myself laughing at this game the whole way through.  This game, while still enjoyable alone, shines when played with friends.  I highly recommend you get at least one friend to play with you."
27155,"This game is really good. I've played a few hours with some friends and it's so enjoyable. I bought it from a third party website called cdkeys for just £1.99 which is really great value. I'd like to see some more maps in the future as there are about 10. Apart from that, the game is awesome!"
27156,This game is a ton of fun in both single and multiplayer!
27157,"This game is really fun for how stupid it looks.

I don't know how fun this would be only playing single player mode, but this is quality multiplayer with some friends.   

I agree with others that it would greatly benefit with some new maps or workshop support, but even without it, you've still got hours of stupid hilarity with pals."
27158,v good
27159,"I just wanted to complete my achievments so i could get some XP, but this game is worth whatever its price tag is. Its fun."
27160,Havent had this much fun in a while
27161,"Insanely fun puzzle-platformer that works much better when you have friends to ruin your plans. Almost certainly worth the pickup, especially on sale."
27162,It's pre good 10/10
27163,Sick
27164,<3
27165,"This game is alot of fun. It would be even better if they added new maps and workshop, but I think they are working on it."
27166,The best game I've ever played. Ever
27167,nice
27168,"One of the most fun games to play with a friend, challenging puzzles"
27169,we need new maps！！！！
27170,10/10

27179,Good fun to kill time with friends and see the amount of failures that will happen
27180,Game of the year.
27181,Great fun and always good again. It makes addictive.
27182,This is a must-have game for online multiplayer hijinks.  It's an absolute blast to play with friends.  It could use more maps but what's there will provide hours of fun and can be replayed several times without getting stale.
27183,good game
27184,"Playing singleplayer isn't bad, but I'd still recommend getting some friends to play this with you"
27185,"i love this game so much lol, it's so funny. it's very easy once you do them a few times except aztec. i can't do that one. but it's very time consuming but i have one problem. when im playing with my friend, some maps (like aztec) make one or the other lose connection but work perfectly fine when we play them alone. sooo idk. but i love this game overall."
27186,"Lacking in the amount of maps, would be better with a larger array of maps. However, great with friends."
27187,Really fun with friends. Just setup a voice chat and enjoy the hilarious moments. Well thought levels and mechanics.
27188,i'm flaccid
27189,good
27190,Very good game that is fun with friends. One problem is there are so many ways to get over walls and skip the whole level but other than that very fun game!
27191,"This games fun, but more fun with friends, less fun without good yes !"
27192,I really liked this game for it's creativity and is especially fun with friends. It's a silly game with a lot of heart put into it.
27193,top!
27194,Human: Fall Flat is a quirky open-ended physics-based puzzle platformer set in floating dreamscapes.  100% true what the game developer stated. best 3d puzzle game i seen so far since 2016. love it and 100% recommenced :)
27195,6 hours straight laughing
27196,"This game is one of the most fun games I've ever played. It has up to 8 player coop so nobody gets left out and it's easy to find a nice sized group to play. I would recommend getting this game on sale (it frequently goes on sale for $7.99) [strike] because it is rather short.[/strike] It has a lot of replay value though so that should keep people entertained. It's real good.

Edit 11/17/2020: Several times since this game came out have there been updates that add new levels, some of which were created by the community. The game is not nearly as short as when it first came out and seems to be constantly coming out with free additions."
27197,This is so fun fun fun!!!!!
27198,"great ... 
funy , nice and simply gameplayed game :))))"
27199,Wonderful and amusing little game. Highly recommended.
27200,nice game and good for friends
27201,Simple but fun. I love this game far more than i would have ever guessed i would.
27202,"Silly, fun chaos.  The perfect kind of multiplayer game."
27203,"10% time is passing lvl
90% time is ****** around w/ friends"
27204,"[b] Made my character look like myself. Never knew I looked so ugly. [/b]

[b] 10/10 [/b]"
27205,nice
27206,"This is a fun little game to play with one to three of your friends. You control a funky little dude with balancing issues while trying to solve the physics based puzzles. The levels are varied and scale in difficulty at a reasonable pace.

In my experience everything usually goes smoothly until one person decides the world isn't big enough for you and tries to throw everyone else off the edge.

15/10 would throw my friends off the edge again"
27207,The best game to play with best friends.
27208,"Human Fall Flat is a very nice game to play with Friends.

Very Funny and Awesome Game :D

would buy again
10/10"
27209,"short but very fun, hopefully they'll add workshop and new maps soon"
27210,"Pog



The game summed up in a quote:

""HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED UNTIL DAWN? WHICH DECISION DID YOU DO AT THE START?"""
27211,Best co-op game ever :D
27212,"If You're looking for a New Cool Game to play with your Friends then this Game should be Perfect for you

Insanely Fun & Entertaining, All of the Hours I spent in this Game were Amazing and the amount of Joy it bringed is unmeasurable, Maps that are really Cool, Interesting & Challenging in some way and some can even be Customized by You (or Anyone who has this Game) & At Last New Interesting Mechanics that I've never seen in another Game that made the Game this Good.

There's not a Single Reason why You Shouldn't get this Game. It's not Too Expensive and the Money is Really Well Spent after your Purchase it and Play It."
27213,"A really fun experience with friends. Sadly, it can be completed pretty fast. I recommend you buy it when it's cheap, because it's fun, but the full price might be alot for the amount you get."
27214,"I love this game, it's hilarious to play with friends"
27215,"extremelly fun, when playing not alone, and doing some things not by rules"
27216,Great to play with friends! Difficulty is just perfect to make you think but not loose interest in the game.
27217,It is a good physics puzzle platformer. Not groundbreaking at all. But incredibly funny when you play with friend(s) in a couch co-op. It maybe needs workshop for custom levels to extend variability.
27218,I love it *___*
27219,Super fun with friends. Highly recommend!
27220,FUN AF WITH FRIENDS
27221,"such a waste of money, it was easy to finish this game"
27222,This is a fun little game to mess around in with friends. Would have much more replayability if we had a workshop or something that created new content.
27223,"Fun Game, a bit too short, still hoping for a Workshop Update then this game will be a beast forever.
"
27224,Insanely fun with friends 10/10
27225,I have already won this game twice and re-installing it to play it again. Its just too funny especially with friends.
27226,Really good game but short 3h play time with fooling around
27227,This game has hours of fun for a pretty cheap price. the fun is multiplied with the amount of friends you add.
27228,good
27229,BEST GAME EVER SUPER GOOD PLEASE CONTINUE MAKING THIS GAME ITS TOO GOOD
27230,amazing game.
27231,Very good with friends
27232,Its fun because its stupid.
27233,Bears a striking resemblance to trying to control a drunken monkey via telepathy.
27234,"The ""Better With Friend"" Award :D"
27235,"Honestly, it's just a whole crap ton of fun with friends."
27236,Goofy and fun
27237,Make workshop update please
27238,"10/10

This game is 100% worth every dollar, especially if youre looking to buy during a steam sale.
"
27239,"Best co-op i've ever played, so much fun."
27240,Definately a fun game to play with a few friends!
27241,"Great/10, this game is simply adorable. Best played with a friend, significant other, family, or sworn enemy you're trying to make amends with. It's too cute to not enjoy no matter who you're playing it with"
27242,"Top notch stuff, all it needs is native support for player built levels inside the game with an easier way to access the workshop, as well as multiplayer support for custom levels."
27243,"Played this with 5 mates all through the game, absolutely hilarious
Really hoping the custom maps multiplayer support comes out soon then will have a ton more content for us to enjoy together"
27244,"This game. How can I describe it... Friends and I bought it on a whim and can sure without a doubt, the best purchase I've made in a long time. Never written a review before but this game deserves it. Friends and I were in tears just playing anmd messing around with the puzzles and mechanics. 10/10."
27245,"Literally the most infuriating, hilarious and silly game ive played in recent years. Best played with your most annoying friends who will sabotage all progress you make by pulling you off the edge. Highly recommend!"
27246,Best described as a goldmine of pure fun
27247,This game has a brilliant feel and humour to it that makes it great to play with friends. The mechanics take a bit of getting used to but are rewarding in the end. Also using a webcam to customise your character can end with terrifying results!
27248,"This game is very fun. However, I think that the play is even better with friends."
27249,Lots of fun single & mutliplayer. Definitely recommended!
27250,"Great game to play with friends, full of stupidity that comes with the controls. Love the puzzles too, they provide great entertainment value with the various mechanics that are discovered through the course of the game."
27251,It's a fun game to play with friends
27252,Amazing
27253,Really fun with friends. Having it integrated into the Steam Workshop would really enrich the game and improve the re-playability.
27254,"It's just plain fun. Get a friend and play every level. It's totally worth it.
And bringing it to 100% makes it double fun"
27255,Very fun game to play!
27256,"fun with friend 
still have some bugs thou"
27257,Hilarious game play. The avatars move so clumsy you cannot help laughing. The puzzles are not too frustrating. So a thumbs up.
27258,Human Fall Flat is the one of the most funniest game I've ever played.
27259,"I want  refund it. But I also don't.


Edit: This game I think revived itself with the addition of the workshop.

Edit 5/27/19: Wow this review is horrible. This is a fun co-op game, especially fun with friends. It's one of those games that you see in your steam library and you play for a little bit, and either never play again or play a little bit every now and then.

Also there is speed running."
27260,"nice game 
"
27261,8/10
27262,"Human Fall Flat is a simplistic 3D third person puzzle/adventure game which, in the spirit of Goat Simulator, experiments with loosely implemented physics models as a core mechanism. 

The game is fairly well polished and a cut above most of the low effort puzzle game bundleware that gets peddled on Steam, with 4K support and reasonable framerates and optimisation, so people who are big fans of puzzle games might want to consider this one."
27263,found infinite jump glitch
27264,"Great game to play with friends, lots of laughs and rage. Needs new maps or workshop soi we can make our own places to play though as after an hour or so when you have done the mission its all over rover. Steam need a MEH! option."
27265,Unbearably dull to play alone but an excellent experience with friends. Grab a couple and have fun!
27266,"This game is a lot of fun if you have friends to play with!

Still waiting on workshop support tho >.>"
27267,"Happy game make human happy.

Nice game!

“只要我的手够长，就没有我去不了的地方”

“只有岛田家的人才会爬墙”"
27268,kool
27269,Such a cool game to play with your friends
27270,"Game is only really fun with friends, but holy shit when you do have friends to play with the game can be crazy. Everyone doing their own thing and hindering everyone. Its all good fun. Needs workshop for maps and maybe gamemodes"
27271,"This game is a blast with friends, if they've got good humor, enjoy speedrunning, or even have to get everything done perfectly. Also makes for an interesting platformer(? Does that count with a game like this?) when playing alone. Lots of secrets to look for and interesting optimizations/ways to break sequencing."
27272,"Very good and fun co op game. Worth it if you get it for 50% on sale! You can get around 10h of playtime.

Its to note that the game gets new maps once in a while. WORKSHOP SUPPORT!"
27273,"Human Fall Flat is a stupidly simple yet fun game, and perfect to play with friends. Only to play with friends actually, since there isn't much to do in singleplayer and the fun comes from cooperating and interacting with other people.

The greatest downside of the game is a lack of levels and more content overall, as it is a very short experience. Having more levels added or even a feature to create/upload new levels would make this game perpetually enjoyable, but as it is now you can get a good afternoon of fun. I believe there is still unexplored potential in there, since the core gameplay is very fun and flexible.

I recommend this game if you are looking to have simple and dumb fun with a group of friends, but don't expect a lot of replayability since the novelty of the gameplay can worn out fast with the lack of more levels. Still greatly enjoyable and worth playing."
27274,funny
27275,fun as fun itself
27276,Great to play with friends.
27277,"One of the best games to play with friends, will have you dying from laughter. 10/10"
27278,it's fun playing this game with your friend you'll til death ^
27279,"By far the funniest physics puzzle game I have ever played. Controls might be a bit tricky at the beginning but as soon as you mastered it, you start do to all kinds of crazy stuff. Like destroying a stack of stones by shooting your friend at it with a catapult."
27280,Very enjoyable to play with friends.
27281,Its a really enjoyable physics puzzle game that has a great soundtrack. Playing with friends makes this game 4 times better.
27282,"Veeeeeery funny game to play with friends. No, seroussly it is goooood."
27283,Experimenting with how far you go by exploting the physics mechanics is the most fun part of the game.
27284,"At its core Human: Fall Flat is a physics based 'puzzle' game.
The game provides simple but satisfying levels to manipulate your way through, and there are always a plethera of ways to complete these (which takes, give or take, 5 hours).

However...

Human: Fall Flat is not meant to be played by the rules, no...
All you need is to get some friends together and you get quite the diamond in the rough; betrayal, murder, mystery, hate, love, I won't let go Jack moments, anything your heart desires...
It may start with just one friend, but in my experience a chain reaction is triggered where you end up with a full lobby to kill, rape and pillage with.

You'll have fun playing this game, through its buggy nature and simple design, because it's just a wonderful bonding experience.
The main negative are the sore cheeks from goddamn smiling too much."
27285,Good fun game!
27286,"An absolutely hilarious puzzle game perfect for all playstyles, whether you like to follow the rules or make your own solutions. It's an absolute blast to play with friends, even with those that don't play many video games because of the games simple concept and controls.
My only gripe with this game is that there aren't very many maps. Fingers crossed they add more!"
27287,"Sticky hands and play-death button, beautiful game and such a great entertainment. And funny if you play with friends, so much laugh."
27288,"This is an odd game, but really enjoyable to just goof around with a friend. I think this would make a fun VR game as well. Don't forget to grab your friend by his face and throw/drag him off the buildings."
27289,"Unfortunately short, but enormously fun game for the company for the few evenings."
27290,"This game is so childish, which is ideal because I am a massive child. It's a great game to play with friends."
27291,"the game runs out of content in record time!  Not only did I spend $15 for a game with little content, theres not even a workshop! Outrageous! You are better off going on a Garry's Mod server and playing puzzle maps or something like that. Fun mechanics, little content, I repeat, do not buy."
27292,Great game
27293,"Great game, even more fun with friends"
27294,Good relaxing puzzle syle game.
27295,"This review is not 100% being written to get 25% XP for a badge. Seriously though, get it on sale and play with a bunch of friends. It's a game that is better with them, and a garuntee for laughter.

"
27296,Is very fun with friends but could use more content
27297,"""Humans, 
they will run into every door they encounter, 
they will push every button they see,
they will reach high and bend low to achieve thier goals,
and grab opportunities for both of their hands,

yet they can't fly, and never will...""

Used to keep updating original levels and new cosmetics, but now they only add workshop levels, I don't like such update, but someone said that it's been many years after publishing, and all the updates are free...

Well, no matter what, I still love this game"
27298,Shockingly fun
27299,Gülmek ve kafa dağıtmak için birebir.
27300,"This was one of the most exciting and entertaining games that I played this year.

I loved the maps the funny segments of the game. I know I had to restart the game plenty of times with goofball antics.

This is one of the best games for multiplayer out there.

There is only one negative... There doesn't appear to be any new content once the game is over. Thats my only negative."
27301,"Get this game with your friends and have fun for hours. The level design is increidible with interesting things all over the map. Truly a great game, can't wait for the devs to make more maps."
27302,"Such a funny game!
Should play this with friends for the fun and acctually good on single player too :)"
27303,A lot of fun! Hope more workshop support shows up in the future.
27304,"You should try to play with your friends, its so much fun"
27305,"the most fun you and a buddy can have, this game is amazing and I love every moment of it, good job developers, keep up the good work"
27306,"Human Fall Flat is a very funny game and at the same time very interesting but in my opinion that much more entertaining with friends, but if you play it, you will not understand the game in its entirety."
27307,a very weird but fun game. almost unplayable on keyboar and mouse controler is a must
27308,"Physics based goodness, best with friends."
27309,"Beautiful game.
I love everything about it: graphics, gameplay, sound, music, chill.
Played with friends is a pure fun experience even if the ""mechanics"" are that... easy?
Played alone is still an amazing experience but here we talk about the chill this game gives to you.
The music/background music, folks... that was really cool... and relaxing.

Completed 100% in ~20 hours in ""full-chill"" total fun mode.
The full price is quite reasonable (15€); under 10€ is a must."
27310,This game really recommended to having fun with your friends.
27311,Funny with friends. Recommend.
27312,Good game to play with friends. Funny and cool. The more the merrier <3
27313,Game is really fun to play with friends
27314,Loved this game.  Gave me a few hours of entertainment with my friend.  He would spend hours trying to find the right path through and i would just drag myself around the environment and meet him on the other side just to piss him off.  the first 30 minutes was just us essentially playing gang beasts and trying to throw each other off the stage. once we got into the meat of the game it was surprising though.  the options of traversing the stages make it so you aren't even sure if you did what you were supposed to do to solve the puzzle or if you found a way around it.  those paths in a physics game were delightful to find.  If more stages are added I will gladly start a new playthrough.
27315,fun with friends
27316,"""A Masterpiece"""
27317,This game is Fucking amazing.
27318,Good game to play with friends
27319,Big fun with frendos

Laugh so much you can't play.
Good game."
27321,An entertaining game wit some thought provoking puzzles. Highy recommended

27326,This game is fun with playing with friends.
27327,"Playing dead while your friends pick you up and put you in the furnece ""was fun""."
27328,Флекс с друзьями
27329,"Human Fall Flat was such a pleasent suprise. I love quirky little games like this so when I got it, naturally I couldn't put it down. This game is so enjoyable to play with a friend either couch co-op or online co-op/ multiplayer. Puzzles are very fun and the game just has this humor and silly atmosphere about it. I love this game!"
27330,A VERY FUN GAME!!!
27331,"Fun but too short, cleared in 5 hours."
27332,"This is a rare game that is on the surface relatively simple, but there is quite a bit more to it. It's fun to play in single player and also multiplayer.  It also has a fair amount of re-playability as many obstacles can be solved multiple ways.  The game is also not so long as to be so daunting that you'll never complete it.  Love it."
27333,happy game
27334,Real good game
27335,"Good game, just wish there would be more levels, or workshop support for levels."
27336,gud gam i put pee pee in pee pee and fun time yay

27341,"very cool, thanks for the comment kanye"
27342,"This game was fun. But i recommended play it with friend and better u have good internet connection.
I can say this game only playable in online i think. because if i play in offline i feel boring"
27343,Very fun play with friends... High recommend for buy it !
27344,"sabotaging your friends while they are trying to solve this game is the best thing ever, just buy it and try for yourself."
27345,Laughed too much playing this game. Destroy everything your friend tries to accomplish. 10/10
27346,too much like cs:go
27347,I was a human that fell flat
27348,10/10 would throw my friends off a cliff again.
27349,fun game to play with friends
27350,"This game is hilarious, from the waddle in your walk, to your flop, and even as you drop. It's a puzzle solver best played in co-op, but anyway you play it, it'll bring a smile to your face."
27351,"Great game, definitively recommend! Be sure to play it with friends for a better experience, if you have any ;)"
27352,Defintely a great game to play with a bunch of friends.
27353,Minimal puzzle-platformer that excels when played with friends.
27354,More maps pls
27355,Fun and Simple game play.
27356,"Really fun and interesting game to play with some friends, but the maps are limited and It would be nice to see some more added"
27357,"This game is awesome when you play it with friends! I played with two other friends and we could not stop laughing. I would definitely recommend using some sort of VOIP program if you're going to play in multiplayer mode. It's just easier to coordinate to complete the tasks in each map (examples: Teamspeak, Ventrillo, Skype, Discord, etc.)."
27358,Play this game with your friends and you'll have a fun time.
27359,Too much fun
27360,please send bobs
27361,is fun
27362,"The physics are wonky, the gameplay even more so. This game is fuckin hilarious to play and gets more enjoyable with friends. Just wish there were more levels or workshop level options, to up the replayability."
27363,10/10 would fall again
27364,Fun to play as a couch co-op.
27365,This game is so funny and enjoyable with friends
27366,"It's a good game, there u can design urself as hitler and do retarded stuff :D"
27367,Incredible potential.
27368,"Hilarious and great with friends. A bit glitchy sometimes. I freeze up and have to restart, which also means restarting the entire level...."
27369,So much better with friends - but good luck getting everyone to work together :D
27370,"Just buy two, give one to a friend. Just do it!"
27371,Still one of the funniest co-op games out there.
27372,"A fun game definetly game to play with friends
"
27373,"Simple graphics. Cool physics. Game control is frustrating, but it's fun to play with friends."
27374,this is a fun game :)
27375,:D
27376,"This game is really fun and very amusing with a group of people. Even though the controls are a bit hard to do, because of the rag doll aspect to it. That is also the best part of it. To the throwing people off the edge of the map. To the achievements asking you to do certain silly, brain teaser things. This game right here will give you entertainment for hours especailly with friends to join in on the fun."
27377,"The puzzles go from easy to ""how in the hell am I going to do this"" rather quickly.  It is very simple in design, and then works very well.  I have enjoyed it alot."
27378,One of the best 2 player games in reascent memory great fun
27379,Best game ever to play with friends
27380,Great fun
27381,"this game is so awesome , so much fun x)"
27382,"Some good, dumb fun with friends"
27383,Its a game that is good
27384,Great fun. Especially when messing with friends
27385,i want badge
27386,"It's a fantastic game, it has every element to be fun with friends. 10/10 Game of the Millenium!!!!"
27387,This game can be a lot of fun with a couple of friends but you dont play this game longer than 20 hrs.
27388,"Whacky physics based fun, 9 times as fun with FRIENDS!"
27389,I'm a human and a i fall flat
27390,"This game is alot of fun withj friends, although  It would be boosted with the addition of maps and steam workshop support. The devs still offer holiday events and skin opportunities which keep the game fresh every now and then."
27391,"It's cute, it's fun. LIKE SUPER FUN. If you want to cry while laughing with your coop buddy buy this game."
27392,"Fun game with friends, have not laughed so much in a long time! :)"
27393,Good game to play with a friend
27394,"Experiencing the environment, narration as well as the gameplay is real joy. If only there were more levels."
27395,"Very fun physics based puzzle game, incredibly good time to play with friends.
Lots of little secrets and fun workarounds for puzzles to keep you trying different things with each playthrough, and somehow has a bug that lets you infinitely jump in the air.

Lots of fun, especially with your friends."
27396,fall - flat . thats it. flat
27397,"I'd discribe Human: Fall Flat as frustrating, difficult, and hilariously fun. All things you should be looking for in a solid puzzle platforming game of this calaber. The controls especially when using a mouse and Keyboard can be frustrating at first but once you get used to them you only have the frustration of some of the puzzles to deal with. Playing on controller came more easily with the control of the arms being on triggers it made things feel more natural. Also the multiplayer additions in the last year have added to a good relaxing time to be had with friends and customization of your Bob lets you look as goofy as you'd like as you bounce along through the puzzles.
I strongly recommend this game for anyone interested in platforming puzzle games."
27398,1
27399,"Definitely too short, but insanely funny with friends."
27400,A very fun and challenging game.
27401,i'm mentally challenged
27402,Few hours of WTF and endless bubble butts. In urgent need of a workshop system.
27403,:)
27404,+
27405,Insanely fun with the wrong friends!
27406,The perfect game if you want to do stupid things with friends.
27407,taught me how to climb irl
27408,Great CO-OP game. 5/7 would play again
27409,Huge fun chasing achievements with a friend or two.
27410,Completed every level with an incompetent friend in 15 hours and had laughter and fun at every step along the way. Highly recommended
27411,"8 outa 10, would try and cheat the game even though it wouldv'e been easier and faster to do it how it wanted you to."
27412,"A fun wacky physics game that almost always leads to a a lot of laughs. Highly recommend this game, especially with friends."
27413,"Play this game with a friend or more and you'll have some great laughs and fun trying to work out how to get through each level.

It's a little short and it definitely requires some form of Steam Workshop. But it's a great game to play if you haven't already.

8/10"
27414,Amazing Love it
27415,This game has made me laugh harder than i have laughed in a long time.
27416,"我们需要新地图！！！
We need a new map！！！
新しい地図が必要です！！！
Necesitamos un nuevo mapa！！！
Нам нужна новая карта！！！
Wir brauchen eine neue Karte！！！
Nous avons besoin d'une nouvelle carte！！！
Abbiamo bisogno di una nuova mappa！！！"
27417,"This game is so fun to play with friends, me and my friends always play it and laugh and enjoy it so much! It definitely deserves the ""Bettter With Friends"" award."
27418,"I love when a puzzle game doesn't treat you like if you were a retarded child and just lets you play with the enviorement to complete each puzzle. Human: Fall Flat is some of those rare games like Zelda Breath of The Wild or Dishonored where you can truly complete each objective the way you want.

Also, playing with friends is the most fun a human being can have."
27419,fun game when you play with friends
27420,"this is a fun game. 
its great that they have some events wish it was more frequent."
27421,fun with friends!
27422,"One of the best games to play with your friends. Think of a wacky, glitchy Portal 2 where you're not given any instructions whatsoever and are free to do whatever you want. Do you want to be catapulted and destroy a castle wall with your body? Done. Maybe you want to make a human slingshot by glitching the game and skip every puzzles that the developers have created for you. Yep, you can do it.
I've laughed so much with this game that I cannot recommend it enough."
27423,Simple and easy way to have fun with friends.
27424,"Great game to play with friends or relatives,
Allot of fun to do in a very simple level."
27425,"This game.
It honestly is the most amazing thing to play with friends. Playing solo is still fun, and sometmes can be easier when you don't have your friend hanging on your head trying to pull you over the edge of a cliff. But I mean, who wants easy when you can throw your friends around and strike super sexy poses for them??
It is most definitely a rage quit game, especially when playing with friends, because you end up just messing around and having to restart a level over 30 times really does start to wear on your sanity.
I give this game an easy 20 out of 10, one of the  absolute best multiplayer games I have ever played."
27426,i still have nightmares about not being able to grab something....
27427,beautiful
27428,one of the funniest puzzle games I've ever tried especially fun with friends!
27429,Review
27430,"Best game to play with friends i've ever played.
I literally laughed in tears, hope there can be some kind of update to this cause playing it is superfun!"
27431,"Really good game to play with friends! :D
I wish there were more maps :("
27432,worth all the money
27433,"I bought this game since everyone said how extremely fun it is with friends.

Now that is done, I just need to get some friends."
27434,"A fun and entertaining game, can get a bit boring single player i will admit but where it really shines is with friends.
"
27435,"fantastic, brilliant, eccentric, incredible, and manages to never lose its' fun factor. 
However, there haven't been any maps for a seriously, seriously long time.
The budget's just rising, buddy. Keep developing!"
27436,Play this with your friends. You won't regret it.
27437,"Best game to play with ""friends"""
27438,二逼青年欢乐多QAQ
27439,Trump Approves!
27440,fun with friends
27441,"Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size, catches bad guys like their flies. He's spiderman."
27442,good game
27443,"If it is a person to play then give up, if there are multiple people, then continue."
27444,its a fun game with a friend or group  of frineds
27445,"This game is fun, it has good puzzle solving, innovative controls."
27446,So goofy and fun with a friend. A must have if looking for a relaxed co-op game
27447,Human: Falls Flat Is A Very Fun And Puzzling Game To Play
27448,Pretty fun. Lots of laughter.
27449,This game is very fun! My brother and I always seem to go back to Human: Fall Flat because it always makes us laugh!! I would 10/10 recommend this game if you're looking for a entertaining funny game! :)
27450,"Human Fall Flat is a puzzle-platformer that is best experienced with friends. You play as a character that is practically always in ragdoll mode and yet you still have surprising control over your movements.

There could definitely be more playtime with additional maps and workshop levels, but the base content is adequate.

The thing I wanted to share most about Human Fall Flat, however, is the game-breaking ""bug"" that I unintentionally found. I found myself able to fly at will on the second to last level, and while I found it extremely funny to toy around with, I doubt it was intentional.

8/10, could use some polishing but all around good game."
27451,This game is alot of fun.
27452,"One of the most entertaining puzzle games I've played.
Especially fun with friends but does lack re-playability."
27453,Y
27454,it was fun
27455,neat
27456,"Fantastic physics-based puzzles with a whacky flair. Quirky humor and a sandbox feel. I recommend playing with friends and just enjoy messing around with the puzzle pieces as you go along. The best fun I have had in this game is, once we've realized the intended solution to the puzzle, manufacturing a makeshift solution of our own."
27457,fun game aslong as you have friends to play with
27458,Ultimate hugging simulator!
27459,"This game is the labor of love, it takes work to love it."
27460,with friends will  be better! 一个人玩或许有些无聊
27461,Fun with friends
27462,"I can pick up my friends and throw them into the next puzzle, and then hump a wall until I get over it myself. 10/10 game would buy again."
27463,"Its really fun. Needs more content, please add multiplayer workshop levels already."
27464,"An adorable little game with quite a few things to do, and a load of fun playing with friends. (Unless some of them ragequit and refund because they didn't understand how the climbing worked *cough cough*) Worth the price tag, though a wished they updated a bit more frequently, or added a few more levels and things to do. Good luck getting all the achievments as I'm trying to do currently!~
"
27465,Great way to waste time and just fool around with few buddies
27466,box
27467,"Great game for friends who love to ram poles and fling things across one another. Great game to kill time with, especially when you got friends to play with."
27468,Best game to play with friends
27469,"Drunken baby simulator is a 3G; a Genuinely Good Game. If you like exploring corners of the map you dont think your supose to be in, they have you covered! if you like hunting for secrets an getting achivements for your effort, they have you covered! if youe like bashing your friend over the head with every object thats not nailed down (inclueing your other friend), they have you covered! if you like solveing puzzles, taking leaps of faith and throwing around every thing you can get your small nubby hands on all while having the mobility controls of a rum soaked toddler, then human: fall falt has got you covered!"
27470,"A very Unique expirience, every puzzle (in this case obstacles) has different solutions which is great! Great community, great game, great puzzles. It's better when you play with friends, it makes the puzzles funnier to solve (if you try to solve them) thanks to all the chaos you can make thanks to the tools/objects the game offers in every map."
27471,Pls add more levels
27472,"i love this game. Especially playing with my friends But this game really needs more maps. After finishing the maps on different ways with my mates it got boring to redo the same maps. 

Cant believe im saying this but this needs DLC"
27473,"So many puzzles and levels, and you can skip them all.
Or just hide the essential pieces in a multiplayer game."
27474,So much fun
27475,"Sometimes Human: Fall Flat barely feels like a coherent video games, but that is what it makes great."
27476,real fun with friends on a party night
27477,"Laughed so hard I cried. Cried so hard my ribs hurt.
This alone deserves thumbs up."
27478,"This game is one of those genuinely hilarious bonding experiences. Wanna get to know someone better and have a laugh at the same time? Play this game with them. Definitely one of my favorite co-op games ever,"
27479,"A unique and enjoyable casual gem of a game, with elements of puzzle, parkour, physics and frustration."
27480,"This game is quite borning to play alone, but with friends it can be hilarious. Good way to past time with friends!"
27481,nice game to play with friends
27482,The best game to play with friends
27483,"AMAZING, that game it's awesome with tons of fun (with friends), if you play alone you can also have fun; but is not the same... AND NOW IT HAS WORKSHOP *-*"
27484,is fun.
27485,Bientot un esport.
27486,2 gud 4 mah soul
27487,"If you're looking for a game to play with your friends with little to nothing to do this is the game to chose I had so much fun playing this game with friends


10/10 would scream at again"
27488,Play with the right people and you've got yourself one of the best co-op games that's constantly expanded with new levels without additional cost :)))))
27489,Best game to enjoy and laugh with friends !!
27490,this game is good for making friends
27491,"Really fun with friends, especially when you try to help each other by pulling them by their head"
27492,"Probably the most fun I've ever had playing a game, really hoping they add more levels & maps so I can play more."
27493,Very funny game to play with friends. Wish they would add more maps tho
27494,"Hilarious with friends. Nearly a must-buy, but definitely a must buy on sale.
Lots of fun."
27495,Haven't laughed so much for a long time playing this with freinds..
27496,More fun when playing with friends! :D
27497,Best game to play with your buddies and to find different ways of completing the map together.
27498,"3/10 singleplayer game. 10/10 with friends. The only reason it doesn't push it to 11/10 is because you'll get through the content available in ~7 hours of gameplay, give or take depending on how much you mess around or get stumped.

It has had a beta workshop thing in the works for quite awhile now, no idea if it will ever see the light of day... But if it does, user created content could push this game to a new level."
27499,One of the funniest games with friends and even more and longer if new maps or a workshop would be available
27500,Game plays very well and is absolutely hilarious when played with friends. The only thing lacking right now is a community workshop. Other than that 10/10.
27501,So fun to play with others!
27502,one of the best games to have fun with your friends
27503,the most fun I've had in this depressing political environment. In this economy? Yes.
27504,this is a great game to play with a friend!
27505,I really like this game .Althought if the developers made a epic and inovating WORKSHOP SYSTEM . This game would be one of my favorite
27506,"Sometimes you don't fall flat
0/10 flatness"
27507,I love this game...
27508,"This game will have you dying of laughter when you play it with friends.
"
27509,Better with friends
27510,This game is so fun both alone and with friends helping out.
27511,best with friends
27512,Easy game
27513,"An extremely fun game to play with your bros. The ragdoll physics always add a good comedic icing over everything, but the puzzles and terrain also allow for a lot of originality and exploration. Even after completing the game, my friends and I would return every so often to try and beat levels in a new way or just see how high up we could climbe. My only wish with this game is that more levels and customizaiton would be released."
27514,Thgis is the most fun I've had with friends in a co-op game.  Also breathtaking graphics
27515,c:
27516,"10/10, so much fun to play with friends"
27517,Human: Fall Flat is just really fun to play with friends. You just can enjoy for couple of hours with friends! Really fun.

27520,Good game 10/10 would game again
27521,2 hours of unstoppable laughing
27522,my friends suck at this game 11/10
27523,Best game ever to play with ur mates
27524,Grab friend and throw him out of the map !
27525,Play with your friends for nonstop puzzle times.
27526,Great game.  Makes you think and lets you be creative.  My only complaint is that it's too short.
27527,"This game is.......

Wobbly.
Very wobbly.

Wobbleh."
27528,its a really fun game to play with friends
27529,"Very simple, very fun"
27530,"Simply put, stupid, silly, derpy fun."
27531,"A Fun game, especially if you have a friend to play it with. Challenges and encourages creative thinking to get through the levels. Really wish they would add more levels."
27532,11/10
27533,"Awesome to play with friends
"
27534,"This game is challenging and fun! The mix of bad teamwork and ""Clunky"" controls make it a blast. The Challenging puzzles promote teamwork and communication between your freinds, helping them up ledges, showing the way to a confused team mate and such is what is making me give this my nomination for the 'better with freinds' award. I picked up a 4 pack during the black friday sale on humble bundle, £12 for me and 3 freinds to get this, arguably one of my best purchases of this year.
"
27535,Very enjoyable. I recommend playing with your friends when you're drunk.
27536,"A real hoot this one. Control the ragdoll with a controller (really recommended) and try to mess with the enviro to reach the exit. 

Not for everyone but the multiplayer potential is really something on this one. Can be really annoying sometimes but i'd say that those who will not play this game type  will immediately steer clear so it matters not much."
27537,Good game
27538,11/10
27539,fun
27540,Damn you paid games that are only fun with friends
27541,"This is a terrific game to play with friends, either you can work together or work against eachother which makes for a very fun game!"
27542,It's great fun when you play it with friends and try to complete the levels while you're dicking around at the same time.
27543,"10/10 Very accurate physics, would fall again :)"
27544,Needs a steam workshop so players can add their own content to a fantastic game. I would still recommend playing it with your friends but it would be more replayable if there was a level builder or workshop.
27545,Fantastically fun game with a few friends to exponentially increase shenanigans
27546,haha funny man fall flat
27547,Yes
27548,"Such a great Game to play with friends, true fun and great value for money."
27549,A great game with fun physics puzzles. Split screen play is the best!
27550,"Was trying to push a boulder together with friends. 

Pushed my head into his anus instead. 

10/10 would love to do it again."
27551,Best free time game with friends!!!
27552,This games a lot of fun.
27553,Best game ever

27562,"Great game, it's really fun between friends. I just wish that there was a little more content!"
27563,"Human: Fall Flat is such a wacky and hilarious physics-based puzzle game. With the addition of an online multiplayer, now you can befriend new Bobs and set off to solve the puzzle, or just goof around and have fun!"
27564,Nice
27565,Fun times
27566,"A short, simple and fun game. Great for playing with friends."
27567,"This game has been good to me.

Managed to launch away friends and bug the game, allowing us to fly throughout the entire game session.

1/1 monkies, would play again."
27568,"Fun alone, funner with friends 10/10."
27569,It's boat loads of fun with your friends. Get it if it's on sale.
27570,Realy fun game to play with my friends. Looking forward to more multiplayer maps!
27571,This game is so super duper fun with friends. This is those kind ofa games ther you dont take it so serious and just f*ck around. I think you will need some friends to play with for this game and the game isn't that long. but I had 100% every second.

27582,10/10 what a fun game..riddles are well made and have a got level of challange..play it with your friends you wont regret it.
27583,"Great fun when with friends!

Had a good time first co-operating with friends in tasks, then skrewing around making them fall to their deaths and dropping them from a cliff in classic Lion King manner.

So go get your friends play this game with you, be it launching them on a catapult in a castle OR breaking the castle wall by launching them into it."
27584,there only 9 maps so if in the future there will be more or at least a workshop but at this stage its not realyl worth it
27585,"8/10 ragdoll physics peak evolution, sadly it's pretty short but if they added custom maps it will be a solid 10"
27586,"This game is fun, with simple game mechanics and techniques. It helps improving the overall game experience, especially the online multiplayer options."
27587,"You will die laughing if you play this game with friends.

That's it, I'm too lazy to write anything else. Just buy this game okok? Okok."

27594,It'll be better if there are more game mode we can create.
27595,"Very flat, such human, wow"
27596,"It is a good game :D If you have friends. Its fun but not for long. Its not many maps and you can play custom but not with friends. 

 Good things: Fun with friends. Really cool style.

Bad things: Not many maps. 

I give this game a 6/10"
27597,what is this this game is the best when played with 7 other people and every one is runing around throwing every one else off cliffs.
27598,SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!!

Best game if u have friends"

27606,(just want the achievement xD )
27607,"I was looking for a fun, easy to learn game to play. It was my week to entertain my one slightly disabled friend  and find a  game to play that wont confuse him. no big numbers, no real challenge and no complex story. (He only plays Fornite, it was hard to find a game that an autistic person could actually play) thank you."
27608,Is Good. b
27609,"Nice Game, but should be played with Friends and Teamwork!
"
27610,10/10
27611,Play this for fun times with friends.
27612,"I've played through this game with my 6-year-old son (he's actually better than me at it) and absolutely loved it!

We're now going back to see if we can tick off all the achievements, which is always a mark of a great game for me. I've not tried the online multiplayer yet, but it was great to see that added not too long ago.

Definitely one of the best co-op games I've played, worth every penny and if you manage to get it on sale (or in a bundle somewhere) then you've got a real bargain.

[edit] Son is now 7 and a half, it's had a couple of great new levels since then and we still haven't done all the achievements. He wants to be a YouTuber now too. Of course."
27613,moving already makes me teehee xB
27614,"Nice Game, but should be played with Friends!
+rep"
27615,"I absolutely love this game! It is so goofy, provokes creativity, is even more fun to play with friends! Unfortunately it does not provide tens of hours of content but you can grind some achievements or just challenge yourself you find new paths throughout the levels. I'd recommend it to people who like to find the way on their own and also parkour lovers."
27616,"One of the most fun coop games I've played.

27645,Great game to play with friends
27646,Great game to play with friends. Has some really funny and wonky Game physics which makes up for some of my funniest moments in gaming. Really cute characters and an array of customization that you can apply to your characters. Just wish they would content more regularly. Recommended 9/10!
27647,"we are humanbeans



16 beans/20"
27648,The best aesthetics in a totally MODULAR game. The best time you are going to spend in steam workshop since Garry's Mod.
27649,This is absolutely fun game and funny!

27657,Fun with friends
27658,good game
27659,Good floppy boy.
27660,"Fun little game to play with your slightly older kids or your friends or both. Easy to learn the controls. Or, you can take time to master the controls and complete the levels in entirely different ways than intended and it is idiotic, but also stupidly fun."
27661,"This game is all about friends.  If you've got a great group of friends to play with, with a decent sense of humor, this is a blast to play.  I haven't laughed so hard in ages.  Not a very long game, but huge potential for fun.  Left me with a lot of great memories!"
27662,Great game to play with friends! Lots of fun to be had.
27663,"Extremely fun with friends. We somehow have comedic moments everytime we play. Though there isn't many maps or workshop yet, it's still a very good game."

27666,"Amazing game, especially with friends. I just wish there were more levels."
27667,Simple and fun 10/10
27668,"Goofy jelly men solve physics puzzles, couldn't ask for a better game"
27669,"This game is uproariously ridiculous. It may be short, but it's a lot of fun. Espeically if you play it with friends."
27670,"this game is fun, its fun to play solo but it is so much fun with friends"
27671,Short but fun.Hoping theres a workshop soon.
27672,"Add 1 cup water, let simmer for 15 mins"
27673,"Great game, alotta fun, would be even better with a workshop for more levels."
27674,"Extremely fun with friends. We somehow have comedic moments everytime we play. Though there isn't many maps or workshop yet, it's still a pretty good game."
27675,"Good game, but I keep having to re-earn my 100%"
27676,"Great game
"
27677,Fun with friends
27678,"This game is a puzzle based adventure. 
There is some physics , good times and laughs involved.
You'll have to mess around and try out new stuff.
it's a great game!

There's more levels being added, and there's stuff from the workshop too!

cons(limited gameplay) : play with friends - there is no seperate campaign levels for multiplayer yet, they reuse the levels from singleplayer campaign. this may change much later."
27679,Good
27680,GOTY 10/10
27681,yes
27682,Just don't short circuit it ;)
27683,"This game is 300x better with friends and is great playing for the first time, do not rush through"
27684,I am always able to go back and replay this game with my friends anytime :D
27685,This game good. (Just doing it for the badge)
27686,not bad. I enjoy playing this game with firends.
27687,Yes
27688,"This game is a Workshop away for being the best co-op game of all times.

So much potential wasted, this game really is amazing. I really can't say enough how this game blew my mind at one point and made me realize how much the community could do with the right tools.

Would always recommend if you want to laugh with friends. 10/10, one of the best surprizes I've ever had."
27689,I love trying to do things the dumbest way possible and having it work out sometimes.
27690,Fun to play with friends.
27691,This is the most fun games to play with friends! You deserve to be nominated!
27692,"Brilliant fun with friends.
Just wish there was more content :)"
27693,Really funny with a friend
27694,aaaaaa
27695,"The physics in this game is so wonderfully wacky, and a great experience with friends!"
27696,More teammates is more helpful. But more teammates is less helpful.
27697,The most fun in the evening with some drinks and friends you can ever have. This is completely silly.
27698,Better with Friends !
27699,Best game.
27700,Buy this and enjoy tons of fun. With friends laughs are also included.
27701,I'll never finish this game playing with my kids. They keep throwing me off the edge.
27702,"This is the purest, happiest game ever created. 

Short but sweet"
27703,"Great, truely great"
27704,"Imagine a co-op Gang Beasts game where you have to solve puzles to win, That's what this is and it is great."
27705,"fun, goofy and hilarious game you can enjoy with your friends"
27706,physics is fun
27707,"great game, hilariously buggy and fantastic to play with friends."
27708,WorkShop Update:They added japanese workshop
27709,I dropped my friend off the edge of the world and he landed on my head.  Would drop again.
27710,"Really good coop game, love to play this with friends. Though we end up working against each other every damn time..."
27711,"Human Fall Flat is an amazing game and is definitely worth wasting your time on. I've spent 23 hours as of writing and unlocked every achievement, yet I still manage to have fun with it. The game has a sense of hilarity in the form of ragdoll physics and blobs for characters. The game is fun singleplayer, but gets infinitely better in multiplayer. Definitely worth $15, but buy it when it's on sale."
27712,"The most fun you could possibly have with friends.
Average playtime, 5 hours.
My playtime, 30 hours and counting.
an unforgettable, wholesome experience."
27713,:) wow
27714,"Human: Fall Flat was a really enjoyable game, especially for it's price, I thoroughly enjoyed playing it with friends. There were many funny moments trying to overcome obstacles and there were many ways to go about doing things in the game."
27715,One of the best games for hours of fun in local multiplayer out there
27716,Human Fall Flat is one of the most fun games I ahve played in recent time (especially with the lads). The crazy physics and puzzles that can be solved in more ways than one lend the game to more than one play through. In my opion the only place this game falls short is the amount of content. Human Fall Flat has a very limited amount of maps and no community workshop support. Other than the limited number of maps this game is a great buy especially for the 15$ price tag.
27717,Amazing game 10/10 best game and review
27718,Very fun with friends. Would be better if it included more maps or enabled workshop maps. Me and a friend completed it in less than 6 hours and would like to play more maps.
27719,The best coop game.
27720,Very fun game to play with your friends
27721,Fun puzzle game with awkward controls that add to the challenge of the game. I played with a friend and we had a blast.
27722,fun game
27723,LONG LIVE THE KING
27724,Drunk baby simulator!
27725,When playing this game my friends and i always get sore throats from laughing - very reccomended and i ahve they add more maps and extra mod support
27726,Needs workshop
27727,Great fun init
27728,"This game is absolutely fantastic to play with friends. You definitely crack a good laugh while playing it.

It needs to have more maps added with new and interesting puzzles to solve and that way you will keep players engaged.

The physics in this game are very well implemented it is way to fun to learn how to control your character and to see others trying to move.

Overall... I do recommend you to play this game with your group of friends."
27729,"Cute game, play it with friends tho!"
27730,"This game is the epitome of modern storytelling, gameplay and the peak of greatness a game can achieve. Characters, interactions, a great physics engine all culminate to create a game which close to surpasses games famed for these things, such as Half Life or Halo, which are both inferior and uncomparably insignificant compared to this monolith of a game. Truly, this is the highest peak which gaming has and will ever have to offer."
27731,Humans really do fall flat sometimes
27732,Really fun physics based game. Quite fun to play alone and VERY fun to play with friends.
27733,"Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious online multiplayer game where you become a puffy uncoordinated baby-like Bob, solving puzzles and crashing yourself into things to make stuff happen.... Laughed so hard i cried, then laughed even more. 


My wishlist as of right now for this game: 

-Add alternate game modes or mini games (arenas, obbys, races, etc)
-Add workshop option to have additional variety"
27734,Fun game with friends!
27735,this game is gr8
27736,Gut.
27737,Most fun I had in a long time with friends!
27738,"One of the best games I've every played co-op. You're completing really fun puzzles in a world that can be explored however you want, making me feel confident in 100% recommending it to those who are interested in playing it solo as well.

However, co-op is really where this game shines. The way you can not only cooperate but also counteract the person(s) you're playing with keeps the game fresh for the entire playthrough."
27739,I love to being such an idiot
27740,"Good fun alone, much much better with friends, hopefully they make new levels soon."
27741,Welp it's pretty good even better with friends.
27742,Very very fun game to play with a few friends :)
27743,"10/10 GOTY
But needs more levels or coop workshop support"
27744,Great party game!
27745,FriendShip
27746,"This game, with a friend, high as fuck, hours of laughter, teamwork and stupid fights. Would buy again."
27747, great game to play with friends
27748,"Never before has a game captured how my body works 85% of the time

8.5/10"
27749,Fun physics game. Takes some getting used to. Best played with friends.
27750,Better with friends
27751,Amazing game. Play it with a friend.
27752,"The title says it all. ""Human Fall Flat"". You're a human and you fall flat either onto your face, the ground, or on your friends (if you have any, that is). Either way, ""Human Fall Flat"" an incredibly fun and humorous physics-based puzzle platformer that's easy to learn, but hard to master. Every level is filled with fun puzzles that may take more than one try to fully grasp. Patience, a keen eye, and skill is the key to get from level to the next."
27753,"The ideal game for hanging out with a friend. I had a lot of fun with this, probably wouldn't be very enjoyable on your own."
27754,"Awesome and fun game.
Best played with friends.
"
27755,Help or sabotage your friends for easy laughs. Only minor thinking required along the way.
27756,"It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot… oh yeah

That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time **** talks
She gets her mou— ahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for shit to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up
And fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the fuckin' nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his fuckin' rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he cannot withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
Fuck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin', ""Drain the swamp!""
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in–
–stead of talkin' Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignorin' our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, ""You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!""
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespectin' the military
Fuck that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!
""He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!""
""He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!""
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm usin' all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
Fuck you!
The rest of America, stand up!
We love our military, and we love our country
But we fuckin' hate Trump!"
27757,hehteehehe
27758,"Incredibly fun physics-based puzzle platformer.  Short and sweet, I hope they make more levels!"
27759,"Best game EvEr, quite fun with friends"
27760,"Great coop physics puzzler and fun for many hours.
Controls are silly but still responsive and predictable.
Developers keep adding new levels for free despite game being already cheap!
Must have! game"
27761,Yep
27762,"The Most Hidden Of All Gems.

I'm Begging For More Levels. Plz"
27763,Playing this with a full group of friends and figuring out the puzzles is super fun
27764,Fun/Funny
27765,Great game to play with friends if you enjoy puzzle-platformers. You can even mess with friends by tossing them out of the world. >:) 10/10
27766,This game is one of my favorites to play with my husband! We have so much fun and laugh so much. There are different ways to complete each puzzle and secret areas to explore. I am hoping for more content in the future!!
27767,vgood
27768,"The game is really fun, but new maps must be added."
27769,"Playing with friends:
Friend throws you off bridge
100% would recommend"
27770,This is one of my favorite games. I first played it last winter with some friends and it's so accessable and provides a positive gaming experience for gamers of all skill levels!
27771,10/10
27772,Great game to play and mess around with friends. Could use more levels.
27773,"Look, this game is just crazy good fun with friends in multiplayer. Get it and laugh your ass off few a few hours"
27774,"This game's so annoying it's fun. The controllers are (probably) intentionally nasty and that leads to all sorts of situations.

Haven't played it alone but I can't say that at least it's a great co-op game.

They also release new levels for free time to time. That's also highly appreciated."
27775,great game especially with friends
27776,Most fun i had in a coop game in a long time
27777,Fun game with or without friends.
27778,good game with friends
27779,"An amazing game to play with friends, endless fun and is one of the funniest games i have ever played."
27780,"It's a very entertaining game to play with friends and will certainly get you and your friends laughing a lot of the time. The walking is hilarious, the controls are easy to learn and teamwork is very useful. Big chance you'll grab one of your friends and just toss them off of the map."
27781,Great game to improve your mouse handling skills. :)
27782,"This is a very fun game to play, and even better when you have friends to play it with."
27783,Nice one!
27784,"You have strong friendship?
You have some money to buy this?
Then buy away. Best throwing away friends simulator. 7/10"

27789,"Would throw my friend off the map again.
11/10"
27790,Great to play with friends. Needs to add workshop support before the games becomes irrelevant.
27791,I accidentally broke the zipline so I manually climbed down it by swinging my mouse back and forth. 10 minutes later my sweaty fingers slipped a few meters from the end and I drowned. 10/10
27792,"Great fun, especially with friends"
27793,A lot of fun with friends!!  Get rdy to laugh until you cry xD
27794,this game is so so so funny :D
27795,"Complete ridiculousness. Lots of fun with friends. Even more fun with randoms! 

Encourage roleplay."
27796,"FUN, FUN, FUN!! great with friends!!"
27797,"""The more the merrier"" definitely applies for this game. You can play it solo, sure, and it will still be fun, but I highly recommend playing with a friend or two."
27798,Climb a lot. No good alone. Pretty retarded. 10/10
27799,"The funniest game ever i have ever played with my friends(yes,i have them ahaha). But too little gameplay because of quantity of maps :("

27838,Played with my gf. It was a fun and cute adventure. Atmospheric and stylish. Sometimes a bit too challenging but not impossible. 10/10.
27839,"Ridiculous, but also annoying at the same time. Particularly with servers issue"
27840,Best experience of my life.
27841,You can grab your friend's peepee
27842,"Has the tools to make a great party game, but with a total 5ish hours of content, it really FALLS FLAT.  

Human Fall Flat had great potential of longevity if they would incorporate Steam workshop, however the developers have backed out on this goal and currently state that they do not have plans to provide a level editor.

Being 2 years since release at this time, I doubt anything more will be added to this game"
27843,is good needs functioning multiplayer workshop
27844,This is a good game and if you become a master at jumping you can win always :).
27845,"Needs more levels, or at the very least community mods. Otherwise, its a great game for a few friends with nothing to do for a night."
27846,Amazing game for 4 people! Recommend to everyone who want to have fun
27847,It is a really good game like it
27848,"It's a wonderful fun experience, with a lot of potential for goffy moments and just enjoyable moments.
Until you get to final 3 levels.
Then it stops being this cute experience to be this ""hardcore every step counts"" type of game. But here is the deal. This is not a game that should be made to be hard. The fun of these game is on how janky the controls are, but even with that you can goof around exploring and do simple stuff. So when the game devs start designing their levels to be hard, they aren't hard, they are frustrating. Because the difficulty comes from how bad the controls are...  and there is nothing more frustrating then feeling that bullsh*t happens not because of you, but because of the game itself.
I think the boat level is a perfect example on how to sumerize this game. It starts really fun, then you get to the crane part, then the slippery platforms, then the water part and then I am done.

Also, no save points for when you leave the game. NO SAVE POINTS. This a game that becomes really hard and frustrating and you make the player have to repeat everything again if he decides to leave? Because of the controls, some of these areas might take up to half and hour, one hour, and there are several of them, and you don't let the player save?

Don't be fooled, this game is fucking hard, and the amount of precision you need to beat the later levels is absurd considering that the main mechanic of the game is having bad controls.

Buy it at a big discount, this is not worth the normal price tag.

Cool OST tho."
27849,"I bought this game mostly to play it co-op with a friend. While the connection is fast and flawless between players, the game by itself leaves much lacking: 
It, unsuprisingly for the size and type of game, runs smoothly and without problems. It's fun to the the ocasional ""betrayals"" of picking a player up and throwing it off a cliff. It's not fun to explore a whole cave to not find anything of interest. It's not fun that another one is filled with ice-level like slippery surfaces, which makes it really hard to climb and platform around. It's not fun that one has like 10 seconds respawn time of a boat before you can try again.
The game is almost pointless in it's levels for there's nothing there other than the exit (literally, because the levels are almost as bare bones as they could be), and again, any new path you might discover leads to nothing other than maybe a steam achievement that i have little to not interest to me. 
I love games with easy to grasp controls and movement but increasing level complexity. The levels begin by teaching you the basics and some less intuitive controls with some charming videos, and are genuinily fun to explore and play around with the new tools explained to us. However, the levels became annoyingly long (given that checkpoints don't save between sessions) and monotonous, or with the difficulty increased by those annoying gimmicks. 
Eventhough I didn't finish it, I appeared to be in one of the last levels, and a game so short and with such a baren feel honestly doesn't justify the full price asked, as I bought it with a hefty discount and sometimes wonder if the experience was trully worth that much to begin with, specially with such a sour taste it left in my mouth in the later levels. 
(Also as a controler user sometimes I would have problems with sudden split screens that couldn't be turned off without me closing the server i was hosting, restarting the game and, as consequence, the level)"
27850,"What is physics?

Just buy the game and play with another friend. Grab him and throw him off the edge of the map while you yourself fall down. 

This game is for the lols.

Ends in 4-5 hours in casual play. Would love to see more maps in the future though."
27851,fun to play but definitely needs more maps
27852,The game is incredible... it's awesome !!! But it needs a bit more maps...Very fun to play multiplayer... I <3 it !!!
27853,Awesome!
27854,"The game is pretty short for the price, that being said grab a friend or two and have a frustrating/ hilarious time in this fantastic puzzle adventure."
27855,Fun. Got 100% achievements with friends. Needs workshop for custom levels/ content. Pleeeeeeeeeeeease
27856,Many goofs and gaffs. It's fun to play with friends and fucking around is the funniest shit ever. My friends and I played through the whole game and the whole time we were dying laughing.
27857,"Haven't had a good laugh for a while, I appreciate the game and especially the friendly players who guided me through my first couple of levels"
27858,Very hard sometimes ;-;
27859,Fun game to play with friends but the devs have basically abandonded the game and refuse to release new maps. Don't waste your money.
27860,Its a fun puzzle coop game where you can play with friends and enjoy throwing them off the map
27861,"Played it twice with 2 different friends and actually never tried to beat it. once you know the mechanics of the game, it feels like every level is the same. It's somewhat created to follow a path, but you can skip so many ways to get to the objective.
Laughed my *ss off with this game ^^
Fun to play!"
27862,"When running the game, it turns to split screen, my character wont move properly, I spawn out of bounds, my split screen player moves on his own, I can see other players chat, it freezes, the screen turns yellow

Honestly I don't know what happened"
27863,"Great game, you'll get the most out of it if you play with a bunch of friends, 100% recommend it."
27864,very good and fun game requires good thinking and skill 100% recommend it to others
27865,"*Short circuits a battery*

27870,"Recommended, lots of fun with friends. 
Waiting for new maps"
27871,"Extremely short, but extremely fun."
27872,"Pretty fun game. And then they went around and stopped supporting my platform. With no way to refund the game.
Way to go.

With this sort of behaviour, I'd be very careful buying it, even if your platform is still supported."
27873,"Goofy little puzzle game that would probably be a ton of fun with friends. Playing alone is entertaining enough but not so much I'd recommend it. The wiggles and art will make you chuckle and the puzzles are interesting (I found it quite fun/entertaining trying to come up with my own ways to ""cheese"" them).

I'd say get this on sale for ~$8 and it could be worth it.

You can watch some gameplay of the game on my [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR9Z24GD5MM&list=PL0q93Rkkmx_tN4G-gpiitZ66q_FAJDGoI]YouTube Channel[/url]!"
27874,"Very fun puzzle game, Best part is finding different ways to do each puzzle which feel like you are breaking the game, best with a friend.

I'd give this game an 8/10 as it is really fun but needs a lot more content however for the price can't complain."
27875,Is gud
27876,"Fun for a few hours as a physics based puzzle/platformer game, and I honestly had some good laughs doing these maps with friends, but the content is severely lacking at the moment.  Once this game finally gets Steam Workshop support I would definitely recommend it, but I would hold off on getting it until then.

Update: Workshop is live, definitely brought a lot more to this game, couldn't be happier!"
27877,"Most fun I've had with a game in a long time, though the last few levels are broken where you can hold down space and fly aorund. Other than that, great game!"
27878,SO FUN OMG
27879,"I like the game physics and funny-stupidity, 
and solve all the puzzles in many ways. Like tons of ways to do each puzzle.

But please add more content/maps. 
I'm always look forward to receiving new updates from this game.

#2020 update review
This game still looking good. 
But some mods/ skin/ workshop uncontrollable.
Gameplay getting laggy/ not fully optimize when other players join the server or joining other people with too many mods/ skin etc.. Server crash or lost connection more frequently than before"
27880,"Human: Fall Flat is brilliant to play with friends, and has got to be one of the funniest games on Steam. The physics and stupidity of it all literally leaves me crying with laughter. The climbing controls are quite tricky to master, and the game could do with more content (new maps, character customisation etc), and recently I noticed that if you tab out of the game when loading it up, it will freeze your cursor and you will have to restart your pc/ laptop. This happened to my friend aswell. Please fix this asap! D:"
27881,"pretty fun game for a few hours, then you go achievement hunting and find out ""will it fry"" is imposible and leave a shit revieuw. me and a friend have tried everything, even glitching to make it work but the achievement wouldt register. over all 3/5"
27882,"A fun co-op game, but barely that.

Levels start of as mildly challenging and great fun, but quickly devolved into managing bad physics to solve puzzles (seriously, whose idea was the shipping container puzzle on the ""Water"" level?).

For $7 on sale, decide it that's worth a couple hours. I would come back to this if it had Steam Workshop, but apparently that's been promised for over a year with no update? Two years and no additional levels?"
27883,"Hilarious game to play with friends.
10/10 would recommend."
27884,"I really *really* love this game. charming and fun in every way. Unfortunately, they removed official linux support, which is my computer's operating system. I bought this with the expectation that it would work for linux, largely because the developers said it would. I feel cheated."
27885,:3
27886,"As fun as it was, Wouldn't recommend. Only a few maps and its been out for 2 years. Not really worth it"
27887,10/10 whens the workshop update
27888,"very fun game to play with friends, but me and others alike agree... THIS GAME NEEDS MORE CONTENT/MAPS!!!!! the devs keep adding language support and other skins but nothing that the people really want and thats MORE MAPS!!"
27889,"Great game and fun with friends, but lacks content"
27890,"Very fun game to play with your friends.

Unfortunately you will finish the game in one night"
27891,Great game. Would recommend to play with friends for laughter. Also play stoned or drunk
27892,"Great and fun game, but...

...Sadly they dropped official support for Linux.

Update (remark): Haven't tested it with SteamPlay (Proton)."
27893,More Maps or workshop is needed
27894,"Dropped Linux version? Without an official announcement? Really?
Oh... and selfishly, what should i do now with my copy? Steam play? Tooo easy."
27895,needs workshop support
27896,"Fun game, but the developer recently decided to drop Linux support. There will be no future updates for Linux.

I only have Linux so I can't play the newer versions and also can't play online with friends running Windows or Mac.

Sadly, this means a negative review for a great game."
27897,"This is a game of teamwork. Not a gamr where your partner SINGLE MINDEDLY CLIMBS A PYLON SO YOU HAVE TO DO MULTIPLAYER PUZZLES BY YOURSEEEEEELLLLFFFFFF!!!!

fun game"
27898,We Want A Workshop!!!!!
27899,"Top of the morning to you ladies, it's Jonny, the DabberMaster. 
Well, we did it, we reached top-tier-gaming. There is no way they could make a better game then this.
Oops, i was confused with Dabbing Simulator 2020. 

Crashes on startup.

10/10"
27900,"I genuinely enjoyed this game, cheers."
27901,"LOVE THIS!!! My boyfriend and I loaded it up and ended up playing for hours. Love the game play, graphics and overall feel of the game. Definitely looking forward to playing this again and again and again!"
27902,Good game needs the steam workshop to be implemented ASAP
27903,"all i got to say is..... MORE FREAKING MAPS, i mean come on now so many months and there is no more maps"
27904,Are you stuck? Got a problem getting somewhere? Well then just fucking climb over it dumbass.
27905,"why do i have 1,000 hours on this game"
27906,"A wonky-physics 3D platforming game that is hilarious in the initial stages. However, it rapidly loses its charm and becomes a frustrating grind with little reward. Beware that it is not worth more than a few dollars for a few hours of fleeting enjoyment.

[h1] Positives [/h1]
(+) Hilarious seeing the character behave in wonky ways.

(+) Some puzzles are clever and require thinking & trial and error.

(+) Fun with friends.

(+) Minor character customisation.

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
(-) Tedious gameplay. 
You will often feel cheated or frustrated. This game requires precise execution to proceed through a puzzle, which is infuriating since the physics offers no consistency with its mechanics. Many mechanics are not explained which makes constant trial and error a chore. 

(-) Terrible checkpoint systems. 
The game can unfairly kill your character and make you restart your progress from a significant portion away from where you died. There is no manual save point and current-level saves can get overwritten without warning or explanation. 

(-) Bugged achievements
Specifically “Will it Fry?” refuses to unlock despite fulfilling all prerequisites. The achievement itself may take from 1-3 hours for no reward. Avoid this game if you are an achievement hunter.

(-)  Splitscreen multiplayer is not ideal
The Field Of View for both players is drastically decreased and feels cumbersome."
27907,Paid good money for this game and then the developer pulls support for linux. What an absolute joke. You will never get another sent from me again.
27908,Recomended if you have friends
27909,"There are too many units and not enough tutorial time and also I cant get past the skill curve, too steep"
27910,"For anyone that is going to buy this... this game only has like 9ish levels and about 6-7h of fun, if you thinnk its worth it(which i think it is) then buy it...

27916,"[h1] Linux Version Review [/h1]

For what this game was, I actually enjoyed it! It ran great on my Ubuntu machine, and experienced no performance issues. 

But when you yank Linux support in favor of other platforms, especially without a formal press release, that's really disheartening to Linux gamers who purchased this title to support your endeavors with Linux. This does not seem to come across as Linux gamers being ""First Class Citizens"". (Source in comments).

To say the least, I'm pretty disappointed with this sudden decision.

Press coverage: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/no-brakes-games-have-discontinued-linux-support-for-human-fall-flat.12853"
27917,..
27918,gets boring after a while. same old same old
27919,.
27920,"I'm usually skeptical about physics-based games, but Human: Fall Flat is fun and mind-challenging.

Controls are simple: you can move, jump, grab items and ledges. The whole game is made of levels where you are required to combine these actions smartly. As simple as it may sound, the game actually creates interesting situations where creativity is nicely rewarded.

Its graphics are a bit too simplistic and the piano music fits rather poorly into the atmosphere of this game, but this is not much of a problem as you go further into the game.

The game is fully playable in solo, but most of its fun can be experienced by playing in co-op (the trailer shows this nicely).

The major downside of this game is its short lifespan. Once you've finished its 9 levels, there isn't much left to do, apart from going for achievements.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Wait for a small discount before getting this game, and ensure you have friends to play with to get the best out of it."
27921,A nice game with hours of fun but they dropped Linux support. Can't recommend the game anymore.
27922,its a good game to play with frnds man. really lov it and i wish they will improve the online play of this game
27923,Unplayable. Super laggy even on very low settings. My PC's way above the recommended system requirements. Please fix this.
27924,"Dropped support, total BS dev. Avoid this dev and this game!"
27925,Please add Workshop
27926,Extremly fun with a group of friends. Needs more maps.
27927,"Great game, more maps"
27928,...
27929,"THIS NEEDS A VR ADAPTION

27930,Developer dropped Linux support right after I got the game looking forward to playing it with my friends.
27931,"A unique spin-off esque to Gang Beasts, this game is sure to leave you in awe at its wacky physics and unique puzzles"
27932,Bad game
27933,"Pros
- so much fun
- quirky movements
- physics

Cons
- feels like 30fps even though i am running it over 120
- sometimes the movement can be frustrating
- is not worth 15 euros (maybe like 8-10?)"
27934,"I really like this game. Really good fun to play with friends. I only wish that there where some more lelves, maybe dlc? Please? Thank you. I do not recommend that you play this game by yourselves, some of the levels I could only get through with atleast one other person. I really would recomend this game for a afternoon of fun."
27935,Good game but needs alot more maps
27936,"This game. Is beyond what I can put into words. This game is not only poetic, but an artist's dream."
27937,Im playing solo i have no friends and i fell off and it started me back at the begining it took hourssss and it was dificult to get the boat off the stupid island.
27938,good
27939,What is the shame! Linux version is dropped! Those devs have scamed linux users!
27940,"Unfortunately I've made the decision to buy a 1€ Steam key from a third party grey market reseller (grey market, no money for the devs) so I can leave a negative review because developers silently dropped Linux support without telling any of their customers that the game will now require proprietary Microsoft platform for newest features and working multiplayer. Apologies for this but thank you for your understanding!"
27941,"I spend more time trying to mess with people than to do the objective.. Haven't gotten passed a stage yet. 

Tip : play with retards"
27942,"1.Start game
2.Sit on the couch with your over-priced steam-link
3. Notice you have no friends over.
4. Call friends over. 
5. All sit on the couch
6. Start playing
7.   You must concentrate, before all of this, you have been training, destroy your friends, beat them in all levels, climb up walls and just demolish them. Your friends start to complain how you are try-Harding or just too good, tell him to LEAVE.
In a shouting tone, you are now aggressive, your friend leaves completely stunned by what just happened. You close the living room door, all your friends, stunned and eyes focused, look at you. you sit back. 
      After 2/3 hours, you win every round, your friends are too scared to ask you to leave or even to stop play. A friend of yours takes out his phone, try to hide his use of it. In the corner of your eye, you notice, holding your steam-link controller, you full-on throw this controller, smashing throw his head, he is unconscious. You go to him, picking up your bloody controller,  out of the 5 people you had over, 3 remains. You sit back down. Memories of those times when your friends destroyed you in Worms fill you with anger. 
      Another hour goes by. To your amazement, you wouldn't think, any of them would even pick up a phone after that last friend who is still bleeding out unconscious, but one is, dialling some number. 999. He presses dial. In slow-motion, you lunge towards your prey, the thought of a fresh kill fills you with energy. This other prey then jumps in front, trying to protect their only chance of escaping. Those words from the phone echo through the room. ""What's your emergency?"" Are you too late? As one of the friends gives the address, you know you are too late. As you stand in the middle of the living room, the banging from the police on your door could be heard from a mile away, the sound of restraint and the loss of freedom now floods your thoughts.
  
      Looking at the TV screen, this game... this game...

Was so worth the full price."
27943,The  devs silently dropped Linux support. I will never support developers like them anymore. Completely irrespetuous towards their customers.
27944,"Dev has decided to stop supporting the game on my platform, which is disappointing. I won't be able to play the future updates with my friends."
27945,A super fun meme game :)
27946,i love bobs
27947,Fun little physics puzzler/platformer with an unexpectedly great soundtrack.
27948,"I bought this game for my Linux machine and after quite some time they decide to drop support for Linux! That is a terrible move from this developer. I even can't get a refund! Did not play that much, but it seems I will not play in the future too :( they will leave Linux build available, but it will be outdated as it will get no support/updates. There would be a way to play this via Proton using Windows version, but as they leave unsupported Linux build it gets more complicated."
27949,good game and my son loves it

Human: Fall Flat is more like an arcade game. You just Keep Trying Things Over And Over to try and figure out what the developer wants you to do. And then, if that wasn't bad enough, you have to jump and grab and let go, etc. etc. at the exact moment so that you can accomplish what the developer had in mind. Games like these were designed as arcade games that made you pump more and more quarters into the machines to try and get to the end of the developers hoops and hurdles.
>Like Pac-man, Mario Brothers, etc.<
True puzzles are more like the ones at miller world inc or The Talos Principle where you are presented with a puzzle to solve, and you just solve it. You don't have to Jump at the exact place OR Grab at the exact height, OR Swing with the exact momentum, etc. etc.
However, If you like this type of arcade game then you should really like Human: Fall Flat.
There are SO MANY VARIABLES that you will be doing things Over and Over until you get it Just Right.
Of course you will constantly die and have to start over again and again and again.
Another thing that I hated and you may like is that the character that you control (that has to perform the hoops and hurdles) responds like a drunken sailor. He is a wobbly mess.
Another thing that I found strange was that I read Many of the reviews before I purchased and they were saying things like: ""It is hilarious""; ""We just kept laughing""; It is insanely funny; etc.  I never so much as experienced a hint of humor.
It wasn't funny. It wasn't fun. I was more like a miserable chore that you just Had To Finish so that you could put it behind you and forget it as fast as possible.
Oh, and least I forget, extremely boring.
But like I said, if you like this type of arcade game then you may be in for a treat. The software ran without so much as a hiccup. The graphics and sound were clean and I didn't experience any location that 'trapped' you.

27953,Ow I fell
27954,"Linux support dropped out of the blue. I paid for the game the same as everyone else.

Very scummy business practices. Support something or don't - that's fine but make it clear from the onset -  don't say you will support it, get a load of cash, and then just say ""Oh sorry fellas you're outta luck now we changed our minds"""
27955,"Had fun with the game, but the drop of Linux support makes it a No. Linux support was part of the reason I bought"
27956,"Honestly, the game's kinda cool.  The devs pulling Linux support is a real dick move however.  They should consider pleasuring thier colons with toilet brushes and brake cleaner."
27957,Linux support dropped
27958,They dropped Linux support so no.
27959,Amusing game cut down by a dev's decision to drop support for Linux after being released on the platform.  I would have been more understanding if they had been trying to implement support and failed than having the rug figuratively yanked out from under me.
27960,"The game was ok, but had design issues and technical issues. I won't play any future workshop version because dev silently dropped Linux support."
27961,Devs will pull out the rug from under you. I bought this game to support game devs who care about linux users. Now they've dropped linux support and I feel cheated.  I would return it and get a refund it if Steam would let me.
27962,"It feels unfortunate that I have to leave a bad review, but I can't sit by while getting screwed over by a company. 

Imagine you bought a car because they had native support for Android phones, and then you took it in for an oil change and suddenly your car didn't work with Android phones anymore! When I bought this game, it had official Linux support. Native Linux support was one of the reasons that I chose to buy this game over others in my wishlist. Now, all of a sudden and with no prior warning or other workaround, the game developers have removed Linux from the supported platforms, and are no longer supporting the Linux build but will continue to push out updates to Mac & Windows. I feel like I just got slapped in the face! This to me is even worse than a company deciding not to develop their game for Linux at all. It feels very deceptive to suddently reneg an offering like that."
27963,"I enjoyed this game a few weeks ago with a friend and found the controller support to be a little wonky, but I got around it eventually. Unfortunately it looks like they just took Linux support out for new updates, which may explain why controller support was so wonky in the first place! Cannot recommend this if you're looking for a developer to keep strong on their commitment to a Linux version of the game."
27964,"I played through Human: Fall Flat with three friends last winter holiday and it was great fun. Everybody was laughing for two whole evenings. Today they developers announced that they are discontinuing their support for GNU/Linux. This is most troublesome and I can't recommend the game for that reason anymore, which is a shame.

EDIT:
Please bring back the support for GNU/Linux."
27965,Extremely disappointed in the developer. They dropped support for my platform and it feels like a real bait-and-switch. Avoid at all costs!!!
27966,"Unfortunately, I made the decision to write a negative review as a consequence of the discontinued Linux/SteamOS support. I don't like writing a negative review on Steam which makes me very sad. Apologies for this but thank you for your understanding!


(Details: https://steamcommunity.com/app/477160/discussions/0/1735468693704602016/ )"
27967,"Human Fall Flat is one of the best games I've played that has CO-OP in it. Playing this with friends is really enjoyable. You can also just play this in singleplayer. Overall, I highly recommend this game if you enjoy CO-OP puzzle games."
27968,"If you have never played this shiit, you are missing out bebe ;)"
27969,"It's an enjoyable game that I bought to play on Linux, then they decided to drop support for my platform so they can add more ""content"" and now I can't play it anymore. To anyone complaining about negative reviews for dropping Linux support, replace Linux with your platform of choice and reread it. Do you think they won't drop your platform if it meant adding more ""content""?"
27970,"The developer simply abandoned the Linux version, which I think is pretty deceitful, considering they already got paid and also kinda weird since they already had the know how. The game itself is mostly okay, but gameplay can be quite finicky sometimes given the physics-based nature. Messing up can sometimes set you back very far, which is annoying and time-consuming, especially when you're playing with someone else."
27971,"Bought this game a while ago for Linux and enjoyed it, but the devs announced that they're dropping Linux support, effectively stopping me from playing the game that I bought. Very unhappy."
27972,Dropping support 0/5
27973,"Nice game, bought it for co-op and because it had linux support. Now the developer has decided to withdraw linux support. I'm regretting supporting a developer that won't support their games; I feel like I boguht the game under false pretenses."
27974,"Devs will no longer support my platform, support I expected since that was what I paid for.  This is scummy behavor."
27975,Dropped Linux support before I had to chance to play. No announcement or anything. I'm getting a refund.
27976,"I'm left with mixed feelings about Human: Fall Flat. It's a fun party game that I recommended to friends. Friends who are now stranded with an old version of the game, since Linux support was unexpectedly pulled.

It seems like poor business practice to offer a product, then pull the rug out from under your customers once you have their money. I understand that a smaller team has to make hard choices on where their focus should be, but a proactive, official explanation would've been better than the offhand forum reply that we received this morning.

I enjoyed my time with Human: Fall Flat, and thus I won't be asking for a refund. But I'm definitely going to be looking at future releases from No Brake with skepticism."
27977,this game totally clumsy and enjoy to play
27978,"8/10

One actually fun game, but scummy developers. They cancelled the Linux version without any notice, hoping none would ever notice."
27979,"Discontinued Linux support, what platform will the discontinue next?"
27980,"Dropped Linux support, silently, RIGHT AFTER having it on sale."
27981,"The team has no respect for its customers. Took my money, then dropped linux support."
27982,These jerks took money from consumers then pulled the rug from under their feet by silently dropping platform support with no refunds. It's an assinine behaviour and despite the game being great I can't ignore that. Screw these guys. Screw this game. I will NEVER buy anything they ever make again and I'll strongly encourage all my other friends to do the same.
27983,"Randomly dropped support for Linux users. Not cool. Like a lot of people, I was only willing to buy this game because it had native support. I'd even recommended it to others based on that fact along with the interesting game idea. While it is still an interesting game, I personally can't recommend a game that turns its back on existing customers like this."
27984,Dropped Linux support silently. These developers do not care about paying customers and they hold no regard for their playerbase.
27985,"Purchased game for Linux.  I (and several others) had issues running, but no fixes came through.  It now appears Linux support has been dropped completely."
27986,"Fun game, but I can't recommend it when the developer drops support for Linux after purchasing it."
27987,"Nice sandbox game, the controls are (voluntarily I suppose) a bit clumsy resulting in an often hilarious  show. The physics and deformation are really well done, enjoyable. However, there's no real fabric to the game, it can feel a little empty and purposeless, depending on your taste you may not spend countless hours in this world. On top of that, the Linux support has just been silently dropped (so much for existing customers..), making it hard to recommend"
27988,"This is a great game to play in coop and have fun with it.

I would definitly have recommensed this game if they did not [b]silently[/b] drop Linux support (while is was working great).

This is not how you should treat your customer."
27989,"[b]Deeply disappointed on Steam and the developers of this game as controllers are not supported , even though they claim they are[/b] or at least mine doesn't work and they aren't at all interested in helping out and plain stopped answering my support requests through email. My PS3 controller work with all other games on Steam but not this one. 
Steam wouldn't let me cancel the purchase since I tried to sort the issue our for to long with the developers. Lesson learned, don't try to fix stuff and claim a repurchase straight away next time.
Love the concept of the game though but without controller support its 1 player only and my kids have a hard time playing using only mouse and keyboard. A shame really because we all looked to much forward to be able to play together."
27990,"Dropping LInux
Dropping you"
27991,"I paid for Linux support, at first there were quite a lot of crashes which eventually went away (?) and now they have dropped it completely. If there's a SteamOS/Linux icon, I expect support for it."
27992,one of the best games  :Oa
27993,"THe game might be good but I'm now very angry now because the dev just disconninued the linux port.
""To focus on more features in the mac an win versions"".
Din't realy played the game cuz I wanted it to play with my friends and bought it at discound BECUASE the supported Linux that time.
Well would refund it if the 2 week wouldn't has passed already.

So I Don't recommend this game because of the dev and the fact that they just droped the Linux Version.
Sry but I feel a mucked!
Like HEY we support Linux and we have a discount, so buy the game.
And afterwards they droped the support and taken my money for nothing.
For me its like throwing my money out of the window... .... ha ha ha window(s) -.-""

Just hope that it will someday work with Steam Play if Valve remove the Linux client from the downloads or at an option to force Steam Play so I might be able to play it someday.
We'll see.
For now I'm realy pissed off!"
27994,This game is alot of fun. It would be even more fun if they added new maps and workshop :)
27995,"100 / 12 best game ever , non stop laughter for almost 5 hours. 3+ ppl on voice chat recomended."
27996,best game EVER in one sitting me and four others spent over 4 housr just fucking messing around i it was an experince to remeber.
27997,"Extremely slow content release schedule for this game, in the year that I've owned it, there has been hardly any change in the game that adds playable content. I'd avoid until workshop support is added."
27998,charming little puzzle game with a bunch of fun parkour. Best played with friends put its still fun alone. If puzzles and parkour and physics based games are your thing you'll love it
27999,Good mindless fun game to waste time with friends over.
28000,"Highly recommended! Great fun, especially in multiplayer. Levels are fun and the right amount of challenging but it could do with more. If/when the workshop is added then it will be even better."
28001,Ilike it
28002,"If you are looking for a game to have fun with your friends and laugh I suggest this game to you 
But if you don't have any friends who play this game it would be boring for you"
28003,extremely fun game to mess around in with friends
28004,"I love Human Fall Flat there is just two things that I can think of that can make it better. 1# If you can have Multiplayer for modder because I don't like having to go back and forth for Multiplayer and player levels. 2# Another thing that would be nice to have would be Mods for Human Fall Flat.
 Thats my review I hope you (Creators) get this review,
 Thank you,"
28005,Best played with a couple of friends
28006,"One of the most endearing little silly games to play out recently. It's clever and funny alone and a hoot with some friends, Runs on a microwave and plays like butter, absolutely worth a go for a lighthearted time. They finally did it, adding workshop support was all the game needed to supplement its short length."
28007,这游戏，一个人玩挺正常的，一起玩的话，像一群傻子一样
28008,needs new maps
28009,now has workshop!!!! :D :O !
28010,"Really a great and fun game. But we are waitin like for years for new content that's not only cosmetics....
I guess the developer would do better in creating new level or the implementation of the workshop so the community could create their own stuff/level.
PLS guys, start beeing smart and work on that fastly.
You should have noticed that noone is waiting for your customs and stuff like that. This type of stuff is not usefull when you cannot play anymore because there is nothin left to do....
You created a very very beautiful game with lots of fun and nice mechanics.
Dont leave you community like that. We want to enjoy your game further and keep you in great memories...."
28011,"Fun with friends, not so much alone. If you have other friends to muck around with you, get it."
28012,"Finally has workshop that you can play with friends, some maps can be buggy and only the host sees certain objects vital to beating the map. Not sure if that is the developers fault or whomever made the workshop map. All in all a great co-op game, and is still getting better."
28013,"Great game to play with friends. Challenging yet easy enough that you are not stuck on a puzzle for half an hour. 

Main complaint is the lack of more levels. Took me 5 hours to play through the game a bunch and now I am sad that there are no more levels to play. A workshop would be amazing."
28014,Good Game For macOS
28015,"10/10 would play again, though I hope they add more content in the future.  I'd love to see some new levels :steamhappy"
28016,"This game is incredibly fun to play with a group of mates, But quickly becomes boring once you've already finished the game with those mates. I can see you getting replayability with a different group of people and stuff, but I can't actually give this game the review it deserve purely because of the fact that the dev keeps adding customes instead of new maps.

I loved this game and it was fun, but it's been out for awhile now and a lot of people have been asking for some new maps or workshop content, but nothing comes out. Ontop of that, the dev doesn't even talk about the fact that this is something a pretty big group of players (who have already paid 15 bucks) have been wanting for awhile and there's no mention of it, no progress talks or even ideas for new maps. 

I understand that this is a small indie game and i can't expect quick updates like that of a AAA title, but when it's been out this long and the only real content that has been added since i've played it, is skins. I would of much preferred if the dev just spent that time trying to add more maps or more things to do on each map, or even just try to add modding support. 

All in all, awesome game to play with mates if you're looking for some casual fun, but beware, the replayability of this game is very little(although that could just be me, but i remember the ways to get through the maps each time, so it's hard for me to feel that challenge). 

I just hope that the dev can give us some insight on whether or not he's going to add more maps, or more to the existing maps or allowing the workshop, and i would like to see the progress of this sort of thing because It makes me feel better about a game when the dev is being really transparent and showing you what's happening and what's planned. 

Hope this game only gets better."
28017,"Hi, I spent so many on the Xbox side (yes, I own it on both) and really love this game."
28018,adorable little game but lacks levels and it would do so well with steam workshop
28019,"Brilliant game but seriously lacks content! Devs literally don't give a damn about the people playing the game, all they need to do is enable workshop content."
28020,"No matter how many times me and my mates have played this, we will always have a great time. Yes, the game can do with more maps or a workshop but even without it its such a great game. The laughs, cry and fails are unforgettable. I deffo recommend this game!"
28021,WORKSHOP YESSS
28022,"Put a map creator in and you'll have a community for years, like, really. plz."
28023,I love this game so much - it's so funny and has brought me and my son so many laughs. It inspired me and my son to make a YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnhGpiAErW6zT_RByboj1zA?view_as=subscriber
28024,"Very fun physics, a blast to play alone even more so with friends."
28025,"I dont understand how the reviews can be so high when the developers haven't added a single new map or workshop availbility in over a year. Like the game is so fun but then you beat the last level and have nothing to do. Make some god damn levels or atleast tease that you're working on it.

Don't buy it until they add more levels, the games takes like 2.5 hours to beat so you can't even refund it once you're done."
28026,as you can see i have 754hrs on this game...yeah its pretty good
28027,"Was going alright until a pushcart handle glitched into the ground causing me to have to restart entire level if I wanted to keep playing -but I didnt, I just stopped playing.... waste of £12..."
28028,"Very enjoyable game, even the frustrating parts were hilarious.
Enjoy the ragdoll physics and the hilarity that ensues with trying to make your way through the maps. 
Good game to play with a bunch of friends."
28029,I wish there was more this game was amazing to play with a group of freinds.
28030,I love This game.Donnot ask me why.It is The most funniest game i have played.If you are tired of killing ` shooting.just join This game.Let us explore The world
28031,I love this game. I'd love to see a level that's just having fun with physics though!
28032,yeah pretty beuno
28033,"Great game but, I wish there was more to it as i've played 16.5 hrs but I've ran out of ways to complete levels and i've done all sorts of ways with friends I wish their was a community workshop to it as that would make the game even better."
28034,"This game is amazing and I can't stop playing it, although there is one problem that sort of ruins the game: it runs HORRIBLY. I can't go through one moment of the game without just thinking about how bad the framerate is.plz fix."
28035,10/10 for being able to endlessly troll your friends while they attempt to actually complete the levels
28036,"Really fun coop game, needs some need updates"
28037,"This game is such a hoot with friends! Playing Human Fall Flat with buddies is such a good laugh, it's so silly and team work is key! I adore this game and I would suggest it to anyone. c:"
28038,extremely fun game but a bit overpriced.
28039,So THIS is what it's like to be my uncle.
28040,"I like feeling drunk all the time and being in an endless loop of falling to my innevitable death.

Znaybar"
28041,"So, this game is fun BUT, it does get boring after a few hours."
28042,"Score:
=========================
Fantastic coop game!

Score: 8/10

Summary:
==========================
☑ Graphics: Funny
☑ Sound/Music: Ok
☑ Difficulty: Medium
☑ Game time: Medium, depends on how fast you solve the puzzles.
☑ Story: It does not have (?)
☑ Game modes: Single Player and Couch/Online Coop Multiplayer.

Additional comments:
==========================
It is best played with a friend on couch coop. The movement is very funny and fighting with a friend is also amazing!"
28043,"Hello, this game is INSANELY GOOD JUST BUY IT ALREADY"
28044,It's fun
28045,Frustratingly fun game.
28046,I like this game that you can troll around or make it serious till the end
28047,"it's a real good game. you can get very creative with it as well! but if they add more body models then it will be more fun! it'll be like having pets in games. or... humaniod creatures i guess? i dont know i'm just thinking that they might add like.... i donno a half-snake bob model? anyways it's a very good game and i love it. OHI THOUGHT OF A IDEA! TINY BOBS AND BIG BOBS! what i'm saying is, if they undate the game more, maybe  you can level your size and add stuff to your character!!!!"
28048,"Good Game, Had soo much fun, but now the devs haven't done anything else to the game.
I think that they should add workshop so then we can go on custom maps created by other players so then that people would start playing the game again."
28049,IT very good and it take a lat or mind to solve puzzel ver nice game
28050,I don't like games where the goal and purpose is to beat the clunky controls which get more retarted by every passing minute; this is a newer version of QWOP
28051,Very fun co-op game to play without too much stress. Campaign mode is a little bit short however. Took me and a friend about 5 hours to complete the game
28052,"This game is very silly. The narrator describes humans very well with his wit, and the physics and controls in this game, while they take some getting used to, are very unique and intuitive once you get into it. Every level has unique challenges to solve that range from climbing a mountain to plugging machines into other machines or shooting yourself with a catapult. Yes, seriously.
It's perhaps more fun with friends. I really wanted to grab onto a wrecking ball that my friend was swinging around from a crane and ride it but I missed :/ eh maybe next time. :P"
28053,clay people lol
28054,Completed....I never want to see this game again.
28055,nice
28056,"This game is very fun....if you have a friend or two to play with. The controls are hard to manage, but I personally believe that's the point of the game. Making your own character seems to be the best part of the game, for me. You have to work and strategize to complete the level. It's challenging but it's also fun to grab your friend and throw them off the edge. After completing all the levels, this game doesn't have much to offer, but it's worth a one-time play through."
28057,"A fun game to play.
Has one of best mechanics ever made."
28058,very good game deff amust buy
28059,"The game is fun, for the first playtrough, but after that, there isnt anything to do. If the devs would add a level editor or more levels, then the game would be worth it. the character creation is a fun gimmic though."
28060,"Good game, especially for the MLG pros out there"
28061,good game for those mlg pros.
28062,"spend time with friends online and having a good time, is a reason to explore Human: fall flat. wierdly fun game, which i did look forward to play. not a penny waisted, truly a game for laughing and kill time."
28063,pretty good
28064,Very fun and interesting game
28065,"Pros:
- Trading cards
- Achievements
- Insane laughter when played with friends!

Cons:
- Not fun alone
- Not too much gameplay.

Worth the money? Yes
Worth on a discount? YES!
Worth for free? OMG YES!"
28066,"A really simple, fun puzzle solving game with tons of ways to do each puzzle. The only downside is that the controls are quite clunky at times, which is only mildy frustrating. That's about it, It's a simple game. Not much else to it.

8/10"
28067,"Was gifted this game by a friend, we spent the next 3 hours playing it straight messing around/completing challenges, actually semi fun."
28068,"I could not recomend against this game more. It is painful to play, the controls are akward, the visuals are head-ache inducing, and the level design is worse than a three year old with cerebral paulsey could do. 4/5 stars"
28069,Really fun and silly game to play with my kids :)
28070,"Where are the puzzles ?

Trying to move a painfully slow and clumsy blob on narrow platforms doesn't constitute a puzzle. Cheap graphics and sounds are no incentive to hang in there. And of course, the trademark of retardesign, the game flaw of the century: checkpoints instead of a correct save menu that would make the grind bearable.

Boring from the first minutes, immensely disappointing.
Falls flat indeed.
"
28071,"What can i say, amazing experience while jumping with friends. u can catch thing and throw and also workshop fine stuff"
28072,"Great Game! Easy controls, and good puzzles."
28073,super sickling game
28074,I like this game.
28075,"Decided to give this a whirl, after only hearing about for it a long time, only to play multiplayer online.
It's very addictive fun, complex puzzles, and some of the most hilarious bugs of all time. The second player got dropped into the game twice, and he controlled both of them. Made for some hilarious situations, where we had a 2.5 player experience. 

The premise of the game is easy enough. Solve puzzles using physics. And it's hella fun!"
28076,Loved it! Not super long but so much fun if you have a fun friend to bring along ♥
28077,"I makes feel sad that I have to give this game a negative rating. Although I cannot recommend it, it is really not that bad.

[u]Why I rate it negatively:[/u]

The main reason is that I do not enjoy a game in which the main (or actually, only) diffifulty comes from the difficulty of controlling your character's body. I mean, I do enjoy challenging levels, challenging puzzles and everything, but to struggle with a bad body to finish some tasks which would be otherwise trivial if you have a normal body, is another matter. The person you control in this game seems to have no bones and drunk as well. It walks as if dragging its body, and the arms would even get stuck with its own head. Most of the tasks are obvious enough, and would be quite simple with a normal body.

[u]Pros:[/u]

I would say that the graphics are great, music is great and the scenes are beautifully designed."
28078,Probably the most fun I had since portal. Do yourself a favor and play with a fellow human being.
28079,"Got a friend....? You do? Great! 

NOW! SELL HIM/HER AND BUY THIS GAME, BECAUSE ITS ALL YOU NEED IN LIFE. 


P.S You may want to find a new friend to play this game with. :)"
28080,"There is potential, I didn't see the whole game, and it has a certain appeal. but it just wasn't good enough to keep me hanging in until the end."
28081,Game is unique and fun to play with friends. It's too short(it took us 5 hours to complete it with screwing around a lot). Needs more maps(maybe map workshop)
28082,"A bunch white people assaulted me but, I threw them off a ledge so its aight. 


10/10"
28083,nice
28084,"This game is a worthy one to play with friends, really fun and relaxing. Our team had a lot of laugh while playing. But one big disadvantage is that it has too few maps, we played only 2 days and we only got ""Aztec"" left. Hope there will be more map, soon."
28085,Fun to play with friends but too few maps to play. Need workshop support.
28086,Very entertaining
28087,"Amazing Game! Controls are weird, but game is good overall!"
28088,Iha jees
28089,this game is absolutely lovely also if you can make the lobby bigger i would like that
28090,"Best game to play with your best friend.
The levels are a bit short. I honestly hope this game have workshop that we can make our own maps.
"
28091,Garbageeeee
28092,"We want the workshooooooooop, pleaseeeeeee!!!!!!!"
28093,"I like this game, but I would like it better if they added more levels and fixed the flying glitch where you cans spam space and fly on the last couple levels"
28094,"Great with friends. Horrible with random people. Game has been abandoned by the developer(s). Extreme amount of bugs issues and glitches in online play and the game will make you exit or alt F4 60% of the time.  

Most people yopu play with online will rush through the level to the end without a care for anyone else. Best to only play this game with friends"
28095,"The game crashes on both me and my friend's computer. With the amount of money paid, you'd think they would have ways to prevent that. Other games on steam do not just crash like that on me and I have games far larger than this one for the same price or less. I've tried turning the graphics down and everything, but it still lags and crashes. Honestly, I want my money back. I bought two of these innitially for me and my friend. Sorely dissapointed."
28096,"Never laughed so much while playing a computer game than while playing this, awesome."
28097,"Just over 4 hours of playing with a friend and the laughs did not stop. This game has much more content that I originally thought, the puzzles are nice and the physics are very impressive. We were able to beat the game in just under 5 hours but there seems to be a bit more to it. I'd love to get this for more friends and play with a bigger party."
28098,v nice
28099,"Fun and challenging little game.
The Multiplayer was a definite blast; can't get better than dragging friends and yourself off the map, then repeating the process.
Would recommend as it's quite a solid game, finished it and all achievements in just under 20 hours.
Frustrating at times, but if you want a casual brain teaser with funny physics, this should be one of your go-tos.
7.5/10"
28100,"Really awesome game, could use steam workshop obviously, but well worth the purchase."
28101,"This is an amazing game! I love the funny ragdoll-like physics and the fact that you can pull trains and such! If I were to have something added in, it would be ai bots that woul help you out and would act like normal players!"
28102,Fun little game to play with your friends sadly it is so short
28103,"(Long-Winded Explanation of Game Mechanics) [Skip]
Human Fall Flat, a ragdoll physics game with velcro hands, entertained me for a while. Control scheme is a typical WASD for locomotion while Left and Right Mouse button stretches out the hands for grabbing things. One more thing: you can jump! Press the Space bar to jump. Gain some momentum by spamming the heck out this and holding both Left and Right Mouse buttons in order to jump huge gaps. Shamble around like a zombie while desperately leaping over gaps. Rotate the camera by moving the mouse which also moves the direction of the outstretched hands.

(I Hate Hook Puzzles)
I spent hours trying to explore nooks and crannies while avoiding conventional solutions to the game's many puzzles. I particularly dislike using hooks to swing across anything in the game and would rather cling onto a wall like an insect to reach my destination.

(Performance Related Game Lag)
You too can experience the game like I did, but better! My computer is crap when it comes to framerate for this game in later stages. The game performed alright considering my laptop come from the year 2013. I assume just about anyone else out there owns a computer that performs better than mine. If your computer can play Saints Row the Third without lagging, congratulations! Your computer is better than mine.

(Multiplayer Experiences-Lag-Trolls-Aloof Players)
The time needed to join a game took about 3 minutes. The few times I managed to play a multiplayer game, I experienced lag with more than 2 people. In the chaotic mess of a multiplayer game, I came across silent gamers that took it upon themselves to cling onto me, carry me off, and throw me from a cliff. Down I tumbled into another experience where players remained clueless and careless on how to solve a puzzle. Their aloof nature infuriated me as my attempt to solve it on my own were ruined by their interloping. I almost gave up until a few of the 7 other players actually solved it by chance.

(Conclusion)
This game is best enjoyed on a single player playthrough. Plug in a USB controller for someone else to play from the same computer (good old fashion CO-OP 2 player that seldom shows up in modern games). Nobody says another actual person needs to be around for 2nd player. Use that other player as a useless ragdoll or stool whenever it's convenient. Go out there and enjoy this game on your own time, then maybe try dipping your toes in the deep end of multiplayer. Best of luck to anyone that plays this. Until next review, see ya!"
28104,"Pre sound game, not many levels though."
28105,Very interesting game

28111,"Only playable with at least 1 friend.

Breaked my ankle. Killed myslef several times. Had fun. Drowned. Bugged the whole game until I could fly. Game crashed and made screaming noices.
10/10 would buy again"
28112,best multiplayer game ever but need to add more levels
28113,"fun with friends if you have friends
prolly why it wasn't fun for me"
28114,This is a very fun game with friends. I would not pay full price for this game as it is now. Not very many maps. I beat all maps with my friend in about 3 hours. If this had steam workshop i would def recommend at full price. I really do hope the devs make this work with steam workshop

28119,"Silly, easy and fun, great for co-op :)"
28120,Too much fun please this game with my friends!
28121,Best ragdoll p2p physics puzzle game on unity so far.
28122,"this game is so fun i cant play it much but when i do i have a blast
"
28123,"Very fun game, small, around 600 MB, but the performance is not very good on Linux."
28124,"Human: Fall Flat is definitely fun with friends but I'm not sure if it's worth full price, if you're interested I suggest you read the short lists below and check it out when it's on sale.

COOL: 
+ Easy to start, understand and play co-up experience. You can play solo, but is simply quite boring.
+ Surprisingly funny and engaging for such simple mechanics. At least with friends.
+ Stylized graphics and design are a'ight. Nothing amazing but works for what it's trying to do.
+ Achievements and other minor challenges are introduced to add some spice to the game, but still has limited replay value.
+ Music is rather surprising. Sometimes doesn't fit the mood, but it might be the most professional-seeming part of this indie game.
+ There are apparently ideas to have a Workshop where people could share levels and avatars they made themselves, this could greatly increase the game's lifespan.

NOT-SO-COOL:
- Without any friends to play with it's simply a rather slow-paced walking simulator with some puzzles and parkour mixed in.
- Everythnig is physics based with no real challenges. Just small chores that are hard to do due to the nature of the controls. This was funny in ""Octodad"" for example, but not so much here since there is no narrative to make it funny, only your friends.
- It's also really easy to go out-of-bounds or sequence break. Half the times the intended path is less obvious then the alternate ones, meaning level design is a bit rubbish.
- A far better experience with a controller then keyboard and mouse but inputs seems to lag quite easily when you're playing with a lot of people.
- For a game that is so easy to break and get stuck in, there isn't an /unstuck command or anything like that. You can only ""reset to checkpoint"" the ENTIRE server when one person is stuck. 


So all in all, it seems this game has a solid idea but fails a bit at the excecution. Maybe a bit more time in development could've given it a bit more character to work with. I think 15 bucks for less then 10 hours of rather limited fun might be a bit much for some people so I recommend to grab it on sale as long as you've got some friends to fool around with.

I hope this helped, if you have any question please leave a comment.
Cheers!"
28125,"Very difficult to figure out on your own. That said, difficulty and puzzle type games are fun, for me at least. I can understand where some would get frustrated and just look up walkthroughs. 

Another Pro, this game is co op."
28126,"You have to get used to the mechanics of grabbing to get along, but very fun, especially with friends.

Nice. The new levels added periodically are always enjoyable unlike the impossible Chinese levels. It's cool being able to watch Tom & Jerry or a movie in the game after downloading certain levels."
28127,fun
28128,This game will live on for a very long time. It just needs to allow multiplayer workshop content.
28129,"i love it, and its amazing when you play with freinds"
28130,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
28131,"Fun game, blast to play with friends. but during the last two levels i was able to fucking fly and bypassall challanges and puzzles."
28132,"Very fun game and well worth the (little) money. 

Yes it's short, and if you know the mechanics you will run thru this game.

Replay factor is good, there are a lot of side missions and a lot of ways to finish levels.

Fun for young and old. Must buy!"
28133,fun with friends
28134,they dont add new maps
28135,"The controls are pain in the backside. This ""game"" is not about solving puzzles, it is overcoming the awkward controls. No fun."
28136,OOF!
28137,"Great game and and great graphics and great laughs
"
28138,It's fun to play with friends. A lot of hilarious moments.
28139,"Need more levels, or workshop!"
28140,"So much fun playing this with my friend, we were fighting each other pulling hair more than playing the mission objective"
28141,"Pretty much finished the game in under 2 hours, refunded it, money back. Great experience, would recommend."
28142,"Was a fun game, If you spam space YOU CAN FLY. and finish all the levels in 30 seconds or less :)"
28143,It gets pretty repetitive at a short amount of time although some of the puzzles are good. Thought it would be fun for a long time but a really short-lived game unless you're with a bunch of friends. I would only recommend you getting this from a 75%+ off sale. I think it's too much for its original price.
28144,"You Should Play This Game.This Game Was Interesting Experince For Me I Didn't Play Single I Just Played Online Or With My Friend You Have To Try This Game 
9.99/10"
28145,"Credits to Edna, Garrickson and 神"
28146,"A multiplayer (and more importantly splitscreen) game where you solve physics puzzles and do silly stuff with your completely drunk character? YES PLEASE!
I play this with my grilfirend and its simply enormous fun.
The character costumization is quite impressive and the local coop is very simple to set up (not like portal where you need 10 minutes to get it right). 
I like it"
28147,"pretty fun and surprisingly engaging.

very good value for money imo, would recommond to people who likes this kind of genre"
28148,"awesome game to play with friends online. You can just play the game sure... but there are so many ways to mess around. explore a bit, tinker with some of the puzzle elements, or even grab your friend and throw them off a cliff for the hell of it. You guys will have a blast. Only have 9 hour because there needs, like the others said. Add workshop"
28149,"A tremendously fun and unique puzzle game, with ungodly amounts of sheer fuckery on multiplayer. Also, more games need to have avatar creation as good as this. Only complaint is that workshop support would make this game of the year. Make it happen, devs. Custom maps and i'll buy 4 more copies. 8/10 dealthy falls."
28150,Beat the game playing 2 player spitscreen with my wife. This was extremely fun and would love to see additional levels added to the game.
28151,great game 10/10
28152,"10/10 Game. 
01/10 Credits. They're in Comic Sans."
28153,"Very nice puzzle game that involve alot with physics. 
Beautiful and simple graphics.

28157,You'll be laughing so hard you'll get tired.
28158,Good game
28159,So fucking fun
28160,"Human fall flat is a somewhat open free parkour platformer where you can scale mountains or climb to the top of the world! you should probably wait for a steam sale though, as it only lasts for about a weekend without friends. Otherwise you can gather achievements or remodel your house to whatever you want! creativity makes this game the best it can be. Do i recommend this game?



Yes, Yes I do."
28161,Bought it on sale and beat in less than two hours. played through again and got a werid glitch where I could fly. So I got my refund.
28162,Short but fun. The sale price was worth it. The blob characters are weirdly cute.
28163,"This is an amazing game and funny, play with your friends!......."
28164,"dont even hesitate about buying this game becuase you will not be disapointed. grab this and a few friends and be ready to laugh yourself into a coma. just spent the last 5hrs or so on this and its been amazing fun.

still an amazing game to play with friends. get it downloaded :D"
28165,fun just fun.
28166,This game is crashing after seconds under Linux for months now. Nothing is done by the developers to fix this. Therefore I do not recommend this game.
28167,"Human: Fall Flat is both quirky and fun. It gives you probably a couple of hours of laugh if you're playing with a friend. But gets tedious towards the final few stages where you're just wishing the stage ends sooner. 

This game is not fully optimized so you get random FPS drops but it does not affect gameplay. 

Rating: 2 out of 5
Replayability: Little to zero.
Verdict: Get it when it is on sale. 
"
28168,"A great game if you have friends to play. The soundtrack is amazing, the levels are fun and you can bhop. What's not to like?"
28169,Fun while it lasted but its too short
28170,"fun game, waiting for workshop"
28171,"Very good game! A lot of fun playing with your friends.
One thing missing (and as far as I know it's already in closed beta) - Workshop maps.
We need more maps to play with friends!"
28172,"I really enjoyed playing the game. It might be a bit sad when playing alone, but with friends, it is a blast! We played until 1AM for God's sake and I recorded it too! Many a laugh has been shared along the road to the credits and many memorable moments. I recommend it to anyone who like nice, relaxing fun!"
28173,good
28174,"It's actually pretty fun, messing around with the game's ragdoll physics.

Now I need friends to play it with. Can't wait to see what mishaps we get ourselves into."
28175,This game is so funny if you play online drag people of the map its fun
28176,"CONSIDER THIS BEFORE PARTING WITH YOUR MONEY:

It  crashes on me all the time.  I barely get started on the first single-player level before it crashes.
I also noticed (on Sep 24, 2018) that Friends and Online modes are ALPHA (not even beta).

"
28177,A very funny and popular puzzle game. Makes me LOL
28178,Such a hilarious game. Very fun and challenging. Always fun to play with friends who have never played it before. Much laughs to be had!
28179,"Absolutely Fun and Awesome all around game. I LOVE IT, I haven't laughed at ragdoll physics like this in a while!"
28180,Workshop integration please! (with working Multiplayer)
28181,"no need to fear, workshop is here"
28182,"boring by yourself,
endless fun with friends"
28183,best game ever
28184,小孩子玩的倒是津津有味。
28185,"its fun with friend but never trust anyone
"
28186,"for 15$, skip it. it's not worth it at all for that price.

this game isn't worth more than 5$ at the very most for another victem of early accses making a quirky game that could be really fun into something realitivly boring, bland, barron, tedious. does HFF have a cool idea, yes it does, does it pull off a game that i can really have fun with?, not really. one playthrough and i honestly can't go back and play these levels that feel so empty that it puts dynasty warriors 9, and any generic survival game to shame. 

there's only 6-7 levels included, and no straightforward workshop support. and this game isn't something like half life 2 episode 1 where even at 20$ it'd be a game that's well worth the money, HFF isn't. it really isn't, and the lack of regular updates puts this game with litterly 95% of early accses games. unfinished, a good idea with a lackluster game attched to it. 

is there workshop support. yes, but it's so stupid to accses, there's no real mod tools that are easily avalible. and for a game like this. it needs easy to get into, easy to make addons to be more alive than a few month old coma paitent. 

TL;DR good idea for a game, horrid execution."
28187,i liked everything
28188,Great toddler simulator physics puzzle game. Clunky at first and the fun builds up.
28189,A unique and clever puzzle/platforming game that is a blast with buds
28190,jello-y humans
28191,fun to mess around in
28192,"Very fun game if you love puzzles, ragdoll physics, and messing around with your friends. Definitely would recommend"
28193,"This game is completely hilarious. The first time you do all the puzzles for the first time and you feel so accomplished. The second time, you discover co-op and completing all the levels takes significantly longer. Part of this due to the fact that you spend half the time trying to figure out how to throw the other off without falling off yourself. Then after that, if you still interested in the game, you start to work on things like extended climbing, speed running, and other such cheating ways. Eventually you reach the point where you have no other intentions that to brake the game completely and utterly. 10/10 would try to break game again.
"
28194,very gucci
28195,"I love this game is funny and good for play on multiplayer.
The physical are so dumb but i love it."
28196,"This game is a lot of fun!
Yeah, it's a puzzle game with human physics and it's multiplayer, so you can solve the puzzles with friends.
The puzzles are really big and you have to solve them by lifting, pressing, launching, or climbing things, which is really cool! The controls are really easy to learn as well.
Plus, you can edit your character with paint and preset outfits and can make your own design by hand!

However,

The game might be a little dull because it's all puzzles, which can get a little frustrating, and there is hardly any music in it.
The only music there is is melodic, soothing piano, and a tranquil orchestra.
Not to mention your character is not very fast, so it is easy to get bored playing.

But if you enjoy puzzles, and play with the right people, solving the puzzles on a roll, then it can be quite exciting!
Also, the physics in this game are actually fairly decent. There aren't any glitches where you trip or get flung by a small crack or anything.
And another thing, if you're really clever, you can actually skip areas of the map entirely by exploring to get to the exit faster, so you can even race your friends if you wanted to!

I highly recommend this game."
28197,This game is rediculous i love it
28198,very fun! super entertaining and all out just halarious. the things you can do is extradorniary with endless laughter!
28199,"Imádtam !! Nagyon vicces, és szórakoztató !
I loved it !! Very Funny, and fun"
28200,Simple and dumb but hilarious and tons of fun with friends.
28201,best game ever to play with a group of friends <3
28202,"Had a great time with this. Once you get into the controls it´s one hell of a funny game if you play with 2+ people.

One of the most important things i want to point out is, that due to the game´s engine (physics ...) you have very high freedom in how you proceed and solve the puzzles. (not talking about all, but the most puzzles)

Could have more Levels though, not anybody of us is an achievement hunter. FIrst playthrough in 4 hours and we were not in a hurry, this time includes character customization and AFK times.

Worth, if on sale (currently 50%). 

100% would be too much imo."
28203,LOVE IT! its funny
28204,"This is easily one of my favorite indie games. Though the story is short there are many little easter eggs hidden in all the levels and a lot of things to mess around with afterwards. One thing that almost stopped me from buying this game is that it looked like you needed people to play with, but that is not the case. Playing with ohters after the story is a very nice touch but overall the solo aspect alone is totally worth full price. *Strongly Recommend*"
28205,you get to be a thicc curvy boi
28206,"0.4 hours played, instant favorit. best played with friends and either sober or under any influence."
28207,20/10 Recommend its really fun and very intuitive and I really enjoyed my playthrough
28208,jesus christ add workshop
28209,"Funny game, especially when you can play it with a friend.
The style is sweet and the movements are funny.
Controls are unexpectedly intuitive and well made.
The overall performance is good but at least I faced some microlags sometimes, even with a constant 60 fps.

But even with a lot of positive points,
the lack of levels and workshop is the worst thing about this game.
You are quickly through the levels and not much is changing.
Of course, you could spent a year customizing your Bob,
but thats usually not what keeps people playing this game.

A level editor would make it worth the 15€.
I would not recommend buying it when not on sale!
Otherwise (for at least 50% off) it is a good choice."
28210,"Wasn't even worth the half off $7 I spent on it. Due to the fact that every time I play it, a black screen pops up with just audio. It sounds like when I hit CTRL ALT to leave the game, a gate opens.... so that's cool... I guess If you like $7 games with only two sound cues and music.... (Black screen, gate noises when I hit CTRL ALT, and maybe the ability to walk around) and yes, I have tried restarting my computer, restarting the game, redownloading the game, and looking it up, apparently nobody else has had this issue... comment halp plz."

Mostly climbing
Picking up stuff
Flying over walls
Sailing a boat and alot more!"
28216,"Great, chaotic coop game. But we need a map editor for more maps!"
28217,It is a good game ... and funny .. when trying to do what needs done to get thru it ... but i can only play in installments as i get motion sickness (might look at camera adjustment speed if it has it) - other then that .. its a great game that even my kids are enjoying and laughing for hours playing! ...
28218,"The funiest game of your Steam Library.
If you want to laugh, have fun with no brainbreaker puzzles I recommend this game.

PROS:
Laugh your ***off playing this game with friends
Fun puzzles
Good amount of base maps
Online Multiplayer

CONS:
Devs need to unlock custom map creation and support for this maps to play online

80/100 for an Indie Game"

[u]What I didn’t  like: [/u]
[list]
    [*]Puzzles for me were too simple

[/list]

[u]More in depth: [/u]
[list]
    [*]The game is designed and encouraged to be played in co-op and that’s only how I played it. It can be played solo, but why would you. Like most games, it is more fun with friends

    [*]The game has you control what is best described as a drunk person. You control the arms height and grabbing with the controls and the simple nature of grabbing ledges is something that you must learn to do well. Your character has weight and physics that you need to use to solve puzzles.

    [*]The puzzles that you do are in a way simple as if they were any harder; only the true hardcore puzzle fans would bother. Most of what you will be doing starts out simple like learning to push and pull objects, jumping and ledge grabbing. It moves on to more stuff like swinging and grabbing ropes, steering vehicles, and more advanced contraptions with enough variety between each level to not get bored or too challenging that even got a my dad to try it out with me.

    [*]Overall the game is a very simple game with its weird player mechanics that is such a blast to play with friends and family that are willing to goof off and not take it seriously. I don’t know how much fun it would have been if I played it solo. Despite that, having a fun co-op puzzle game is rare so it’ s good to see that this was a great game

The biggest workaround is to disable key repeat after starting the game.

1) start the game.
2) in the terminal type without quotes ""xset r off""

Only a few levels to choose from and they can last from 5-20 minutes based on whether or not there are people and whether those people are messing around or not. It has a nice soundtrack and some of the puzzles were interesting enough, but there's not really much to it. If they added in more I'd happily get on and try something new out, but it doesn't seem like we'll be getting that any time soon. Overall, an enjoyable experience for a short time before it gets boring and/or repetetive. 3.7/10, many better games for the same or even lower price that are available."
28247,This is a great game. i have fun with it. good game 10/10
28248,"This game is basically amazing. If you love goofy and funny physics then add this damn gem to your cart! All it needs now is a Level Editor and a Workshop, now that would be super cool!
"
28249,oh shit i purchase this game 4-5 days ago i m waiting for this game in offer but after my purchasing it is in sale shit i buy in 479 rs i m waiting for this since 1 year but then i was purchase this 4-5 day ago shit bro shit .......... but overall i like this game and i want more puzzels and stages and story and levels this is too smal game plz give workshop to us plz...................
28250,"Still waiting for the Workshop...

Edit: Devs provided"
28251,"The game is alright,
at its current state there are a decent amount of levels, hoever, once done.... they are done, little to no replayability.
still currently waiting for the "" workshop update"" which would be worth it.
but no update within months.
only get when on sale"
28252,"This game is hell fun and it totally worth it on 15.50 myr on sale~talk about the control, it looks no bad at all so far because it is humanflate(FLATE)...so to whom are impatient type of people I don't recommend, it is because no spoiler on this review! The graphics looks deserved itself, the music is so soft&warm, but I feel a little weird maybe it was my personal idk??

OVERALL THIS IS A VERY RECOMMENDED GAME~

It is not so hard after few hours of playing to handle this game."
28253,"An interesting concept that ""falls"" short.

The game although amusing to watch via Twitch or YouTube is more frustrating than it is fun when actually played. I experienced the game for the first time co-op and both my friend and I found the puzzles to be underwhelming. The physics for movement is more annoying than it is fun, but considering how the game is built I can't think of a way it could be improved while maintaining its design style in terms of perspective and mechanics.

Both my friend and I tried the game using an Xbox One controller and frankly it was a struggle as the movements for the puzzles became more complex. Not a struggle as in ""Man this puzzle is hard because it requires knowledge A or B with skill A or B."" no more like ""These physics and controls make this object move at an almost unpredictable path."" We honestly felt like moving objects around left us at the mercy of ""RNG"". But that's just our opinion.

Overall, the game is interesting. Many people seem to enjoy Human Fall Flat as it holds a Very Positive on Steam at the time of my review.

However, it's not a game for me and personally I can't see myself ever playing it again, even with a friend.

I bought the game on discount and I couldn't recommend it at that price point.

This is the first game on Steam I've ever refunded in the seven years I've used this platform.

Either way, this is just my opinion. Hopefully it might help with your decision to buy.

(Edited for spelling)"
28254,This game is an incredible amount of fun it offers challenge and fun and with online with friends and strangers it is great but it feels so quick i hope we can get a sequel or DLC eventually i would highly reccomend this game
28255,"As a game that was given to me for free by a friend, I didn't expect to like Human: Fall Flat as much as I did. This game is hilariously good.

Playing online with friends make every level enjoyable, to the point of crying with laughter. The combination of the game-based physics & brain teasing puzzles are entertaining to say the least."
28256,"Very surprised at the amount of content in this game.

Performance is top tier, it runs at like 400fps.

Any glitches are ultimately hilarious and not detrimental to the gameplay.

10/10"
28257,awesome game but need more maps and stuff!!! at least open this to the community workshop for replayability
28258,ITs a SO FUN!!!!

28262,"The game is good,but too short..."
28263,way to short..beat it with my friend in one sitting.
28264,"This game is F***ing amazing me and a few friends had a blast playing this game!!!!!! although i do wish more levels were added but this is a game we could olay over and over and still have a blast each time 
"
28265,i played this with my mom and we laughed our asses off because of the glitches and fighting each other by picking up each other and throw us off the edge XD
28266,"need workshop and more level of contents....
overall was good enough to play with friends"
28267,I love the game it is a challanging little game with only some of the best physics i've played with.
28268,"Crashes a lot with a bug I believe is in the game itself (crashes a lot after 'using' things, like doors).

Looks/looked like a really fun game, attempted to contact the devs but didn't get a reply, so I refunded it."
28269,Bad server's and high ping.Use and throw
28270,"Fun, silly, and best played online or with friends.
The true potential in this game lies with the players. It's already fun to play on your own but it's way better with others. I've made some good friends playing this game, and I'm grateful for that.
The Steam workshop is really good too, so many amazing maps to be played!
If you like ragdoll physics games, try this game out."
28271, WORKSHOP PLEASE. OR MORE MAPS
28272,"Game is short with very few levels to play through, minimal to no updates. Really lacks workshop support."
28273,don't buy it. devs keep adding achievements to try and personally piss me off.
28274,This game is so much fun with friends. I laughed so hard I cried. I really hope the developers continue to add more levels. Great job! Keep it coming.
28275,"A-D, A-D Climbing Simulator 2019"
28276,"This game is fun, but extremely short. It is far more enjoyable with multiple friends to play with so consider grabbing a few of your chums a copy of the game. It can get old when playing by yourself."
28277,no u
28278,I laughed my ass off in this game while split screening with a buddy. I strongly recommend fooling around with the characters while looking for the each maps' solution.
28279,"this had the chance of be a decent game but the physics  are so ridiculous it`s not worth playing at any cost, glad i got it for only a few dollars  still not worth it.
maybe if you had a lot of friends to play with it would be different"
28280,Love this simply funny and fun game to play lots of laughing good game to stream and invite friends ya can make ya owncharacter and share him or her I highly recommend this game and thank whoever gifted me the game your awsome!!!
28281,"Great game, even better when they added workshop support"
28282,50 reviews
28283,"very fun!
"
28284,Best Puzzle game I have ever played!
28285,spent more hours trying to cheat the game then i could have if i just followed the path. except the last level. monkey swing across the bottom of the map then climb up the exit for credits
28286,I love this game but there are other leavles in the workshop i think but i cant find it!
28287,9.5/10 its all awsome accpet the fact that after you finish the story theres nothing to do
28288,"This game saved my life.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
28289,Fun and dumb my 2 favourite things!!!
28290,"This game is dead now, there isn't being any new maps made as far as I know. I wouldn't buy this game unless you have a lot of friends to play it with because the levels get old fast."
28291,"Human Fall Flat exemplifies the importance of having a world that you can consistently interact with in a way that always makes sense. Every part of every level works exactly how you would expect, making exploring a true joy. Play with friends."
28292,"Oh, Man..
I can't even say or express enough how much I love this game.

Gameplay, Artstyle, Mechanics, Atmosphere, Music, etc, etc... 
Every bit of these elements makes me lose track of the time.
Even in single player.

Multiplayer is so much more fun and still in alpha, yet pretty playable.

Desperately needs more levels. 

Totally worth a full price.

Infinity/10."
28293,"Its cute, its a puzzle game... its good"
28294,Great and funny game
28295,"This game is an absolute BLAST.
I got this game after playing it at my friend's house a few times. I'm glad I did, because this game is amazing. 
Nothing is blocked off to you. Invisible walls? No such thing. Everything that you can see is reachable...with the right technique. Every level is a large, explorable masterpiece, chockfull of secrets and achievements to be had. If you have friends to play this with, i highly suggest that you do. You'll be in for a great time."
28296,"- Played alone
- A Map took me about 20+ min to finish
- 5/10

- Played with friends
- Never got to finish the third Map
- 3/2, wouldn't finish the levels again"
28297,This game is so creative and so fun though it is challenging more levels you play it will be one of my favorite games on Steam worth the 11 years in development.:)
28298,yeah its a funny game
28299,Great with friends. Find friends
28300,its good
28301,fun
28302,Great game!
28303,Super silly and funny game. Loved to enjoyed this game with your friends or your partner.
28304,"I've almost died from laughter within the first 15 minutes of playing, it should have a safty warning that you'll have too much fun."
28305,"oh boy.

So.
This game.
Its fun for alot of people.
But...
I feel like the devs didnt know what play testing is,
You can skip 90% of all the levels, and you will randomly be able to fly.
Speaking of flying, theres an odd glitch i call ""remote controlling""
you fly to something, grab it with both hands and fly away with it, then drop it, it will follow you.
This just shows how much the devs missed.

Also the game is poorly optimized and lags sometimes for no reason, but it is still very fun."
28306,this was a great game and a very calming experience to play on my free time i just wish there were more levels to play through.
28307,"This is a very good title to pick up if your a fan of Physic based games and ragdolling. The only issue of this game is the sort of lacking in replayability, as once you ""Master the game"" you sort of got nothing else to do. But you will definatly get your hours out of this game before you reach that.

Would love to see Workshop content fully accessible to this game while it still has a community"
28308,this game is hard :(
28309,WHERE IS YASUO ??
28310,"I keep coming back to this wonderful game, whether alone or with friends. The inclusion of Workshop absolutely elevated this already fantastic co-op experience with never-ending fun and creativity."
28311,is k
28312,"HIlarious game, no length of gameplay. GIVE US COMMUNITY MAPS AND MAP CREATION"
28313,great fun with a group of friends

Approximate amount of time to 100%: 15 hours
Estimated achievement difficulty: 7/10
Minimum number of playthroughs needed: 1, but it has stage selection
Has it been in a bundle: Yes
Is there a good guide available: Yes [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1304328022] here [/url]
How many people have complete this game at the time I'm writing this review: 342 on Astats

Multiplayer achievements: No, but since the last update it is possible to play it in multiplayer and that is a lot more fun!
Missable achievements: Yes, in every stage a few. But you can select which stage you want to play.
Grinding Achievements: Yes, carry an item X meters, walk X meters, stuff like that
DLC-Only achievements: No
Time-gated achievements: No
RNG-achievements: maybe, the groupds with who I complete this game had some problems with ""Surfer"" but not sure if we just failed hardly, or that it is a little bit luck based.
Does difficulty affect achievements: No

Unobtainable/glitched achievements: Yes, not sure if you have the same problems in single player, but in multiplayer the game is buggy and while we tried to complete the game in one sitting a few of us kept disconnecting and failing that achievement.

It was a fun game, and I like this kind of achievements! But the multiplayer (no experience with the single player) is buggy. After a while we were able to fly, which made completing the levels a lot easier. I'm glad we got that bug because otherwise it would be impossible for some of us to complete the game in one sitting because they kept disconnecting."
28315,"I freaking LOVE this game. It runs pretty well (then again I've only hosted online/friend games). And it's super silly and fun. I like to goof off on the levels with friends and just be dumb little shits together. It's a great stress relief for me.

I just wish there was a Workshop DLC thing available. I'd love to play on other maps than the default ones."
28316,plug walk
28317,"I really enjoyed this game - for a few days.

Desperately needs more maps and I was very surprised that there is no workshop. 

I've decided to do my review now, since I haven't played the game in around a year, and I just came back to check if there were any updates on new maps. Unfortunately, the only new content I was able to find, were Chinese New Year skins. Meh.

If you don't mind paying 15 euros for 5-10 hours of (very enjoyable and fun) gameplay, then by all means, buy this game. However, I am basing my review on the lack of replay-ability, and this game does not have any."
28318,had had great lauge with my friends would recommend
28319,Amazing and stupid 10\10
28320,Var olan en boktan oyun
28321,"Really fun, great to play with friends."
28322,"I do not recommend you play this if your friends are jackasses.
That being said, it's really fun being a jackass."
28323,its an alright game yeah its a laugh
28324,WASTE OF FUCKING MONEY YOU GET 2 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY MAYBE IF THEY MADE MORE MAPS OR WERE ABLE TO MAKE OWN MAPS WOULD BE COOL
28325,Awesome
28326,"really fun game... wish it had more maps ;)
"
28327,"Much fun, yes.

Game is too short for 15 bucks but it's worth it on sale!"
28328,"It's a 3-dimensional physics puzzle game with a visual style as charming and quirky as it's gameplay.  The ability to add friends to the experience (both of the couch-sharing and online variety) adds a great deal of replaybility to this game.

10/10 would derail the train car and get my head stuck in a bench again."
28329,"This game took a couple of days to beat, and a couple more to get all of the achievements. That being said, there's still a lot of potential havok one might have if you decide to go into co-op mode, as even if you all know the puzzle, coordinating your ways through the puzzles will be more time consuming than if one were to be alone. I'd say that the game is worth its price, and it'll grow in value as the dev adds more to the game (though localization should just be outsourced at this point, it's been over six months).

One more thing...
The ragdoll mechanic can be activated with the 'Y' key on the keyboard. It doesn't really make it clear, and it's crucial info if you want the ""Head First"" achievement. If this is remedied later, then great, if not, hopefully that'll help someone from wasting several hours reattempting the achievement."
28330,"Please add a low gravity option. But when and if you use the low gravity option, make sure the achievements are disabled so that it's not easy. Please read this review because I saw a low gravity mod for this game on youtube but the mod does not work anymore."
28331,"Brilliant, played with a homie and cried because of how much fun it was"
28332,"Great game, make a map editor where the community can create their own maps. That would be F--ing awesome! :D"
28333,"love the game but it need to be not as laggy so i say it good but its super laggy
"
28334,"Probably one of the best investments I've ever made, even though the entire ""campaign"" is only like 3 hours. This is by far one of the most fun games I've ever owned. You'll get hours of laughs and enjoyment out of this game. Highly reccomend playing with other people or friends that also buy the game."
28335,"This is a really fun and funny game to play with your friends and with a lot of workshop levels to download and play.I told all my friends about it and they loved it if you like a funny, puzzle, challenging,fun game to play including multiplayer game, this is the game for you."
28336,ez
28337,best game so far
28338,"This game is great and i really recommend playing it with friends, however i found one problem once you complete the game there is nothing to do so the suggestion i think would be great would be adding fan made levels on the steam workshop as this would be really fun also some kind of editor to create maps that would be fun too and i think that could boost the popularity of this game."
28339,basically 3D LittleBigPlanet
28340,needs workshop what the hell are the devoplers are doing
28341,very well
28342,Workshop please or add some more content at least.
28343,"too bad that it doesnt have custum map setting, the game btw is well made"
28344,"This game is amazing because it gives you the freedom to solve puzzles how you see fit with resources you are presented with. That and coupled with the nice physics the game has to offer and you're looking at a lot of fun hours to be had playing this game. Also , co op is a thing that's coming up soon , so yeah.... Can't wait for that !"
28345,Grab your friends so you can grab your friends and reenact Mufasa's death in a bunch of different levels.
28346,trash
28347,This is such a fun game and funny I cant count how many times i laugh so hard i fell out of my chair!!!
28348,"A fun game indeed. Lot's of maps and content, it takes you about 10 hours to finish all the maps once. However, there's much more to do than just that, there's a ton of achievements and hidden easter eggs all over the maps."
28349,Probably solved all the puzzels wrong but still beat the game. 10/10
28350,When you solve the whole game by swinging like a monkey :) 10/10
28351,Great simple game with addictive puzzles.
28352,Really good game with great physics
28353,"10/10. If there would ever be a sequel to this; I'd buy it immediately. The game has satisfying physics with great possibilities. You can drag your teammate or an object and have lots of fun (WITH JUST A PROP LMAO).

Nuff said, never have I had more fun from a game than this. Every time I played this, I always had lots of fun. Much better than Grand Trash Auto V.

Please, make a sequel."
28354,"love this game it was fun with friends, controls are smooth and feel natural it doesnt take long to get used to  , wish it was longer though"
28355,"Already played quet a bit, would like a workshop. Great fun and one of the best co-op puzzle games I know! Would be nice to have a steam workshop, let the community get crazy."
28356,Ridiculously funny to play with friends. Not so much solo.
28357,"This game is absolutely ridiculous. Get a couple friends to buy the game with you - as it's not too entertaining alone - and let hell break lose. The physics make for some hilarious and memorable moments that'll leave on the floor laughing, especially if you and your friends are morons.

15 bucks seems a little high, but I've bought triple A titles and have enjoyed them less than this. It's all about the experience."
28358,"A fun little puzzle game, that lets you break all the rules. 

Highly recommend this game if you play with friends. Some of the funnest play time I have ever had was with a group of 5 people playing. 

Local coop is also great fun.

Game is fairly short, a group of quick witted friends will be able to blow through this game in a matter of hours. I have a total of 3 playthroughs on my account, putting me at 23 hours total.

As is, I recommend it on sale, especially if you have a fun group to play with. If and when this game gets workshop support, I think it would totally be worth its full price."
28359,Fun game with friends. Gameplay didnt last...
28360,"Not flat scam














































































































10/10"
28361,Made me laugh multiple times.
28362,Really fun and funny group solving puzzle game.  I recommend to get if playing with others
28363,so funny
28364,"It's a very funny game, both realxing and entertaining at the same time. Anyway, I'm here waiting for my future friends to play with me. By the way, remember that be more patient and intelligent, cause you should know that sometimes it's exteremely hard to concertrate on how to finish the game itself......qwq【LOL】"
28365,"Boring and dull. Worst of all E for everyone. The entire look up then down to grab and pull up gets real annoying quick. Could at least make the blobs more ""human"" shape as well"
28366,"Very funny game, played it a few hours with friends. Alone its a little boring but together much more fun!"
28367,For Speedrun Tipps Message me. 10x faster
28368,"They took money from me and dropped support for my platform. Thats it. I can not give this game positive review, next to this terrible thing they have done it is lagging as hell in multiplayer, on both Linux and Windows.

Mac users, you are next!

Apologies for this but thank you for your understanding!"
28369,"this game barely worked!
other than that kinda good
oi do not recommend it for mac!
use a diff computer than mac!"
28370,The best and first wacky ragdoll physics game with a main character named Bob. I would reccomend this to everybody who needs to let out their childlike instinct in them.

28378,I had the best time! Better to play with friends!
28379,Best game to play with a group of friends.
28380,8/10
28381,"Overall, this an amazing game. It is one of my favorite games to play with my friends, and I would definitely recommend it. There is one major issue that takes away from the game. THERE ARE NO NEW MAPS. This is such an amazing game and they haven't put any maps in!? I wish that the creators of this game would add new maps. If they would do it on some sort of regular basis, that would be great. The maps they provide when you first get it are so much fun, and it would be so much better if it had more maps. It makes me sad that such a great game has so few maps. I've never laughed so much or so hard at a game before. And that's why it makes me sad that they won't add new maps. Because it is a great game that brings fun, action, challenges, and so many laughs. However, if you haven't played it before, find some friends who haven't either and buy it. It is mostly worth it."
28382,Fun with friends. No Friends = No Progress
28383,"Delay in multiplayer is ridiculous, I get that it's in alpha stage but I will change the review once it changes"
28384,yes
28385,pls buy it. It's awesome.
28386,"It's fun, and ready to be snap by girl friend if you laugh at her face."
28387,This is one of the best games I ever played. It's really original. I can't wait for more levels. The only thing I don't like is avatar creator. It's really hard to use. It could be more easy to operate. I know that you don't like to put too many buttons in game but this is necessary. Or at least you could add keybinds for avatar creator. And please add level creator. Thanks. Bye.
28388,your retarded charater is gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
28389,Its ok but the bad online and the toxic community ruins it
28390,Great And Funny Love It Perfect Combo

28393,"  A shit ton of fun, especially with friends. Basically Gang Beasts, but cheaper, more puzzle-based and imo a better customization thingo."
28394,Best game ever made to play with friends and alcohol.
28395,"Grab a friend... not literally though - and have even more fun. 
Floppy physics, customization, possibilities to troll your friends, what else do you need?"
28396,Good
28397,good game
28398,"This is the first, and probably the only review I'll ever write for any Steam game, or for that matter any game - ever.  My friend gifted me this game, and I am super, super grateful.  This is the most fun, and the hardest I've ever laughed, playing any video game in the history of my 28 years of gaming.  
Sure, I've had funny guildies / friends in MMO's / games, and shenigans occur oftentimes; but me and my buddy just playing ""CO-OP""; a laughable term for it :D Was some of the most pants on head retarded thing I've ever done.  It was beautiful; artistic.

I cannot reccomend this game any higher to people who just wants some silly fun to have with their friends.  ""Good clean fun."" Would be the term I'd use, but we're gamers and it's never really 'clean', is it?  ;)  It's worth every single penny of it's price.

I hope the Workshop allow modders to make content for it.  It could soar into the stratosphere for not only sales, but replayability and shenanigans.  The new ""Portal"", as it were.
Thanks No Brakes Games for a fabulous time."
28399,"This game has a unique set of controls that required me to actually spend time on a learning curve again. It introduces the concept of the controls well with little ingame tutorials, and good map design. The beauty of this game, is that you can solve each level in many different ways, and is not as linear as it may first appear. Would recommend."
28400,"This game is like Portal and Gang beasts got mashed together into this strange hilariously fun puzzle game.  I absolutely love this game, plus, it has a local co-op mode that’s even more fun."
28401,It was a great physics game
28402,"pros:
you can have lots of fun alone, or with friends!


cons:
i don't have friends."
28403,"it is so cool
"
28404,good.
28405,düştüm lan düştüm
28406,"i really enjoy this game, just having a hard time finding the workshop. trying to get new skins to use and maps to play."
28407,This game fun but need more workshop maps.
28408,"This game is really fun. The main levels are really fun, and there’s also a ton of extra stuff that you can explore and get. Across two platforms I’ve beaten this game three times, and intend to go through and 100% complete my steam version. Really fun, especially if you have two people!"
28409,i like
28410,I put my friend into a trash bin and threw him off the map :D
28411,best 6 hours i have had in my life this game is so good if you have a buddy cause u can just grab him and he can do nothing
28412,funny af
28413,Fun to play with friends
28414,You convinced me to buy this game and now you never play it.
28415,good
28416,very good game featuring throw your friends out the boat 8/10
28417,"THIS IS SO FUNNY OMG!!!!!!!
BUT IS VERY SHORT PLS MAKE MORE MAPS PLS !!!!!!1"
28418,"Fun game to play with friends, needs Workshop or more levels"
28419,"Very good game. Sometimes it needs to use your brain, it's very funny game when you play alone, but it is much better with friends."
28420,"great with friends......


Too bad I have none."
28421,"So the game is incredibly fun for a hole 6 hours ESPECIALLY with friends, but i just cant reccomend this game for anything more then just $5. There isnt much content and almost no replayablilty value. This game would be worth the $15 or maybe even more if it had workshop support. But at the moment if you want to buy this game, wait for a sale."
28422,fun
28423,"This game can create some hilarious situations for you and friends and that's what really plays to this title.

A classic problem solving title with a whacky take.

Graphics are ideal style for this game, A simli-low poly simplistic design but looks sexy while doing it.

Sound is nothing to brag about but that is no issue.

The price tag is perfect, Any more would feel beyond what this offers and any lower would be a steal.

Bottom Line: Buy this game for you and a few friends and laugh your heads clean off!"
28424,Its a really fun game! Good for messing around with friends. I'd give it a 8/10!
28425,"
Funny game, I really like the physical mechanism and character but would be great if adding workshop"
28426,yeaah funny game
28427,You can make your own skins 10/10
28428,I simply was not prepared to have so much fun with this title. It is most enjoyed with a friend or three.
28429,"Human: Fall Flat is an amazing experience. A must-play physical sandbox, which puzzles got devastated by the co-op madness. Requires a small amount of brains and some platforming skills as well as tolerance for unusual controls.

A shame it is too short though."
28430,Best game in Steam too play with friends!!!
28431,How could you write a negative review about this game?  It's funny and challenging at the same time.  Multiplayer is a great addition!  15/10
28432,"Its actually a really fun game, however i really would like workshop to be added, i mean the current maps are fun its just kinda repetitive after some time.
"
28433,"ITS AMAZING
I got it for 2,5$, and instantly bought it for me and my friend.

pros:
+the physics are so derpt yet so fun
+amazing levels
+works very well with multiplayer
+all the level have A LOT of possible ways to finish the level (some levels can almost be skipped entirely)
+great performance, i have gtx 1050ti and i always have solid 75fps+ on max settings (vsync on)

cons:
-though levels are amazing, there arent to many and especialy in multiplayer they areny quickly finished

overall great game, 9/10 would recommend"
28434,can i get some more maps this game is so good!!!
28435,yes very fun indeed
28436,"Insaneley great game. A three man squad composing of me and friends, took 4 hours to complete this, and had a laugh while doing it. If you have friends, Get this game and play with them!"
28437,i love this game its hilariosly fun
28438,"Funny little boy.
Bright and comfortable pictures.
Sometimes you will see views that you will never forget .
Definitely will you get fun."
28439,"When you first hop in the game it seems cool and all. BUT after an hour or so i found this game to be very boring and i could basically just remember all the ""puzzles"" in the 5 different maps. Plus, some of the puzzles are so easy to pass that it doesn't even feel like a challenge, but are in general just a waste of time. I only bought it because i saw other youtubers playing a couple of levels but now i have reconsidered it and requested my money back but even with a little under an hour playtime i can't get my money back. I do not recommend this game as it seems to just be a copy of Gang beasts that tried doing something different and then just completely failed."
28440,Human: Fall Flat is a great game. Better to play with friends. A little bit hard to play by oneself.
28441,"Really fun with Friends, and sets a true example as a Fun Ragdoll Puzzle game, I got about Seventeen hours on record, and I don't regret my Purchase, you should get it!"
28442,very nice
28443,"A really fun game! You are a human creature that was made to grab and jump anything. You have some levels, all of them puzzles and you need yo vomplete them by climbing stuff and finding the exit. (Nothing else to say, probably my smallest review ever). You can also play in co-op. It's funnier. But be careful with griefers, you can grab other people and push them out of the map. But don't worry you always respawn. You have unlimited lives. Have fun!"
28444,It's a very fun game.
28445,"Pleasing graphics, beautiful soundtrack, intuitive controls, and a great combination of adventuring, puzzle solving, and free-running. The puzzles are fun, challenging, and rewarding. And as an extra plus, there is a vast character creation engine built-in. The movement of the characters are funny and cute, I just find myself chuckling everytime I pull myself over a ledge.

I absolutely reccomend this game, and it is 100% worth the price."
28446,Great Game
28447,Yes
28448,"DON'T GET THIS GAME.
It's funny for the first 10 minutes, but even with friends, this is boring and tedious.
I've played for three hours with my friends and I completley regret getting this waste of money."
28449,"Bought it on sale, 4 copies for 30 bucks. Had a great time. Hope they add more levels as we got through them all in about 6 hours."
28450,one of the most fun coop games ever made. best to mess around with alot of people.
28451,"Gimmicky physics game which hints at solving puzzles. Only proper problem you need to solve is keeping your frustrations in check while you are stuck hanging on to a wall. 

The game also crashed on every single loading screen."
28452,"No replayablitiy, make workshop map and i will be happy"
28453,"This is a great physics based puzzle game to play alone, but its even more fun with friends."
28454,This game is amazing and Funny and i enjoy playing with friends. I think the game is worth the price as it is one of the best ragdoll physics game i have ever played
28455,Amazing game. i sure do love me some floppy physics. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD NEEDS TO GET THIS GAME! Also the game is so much better with the level editor so you can keep playing FOREVER...
28456,"Anatomy of a Malleable Fellow, or: The Quest for Sustenance and the mighty AC Power Converter"
28457,great game
28458,Awful.  Terrible controls for the PC.
28459,:D
28460,"Wow, what a fun game - goofy mechanics combined with clever puzzle design. Each level has room for improvisation and achievements adds extra challenge. Devs are releasing new levels from time to time, so it keeps on giving.
One thing that could have been better was narrator. It was present in the first levels but then disappears completely. I think it would have improved overall experience and given more continuity for the game. Nevertheless it's a solid game, can we expect to see a sequel?"
28461,"Its a Hilarious game hahahaha i laugh a lot playing this game with my friend.
what a stupid recomended game hahahaha
this game so much fun. need more maps haha"
28462,:D
28463,"yes











yes"
28464,"Absolute and utter pain.
Would not recommend.
""Puzzles"" involved trial and error with the nonsensical, aneurysm-inducing controls. There was little actual puzzle-solving as opposed to mashing the keys until your floppy manbaby flings itself through the exit.
Co-op mode allows you to involve another unfortunate individual in your experience. The ""puzzles"" do not feel designed for co-op, rather hastily flung together single player maps that you can bribe your unwilling friends into joining. 
On another note, I enjoyed customizing my portly muscular dystrophy-afflicted companion. It was nice giving him a face - watching him die was more satisfying."
28465,"Fun co-op puzzle game, good with a group"
28466,Very cool game looking forward to updates.
28467,Its very funny and I hope that in future it will be a workshop
28468,think i've installed and uninstalled this crack around 500 times
28469,Someone can gimme a pizza?
28470,"This game is pretty good. I always play this game with my friends, which is very relaxing."
28471,"Hey, This game is overpriced for its small amount of content. for $15 you get around 4-5 hours of playtime. We need more content for this game. More levels mostly."
28472,"This game is one of the best multiplayers i've played however it ended quite shortly so I do want them to make more of this.

Definetly worths the money but i advise playing multiplayer as it tend to be a better experience"
28473,It was fun while it lasted. But gameplay lasted 6 hours for me and since there is no workshop support i don't recommend it in its full price.
28474,"It was ok, my friend found a way to abuse everylevel and skip it though."
28475,Best game I have played in a long time. Play with a friend though and have the most laughs you will have in a lifetime. Seriously. Get this game.
28476,title describes game
28477,7/10 pretti gud
28478,It's super fun but it gets a little boring if you have nobody to play with: so play with your steam friends
28479, localisations  localisations  localisations that all these guys have done since game launch no new content or real way for people to add and share what they make sure games lots fun but soon as beat all of the level that it as it stands I dont recommend the game right now
28480,Best game ever if you wanna laugh with your friends. 20/10
28481,slap that ass
28482,"Great game to play with friends, preferably with alcohol..:)"
28483,SCHÖNES Spiel mit Freunden
28484,flop
28485,"Great COOP game, I played it with Tunpu44 aka tonttu aka potatomusshound"
28486,Great game but low content.
28487,this game is dumb and you should never buy it its cool but it has 1 second delay and i cant be boyfriends with my pet rock i HATE you devoloper you should die poo bum face shh dont tell mom
28488,Beside throwing friends away from the map and raging on aztec the game is kinda boring buttttttt gud to relax and enjoy the breathtaking music...jk throwing friends is the best thing evah 11/10 would play again
28489,idk its just funny lol
28490,Pretty good.
28491,"simple and fun, hilariously fun"
28492,I have no friends ):
28493,take serious more than I imagine
28494,I HATE IT
28495,"This is a great game to play with either your significant other or mortal enemy.

5/5"
28496,"There is only one point missing in this game:
A workshop where people can create own maps for more fun.

This game is a gemstone. Play it with friends, as i did.
You will cry. This is absolutely awesome stuff.^

edit: woaaah workshooooop <3 <3 <3"
28497,Fun little physics game! Definitely play with friends.
28498,The hardest I have ever laughed.
28499,"Love this game, good for laylow when tilted"
28500,"I thought this game was really fun, but I finished it within 3 days. Its fun to play with friends. I recommend if you are looking for relaxed, stupid physics gameplay."
28501,"10/10 freaking amazing, loved playing it with my friend but also wanted to murder her the entire time. if you really want to test your friendship this is the game for you"
28502,"STAY AWAY!!!

Frustrating and crap level design."
28503,Its fun and puzzles are challenging but the game is pretty short. I completed the game in under 2 hours with 2 friends and now we are pursuing the achievements. A workshop on this game would be an amazing addition!
28504,"Good mechanics, long adventure, fun."
28505,"I had been playing this game for a very long time , and so far in its silliness it has to be one of the funniest one that I put my hands on as. The multiplayer in itself is , in my opinion , what keeps people's interest in it , and unites many players around the globe. Since the recent update , however , as soon as the game moved on from 1.3a.26 version , I have experienced multiple bugs , that in the past were minor , and now made bigger, which also can be easily ignored , as they do not entirely break the gameplay and make the game unplayable, so with that in mind I'll start with the cons first.

Cons:

-Multiple players hanging on the same lantern , chain or rope can cause it to dislocate in a freakish matter , making the whole party hanging on it unable to complete to puzzle. Also worth mentioning that the pendulum puzzle in the Azctec level had been affected by the update , as you can simply can get yourself stuck in them, as opposed to previous version of the game;
-Not sure the cause of it , but I , as well as many other players , have experienced the so called ""Fly"" bug, which is usually triggered after finishing the beach level ( had you hosted your game since the intro level ) , and most often triggered for clients. While it may seem fun at first , it does remove the purpose of doing anything other than just endlessly pressing the jump button , getting up places to cheat your way into obtaining the achievements, or just having somebody fly to the exit sign and have them finish the map within 15 seconds into the level;
-The game crashes a lot more times than it used, and reviewing the crash log is not gonna solve the issue at hand;
-When playing as a client , you are forced to wait incredible amount of time before the level loads up for you , even if the host had already had his game loaded minutes ago;
-Leaving a 2 player server , whether it's a connection problem or if the loading is taking too long , so you're forced to restart the game, will usually result in having your own character model to stay in the server. The said ""dummy"", so to speak , cannot be kicked in any way, and can only be removed from server if it's restarted or if the host returns to lobby , hence loosing all the level progress;
-Players as clients tend to get teleported under the map, and remain in sort of a ""T-Pose"" state of such , floating in mid air , with the camera locked on them , when in fact , from other player's perspective , physically the said player's character model is responding to movement controls and checkpoint restarts as is , only without the player's knowledge of it;

Majority of these cons can be simply fixed if people would restart their servers/games and if they don't try to get on the same object all at once , to prevent it from glitching out.

Pros:
-Great fun all around , makes use of your imagination;
-Level replayability is endless (every time I replay the levels , I always manage to find new ways to go around or just mess in a single area 2 hours straight with me friend , finding myself in situations I never anticipated finding myself in ) , whether you're looking for new and inventive ways to solve the puzzles or just trigger your inner scientist , and test the game's mechanic and limits , with the ideas taken from cartoons , comedies or in funny compilation videos;
-If I had to prioritize the game's features from best to worst , I would definitely put the ragdoll-ness and the icon play dead key/feature in this game, because it bursts you into laughs , whether you intended it to happen or if it was caused by an accident or a game glitch, making this game a whole lot more enjoyable; 
-Simply taking a vantage point and watching other people make their way trough an area using teamwork , skill , intentional interruption or just pure need to grab on to someone and make the jump before anyone else , causing the whole pack of players diving into water , because the momentum was broken is always super entertaining to watch , whether you're taking part in all that or not. Watching other players might also teach you more about game mechanics that you might have missed out on.
-The game is unique in its own way by having very few controls but being able to compensate with its gameplay;

I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who is willing to let their inner child out (whether you're 12 or in your late 30's), and stop taking games seriously for a while , have fun with your friends , and finally let that crazy imagination loose , had the other games not been able to accomplish that by now. Best way to get hooked on to it is to play it with someone else , and give it a fair chance ( an hour of gameplay , at the very least) , before writing it off as some silly physics game for 3 year olds (Because let's face it , the longer you pretend that you're not into the silly , stupid and fun stuff the longer you'll live in a lie).

As for the nomination , all I can say is , so far , it is the only game that has been worked on right by the devs: people ask for stuff , and they get it , bugs are fixed, workshop is added , new skins and maps are added and the problems we mention about the game glitches are heard."
28506,can u pls update some of it today :V
28507,"guys my gf said if I dont stop posting comments on steam, she gonna drag my head against my keyboard... but, as you can see, Im perfectly finjwekdwjxhmdebkerfnk,ed fjkbe mne fjkFedm fwstfgvjlujhytgfrtvyhjukl;ujhytfgrxtgvujhnkl'/ptfgrvhuiortfjhukhgyftvbjhgfvcnjhbmgv  bfckojuhbtfgrtfgvhujkloujhytfgvgholgtfrcfuyhkjdfjksghnjhrxdcfvDFGHJKLUJMVBJMN HTU123456789RFGVK VBNVFBH6     H BTV  B.E"
28508,"A very fun and enjoyable game with level design offering a lot of replay value due to many solutions and secrets hidden troughout them. The game is especially enjoable with friends and when you try to figure out how to abuse the game mechanics to beat a puzzle or do it in a most fun/weird way.
To the negative reviewers complaining about no workshop: the feature has been in alpha for well over a while now and you can join a steam group to gain access to it: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/humanworkshop (link to the steam group). The workshop offers custom player skins and levels."
28509,eh
28510,"ReviewBrah here, i enjoyed this snack"
28511,"amazing game really should add more stages
"
28512,The best Humab game ever 👍
28513,"Great game overall. me and my friend really enjoyed it. But, everytime we reach the metal hook in castle (after jump two stone cars), the game just quit itself... not sure if this is a mac thing. I jumped so hard to get there everytime ... please fix it !!!"
28514,"A lovely game 
tho would be more fun with new game modes like Human fall flat sports and shit
im just waiting for the full game release"
28515,i fell
28516,"When I play, a black screen come and fill the whole screen, the only solution is to restart my game, i saw some people having the same troubles on forum and Youtube, please fix it"
28517,This game is a lot of fun. There were times I couldn't play because of laughing so much. We all need more laughs in our lives.
28518,This game is a masterpiece. It just needs more content.
28519,lit
28520,"pros:
fun game, lots of ways to get through each level, better with friends, good music
cons:
online is broken (not sure if it still is, last play online was december)"
28521,"fantastic game,i like it."
28522,GOOD GAME!
28523,"VERY ENJOYING GAME, VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS.
NOT MUCH LEVELS, BUT I NEVER GET BORED OF IT.
WELL DONE :)"
28524,Awesome
28525,its good but it gets boring after you complete all of the maps
28526,Get it
28527,"Ok-to-meh single player, an absolute Blast multiplayer if you play with fun people. 

doubtful you'll get more than 6 hours or so out of it though, but it was still worth it."
28528,"Do you like pick up your friends and throwing them off the map? Do you like climbing onto your friends head and shoving their face into the ground, just so you can try to get on their shoulders for a piggy back ride? Do you like dancing around, twerking on the ground and waving your hands in the air like you just don't care? Then this is the game for you! 

10/10 great game! Just finished all the achievements and i still want more!!!"
28529,"Very fun to play, i did not regret telling my friends about this game and on top of that we had so much fun."
28530,"8/10. Fun, but not enough levels."
28531,lots of fun with friends. Very few problems or bugs.
28532,he fall over
28533,a very fun game
28534,"I really like this game. The grabby, finnicky nature of how you control your character is very comical. Giving your friends a tackle off a ledge never gets old. However, I think the price is a bit much given the amount of content. You will likely have mastered it in around 10 hours, but don't be discouraged from picking it up. It is all around still a fun game, especially with a couple friends. Shep I will steal your reviews idgaf"
28535,[h1]Simulator of the [u]drunk[/u] cosmonaut[/h1]
28536,"Interesting puzzle game, can be frustrating, but rewarding."
28537,y tho -Lizard Supreme
28538,10/10 would succ again
28539,its gay
28540,AAAAHHHH THIS GAME IS AMAAZING
28541,"A short game but tons of fun.

Heard about it from the funny let's play boys Mat and Ryan"
28542,8/10 but have to play in coop!
28543,"No workshop.... so bad :( 

give  workshop to us
"
28544,Great Co-op game :D
28545,game gabut
28546,"This is great fun with friends but we finished the game in 3 hours! Way to short, especially for €15. Will be good once it gets community levels."
28547,"Beat this game many times on the PS4, its just as good on the PC!

Buy buy buy!"
28548,Needs More Levels
28549,"It is a good game. Especially when you play with your friends. Though the map is limited, it is a great and funny game. Need some logic/creative thinking to solve the puzzle :)
"
28550,"Really funny game specially if you play with a friend.

Short though so you may wanna wait for a discount to grab it."
28551,WORKSHOP!!!!!!!!!! :D
28552,"HMM, yes very high quality game. You can grab ur friends and throw them and you can grab things then you can jump and you can respawn. Very nice qality thing right there hmm yes. Buy it highly recommended because its wow strange game. Yes because friends can join and you can yes so buy it thx"
28553,"Fun as a Singleplayer game (achievement hunting in this game is pretty fun), even greater fun in co-op.
I have played through the entire game 3 or 4 times now, got all achievements and still I want to keep playing it.
Just hope more content comes out (workshop) seeing it's fairly short."
28554,skipped most of the puzzles by climbing over the courses
28555,a very entertaining ragdoll puzzle game. the more the merrier. i keep trying to get more of my frineds to purchase the game.
28556,"If you enjoy Ragdoll Physics games, this one is for you. If you don't enjoy Ragdoll Physics games, this one's also for you. Human: Fall Flat was my gateway to more of the Ragdoll games such as Gang Beasts, or other simmilar genre games. It's fun to figure out puzzles on all the different levels and even funner with friends all while goofing around and trying things different. For example on Power Plant, will you do it the right way and try to deliver coal, or will you try the harder way and attempt to launch and land in the exit? And, once you've beaten the base game, you can do workshop levels for a little bit of extra fun."
28557,"Game is fun and requiers some thought. 

If you can stand the motion sickness that comes with it, you can hade va great time with your friends."
28558,release more maps
28559,"Delightful game! There are only two things I wish for: A friend to play it with and MOAR! Oh, and barring the second thing: Workshop support. The things a dedicated fanbase would be able to do with this game..."
28560,This was an absolutly amaxing game! I really hope that No Brakes Games makes a seaqual/more levels as they were so fn to play - even better with a helping pair of hands and a helping brain
28561,Awesome Game!!!! I love the floppy phisics!!
28562,Jelly blobs dressed like guy feiri and a roblox kool kid flailing around with a cane attepting to make a jump.
28563,"Pretty fun game if you have friends, if you dont, (like me) Just look at the amazing lighting. ITS AMAZING"
28564,They're still releasing content for this game 5 years after it came out.
28565,Yes...titties
28566,WE WANT WORKSHOP!
28567,very fun game got 10hours out of it loved every second good playing with a frend probebly less fun in singleplayer
28568,"Its fun, But its old. Its a pretty fun game tbh."
28569,"REALLY FUN GAME PHYSICS
REALLY COOL FOR CO-OP
IT'S JUST REALLY FUN"
28570,gud game when ur bored with friends
28571,"Fun and goofy puzzle platformer with quirky physics. Great to play with others, probably decent playing alone. Lacks a bit of polish in some areas and also content, but can't complain for the price, especially cause I purchased on sale. Aztec map was infuriating and didn't feel as intuitive as the other levels. Overall good experience"
28572,"Great when playing alone, terrific fun when playing with friends. Feels short after having so much fun, developer should work on DLCs so we can revive the fun and keep game alive."
28573,"This game is amazing, it has good humore from the narrator (sadly its for only 1 level) but is goofy phisics whitch are fun to mess around with, also the best thing about this game is you can finish levels in any way you want. You could either jump over walls, build over walls or go around them. I got this game for free from a friend that owned me money and i have to say this game is worth evry penny. 10/10 would play agine."
28574,"CLIMBIN' HAULIN' MUDDIN' MORE CLIMBIN'

this really needs a Workshop BTW

"
28575,cool
28576,"let me just preface this by saying i only played like 15 minutes with a buddy.
But our initial impression was it starts off really slow and holds your hand a little too much.

maybe it gets better further in but we weren't sold"
28577,I think the game is a ton of fun for co-oping. It's pretty short but worth it if especially if its on sale. I'd put tons of hours into this if it had more levels.
28578,please put a workshop
28579,"Just bloody buy it, i cried with laughter when watching Hat Films play it, so i bought it for myself and ive never regretted that decision"
28580,"Wonderful creative game I had a blast. Just needs more content, sadly I think the devs gave up, which is a shame because this is an amazing game. Worth it if you have a friend.
"
28581,very cool
28582,Likey
28583,"Shannanigans.

The first 4 levels are a bit of a waste. When it opens up, its a great Friday night game with mates."
28584,My fingers hurt.
28585,A very fun game to play with friends and goof around in.
28586,"Falling flat from the sky.
throwing your friends off the edge.
ragdoll like you never have before.
laugh till your pants fall off.
great game to play if you have friends with the newly added online multiplayer."
28587,very good game. this game will make you lol . BUT not enough content and no workshop..
28588,yeea yea. alriiiight
28589,"Really fun and goofy game to play with friends.
Especially when you glitch out of the map and fly at supersonic speeds ass-first towards your friend.

Would be really great if they added custom map support"
28590,"If you like puzzle games then you will love this fun game - ok, so graphically, it's not gonna beat any game, but for fun, this game is great. If you have it, then please try the 2 player split screen mode, it's great fun and will have you shouting at your partner or mates :) 

I am very happy with my purchase :) 
Are there any plans for more than 2 player in split screen? That may get a little crazy, but just gives us more fun!

We have found a bug in 2 player mode - if one of you opens a door and then rushes to it as the other player gets through, you get stuck in the door and the only way to get out is to restart the level - very annoying!"
28591,WORKSHOP!!!
28592,LUL
28593,"workshop please?
"
28594,You can have a good time with your friends
28595,Very nice! well designed levels! Only wish there was more levels!
28596,"My son likes this game, but i think he likes fortnite and barbie baby maker on the cartoon website. I like any game that gets him off those porn sites! Great job developers of Human: Fall Flat!"
28597,Game gets stuck at curve digital loading screen every time I try to load. All other games run fine only this one has a problem. Tried everything can't fix it.
28598,gang beasts but with puzzles
28599,"With a very funny and thought-provoking game, Yoevuovo has been able to put together an entirely-voluminous game and, therefore, deserves a big boost."
28600,"I used to play this game all the time.But today,when i try to play it,it flashback and turn off the game.I don't know how to fix it.Can anyone help me?"
28601,"Workshop priority in 2018 btw, half way through 2018 btw, 1 person dev team btw, dog shit game btw.

I've seen Dean Hall deliver better content than this dogger game. 

- Marc Merrill"
28602,one of the funniest games I've ever played!
28603,Fun game ! I wish they would add the workshop tho...
28604,...
28605,"Yes, it's short. Yes, the controls are difficult. But grab some friends and I promise you'll have fun!"
28606,"Far too short, no community maps for multiplayer

Edit: JK community maps are great"
28607,"Great game, so much fun but not enough maps to invest and real time in."
28608,"nice game
"
28609,this game really shines in its coöp mode. its not a very hard game and it can be boring on your own its the best to just hook up some friends to play with.
28610,"3/5

Play with friends for best results, SP is dull & a couple of the last levels have too much busywork in them.

This game is sat outside a door called Fun and it just can't reach the handle.

Steam Sale."
28611,"Excellent game, sooooo much fun with friends , laughs galore to the point of nearly peeing myself lol"
28612,"Really Fun, with a friend or friends i wouldn't play it in single player. couldn't stop laughing almost made myself sick from it 10/10 best buy of 2018 so far."
28613,"I recommend this game. It's a great platformer game, which allows you to  customize your own character. It's funny too. Like when you're getting ready for the rope jump in the mountain level, get across, then you put both hands up for a ""Hooray!"" looking gesture, and fall backwards off the cliff."
28614,"I love this game, and please play this if you want, or if you do and don't have enough money for it, save up, thanks for reading to!"
28615,Don't buy it until the developers add workshop. Too few content for now and maybe already forever...
28616,"Devs dun good, added workshop support and now replay value has skyrocketed"
28617,"A fantastic physics-based puzzle game! Basic puzzles, made infinitely more fun by the floaty controls of the avatars (henceforth referred to as ""Bobs"").

In 'Human: Fall Flat' you work your way through a selection of themed levels, trying to find the exit. Along the way, you will need to learn the basics of navigating the world and solve a bunch of intuitive puzzles to progress. Once you have got the hang of the controlling your Bob and the climbing mechanics, this game is an absolute scream.

I ran through the whole thing with one of my best gaming friends and went straight back to mop-up all the achievements we could be bothered to do. There were so many points that had us belly-laughing along the way, as well as challenges that felt genuinely rewarding. The levels themselves, are very varied and each level offers its own unique challenges.

Well worth a purchase, especially if you plan on going through it in co-op."
28618,"One of the best platformer I've ever played. The levels are very good, and completable in different ways. Intrereting in solo but better in co-op. However there are only a few map which doesn't take take too long to complete. 8/10"
28619,"Nice game !
Nice game !
Nice game !
"
28620,"This game is a lot of fun and the puzzles are challenging enough to give your brain a solid workout. This game is however an absolute must with friends. My only qualm is that my buddy and I beat it relatively quick so I hope that we get more levels down the road. Definitely worth the eight bucks I paid for it.

UPDATE:

User made levels! Nuff said! Go buy!"
28621,"Bought this game just out curisity did'nt think I was going to like it, BUT SORPRICE wow this game is unbealiveble good. If you have friends I 100% recommend you to try it together."
28622,Give us workshop!
28623,"Great game, but with the physics your able to skip half of most of the levels."
28624,funny
28625,"My 3 friends and I have never laughed so hard in playing a video game. It was simply a great time. My only complaint is that the game lacks content. What I mean by that is the levels are big, but the obstacles you have to endure through are very few. That being said, this game would skyrocket if there was a workshop or in-game level editor. 

Worth it when on sale. Only play with 3 or more people. Not solo or duo."
28626,"Human: Fall Flat is a quirky, open-ended physics-based exploration puzzle platformer set in floating dreamscapes. Your goal is to find the exit of these surreal dreams by solving puzzles with nothing but your wits and physics."
28627,"No Workshop
No replayability"
28628,"A fun, wacky and some times frustrating game"
28629,"Incredibly fun. Figuring out the puzzles, admiring the style of the game or just goofing around, its fun to play, especially with friends. I'd love to see new Levels in the Game! 11/10"
28630,If you have funny friends I suggest this game.
28631,"It is SO FUNNY!!!
Please add more levels!! :)"
28632,"Amazing Game, lots of fun with friends <3"
28633,"It's awesome, very funny but also very short. Please add Steam workshop! We need more games like this. <3"
28634,"This is a fantastic game. I've been able to get a few hours out of it playing single player, but haven't tried multiplayer. It's probably better with more people.

I don't think it's worth the full price of $15 if you plan on only playing alone."
28635,"Lack on content, otherwise a hysterical fun game with friends where you help each other solve puzzles.. after youre done sabotaging each other and after you laugh it off (warning this will take more than a while). 
Throwing your friends or friends throwing you over the edge never stops being funny, or somehow avoiding being thrown overboard while hanging on to your assailant so now you both have to save each other! After a while you learn to scale walls, and you can climb up some funny places, i cant recall a game where i have laughed so hard it started to hurt for long periods of time. 
Drunk adult babies is the theme of the game, be the best drunk baby you can be !"
28636,"Fun game, but not enough levels. Only took maybe 7 hours to beat all levels included in the game. Don't buy this for more than $5."
28637,"This game is absolutely incredible. The physics based movement makes for hilarious moments when playing with friends. This game has the potential to be one of my favorites, but needs to include multiplayer custom maps. Hurry up!"
28638,Very Noice!
28639,"2 words 1:play 2:it
"
28640,"Awesome game, played co-op for 8 hours today after buying. Highly entertaining, many laughs had!"
28641,"fun game, but multiplayer is filled with pricks who kick you if you arent their friend, and those who dont kick you have no clue how to, and anybody who joins either ruins the game or is just so mindboggling ly inept thaty they fuck up the simplist shit."
28642,"This game is great and all the levels are fun, the controls aren't really hard to learn if you've played games like gang beasts.
The only problem I have is that I wish It added more levels but if your bored with the levels you can just spend hours customizing a cool character"
28643,gangbeasts platformer with friends
28644,Is good doods
28645,funny
28646,One of the funniests games out there to play with friends (or strangers)!
28647,Played it with my brother coop and we laughed our asses off. Absolutly worth buying.
28648,"Who knew drunken playdoh babies could be this much fun?  

If you want fun you must play with friend.

If friend does not laugh, question friendship."
28649,"A really fun, goofy physics puzzle game"
28650,"seen a lot of shit. lot of bad shit. like little kids getting stuck in coal funnels in the sweat mines, like ghouls peeking into my window at night. i've seen good, hard working young men get crushed by elevators, and pale, malnourished atrocities get their damn heads stuck in doors. shit that keeps you up at night. like old men getting stretched to death in conveyor belts... seen a lot of shit man..."
28651,Need workshop!!!
28652,One of the best coop games.
28653,yes
28654,.
28655,All we want is level editor with multiplayer support and instead of it they translate the game which has easy english.
28656,"This game's gameplay is quite simple but It's quite challenging, and tricky?

plus:
-you could customize your character, and paint it!!!

min:
-the brush need more work tho...

Let's wiggle wiggle...!!!"
28657,"Just did all achievements (including the tedious ones) and it is absolutely amazing, by far my favourite puzzle game (and that is quite hard to get from me) and I have nothing but good things to say, amazingly creative puzzles, multiple ways to finish each puzzle and sometimes just makes you feel like a badass just swingin' on lanterns and launching yourself from catapults"
28658,"Hate to leave a bad review because I've thoroughly enjoyed this game when it was working, especially around xmas with the holiday event/lobby, but after several bad updates, which both messed up the climbing mechanics and rendered the game unplayable, I have to warn others.

Climb mechanics for advanced techniques like swing & hoist climbing have been deliberately made a lot more frustratingly difficult. This is just one of those things that made the game fun after you've played and finished everything and wanted to enjoy playing in a more skilful way. Sure, there's a climbingcheat console command for allowing easy climbing but that just makes advanced climbing way too trivial to be fun -- it might as well just be a flying cheat. Interesting note, one of this game's bugs is people being able to fly, which ruined everything for a while. Not sure if they ever fixed that bug for good.

The biggest problem I have this with game, however, is that it now easily becomes corrupt and often won't start. It just gets stuck at the ""Curve Digital"" intro screen. I've had this problem once before and after everything from reinstalling the game to reinstalling drivers, it just decided one day to come back on its own at random.

Now the game's corrupt again and I have less incentive to bother fixing it. There have been no new levels added, only bad updates. The game's getting buggier by each update."
28659,"WHAT AN AMAZING GAME!

I 100% reccomend this game its so fun to play with mates.
(nothing is better than dressing up like an astronaut and smashing windows with sofa cushions)

The physics baste puzzles are really clever and there is more than one way to solve it, this really involves your imagination.
Speaking of physics, the charactor physics are helarious.
(Smash windows, climb walls, crash cars; do it all anything is possible in this game)

For keyboards the controls are SUPER easy.
i haven't tryed controlers yet so im not sure how difficult they are but im guessing there easy.

So heres my conclusion: GET... THIS.. GAME! SRSLY :D

"
28660,The controls don't feel good at all. I know it's kind of the point but I just feel that it is way too tedious for me atleast.
28661,throw your friends off the map simulator. 10/10 will do it again.
28662,you stick to things
28663,"Played these levels with friends and just ♥♥♥♥ around. Its an amazingly hilarious time, seriously with friends this game is hundreads of times better. 10/10"
28664,"Gooooooooood game!!
But i need some more new map!"
28665,Great game to play with friends. Wish they added more content.
28666,super fun
28667,"-be me
-Sees exit of map
-Spends an hour trying to catapult to the exit instead of doing the level
-Catapult falls off the edge of the map
-Kills myself
-Get another catapult
-Spend another hour catapulting
-Loses catapult
-Say fuck it and does the level
-Complete it in 30 minutes
10/10 would catapult again
"
28668,Epic game to play with friends
28669,This game runs like a glitchy hairball on Mac OSX. May be better on other platforms but don't waste the money if running under OSX.
28670,I love this game.
28671,"Great little game. Had a lot of fun playing it solo. Achievements are also fun little challenges worth giving them a try. Levels are on the easy side and I suppose that they will be even easier with two, or more peple. It only needs workshop support, or simply more levels. Would recommend."
28672,"Wow, what an amazing game. Playing this game with friends is truly a unique and fun experience. The intricacy and details of the levels in this game are astonishing and allows for the players to find their own ways of making their way to the finish. The only thing I wish for is that there were more levels or custom levels. 7.5/10 game.

EDIT: Since the writing of this review, new official maps have been added, as well as the Steam public workshop being made available to players. This has added a completely new experience for the players, expanding the possibilities of the game. With these new additions, my review has changed to a 8.5/10."
28673,i liked the amusing physics
28674,Very good.
28675,"Its charm, comedy, and cleverness built up enough momentum to keep me going when the going got annoying, but man, does it get annoying sometimes.
The biggest part of that charm is our doughy, completely untextured (by default) protagonist. His animations are driven by inverse kinematics, meaning they’re dynamic and react to interactions with the world around you, and that they’re hilarious. In the early levels I winced when he tumbled off cliffs and when physics contorted his pool noodle-like limbs in unnatural ways. But as soon as I learned that he feels no fall damage and will always eventually pick himself up off the ground, I laughed along as he clumsily waddled along like Gumby with a full diaper.
Controls are deliberately tricky, setting up the slapstick comedy of flailing to keep from dropping important items, dangling from ledges, and getting crushed by heavy things. Your right and left hands are controlled individually by the right and left mouse buttons (or gamepad triggers), respectively, which gives you a lot of opportunity to mess up simple, usually automated tasks like pushing blocks or grabbing onto a ledge and pulling yourself up onto it.
Human: Fall Flat’s slapstick controls and ridiculous animation do a great job of making repeated, frustrating, and unfair failure at physics puzzles seem fun for a while. And when that fun runs out, you can extend it by bringing in a friend and drawing silly things on your goofball character. If you don’t play it, watch someone play it."
28676,"Meh. Walking around like drunk toddlers trying to complete puzzles isn't that fun. While funny at first, the novelty wears off in a few minutes. This game made my wife nauseous, pretty sure she's still plotting my demise. Thank the Baby Alexa i didn't buy this outright and it came in the Humble Bundle. 

I hate leaving negative reviews, but I honestly don't find this game enjoyable at all."
28677,"Very good gameplay, more experience about puzzle, unexpected puzzle, and more 😂. Very fun to play!"
28678,Good but I wish there was more and the Workshop is only in ALpha so there's only a few user-made levels there.
28679,"This is a very fun game. I was not sure I would like it as it looks pretty silly. It's both hilarious and challenging, especially when first starting out. If you want extra hilarity, play with friends. If you want extra challenge, play alone. There is definitely some replay value in this game. Especially if you like to get achievements."
28680,I recommend this game to my friend Adam.
28681,I recommend this game to my brother Adam.

Edit: it got more levels. its a amazing game now"
28695,This game is ok
28696,"The game is fun to play with friends, but it could have had a few more levels."
28697,"Its not ""fun"" per-say, at least its not very exiting, but its calming and a great way to chill for a bit if your too hype or frusterated by something"
28698,"Online multiplayer needs some serious work when it comes to hacking and connection. But besides that, the game itself is awesome, I just wish there were more levels."
28699,"This game is supposed to be a comedy, but instead its boring and all puzzle solving. I played this and immediatly did not like it. There is nothing to do that is funny and comedy. I give this game a bad review because it has no comedy, laughter or even a level of fun."
28700,no tux no bux

28705,"very fun game, but 10x better on multiplayer. recommend to groups of people 2-4, makes the game alot more enjoyable."
28706,really fun with friends but a bit short
28707,"A great physics puzzle game to play with friends,just love how nice the music is. 10/10"
28708,"Honeslty wasa ver diffcult puzzle game untill one bug. Me and my bro did completed levels together spltscreen when the level before the last (there are around 6-7 levels) the very first part of the level with the fan pushing you from the next part, somehow when I jumped towards it and my bro was on the other side it gave me infinte jumping so I could pratciaclly fly.  Basically I was able to in about 3 mins finish the rest of the game. Best bug ever. Other than that one bug the game is very difficult and fun (its difficult in the sense it makes you think what next you have to do. 8.5/10 game for playing with your friends"

28713,my friends kill me more than myself
28714,"[h1]Best online multiplayer physics puzzler of all time[/h1]
Fun little puzzle game with the key feature being its physics based player controls. 
You drag your arms around with the mouse and attach onto walls to pull yourself up. 
Similar to other games like Gang Beasts.
Puzzles are well done and the simplest solution is often the right one, you can also skip parts of the level if you choose to or know how to climb properly. 
Game has online co-op which makes it really fun to play with a friend and makes for lots of funny moments with all the different physics items and objectives in the game.
Pretty short, only about 5 hours long but it’s a good length considering most of the things you do are the same process in the end such as getting to another area, opening a door or climbing to the top of something. 

[h1]7.7/10[/h1]
[i]- short, sweet and hilarious physics puzzle game[/i]"
28715,Amazing games to play with friends
28716,"This review is a lil late but better late than never :P

I first played this in December 2017. I had bought it for myself and a few friends as a christmas gift. 
I streamed the 4 of us playing it and both us and the audience couldnt stop laughing. 
There was even a moment where i literally couldnt talk cause i was laughing way too hard lol

The characters are so hilarious and the movement is just too amusing
The puzzles are actually a little challenging too.

I would highly suggest playing with friends. 
Helping eachother do stuff in the game , watching your friends mess up while they try to get to you and ofcourse throwing your friends in danger to save your own life ... hahaha...  is the reason i loved it so much.

Devs need to add workshop for community-made stages

Edit:

Devs finally added workshop."
28730,"Not really worth the money spent on the game. The game, while at first fun, the level of fun starts exponentially decreasing. Not worth 15 dollars."
28731,"worth every penny, but only if you play it with a friend. I got it and played it alone and its not as fun. So i got it for a friend and its fun factor went up by over 9000%.
heres are fun time moments.

28732,"Short, but totally worth it! Had a lot of fun in 2-player co-op."
28733,"A must-have party game :]

It's like Portal 2 but you do even stupider stuff."
28734,"This is one of the most fun, silly, wacky games that I've ever played. If I could give one suggestion as to how to play, go in with no expectations and no knowledge and, most importantly, friends! That combination worked great for me, would highly recommend."
28735,Very fun multiplayer game!! Highly recommended!! Though hope to have more levels
28736,good game to play with a friend
28737,"this game is fun but you will finish it in 4-5H, there is only 7maps for the game it self there is no one online and 
no modes you can find. this game will make you enjoi every second of it with friends or alone but the fun will end very fast because there is nothen els to really do"
28738,"A friend bought this for me through a Steam Sale and we played it.  The first few levels were rather quick, so we both thought ""was this worth the $7 each/ $14 total"" (he gifted it for us to play). the first few levels are short, but after you get used to the controls they get rather difficult and might take an hour or more to solve. Through the physics and our incompetence while we played this game provided me with laughter that I havent had in years in a game. If you are looking for a good, cheap, fun game this Steam Summer sale or any time. I recommend it because it is really good fun. 

P.S. I found Keyboard and Mouse easier to use over a Xbox One Elite controller, but find whatever works for you :). 

ENJOY"
28739,"Reviewing this game after completing 100% cheevos. HFF is a Very fun game, especially when playing with friends. The puzzles are also challenging. When playing alone, it's also good to practice wall climbing. when that skill/glitch is mastered, it feels like you can overcome any obstacles in the game. Haha. DazIzGood!"

Me and my brother were done in less dan ten hourer and thats not much for a game that cost a lot of money. yes it's fun, but I've your looking for a game like Terraria or Minecraft were you can do a lot of things, its not the thing for you... thank you for reading this comment, I hope it has been a help to you..."

28750,"cool, cool"
28751,This game was funny and challenging
28752,I recommend this game
28753,"It's fun for a little while, but it starts losing its charm after the first couple levels. The puzzles all feel a bit simplistic, and playing with the physics with your friends is only fun for so long.
My friend and I encountered a lot of bugs in some of the more complex environments, although it's possible that was just due to connection issues on our end. Either way, I don't the game is fun enough for the time or money."

One of the things I like most is that the game does give you some freedom as to how you complete each section allowing for a variety of solutios in some areas.
Only downside is the game is fairly short but for the sale price and the fact more contetnt is being released its not a big issue."
28766,"Mama mia, i wanted to get a refund so badly the second i spent 15 min on a server"
28767,I've beaten the game. Sort of... Its a great game but the last level can be beaten with just some careful and pretty simple platforming. But other then that. The music is amazing and so are the levels. If you want a fun time waster then this game is for you!
28768,yeah yeah
28769,Good
28770,"An exceptionally fun little multiplayer gem, however it is incredibbly short. Any word on dlc or more content would make my day, but its still good as it is."
28771,"I was debating to go to trade school, but then I played this game and it all came clear."
28772,It's like a bad version of Grow Home.
28773,"Yes 
YES 
Y E S

i find this little game so interesting and funny and cute and spontaneous at the same time.
Such an easy laugh and an amusing game to play with others (friends or online) both are seriously fun.

You Have To Try It Yourself. 

By default the game have limited character customization and limited maps, but you can mod and workshop everything! (unlimited creativity potential)

I probably will always come back to this game"
28774,Beep Beep Lettuce
28775,"The pretty fun game, lots of laugh spots when I attach my hand on my friend and drag him along, really funny. I think the physical engine be really exciting, make me dumb nuts who can only jump around like a fool"
28776,this game did not run well
28777,Human: Fall Flat while not very rich in content was surprisingly fun to play. Your character stumbles around due to rag doll physics that give the appearance of being drunk and with that feature you are set to solve simple puzzles. It plays something like octodad where simply moving around is what creates the challenge. This feature is also what creates humor which is as well the greatest thing about this game. I found myself constantly laughing too the point of tears. If you are looking for something to throw on quick to have a few laughs with your buddies then I definitly recommend this one.
28778,realy fun withy freinds
28779,I enjoyed the entire game. Nothing negative to say.
28780,"One of the funniest co-op experiences I've had in a long time. The game had a couple bug issues, but they are nothing compared to how much I enjoyed the game."
28781,i love this game so much fun
28782,Its a fun game to play with mates but until they add in Custom maps/community maps it's not worth the $15.
28783,Just grab your friend and murder him
28784,If you like to laugh then this is it.
28785,"Great game and I really like it, I've recent;y updated this review from the negative score I gave it for being short and buggy back in 2017, and with all the extra content that's come in over the years, it's say it's earned it's price. Where it was once a novel game with 6 hours of content AT BEST, it's now a game I can see people pouring 30 - 50 hours into because of the map count being more or less tripled since last time. Good Job, Devs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Positives[/b]: 

* Very silly physics which made for laughs at almost every interraction 
* Customizable characters (Loved making a jelly version of myself)
* Good tutorials
* fun to learn, easy to master
* Great concept 
* 3 of the levels are amazing
* some community maps get love from the developers
* More than one approach to solving a puzzle

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b]Negatives[/b]: (Updated as of Nov 17th)

* Poor networking (Lags with more than 3 people) Still lags occasionally
* Many bugs (Invisible walls, loading wrong maps, freezing) (Not as many bugs)
* Ridiculously under developed; This game plays like Gang Beasts did in it's PRIME, yet the dev has no other modes besides 5 puzzle maps. There SHOULD be sports, tag, racing, crash test dummy courses, wrestling, hunting, game shows. The formula is there for ANYTHING, yet it's only used for puzzles. (Human CITY was just added with a freemode style to it to play mini games and goof around)
* ~~Slow updates (one every 3 months) ~~ It's around the same time frame, but more content is available which is great
* ~~Short (6 hours)~~ It's longer now"
28786,This game is absolutley the most fun i've had in a while. The laughs from your silly failures to the randomness of the levels is just great. 10\10 game
28787,"This is one of those games where you can't really describe it because there's nothing to describe that doesn't make you sound like you have a mental disorder. It's insanely fun to rab people (or anything) and throw them off of a floating island, or actually play the game, or do, really anything. With customizable skins, you can have countless hours of fun."
28788,"This game is funny, multiplayer and it has a small twist of puzzles to play with friends and online strangers! It might look stupid or dumb but, THIS GAME WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE (forver)"
28789,"I genuinely have not had this much fun being thrown about a room since my dad abused me as a child!

10/10 instant indie classic!"
28790,Fun game to play with friends
28791,I played the first few levels and really enjoyed them. I don't usually care for puzzle games and this one was fun through every step. I hope more of my friends pick this up because 8 player multiplayer sounds hilariously fun.
28792,"I have actual feelings of love for this game, if I had any friends to play with, and steam workshop, I'm sure I'd have 1000+ hours."
28793,Quite a hilarious game on multiplayer. I'd play it more if there were a few more maps.
28794,"It's okay, Has some replay value."
28795,You probably won't spend hours on this game however you feel addicted to it at the beginning. It's a great game if you have a couple of friends to play with otherwise it's not much fun alone. Physics are great everything colapses as if in the real world. I haven't encountered any bugs yet but that doesn't mean you won't either and yet I think minor bugs might make this game more delightful though.
28796,"very fun game, easy to speedrun with a little training"
28797,"It's good, I find it better playing it with Multiplayer. Thats if you have friends."
28798,LOL!
28799,"Once you get a feel for the controls, it just feels great to move around. Playing with friends is recommended and will cause plenty of hilarious moments. Only complaint is that there isn't more of the game. Would love If they added more levels as dlc."
28800,"Played it alone, reminded me how lonely I am"
28801,This game is absolutely amazing
28802,"Amazing! Even better with friends! Plase buy, very much worth it! Many great moments. Worth every penny."
28803,This Game Have So many Fun things to do
28804,"This game is so stupid, but that's what makes it fun. The puzzles are dang good, and add some good challenge to the game, but the ragdoll physics and goofy animation give it it's charm. I definitely recommend this game if you have friends that have it. The game is still fun without friends, but it isn't as good of an experience. Great work!"
28805,"Its a drunk platforming game, its hillarius and ingenius game design makes for some fun game sessions. but you can only play through each map so many times. so please add a workshop and more maps"
28806,"Great game! 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a fun mind numbing game. 

I can't wait for the added Workshop function and unleash the creativity of the people!"
28807,Good game!
28808,2 Hours gameplay to finish game.
28809,"Too difficult to control, never finished it"
28810,Serious lack of content - no new maps added since ages.
28811,its ight. could use less hoes tryin to fuck me up mid game but its ight.
28812,8/10 Top Nep
28813,12/10 nice physics
28814,"Humans. 

They attempt to speedrun every obstacle they encounter.

They will toss their friends off a cliff without notice.

They will exploit every shortcut and cheat possible for bragging rights.

And will rage as again they miss that one final jump.

Yet they keep trying, and always will."
28815,"Great fun with friends and/or family. Not a long game, but you can play the levels in a couple of different ways. Very good for pre-teen kids as well, lots of laughter and good simple enough puzzles."
28816,best gayum ever
28817,great game ... realy enjoyed it ... maybe best coop game 10/10
28818,"More frustrating than it is fun, and the funny ragdoll moments last for the first two missions then fade. The game lacks longevity too, you can finish it in one or two sittings (dependant on the person)."
28819,一直更新真不错
28820,A really good game to play with friends. Had a good laugh. And you don't need an incredibly amazing pc to be able to play!
28821,Game is awesome worth every penny had a absolute blast laughing all the way through playing with a friend will challenge your mind just absolutely amazing game looking forward to new maps!
28822,needs more levels
28823,"10/10 IGN, yeet"
28824,"First time I played this it took me and a friend four hours to beat because we got side tracked by a three hour screaming match over who's plan was best. Second time around we got through it  a lot quicker.

Perfect strat: Just keep yelling speedrun while playing to move faster"
28825,Highly reccomended if you like these kind of hardcore parkour but silly and wierd with only 1 passion to fall off of a cliff at the end of the level maybe more story?
28826,The best game I've played !
28827,"This game was working really good to begin with, then all of a sudden it started to glitch out to where it look like a am looking at a broken screen. someone please help me."
28828,I want more maps! >:D
28829,"I wouldn't recommend it ever since the new update. It won't load the level and will give me black screen. My friend is stuck on the title screen. I don't know what happend but it just won't work now for me. If you're not having trouble, idk what's going on then."
28830,Amazing when playing co-op!
28831,loVE gAME
28832,fun game to play with your friends or alone.
28833,"A fun concept but the multiplayer is broken. In its current state, after completing about 2-3 levels online you are ""granted"" the ability to jump infinitely in thin air, allowing anyone to fly to the end of the level. Even if you don't take advantage of this, it's still there and can give you an extra jump when you don't want/need it. Annoying, especially among other smaller glitches.
I recommend this game, but buy it on sale."
28834,"DONT BUY
-3 very short maps thats all yeap no jokes.
Every single map took like 10 mins if u good and 40 mins if u bad at gaming thats all."
28835,"An extremely fun game to play with your friends, Human: Fall Flat is a physics sandbox game about causing mayhem and messing around. Go in alone or team up with your friends to get through the stages and finish the levels! While very fun, it lacks in stages and workshop content, leading to only about 3-10 hours of gameplay.

7/10. Short of an 8-10 due to game length."
28836,"stop playing with our emotions, more maps"
28837,"This game is a lot of fun, but it has an hour worth of content. Listen to your players, we want custom maps and/or workshop support. This game could be a great medium for user-generated content, but people are going to move on soon if you do nothing..."
28838,"Fun little game with lots of potential, would love to see some kind of sports game mode like hockey, soccer, basketball. In an olympic stadium level to boot. 

Maybe an American Gladiators style mode, or the good old capture the flag and king of the hill. 

And some levels geared more towards multiplayer puzzle solving and cooperation between multiple bobs.

If you like physics games, you will like Human: Fall Flat.
Keep up the good work devs."
28839,I simply love it. Playing this game with friends is so much fun and it never gets old. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
28840,5/5
28841,"Human: Fall Flat is just a really strange game. I first came across it while checking out what games are out there and instantly thought 'this game isn't for me' and clicked on not interested but after a long while, my friends were looking for a fun puzzle game to play together. We had recently just played 'we were here' and 'we were here 2' which we also enjoyed. Regardless, I was asked to purchase this game, now for the price tag of 15 bucks and the looks, it seems a bit hefty and all in all, it kind of is a bit much for this game but when push comes to shove, its fun. You may not get thousands of hours in and for the relatively short game, its a bit on the pricey side but with friends, it really is just a heap of fun. 

I would like to point out a few things about the game though. Single player without friends, is like yanking out your own teeth, its boring, this game is all about the group dynamic with friends. VOIP, random acts of harasment to your team mates, its all fun and games till somebody gets picked up and thrown off a cliff.

As for the graphics, well, there are a few issues but it looks like it plays, like walking around with a puff pastry. Your balance is a bit wonky, when you look at places, you move around which considering the sizes of some ledges means that you look towards the next ledge and you go falling back down, its pretty hard sometimes. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy to solve but require you to think for a moment and in that moment, you should have that one friend that tries something to prove Darwin correct.

Now for the sad part, the game doesn't have much replayability. Face it, once you know how to do the puzzle, its just done. The fact you move around in a kind of wonky way makes that the hardest part about the puzzle and you will start to hate the game pretty fast when you are trying to do something you already know how to do but can't really make it. However that isn't the biggest down side of the game, the biggest downside is the fact that there are bugs. The biggest 2 seem to be a locked door that can't be opened while it should be to allow for movement between two areas which makes achievement hunting a real pain and then there is the big one. Sometimes it will bug out and you can just jump over and over to fly. As you can understand, when you can just hold down spacebar and avoid 100% of the puzzles and just go from start to finish in a few seconds, its pretty dull. 

However, I would recommend this game, its fun, its a bit expencive all considering. If you are looking for a good game to play with friends, I would put this one on hold and buy it on a sale.  If you are playing with a full group, you can probably finish the game in 1-3 hours. If you are looking to do all the achievements, 5-10 hours. If you are looking to just goof off and have fun, 10-15 hours before you hit the workshop really. I haven't tried the workshop myself but the game seems to be pretty fun all round. I would have wanted a game of this size and quality however to be sold at a price 33%-50% of its current price, so between 5-10 and not 15. However, get it on a sale and you got value but you should really only get this game with friends."
28842,"Human: Fall Flat is a 3D physics-based puzzle game that really shines when played cooperatively with friends. You play a drunkenly wobbling character (which you can paint and customize) that can walk, jump, and grab/carry items (as well as each other, which can make for some fun rescue attempts of doomed friends). The only play skill really is perhaps the ledge jump, which requires your arms up during a leap that hopefully gets you high enough on the ledge so that you can pull yourself up. Other than that, the playability is pretty straightforward. I played with mouse and keyboard and didn't have any problems with the controls. There were some moments when I was carrying and aiming large poles where the camera ended up in a poor position and I could not see. Having a friend to be a spotter definitely helps for those moments. Oh, and figuring out how to row a boat, that's a tough one. 

I'd say that most of the puzzles are not too difficult and become apparent rather quickly. However, while you can see what NEEDS to be done, it isn't always obvious HOW it is to be done. There was probably 1 puzzle per map that really took a long time to solve. A few took almost an hour to solve. This is when your personal creativity really comes into play. I think there is the primary, graceful way to solve each puzzle most efficiently, but aside from that you can always drag random items with you to a new area and end up creating your own solution. Some of the puzzles seem to have extra items laying around for exactly that purpose. Also, this means that if you trip an event and 'lose' your item, there is always a backup plan laying around for you if you can find it. There were a few times we lost our item, our boat, or whatever, and the developers never left us stranded. We always had a way forward and never had to quit and restart. I really like this aspect of the game. A lot of puzzle games can focus on the ""one solution"" and box you into that expectation of how it should be solved. This game sets you free. If you can get your character to the end... however you do that.. you solved it! The puzzles themselves are quite creative, and while there are some simple ""get the box to this weight-switch"" puzzles, there are so many others. Probably the most common question you ask will be ""how do I get up / over there?"" and the puzzle is more about traveling to a location rather than solving some kind of number or pattern riddle. 

I did not play single-player, but on cooperative mode there were times when it was the sort of situation where only 1 person can reach the end, so that was bittersweet. Although, the puzzles themselves generously allowed 2nd player to proceed after the 1st player trips an event. For example, the 1st player may be swinging and land on a stone which topples over underneath them. That stone falls but lands in a way that allows the 2nd player to drop down onto it and take a secondary path to catch up to 1st player. It's fun to be in the lead and trip the events, and if you are 2nd in line then it could be a drag if you only get to follow someone else's path of destruction. Don't fear! Many of the alternate paths have their own events and encounters, so you still get that experience of being first. Because of this aspect of the gameplay, I feel that the experiences of who goes first and who goes second is quite balanced. It may be a little different with more than 2 people though. 

The maps and level design were fun and maintained a lot of interest due to number of places to explore. Some of the maps are quite large, and there will be many puzzle sections within the map. It does save gradually as you work through the map. The design itself was quite varied with each map being its own very different world. I never got bored of the maps. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with this game. It was a lot of fun, it got me thinking, and the characters are quirky enough that you can't control things smoothly yet somehow it seems more amusing than frustrating. If a sequel comes out or if there is a DLC / workshop for more maps I will definitely return to this game."

Thumbs up"
28844,"REALLY FUN AND FUNNY GAME
but i recomend u play with friend make more fun and funny
while im playing this, a lot of kids watching me, and im gonna be like "" wtf? ""

10/10 game"

I genuinely love this game. It's so adorable. That's all. Oh and it works on every operating systems Windows, Mac and Linux. Although I stumbled upon a glitch when playing online with my girlfriend. It was in the power plant level, I could spam JUMP button and I could fly. That was a pretty cool though so it was nice."
28850,"Needs a map editor and a workshop.

EDIT: It now has workshop and, as predicted, it's amazing."
28851,"Fun and Silly puzzle game, funny physics
Best with friends, Co-op
Lets grab anything including ur friend to stop them from being autistic around and showing him something to solve the puzzle
customizable and colorable cosmetics

update: now with public workshop

its a bit frustating for some climbing stuff up though"

28856,"""Grab my fanny, I need to be taller."" This group puzzle game is a wonderful time with friends. Whether helping them or making them have a much harder time, it's truly a great game. You can play both local and online with friends or try to solve them alone. The game will guide you in the normal ways to solve the puzzle, but there are no limits. If you want to climb the wall instead of solving the puzzle then go right ahead, you're free to explore and work things out however you wish. My personal favorite is never using doors properly and propping them open with your friends rather than using a box."
28857,fun and loving blobs
28858,"so much fun but it needs new levels or a mode where you can build levels
"
28859,Its a fun game
28860,its a fun game expecialy if you play with your friends
28861,Its good but the problem with it is that there isn't enough to do. This could easily be solved by letting us build our own levels. The game is loads of fun but my friends and I are about to run out of stuff to do in this game. If we could continue to play levels built by others or our ourselves it would be fantastic.
28862,"a lot of fun, great to play with friends."
28863,"This game is excellent!
Perfect example of an Indie game done right.

Highly recommend for a good laugh."
28864,Great game with friends - the clunky controls are great and the puzzles are good. Its short though - the only problem is its too short. And the infinite replayability isnt really so. There is usually a way to cheese it. Fun though.
28865,"not worth the money even on sale, would only be worth it when they add workshop maps"

28868,i have a problem: i bought the game and no matter when.. it wont turn on. every time it opens it just shows a black screen and nothing else. i am pretty sad because i paid 10 dollars which is a lot more in my country :(
28869,"A very good game , very interesting physics , well optimized , I reccomend this game ."
28870,This game is amazing you can do anything from throwing your brother off a bridge or a building or a cliff climb to victory   just buy it!
28871,"I really had a fun time with this and I bought the 4 pack to give to friends. It was great.

I kinda wish there was just a tad bit more maps to play, but even though you already know the puzzles in this, you end up exploring everything else and that's really what makes it fun. Also, I figured out how to climb things despite how tedious it can be which makes me want to climb to places I don't belong.

Even with randoms, it's pretty funny, but definitely better with people you know.

When you buy this, make sure you have friends."
28872,"Cute, fun, able to play with friends. Not bad"
28873,"Game is pretty fun for a couple hours, and for only aorund $5 at the time, its a great game to pass the time."
28874,"Very fun to pplay with friends, funny mechanics and really creative customization."
28875,"Every so often, Humble Bundle offers cool bundles where you can select “x” amount of a specific selection of games for “x” discount (usually 3 for 75% off, and it grows from there). Anyhow, I had already been considering Human: Fall Flat since I enjoy the occasional physics based game, so when I saw it offered as part of one such bundle, I jumped at the chance to pick the game up. Typically, physics based games rely on ridiculousness created through loose controls and intentional (or intentionally ignored) bugs to up the fun ante. Goat Simulator is a great example of this as is Surgeon Simulator, Probably Archery, Octodad,  and any number of other equally silly titles. In light of this, how does Human: Fall Flat stack up? Let’s find out.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Well, as is often the case in this genre of gaming, the story is typically one of your own creation. Human: Fall Flat is no exception. There is of course a loose start up story, wherein you, “Bob”, a normal guy who enjoys the use of a good power tool and a little elbow grease, explores his desire to fall, falling into and out of eight game levels. Really, that is about it. The ways in which you go about escaping or solving these levels and whatever misadventures might ensue creates a story of your own design.

There is really no reason to rate this category, but at least you now know as much as anybody else regarding the story within.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Gameplay in Human: Fall Flat is what really defines the game. It is the most important aspect in this genre.

You control Bob via basic movement (I used a gamepad, and it is standard analog movement and vision radius control). You also control each of his arms separately, and can have him jump and fall flat as well.

Bob has very sticky hands, and so anything you touch with them is stuck to his hands until you drop the item(s). This is the key dynamic in Human: Fall Flat, and will impact everything you do, from using objects to climbing to moving stuff around and so on. Often times, this leads to a lot of laughs due to the ridiculousness of the scenarios Bob finds himself in.

Should you be at a loss for what to do next or how to do it, you can and will find VHS tapes throughout the game that will provide helpful hints and tips via old film school reels (of which Bob is the star).

So, with that in mind, you still need to explore and escape each level. The level designs are each distinctly different. For example, one is a medieval castle and town while another is a construction site and yet another is an apartment complex (or condo). There is no right way to approach each level, and that fact opens up the opportunity to replay each level many, many times. Co-op is also an option, although I personally didn’t test this out as the online community for this game is virtually non-existent.

Within each level are also many optional goals, such as using a cane to zipline across the castle and into a bell which you ring by striking it with your body. Another goal is to throw your neighbor’s speakers out the window of the tall condo they are in. Catapulting yourself into the castle is yet another goal. You will drive a forklift at one point to move goal specific items around…and you will use a wrecking ball at another point in the game, both as intended and also as something to help you cross a large open space. Variation is what really keeps this game fresh and fun.

Now, this wouldn’t be a physics based game without some issues. As a rule, they are minor and aren’t worth noting. However, there is one bug that is most likely not intentional and absolutely does NOT add to the experience. That is the lack of a return to game save system. Within the game, you will “die” often, which really just means you will fall back into the level from great heights and splat onto the ground, where you will have to pick yourself up and go about your stuff again. The in game save system is generous. As a rule, you will be dropped right back to, or close to, wherever you failed.

However, once you leave the game, if you re-enter, you have to start over from the tutorial level. That isn’t cool at all. I can’t imagine this is intentional, and yet that is definitely the state of the game, at least for my playthroughs. I have left a note in the games Steam bug forum, but I don’t hold much hope for resolution with this issue as all previous bug reports over the last few months have been ignored.

One further note: there are some minor customization options for Bob including the ability to import your own face via a webcam. I didn’t play with this too much, but it’s a cool feature nonetheless.

While I think the actual gameplay merits an 8 out of 10, the annoying start over bug and seeming abandoned state of the game have me reducing my score here to a 7 out of 10. It’s definitely fun, but you will want to complete the game in a sitting, at least initially.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

The graphics in Human: Fall Flat are actually perfect in context to the game and what it is trying to convey. It looks almost cel-shaded, but not annoyingly so, and is pretty much all soft tones. Everything looks quite distinct and notable, but overall, this is a placid game as far as graphics go. Almost sterile, but in a good way. You will definitely have more context for this by simply checking out the screenshots I have included in this review

8 out of 10

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Much like the graphics, the audio in Human: Fall Flat are subtle. The music seems dynamic at times, responding to where you are and what you are doing, to an extent. The ambient noises, and sounds that come about from what you are doing or what is happening around you are clear and obvious. That said, they weren’t really memorable and I find myself really straining to remember them.

5.5 out of 10

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I think that Human: Fall Flat is overall quite successful at what it has set out to do: create a widely variable physics based playground for you to explore, interact with, and enjoy. The sheer diversity of options and goals makes this a upper tier game in the genre. However, it does have an unacceptable flaw (in my opinion) that I detailed in the gameplay section, and does in fact seem abandoned at this point, so I doubt it will be updated again (although I hope I am wrong in this assumption).

Still, the good absolutely outweighs the bad and I find Human: Fall Flat an easy game to recommend, although I would also recommend buying it when it is on sale.

28881,I now know how to human.
28882,"Tons of fun to play, especially with friends. The wacky physics and interesting sandbox levels lead to some very funny situations. Not a lot of singleplayer content, but the 3ish hours I played were very enjoyable."

28893,"At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. 
“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. 
...
After playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. 
 
[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. 
[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. 
[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.
[/list]

[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. 
[/list]

[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.
[/list]
 
[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]
[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]
I was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. 
Human Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours.

28894,Needs more updates and a workshop!
28895,good game but needs workshop
28896,best game ever ?
28897,Made me Zoink.
28898,"I played this with my friend and I don't think I've had more fun in a coop game. I played wacky, tried things you might not think of to solve puzzles, and murdered my friend often. The best part of the game is breaking it. Whether it's intended or not, there are a lot of ways to solve a puzzle and trying to find a new way of doing it was incredibly fun. I really do recommend playing this game if you have a friend to play it with, no doubt, especially for only $15."
28899,Great game but [b][u]NEEDS[/u][/b] support for a Steam Workshop
28900,"Now that the multiplayer workshop is in the game, 100% worth it. I'd probably pay up to $20-25 for this game. Nothing crazy or special, but it's fun as a co-op game with potential for a ton of content as more people design levels. Really silly game to mess around in."
28901,Nice.
28902,fun game
28903,XD
28904,"my friend threw me off a cliff and beat the level without me, 10/10"
28905,"Great game really fun to play with friends and it was fun to play mostly my only problem is the amount of levels but other then that very very very good game suggest getting if your friends have this game but still great if none of your friends have it 
"
28906,"made hentai sweater

7/10 

i felt like a weeb making it"
28907,"Usually I play the game a little while longer as I hate it when people put up a review with less than 2 hours of play time, BUT! I feel that I desperately need to say that this game needs a steam workshop. BADLY! This is a great game and if you've played it then you know how badly this game needs a steam workshop and a level editor."
28908,drive in dumpster very good
28909,If you want a game that you can play with friends like I did. Go for it. This game is not for singleplayer. I highly recommend playing with friends.
28910,"Great game!, Add more Maps!, it would be awesome"
28911,the puzzles are interesting in this game
28912,"i like the game and the players are helpful, they kinda have to be tho."
28913,This is a good game.
28914,Fun and funny game. Love it.
28915,Adding multiplayer was the best thing they could do for this game. It was a blast.
28916,Beautiful Adventure Puzzle Indie game i love it its short add more levels please :D
28917,"worst game
"
28918,"Fun game but just few levels. :((((
"
28919,Me and a friend almost died laughing while playing the whole thing couch coop. Thank you for this wonderful experience.
28920,"One of the best games to play with friends.
Unfortunately not enough content to keep you playing more than 3 hrs
This is why i cannot recommend at the current price tag

EDIT: Crazy! Added Workshop Support and there are some cool maps already after 20 days.
If you want to have sex with DOnald Trump and Borat together, get 2 friends, drink some alcohol and play this game after downloading these models from the workshop. Im drunk"
28921,highly recommended
28922,"A Great Ragdoll Physics game.


 The Levels

[*] A fun level design in my opinion, can be very fun but also frusturating at times.
[*] Not many levels though. it will take around 16 hours to beat the game and get all achievments.

 Operating Sound track

[*] The sound track is super nice to listin too.
[*] sometimes can be dramatic/loud 

 Multiplayer

[*] Currently the multiplayer servers can be laggy with 5+ people on, and also a huge lag spike when someone joins.
[*] i have'nt had many server problems yet. if i cant join my friend usually just restarting your multi-player game will fix it.

 Bugs

[*] i havent seen many bugs but one ive seen was game breaking, me and my friend were achievment hunting and all the sudden we could fly. (i do have a screen-shot of it on my profile).
[*] Another i've seen was on the map castle which you couldnt break a lock inside a building. Luckily that isnt important at all and its only optional.

 mods
[*] Mods are a small pain to get, and you cant play them multi-player. (Hopefully workshop support soon)
[*] With mods you can download charecters (They work in multi-player) And you can also get Maps/Levels

 SUMMARY

overall this game can be amazingly funny, a great OST, and only a few bugs (i've encountered) i highly recommend if you 
want a small game to play with your friends, or yourself."
28923,Amazing physics-based puzzler!!! Love the challenge!
28924,fun game with goofy physics and a real brain teaser
28925,"No replayability value for me, but the initial playthrough was filled with rage, and laughter.

7/10"
28926,Very fun game :) I recommend to everyone :)
28927,Love it. Really fun to play.
28928,GG
28929,This is a really really fun game I love the ragdolls and jsut how silly it is andthe scenery of the game and all the obstacles can either get hard or easy it's jsut really fun
28930,good but not good if you get angry easily.
28931,"What can I say? This is a game that's fun to mess around with!
Even when the main ""puzzle"" is done, there's plenty to mess around with; you can interact with almost everything. It's also nice to try and do the side acheivements.
All in all, I'd say this is worth it's money in hours spent simply messing around"
28932,"Game fun, you can replay alot"
28933,"super cute game to play with a s/o or with friends, the only thing i don't like is that there aren't enough levels!"
28934,other than the lagg its good i just wish i had friends to play with :( (could someone friend me plz)
28935,","
28936,ok
28937,"add workshop, add paid cosmetics, fix connection shit, game complete
"
28938,i dont have  a work shop why?
28939,"Great value, great fun, great time with friends.  A bit short, finished it in 6 hours."
28940,Great game you do need a good computer though And this game has changed my life due to the friend it got me see my profile my friend made that for me I met up with her in a online host and well we became best friends and then because i'm friends with her I end up meating the Coolest group of kids ever including her and well lifes good all thanks to this game I made this review not for the game play but to show how thankful I am for this games existence and yes this game is very fun and funny 10/10 besides when my hands stop working and I can't pull myself up ): saddo
28941,Really really funny game if you playing with friends its fun but i suggest buy it on sale
28942,"Excellently built game, but unfortunately there are not to many levels, and it isnt very replayable. I would recommend this game, but best to wait until it is on sale"
28943,"Pretty fun game, lots of laugh spots when I attach my hand on my friend and drag him along, really funny. I think thr physicial engine be real interesting, make me dumb nuts who can only jump around like a fool"
28944,"Have a couple of friends that you can fool around with while puzzle solving? Human: Fall Flat is the game for you. Exceedingly rewarding when you solve something right, and exceedingly funny when one of you messes up. Or if one's model messes up and then you're missing a limb or two.

Downside is that there aren't much levels; having a few updates with new levels would sate your tastes for a while longer. Or if there were workshop support for this game.

Still, for a good 5-8 hours, this one's really fun to play."
28945,"+ funniest coop game I've played in years
+ clever puzzles with multiple solutions
+ great map design, beautiful scenery 

- not enough maps, over all game was too short

I really wanted to play more of this game with my friends but we finished in two evenings
hope there is a Human Fall Flat 2 or more DLC maps I can buy"
28946,"such a fun game but im loosing hope because theres no new maps or anything coming for it. 
Please make an update at least saying your working on maps for the near future."
28947,Fun game
28948,ugandan knuckles 2016
28949,"I have to say, really great game, the graphics are simple, the music is nice, and the mechanics are top tier. I absoleutely love it but it's not as fun when you get motion sickness"
28950,It was great! Loved it!
28951,"A really funny game overall! It's great for y'all out there who like puzzle solving. As fun as it is by yourself, it's pretty difficult to beat that way and can get pretty frustrating. I highly recommend playing co-op with your friends, as it will not only make it easier to beat, but it's also really funny. I don't know about the rest of you, but when I play it with others we all end up cracking up with every level as these floppy little dudes try to help each other maneuver through the levels. Will definitely replay and recommend to my friends!"
28952,Very fun!!!
28953,"Fun game with friends, but runs dry quickly. Buy it on sale if you really want it, though be warned there's no replay value and it's incredibly short"
28954,It now has workshop levels i am happy
28955,"The game is immensely fun when played with friends. Single player game can be depressing af: you play a faceless guy floundering in what appears to be an inescapable, infinitely purposeless, and intendedly indifferent world with nothing but your flaccid, choreatic limbs to grab whatever bizarre objects the world throws at your face in the desperate hope of figuring out what to do with it so you may, after repeated failures and forced reincarnations, stumble upon some arbitrarily placed destination, only to start falling again and flat to the ground of next satge of this trek which is basically a bigger, meaner, lengthier version of what you just struggled through, and once again, with no one watching. 

Yeah, I would definitely recommend this game for portraying the human state of existence so accurately."
28956,Very fun game to play with friends. Provides a couple of hours of silly fun and wacky physics. Would reccomend picking it up when it is on sale.
28957,Ok
28958,very fun game 10/10 yw
28959,Very fun physics game and is perfect to play with your friends. Has a workshop so the community is able to create their own levels and items. Lots of content and fun and one of the most well spent times on a game.
28960,"Fun and short little puzzler/platformer with deliberate ""drunk"" movements of the character.
Plenty of opportunities to stray off the main path in any level and clear the game your own way.

Playing co-op isn't mandatory but certainly adds to the experience.

"
28961,"Hmmmm..................................
I want to suicide 
bye world

I respawned =)))"
28962,"I miss the christmas level. It had a train. A TRAIN.

Game is surprisingly an actual game, with puzzles and platforming and exploration. It's not a Goat Simulator sort of nonsense sandbox, although you can certainly have those sorts of shenanigans (especially in multiplayer), and the levels are long enough to enjoy fully."
28963,Climed out of the map and didn't bother with the castle level. 10/10 would climb again!
28964,"TO FALL PROPERLY YOU NEED TO GET H I G H

this game literally saved my relationship

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPhSL2JRqjM"
28965,not fun when you play alone
28966,its a game
28967,Climbing is really fun 5/5
28968,This game is really fun but I have trouble playing it and sometimes can't because the fps drops extremely low when not even 5 minutes into the game. I've messed around in options and it doesn't get much better. I do love the graphics and gameplay though.
28969,Cute❤️
28970,fun with fwend
28971,Fun for the whole family.
28972,I LIKE IT IT IS GOOD!
28973,needs more levels but is gudy
28974,its a great and fun game for both single player and multiplayer. its also a puzzle game when u have to find out where to got and how to get to places. the whole point of the game is to go from a start point and make youre way all the way to another level.
28975,"Overall fun game, could use more maps."
28976,"A hilarious adventure, as long as there's more than 1 of you.
My time spent on human fall flat was full of laughs. From trying to help friends who didn't quite make 'That' jump to the satisfaction from when you finally figure it all out. 
For the price the game is great. I really love the mouse controls to use your arms/hands, it makes a new challenge that I haven't had before. The workshop and skins allow for more of a personal touch on your characters which is also quite nice. 

The only downside of the game was when I tried the single player. Now don't get me wrong, the game doesn't nessisarly change from single to multiplayer, I just found that single player made the game seem a little dull? That could just be me and but it's something I thought was worth a mention.

So in short...Human fall flat is a great game to play with friends, I feel this game shines most in it's multiplayer and playing as a team seems to add more enjoyment to the game."
28977,The game is dead
28978,"Just another coop-fun-based game, with a few hours you can complete 100% this game, but most important it comes with a lot of fun if you play with your friends.

U can drop them off the cliff, or just mess with them, its your choice.

And for this price its totally worth."
28979,"I WOULD recommend this game, but I feel like they need to add in some sort of workshop or new levels. The game is a blast, a lot of laughs and good times, but very short lived.

If that day ever comes, I will change my thumbs down to a thumbs up!

Even though I haven't played much since they put out the workshop. I'm a man of my word. Thumbs up.


EDIT: They have added this stuff, I haven't played the game in a while, but its probably still fun."
28980,"A fantastic introspective on what it means to be human. Much like in real life, you control a bumbling, squishy specimen tasked with solving a variety of problems, mundane or otherwise. Most YouTubers and casual gamers only see a funny ragdoll meme game. But not me. I believe that this game is a true metaphor for life. In fact, the game is highly metaphorical in almost every aspect. The multiple ways to get around a problem is a metaphor for free will. The way that when you fall off the map you land right back on it is a metaphor for starting again when you've made a big mistake. The act of falling to end a level is a metaphor for the ""rollercoaster of life"" philosophy, which states that when you are at your highest point, you can only go downhill from there. The game's levels take you through the essentials of what it truly means to be a human. Whether you're destroying walls with a wrecking ball (a stunning metaphor for how society breaks itself down over time), exploring a medieval-themed land which requires you to perform exhausting manual labor to find your way to the end, or rewiring power through circuitry to open doors, you're learning a new life lesson about what makes you you. The character customization is insane. You can make almost any type of human you want. You can even be a dog. But no matter what you are or what your character looks like, you will be climbing your way to victory, much like we humans strive for success in everything we do. This game is brilliant. I have never seen a game that takes itself and its subject so seriously. What an absolute masterpiece. 10/10

late disclaimer this review is ironic but the game is great definitely get it especially if you have friends"
28981,"Really, really frustrating game."
28982,"What terrible fucking game! waste of money, get Gang Beast Instead!"
28983,":D  Very, very fun puzzle game. I have NO complaints.  :D
This is my favorite game. It's very relaxing. Just some nice puzzles to to try and complete while at the same time having fun messing around.
I haven't tried it yet, but you can play with a friend which would most likely be even more fun than solo (solo is still very fun).
:)"
28984,BUG WHY THE FAK I CAN FLYYYYY!!!
28985,thank you for the lovely game. cant stop laughing with my teammate. haha
28986,so funny!i like this
28987,i dosent let u do anything like pick up stuff aqnd when you try to CLIMB ure stubby little arms will just slide down sotp
28988,"Never in my life would I thought this game would be this fun,  It just so funny to play  that all I did most of the time is laugh all the time though out the whole game.      My 13teen year old daughter and I played through one huge area and that about all we did.  I would have to say this game is really fun and think it would have been cool in a story mode playing and build and fight and all the things you do in a game with these controls it would be fun and also very funny to play.  I wish they would make a campaign mode for this game. I would say that the game is only fun playing with a friend if you play it alone the game is not meant to be played alone it is not fun to play alone.
I GIVE THIS GAME 100% THUMBS UP FOR AN EXCELLENT GAME,
 ""BUT THE LENGTH THIS GAME IS A JOKE IT ONLY ABOUT 8 TO 12 HOURS LONG I PLAYED DEMOS THAT LASTED LONGER SO IF YOUR GOING TO GET IT, BUY IT ON SALE FOR ABOUT 5 TO 9 DOLLARS THAT IS ALL IT IS WORTH FOR THE SMALL AMOUNT OF GAME PLAY!.""  
I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE SOME ADD ON MAP MODES IN STEAM FOR THIS GAME IT IS A LITTLE SHORT IN GAME PLAY, THOUGH THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ALL THOSE WHO PAYED 2O DOLLARS FOR THIS GAME. 

Unlike the game called game beasts this game works very well, i have posted reviews but most have not even seen my reviews, unsure why when i give positive reviews but game beast never fixed there game it is unplayable on the pc...

THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE SO CALLED MODS MOST DON'T EVEN BUILD MAPS THAT WORK VERY WELL and some have such good looking maps but the doors don't open with lots of cool building and other object used for nothing and level that don't work all for show,  what a waist of good map editing and time! 

(REVIEWED BY TRADE MARKED {S.S.G} THE STEPPING STONE GAMING FOUNDATION!)"
28989,really fun game to play with friends but there is not alot of levels and stuff to do and the game can be played in under an hour if you know what you are doing
28990,"Overall, this is a really fun puzzle game with goofy physics and adorable floppy buddies you guide through colorful environments. I particularly enjoyed the different ways your beanie baby human can interact with objects (especially breaking windows and swinging like a trapeze artist).

It's fun to puzzle through on single-player mode, but I also definitely recommend spoofin' and goofin' around with friends on multiplayer, too."
28991,"Gasping for breath laughing at this game. Play this with friends, and just let slip your sanity. In a good way."
28992,"Fun game with a friend, bit short maybe but nice"
28993,"A very engaging game! Difficult to put down for long. 
The 'Festive Unlocks' (and map) were a real highlight and a great surprise. If you're creative, character (Bob) customisation is a game in itself. 
Running through the whole game can be done in a matter of hours, but then you're likely to miss out on the secrets and mysteries that are hidden away in the most sneaky of places. Almost 24-game-hours in, and I'm still finding stuff!  
More maps / official workshop support would be nice, and rumour has it may be coming... maybe... 
Only had a limited time with the multiplayer as my Internets are lousy - however it's massive fun. 
TLDR: short but tightly packed with potential. That's the game... and one of my oft-used pick-up lines."
28994,"Most derpy game I have ever played but I love it!
"
28995,"wow
"
28996,"Graphics <3
Tp game 
Play with friends 
"
28997,"A deceptively simple but fun game. Puzzles are intuitive. Maps are interesting. Controls are wonky, difficult, weird, fun, and stupid.

Human: Fall Flat is a hilarious time with your friends, and not worth your time without them. It’s meant to be a casual mess-around sandbox with some friends, and if you treat it that way, you’ll love it."
28998,"sexy sex, best game ever."
28999,fun but sometimes annoying controls.
29000,"human fall flat is a game i played for about 10 hours. this is 10 hours that i could have spent watching BBW videos on the ol Etherweb. that alone should tell you that aside from my obvious addiction to BBW videos, this is a game that is playable for 10 hours, or even more. the name ""human fall flat"" is clearly derived from the famous chinese proverb: ""even monkeys fall from trees sometimes"". when i figured this out I knew immediately that the creator of this game, Mr. Fallflat himself was an intellectual and was thus deserving of my money."
29001,The game is really fun when you are playing with your friends. So many funny instances.
29002,"This game is an unique . if you and your friend   experience together it , you will understand why i said that i do not have any words in order to define or explain this game ,yet if you play alone , you will definitly be bored . Hence, you should play with friend  if you have :D

My point is 7.2"
29003,The game was amazing... until I experienced the entire thing in under 10 hours. Seriously lacking content.
29004,"Amazing game!

I liked every second of it.

I can recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of games.

It would be nice if it had more levels tho... or if it had the possibility to make custom maps."
29005,so you grab your friends by their balls and throw them off floating islands
29006,What's better than drunken video game night?  Drunken video game night while attempting to control a character that is also inebriated!
29007,"WOW what a fun game, it took me a whole 1 hour to complete."
29008,"Really great game.
A real brain teaser when playing alone. But I got to say - best way to enjoy is to play with friends.
We where laughing our asses off. The game itself isnt that funny, but its just so easy to mess up and create funny moments.

Interesting alternative ways to finish levels, wich actually encourage second and even third playthrough. Some random gimmicks to try out while playing. Achievements are difficult, but they are not impossible to get for a regular player - just need to get some hours into it.

I hope new levels come or workshop support. Its a great game I would definitely play again. Couldnt recommend it enough :)"
29009,Great fun with friends ! ! ! We cried like never before :D
29010,Crazy Fun
29011,This is a really fun game to play with friends! Bought it because I enjoyed playing it at a party so much.
29012,"GREAT game! This game is halarious, but also enjoyable singleplayer as well. This game NEEDS steam workshop or some sort of way to make your own maps. This is a very borning game at this state  because of the very few maps. Other than that this game is good, besides the VERY unactive developers."
29013,A must-play game with your friends!
29014,和朋友一起玩太好笑了
29015,"It's a funny game to play alone...

But it's a really funny game to play with friends
And contrary to most co-op games, you won't even hate them afterwards"
29016,"98% of the time laughing so hard cant play correctly, 1.8% not goofing off, .2% Solving puzzles"
29017,"Such a great game! Played it with my bf and we had a ton a fun! And discussions how to solve everything :)

Hope new maps will be done soon :)

29018,"very cool game, had lot of fun. Perfect game to play together.
Bit short, run through it in 8.5 hours."
29019,"Very fun to play with friends, great laughs and easy to have a good time, levels are limited currently but hopefully they will add multiplayer mod support so you can play user created maps with friends in the future"
29020,It's a so funny game. I love it. The maps are great and the multiplayer is very cool.
29021,noiceeee
29022,Some of the best laughs I've ever had

29028,pog

29030,god i love this game. character customization is top notch too.
29031,vis du spiller med Marcus er det cancer
29032,pretty good but short more fun with freinds pls add more stuff to the game.
29033,When a kid holds on to your leg and something else.. you just want to kill yourself.
29034,good shit
29035,Fun game lots of laughs but we need more content!!

29039,"Very cute at first. After a while, I realised that it is not a puzzle game, for they are quite easy, but a jumpy-jump game which are quite difficult. Actually, the main thing to fight against is the clumsiness of the move commands You quickly understand what to do, but the mushy answer of the moves transforms it into a challenge of a type which I personnaly do not like. So, if you are looking for that very type of challenge, go for it, it is quite original and nice looking. But if you'e looking for a puzzle game, go elsewhere."
29040,"Think it's a little bit too lazy of a game for me to play any further than first levels. I mean the game base is there, but polished, finished game is not.

It's funny / fun for a while, but then it's pretty predictable real fast... and gets boring.

Gang Beasts was much more fun out of the 2.

It would have been better if the characters controls weren't so floaty, and more precise combined with physics. Climbing for example would be better if you threw up 1 hand, grabbed, then threw up the other, grabbed, repeat, but this current climbing method only allows you to climb up onto edges.

I don't dislike it, it doesn't deserve a negative, but it could have used a little more TLC to be fair."
29041,"Got a steam link for a dollar

10 / 10"
29042,"Pretty nice game. The controls are a bit hard to use but if you just use a steam controller, ps4 controller or other controllers it's much easier to play.

The game itself is really fun to play with friends, however I wouldn't buy it if you're going to play it on your own."
29043,"so fun to play with friend
"
29044,"Awesome game, very funny to play with friends.
The perfect co-op experience! 
WE WANT MORE OF THIS!! :)

29045,The best co-op i have played
29046,Fun puzzle game only would like to see more maps cause i finished it alone and legit pretty quik!
29047,i like this game i play it all the days
29048,It's fun at first but due to the [i]advanced physics and innovative controls[/i] becomes a rage quit simulator very fast.
29049,This game will be my main game if this game includes steam workshop.
29050,The most fun I have had with a game in quite a while.
29051,"NIce game to play for a lan party

short but really fun

Play with friends and not alone"
29052,"Fun game and pretty good physics. I wish the  character in the game  had a little more rigidity as the body has a little too much flop in it making it hard to control. I also wish there was a deeper save point - when the doughboy decides to flop around and you fall off a cliff - which is very easy to do - it would be nice not to have do start the entire section all over again. Between the two it's more frustraing than fun for me. I 'play' games to have fun, not to be frustrated and this has become a frustration. If I were goving starts I'd rate it a 3 out of 5"
29053,"The best co-op game I've ever played. Only thing that they HAVE to add is custom maps in multiplayer.
But the normal campains are also fun, especially with friends. Recommend this if you like to play the portal games or similar games."

Buy the game when they release new levels/steam workshop"
29055,really funny i can grab everone's ass
29056,One of the greatest co-op experiences I've ever had with friends.
29057,you should definitely get some friends to play it with you
29058,"'It's a masterpiece"""
29059,Really Fun Game love it
29060,"Probably some of the most fun I've had on any game. It's better with friends, and just amazing fun"
29061,Great and enjoing game for co-op with friends.
29062,"This is an extremely fun game for two players. It might be hard to control the characters at first, but once you get the hang of it you will love it! The main issue used to be a lack of levels to play, but now steam users can create their own maps and upload them for others to play. 
The game is well worth its full price!"
29063,Nice game.. But we need more maps and the WORKSHOP to create a lot of comunity maps.
29064,"This game is a basic and fun game.

Pros - 
- This game is not demanding, you dont need the biggest and best Pc to run this!
-Very fun!
- Can end up spending hours on this!
- there are many things like vehicles
- this game can make you laugh alot
- 8 players online!

Before i do any cons.. i actually dont want to do this, but im doing it so they can possibly add on to the game.

Cons -
- Not much maps - 8 maps?
- Not very fun when playing solo :/
- Cost £12 for a short game. add a ton more for this game to be worth it.
- No workshop *i think* this game really need this feature.

My opinion - 
- If i were you, wait untill a sale or buy this off a website like instant gaming. this is not worth the full £12. spend the money on something bigger and better.
"
29065,"Introduced to this game by watching Neebs Gaming on youtube, I purchased a copy for myself and my boyfriend. We really enjoyed it and hope for more levels soon! Its silly fun, great look,  and just begs for the ability to make your own maps!"
29066,"I absolutely LOVE this game. It's silly, cute, challenging and fun. It has fun but still challenging mechanics and amazingly well crafted maps. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this game. Maybe more maps could be added, but that's a just nitpick. If you love puzzle games, you'll adore this. Being someone who isn't a huge fan of puzzles, I still think that this is one amazing game. I highly reccomend it."
29067,very funny :>
29068,"Best game to play, chill and have a laugh with your friends!!"
29069,very fun game needs update more levels and maybe user created levels
29070,"Human: Fall Flat is an incredible game meant to be played with friends. Its engine allows for fun gameplay and the puzzles are tuned just right so that you can have a few laughs without getting anyone bored.

The base maps should be enough to keep you enternained anywhere from 3 to 10h. Anything beyond that would require added maps or a better (open for everyone and easier to access) workshop, so that the community could help the game grow and/or maintain an sustainable playerbase.

Seeing as the developers have been dead for a while as of the time of this review, I would absolutelly recommend this game only as long as you keep in mind that it does get repetitive after a few hours of gameplay."
29071,"I'd only recommend this game if you want to do some puzzle solving with your friends as a co op kind of thing. Other than its a fun game that, and if you can get it on sale with a couple friends do it."
29072,we need workshop!
29073,"Super fun game, recommend playing it with friends."
29074,Absolutley amazing. Great way to sit back. Relax. And angrily decompress.
29075,This is a great game to play with friends! Lots of laughs and good times. I wish there were more new maps added regularly!
29076,Annoying
29077,how do go to the workshop
29078,beest funny game
29079,"This game is fantastic fun, at least if you have some good friends to play with like I did. My one complaint is that there wasn't more of it. You can easily run through it in a couple of days, and then it's thoroughly over. If anyone knows about easy-access mods to this game, please do give me a call. New levels etc would be amazing."
29080,"Hella fun with friends! I haven't played it alone, but it'd probably be alright solo too."
29081,"First of all I know that i don't have alot of hours of gameplay but i'll just explain the cons and pros.

Pros
- Fun to play with FRIENDS
- Fancy graphics
- Can run on lower spec pc's (no high recquirements)
- Puzzle-aspect is very much pro to game
- Physics 9/10 Newton would say I do not approve

Cons
- Same maps over and over
- Very limited workshop
- It is not a game where you'd expect to get alot of hours on.

29083,i love this game but they deleted the winter map so can you do a summer free map plz?
29084,"in Human: Fall Flat, you control a ...grey plasticine human.

Human: Fall Flat is an awesome and fun co-op multiplayer puzzle plataformer. You can play alone and with your online friends, but be aware this game is ADDICTIVE. (especially if you are playing with friends)

Soundtrack is also very good (if you care about that), the game has 8 levels, it kinda deserve a few more, but, still a great game!

I totally recommend it, totally worth the price!"
29085,"Interesting until the last level which is garbage and glitchy in an infuriating way.

Okay, If you disregard the last level, pretty fun and neat."
29086,"a fun, simple game. great with friends."
29087,"Human not flat
Human fall down

...

Human flat now."
29088,"What a great game!

Simple mechanics of a slightly clumsy avatar brought to a superb life.

The environments are very different, there is a lot to explore and try out. Nice progression, and you barely do things even twice.
Gameplay is a combination of platforming, dexterity, light puzzle elements, exploration and experimentation.

The control scheme is pretty simple, but through the unique avatar reactions something special.
Although the avatar feels a little bit clumsy, the control aids implemented stood out to me as great/superb.
Objects truly have weight, but can still be handled through consistent controls and slight aids.

The graphics are charming and unique. The environments very different. Always consistent in style and minimalism.

Varying soothing good music as emphasis in only specific scenes. Audio is otherwise pretty basic and minimalistic, which never stood out as negative. It fits the relatively bare world estetics.

The technology is superb. Physics play a big role in this game.
This game has the best loading and respawn mechanic I have ever seen. Truly one of a kind.
Menu traversion feels nice as well.

A masterpiece."
29089,Better than portal. 10/10
29090,"All the way through my playthrough I felt like i was being surveyed by higher beings, testing human intelligence. The most common comments: 1: ''What the fuck is he doing?'' And ''How the fuck did that work?''
"
29091,"I had a very good time playing this game with my friends , but they must add more maps or add workshop"
29092,Awesome... Funny... Every human falling flat must have it!
29093,"very good, cooperative game that brought much joy to my and my firend's heart. Well done!"
29094,Game is lots of fun with more people!!!
29095,"hi i forgot i had this on my switch may i pls have a refund
"
29096,this game is very fun with friends!
29097,"this is a great game but it needs cheats like fly cheat or something
"
29098,Please add more stages
29099,very good game fun to play specialy if you like puzzles but when you have done all levels you have nothing more to do
29100,Awesome game really fun and time consuming
29101,"Simply a fun and wacky game, great to play with friends, with a decent level of replay abilty, hope to see more levels added in the future, as well as maybe character unlocks for getting certain achievements."
29102,"Fiendish & addictive & fun (sometimes) ... it starts easy enough, but increasingly gets harder pretty quick.   It's a 3D pyhsics/puzzle game that is clean & beautiful & challenging...  Especially since the character you play, 'Bob', has his own wobbly physics.  

There are some frustrating points, like having to restart a checkpoint when you are 'almost there' ... but it's never too brutal.   Checkpoints are frequent, and the puzzles (so far) are often hard enough to give you good satisfaction once done.  

I've play about 4 hour so far and probably have gotten 1/2 way through.   I'm imagining the final levels will be even harder.   Each 'world' is very unique, and often easy to explore 'off path' ... Occassionally there is more than one way to solve the challenge.   This would definately be a fun game to play with a friend, too. 

My only complaint is that there are not multiple save slots, meaning it's just one person's progress being tracked, so if I wanted to let my family play, they would have my progress and achievements and check points.  

Overall, this game has been a suprise delight -- (it's been years since I've played puzzle genre games, and I was drawn in by the graphics and watching someone randomly play a bit on Twitch) ...   would def recommend."
29103,"This game is actually quite good, I've really enjoyed playing it. It's an interactive game and has a nice gameplay."
29104,"Great game, love playing, also nub hands."
29105,"Love spending an hour trying to do something unintended by the game mechanics? Pick up this ginker of a cold kosher.

29106,Indubitably enjoyable
29107,fucking hate this game
29108,"Speedrunned the game without knowing that i missed a bit of puzzles




Btw accidentally found a bug"
29109,"Really good concept, and great mechanics. Just not enough levels. Add steam workshop and this game would be a solid time waster"
29110,"****************Introduction****************

Human: Fall Flat is a fantastic experience for CO-OP with your friends Online or right next to you.It has simple puzzles to keep you guessing,plus fun physics with fluid movement.Yet small in the scale of it's missions,it's a fun game.

****************Performance and Graphics****************

Game runs smoothly,haven't experienced any bugs for in my playtime.

Graphics are simplistic yet enjoyable.The cartoony feel certaintly helps make it more accesible for younger audiences/people with mediocre computers.

****************Gameplay****************

To keep the review short,gameplay is really simple.Left mouse button to use your left arm,right mouse button to use your right arm,WASD to move and space to jump.That's pretty much all you need to know.Movement feels good,jumping and climbing things is really easy,and dying is not annoying at all,since you don't lose much of your progress.

You can customize your little ""human"",with different colors and clothes,so make him/her fabulous!

Game is not that long,but I think with some friends,a couple of beers,it can get pretty fun.There is Split Screen as well.

****************Final thoughts and Verdict****************

Human: Fall Flat is a game that really shines while playing with others.Do not buy this if you are planning to play it alone,you will most likely get bored fairly easily.It is recommended to buy it on sale,or even get something like a 4-pack for your friends as well,game get's discounted a lot of times within a year,while discounts can be really good.

It's a 8/10,a fun game that is held back by it's lack of quantity on the missions and the requirement to have other people play with you to truly have the most fun in the game.Still,it is an easy recommendation."
29111,"It's very fun, whether you play it yourself or with your friends, you'll find happy , hey, please don't pull my hair out."
29112,Noice
29113,"GR8 M8 8/8
Seriously a great game"
29114,Better than roblox
29115,"Only good when playing with freinds.

Edit: Nope single player is great. I was a noob when i wrote this and it was a bit difficult to cotton onto the strategy"
29116,"Needs a map editor 
updated: it has a workshop support now"
29117,Good.
29118,Best Co-op experience ive ever had. Playing this alone is kinda booring but with a friend/ friends then its really fun. We will definently come back when more content comes since we got 100% of achievements.
29119,This is a really fun game to play with friends! I had a blast playing this as it reminded me and quite a lot of other players of gangbeasts. It may not have any new mechanics but it was a new concept for sure. Quite refreshing to see something original again. Please support the devs and buy the game!
29120,"fun game but the achivements are near impossible, the achivement ""breathing exersises"" is VERY hard, and i couldn't complete it on over an hour of playing"
29121,"So much fun :) 10/10
(Please add it so we can make our own couminity maps or add more maps) <3"
29122,"Good fun, nice textures, calming music, not too difficult - without being boring."
29123,"Human: Fall into a frozen lake and drown, with friends edition."
29124,"I'm not fan of puzzle games but.
This game actually really cool :D

Good Job :D"
29125,"I have only played multiplayer, so I can't say anything about single player. However, the experience with multiplayer was honestly awful. The game itself is great, but there were so many bugs that everyone stopped playing one after the other when they got too annoyed at it.

Over the 2 hours we played for, we had 3-6 people in the lobby at different points and found several problems that made the game unplayable for half the players:
- rendering was offset for some players, e.g. their point of view was below the floor, where the others could see them on the ground perfectly
- some players were invisible to others
- the game froze on some players consistently every x minutes
- some got stuck in the connecting to lobby screen (does this have a timeout? it probably should)
- when someone tried to join a full lobby, the whole game crashed for them
- as the host, I wasn't able to kick people when randoms joined using the chat commands
- when I tried to join a lobby where someone else was host, the game completely glitched and I had several menus overlayed on my screen, all doing the zoom in animation repeatedly then staying there while the animation was triggered again, so my screen was a mess of white text

I only saw the last two problems as I was hosting most of the time, but the other problems were all experienced by each of the other players, as far as I know, so it wasn't any one person's computer or internet that was the problem. And some of us live quite close to each other and we had just as many problems, so it doesn't seem to be ping related.

So, in general, it seems to me that the netcode and a few other things need a lot of work. Maybe single player is amazing, maybe they'll fix all the problems with multiplayer and that'll be great too. But most of the people I know of who were interested in this game where interested because of multiplayer, so for now I can't recommend this to anyone."
29126,The game is fun but for the price it is sold at I’m not sure that it is worth the money unless it’s on a big sale there are only 7 levels (i think) and the online play is very laggy and has high latency but it still is getting worked so a lot of those problems could be fixed.
29127,short but fun with friends
29128,"i like thes game
"
29129,wheres the workshop WHENS IT COMING IVE BEEN WAITING MONTHS
29130,funny and fun with friends. Definitely recommend.
29131,game is jokes
29132,lol
29133,"Not really that worth to play if youre gonna play it alone, but if u have a friend with you? YES this game is amazing to play with friends, just wish they could add workshop maps to multiplayer or atleast add more maps..

EDIT: THEY ADDED WORKSHOP!! Best Co-op game out there tbh."

29135,"It's an awefull lot of fun to play with friends, but untill the workshop is fully imported and community maps can be made and played, it's finished after you done the story.
It creates hilarious situations for you and your friends and is an easy way to kill time, but when finished it's literaaly finished.
I would say buy on sales for now, but when the workshop launches it's fully worth it's price.
8/10"
29136,"Human: Fall Flat is a very fun game I HIGHLY recommend this game and you buy it, it's REALLY FUN!"
29137,"Pretty good meme of a game! So yeah, fun!"
29138,good
29139,":D
"
29140,"Honestly, the content is a little lacking. So far, it only has eight maps, each of them slowly ramping up in difficulty. The first two or three kind of teach you how to play, and the rest are really thought provoking puzzles.

However, at the same time, playing this game with friends is the most fun I've had in a while. We couldn't stop laughing at our silly looking bobs! Waddling around, holding a giant crate over your head, or jumping franticly in order to drag a catapult to where you want it in an effort to complete the area with your friends is so much fun.

This game really did give me the most light-hearted fun that any game has given me in a long time. My stomach hurt from laughing and I almost cried once or twice. Me and my friends might've blazed through the game in a day, (Eight or so hours) but I believe it was completely worth it."
29141,A fun game for friends! It's a little short but it's also hilarious. Laughter is medicine.
29142,"This game is absolutely amazing hell a fun perfect use of physics into a third person funny puzzle game.
the only downside is lack of maps hopefully with new patches there will be more maps and who knows if the game grows in memebers people will start making more custom maps."
29143,I'm angry
29144,Got strangled by my fellow humans and thrown off a cliff. 10/10 would play again.
29145,"Human: Fall Flat is a physics based silly game about a ragdoll named bob. Your goal as bob is to complete puzzles and/or break the rules any way you want to finish level after level. There are 8 levels in Human: Fall Flat. I can assure you, no matter how many times you complete them and play them over again, it will NEVER get old!! Dont get me wrong though, Human: Fall Flat has its issues. Most of them lie within the mulitplayer of this game. Usually, if you join a server in Human: Fall Flat that you are not hosting, you will experience SERIOUS latnecy issues. Im talkin like 30 seconds to 1 minute of a delay. This can not only be annoying to deal with, but it basically makes the game unplayble. Manily because timing is everything in this game, weather your solving the puzzles or not, it sitll makes the game unplayble. Anyway, despite its issues, if you host the server and your friend is close to you (like maybe the closest 3 states) you should be fine. And let me tell ya, this game is even better with friends to play with!! In the end Human: Fall Flat is a must have in any pc gamers libary due to its unique puzzle solving, and gameplay over all. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who has 15 bucks in their pocket."

UPDATE:
Has Online Workshop support now, meaning you can play other people's creations. 
If there is a sale, it's a steal! [b]GET IT![/b]

The physics, the cute models, the coop, paired up with the feeling of completing a level is awesome."
29147,Hell yeah it's fun!
29148,"You play as an average BOB and must traverse different places with only your hands and legs; Each challenge you solve only leads to something much more difficult. 


A very quaint and simple experience; A puzzle solver about the struggles of life and the work into overcoming it. The intuitive challenges set before you will give a short yet enjoyable experience of accomplishment.

NEEDS MORE MAPS and maybe an easy way to build your own"
29153,"Bu incelemeyi yazmak için erken olduğunu düşünmüyorum. Yanınızda bir arkadaşınız varsa ve biraz da aklınız varsa çok çabuk ilerlersiniz.

Oyunun grafikleri çok tatlış. Küçük penguenlerinizi (benim deyimimle) istediğiniz gibi giydirip paytak paytak oradan oraya atlayabilirsiniz. Oyunun arka fonunda çalan saçma müziği hiç beğenmedim. Onun yerine arkada fonda 2pac veya eminem dinlemek daha zevkli açıkçası.

Oynanış açıkçası çok basit diyebilirim. Sol click ile sol kol, sağ click ile sağ kolu haraket ettirebilirsiniz. Zaten bunu oyunun en başında size çok rahat bir şekilde öğreniyorsunuz. Dinamiklerden bahsedecek olursak bu konuda biraz kanser diyebilirim çünkü karakterinizi istediğiniz kadar ileri veya geri götüremiyorsunuz. Ayaklarınız normal bir şekilde haraket ederken belinizin üst kısımları sıvı kadar akışkan bir şekilde haraket ediyor. Ancak bu kanser haraketler sizi güldürebilecek potansiyele sahip. 2-3 arkadaşınız varsa (mümkünse aklı olsun 70iq altında olursa olmaz) bölümleri çok rahat bir şekilde geçebilirsiniz. (Buraya kadar okudun beğenirsin umarım ;*)

İndirmdeyken alınabilecek, arkadaşlarınız 3iq değilse güzel vakit geçirebileceğiniz tatlış bir oyun.

29154,MORE LEVELS!!!!!!!!!
29155,A blast playing with a friend
29156,Amazing and fun little game. Having a community workshop would really kick this off massively. Really fun to play with friends. Pls.
29157,"The game is fun to play on your first playthrough, playing normal. You might even get a second playthrough's worth if you try to break the movement system (which you should try to do because its incredibly satisfying), but afterwards its just dead weight in your steam inventory with 10-15 hours played, only to be played by people who havent played it yet or for children to be entertained. I recommend this game, but only if it were on sale, because $15 isn't a great prive for 10-15 hours of fun."
29158,"Fun game with friends. 
Needs updates and more puzzles (Steam workshop would be good) 
But it's a good amount of enjoyment."
29159,fun game when you dont have a dumbass on your team who constantly messes up the level
29160,"A very fun multiplayer puzzle game where you drag, cling & swing your way through the levels.

Bring along some friends to throw off the edge or get through the puzzles by manipulating the physics."
29161,"TL;DR - tried to climb some stairs... accidentally got my friend in a headlock and threw him in a lake. - Tried to pick up a stick... accidentally grabbed my friends leg and dragged us both off a cliff.

Hilarious game, highly recommend as a co-op game. Singleplayer is nowhere near as entertaining."
29162,"It's a fun little co-up game that let's you mess about in various small worlds which all have their own interactive themes and puzzle solving elements. 
Though it is possible to play by yourself most fun is to be had with friends, be it to complete tasks together or just troll eachother.

The Controls are intuitive but can be quite tricky to master, and even if you do get the hang of it it never feels like you're in full control of your actions, but that is as intended because it adds to the fun. This game is not about who gets to the end first or who is the best at something, it's about, again, having fun with friends in the playground you just got dropped in, literally. And the more friends the merrier.

I'm not sure if it's worth it at full price, but it's definitly worth getting if you're looking for something to play with your friends or others. So probably wait 'till it's on sale, which is often. I recently bought the four-pack via Green Man Gaming for about €13,- ($16 US) , which was a pretty good deal."
29163,good game
29164,"The trailers look pretty funny, but I couldn't get past the HORRIBLE controls. It's like trying to walk a dog that has never been on a leash. Took the refund after about an hour of this crap."
29165,"Get this, make your friends get it, get it for your friends, whatever, just make sure you and your friends get this game. It's an incredibly fun, quirky, short co-op puzzle game that is serious fun."
29166,"This game is wonderful. Ever since the recent update, my friend and I have been torturing the physics engine and attempting to solve puzzles in the worst possible - and occasionally impossible - ways. It is true that this game has great replayability for creative solutions, but it does get dry after the rhird or fourth time through the maps. I would love to see more maps, or alternatively a map creator and steam workshop support. It would be a great way to add a practically infinite number of levels for all to enjoy."
29167,This is the FUNNIEST game I have ever played. 100% woth the cost!
29168,"excellent puzzle game, simple gameplay, with very thought out mechanics, definitely worth the money"
29169,"Pros:
Fun
Customizeable characters (they thicc too)
Fun with friends
Can throw people off the edge
Can throw any object off the edge
Cons: 
Very little content (need more maps or steam workshop maps)

id give it a thicc/8.5

"
29170,Gets boring really fast.
29171,"nice game to play with friends, ONLY 3 BUCKS ON G2A don't buy for 15 not worth it. for 3 it is tho"
29172,"Great game, tons of fun. Make sure you play with friends!"
29173,"The game has a very simple concept. Get from A to B, solving puzzles and working together along the way. The simplicity in itself is something I appreciate, there's no hidden trophies, severe punishment for failure or any micro-transactions.
The physics are simple, as are graphics, as there isn't really any need for them to be anything other than that. It's a functional, self-explanatory environment.
There is a rather cute 'character creator' allowing you to paint regions or free-draw on the character's model.

Some puzzles aren't always obvious at first glance and there are multiple ways of solving it, the one that succeeds depends on how patient and tenacious you are.
The controls are simple and easy to get the grips of, excuse the pun.

Perhaps the downside of the game, at least as far as I can see, is the lack of 'levels' overall.
Quickly completing the levels there was little left to do other than drag along a friend. Once their run was over, drag in another... it all got rather boring and even a little frustrating when those friends couldn't see the solution to the puzzle, which was all the more obvious to me having completed the same thing multiple times already.

Something I've seen suggested many times, and now agree with, is some form of level creator incorporated in the existing game (or as a different application). This allowing users to create new levels for their friends or others around the world into a workshop where they can easily download the map and have more adventures. Not only would it bring back a lot of existing players but new ones too perhaps.

Understandably there will likely be a level of 'trolling' with this however, maps with rude words and creations or ones that simply cannot be solved. It would be up to a team, or just the general Steam public, to test these maps and either remove, report or review them appropriately."
29174,"This game is soo good.Easy to play, Multiple way to solve puzzles and soo much fun to do it all.The achievements are fun to get.It would be better if there was a workshop for the game."
29175,"It's a really fun game, but extra fun with friends. :)"
29176,"funniest game when played with friends.
10/10 would fall flat again.
(pls add more levels or an editor)"
29177,"I would absolutely recommend this game! Super fun to play multiplayer, laughing fits occur everytime we log on. My one and only complaint is that there are a limited number of levels. With that being said, I've played through each level at least a few times at this point and still find something new to interact with each time :)"
29178,"Me and my friend discovered a glitch on the third to last level and used it to beat the last 3 levels in 5 minutes. We did go back and beat them legitimately however. Great puzzzles, but please play this game with friends. What is this game without a little anger and yelling."
29179,This is an amazing game however wish there were more levels to play
29180,"Fun physics game, needs more levels though."
29181,"This game is a legend, i had really much fun in this game when i played it with my friends, we've been playing this game for long, but the game is not making new maps, so its nothing to do more in this game, i think the best way to revive the game is to add Steam Workshop, so people can create maps for this game, so we can continue playing this game
10 Backflips /10!"
29182,"Needs more levels and for online it needs a system in which you can progress to the next level, instead of having to go back to the waiting room to manually go to the next one.  Also a couple of levels that are online exclusive that require 2 or more playrers to solve puzzles.  None-the-less still a great game."
29183,"This game is so goofy i love it. From the customization of making a guy wear a swat helmet that about to go swin at the beach with heels on. The levels are smart and fun, i really like the water one. it is so much fun me and my mate took a long time. but we did it, honestly the game is fun, maybe not worth 15 dollars but i think if the game had some more attention and had a few maps or some event ones then its a 10 outta 10 but right now theres about 10 ish hours of game play and 20 meme hours if ya know whadda mean. 

Conclusion/Summary
I bought it on the chirstmas sale for 5 bucks, i would do 10 but 15 is a bit much, a little more attention then i would, great game with mates, 4 - 6 at most."
29184,"Man oh man I haven't laughed so hard at a game in some time.

love it 9/10"
29185,"I don't write many reviews, but felt I had to for this game.
I'm a fan of physics based puzzlers, but so far in my experience the 2D games tend to do it better.

HFF is the exception.

The levels range from easy to infuriating, but I never found a case of not knowing what to do (great level design). Achieving it, at times, was a different matter!

Got it on sale and got 9 hrs out of it first play through, which I don't think is bad at all, but it does leave you wanting more.
As many others have said, more levels & Steam Workshop would both be great additions if possible.

Thoroughly recommended.

NB. I don't do multiplayer so I'm basing this on Single player only."
29186,Good game but needs more maps
29187,great game however little to no replay value so pick up on sale
29188,"When you get used to the physics, alot of things fall into place and it becomes very fun - although the complete open-endedness of some of the puzzles meant you can get frustrated and just climb your way over an obstacle. 

There was a significant disconnect at one point later on where I almost gave up trying to figure out what was I was meant to be doing (becuase if its not clear, you're fecked!).   I 'think' I skipped two thirds of the last level by semi-accident."
29189,"this game is the BESSSSSST ever

29190,"Great game to play with pals, whether you're taking it more serious and going for achievements or just looking for a laugh, definitely gonna have a good time."

29193,"This game is really fun! 
I did not expect it to run on my potato but excellent performance for me a bit laggy sometimes
The mechanics of this game make me come back to play again again.
I highly recommend this game to those looking to play with friends on a very silly puzzle based game."
29194,Nope
29195,funny and stimulating. though I did grow tired of it
29196,"Fun game, not worth to get for the full price though. Way too few levels come with it from the start. They finally added a workshop and hopefully there will be some more good levels soon."
29197,FUN FOR 5 MIN
29198,its a very good puzzel game so yeah
29199,is very funny make me heehee til i peepee my pants

29206,"A fun little game to play with friends, the puzzles are pretty simple yet still challenging. Recommend to play with friends."
29207,"I WILL RECOMMEND THIS GAME ONCE

1. They add an easily accessible level building system
2. They impliment the workshop on steam

It's a fun game and I got 2 4-packs for me and my friends, but after 1 play through there is no want from anyone to play anymore, which is completely understandable.  They either need to make a bunch of levels themselves, or open up a map builder and workshop THROUGH STEAM.  

I really want to recommend this game, it is enjoyable and charming on the first 1-2 playthroughs, but the lack of content and updates mixed with a low replayability factor leaves me wanting more.  Again, the easiest fix for the Devs would be a workshop system, thenthe fans could make levels and do the work for them happily.

Edit- They added steam workshop finally.  Well done."
29208,I've enjoyed being raped by my friend
29209,I've enjoyed raping my friend.
29210,Just a weird fun game to play with friends
29211,))))
29212,"If the game was designed to be infuriating or just to troll people with missions that are impossible, 10/10.
If it's meant to be an actual, playable game, you'd have more of an enjoyable time deepthroating a live chainsaw."
29213,"Find this game very funny when with friends or even alone.
Could do with a new update making levels longer and more enjoyable and even an update that would add 1v1 arenas (like in gang beasts) and a fighting mode etc.

That's my thoughts. Great game."
29214,"- Gave my Bob a pedo-stache

29216,Very swell.
29217,great game to play with friends
29218,"A few bugs here and there, but nothing that breaks the fun. Truly an amazing adventure, you can do anything you set your mind to, there is no rules, but it's still challenging."
29219,"This game is amazing! Even when the level got longer and the puzzles got harder, I did not stop. I found ways to complete them and is more fun when I'm playing with my friend."
29220,funniest game i ever played! love it you can make any  character you want!
29221,"A silly, fun game to play with friends.  It's quite short in terms on levels but nonetheless I've managed to put 6 hours into it. Well worth every penny."
29222,"This was a game i thought id never own. Human Fall Flat is like Mirrors Edge with Skate 3 without the skateboard. So it has parkour and its hilarious. Best combinations ever concieved. The level design is top notch, and the puzzles along with it. No puzzle in these games were a bit tough due to the controls. This game is great, and better with buddies."
29223,"Pretty fun with friends, online can be laggy and some people are annoying but yeah i recommend it for some hours of fun."
29224,I don't have friends to play this game with.
29225,It's ok.
29226,Super fun to play with a friend.
29227,basically  me and my friend  dicking around trying to screw each other over
29228,"Very fun, but only if you have friends to play it with. Puzzles are interactive but not super challenging. level are well designed, and overall a good game to have fun with."
29229,"i bought this game because i wanted to fix my relationship with my friend. im willing to buy it for her.
i ask her to play together and she accept it if i can find another person to play,
(that's the problem) nobody else we know willing to play with us, then she reject it eventually.
because i already bought it i refund it right after that.
i hope to fix relationship with my friend using this game. but maybe i was stupid to think about it.

this is good game, but playing it alone is misery.
ill buy it again if she can forgive me (not gonna happen i think).

but yeah worth waiting!"
29230,fun but sucks without friends to mess around with them and should have more levels
29231,"This was honesty one of my favourite indie games I have ever played. The physics and challenges make it really enjoyable and the pace is never slowed as if you get stuck a tape will drop to the floor.

 What makes this game so great is the creativity that is apparent in every aspect of the game- from the music to the level design not a single stone is out of place.

-multiplayer-
The support for multiplayer is well added and although I enjoyed singleplayer thoroughly, doing the tasks with a friend ensured chaos would ensue soon after (I am pretty sure we broke some of the puzzles with our crazy scheming). 

My only issue is that it is only about 4-5 hours of gameplay with little replayability. So I would have to go with the rest of the community and ask for either more levels or community created (workshop support maybe?)

10/10
- loved it! Definately worth the full price if you like strategy games. 
Fun on own, Crazy with friends! ;b"
29232,"7/10. Absoulte retard fun with friends. If you have no friends, then don't buy this."
29233,Very fun game with someone
29234,IT is very fun check it out!
29235,"good game
"
29236,Really funny with friends but also the puzzles can be a bit of a bitch at times
29237,"Love this game it is hillarious
"
29238,"As a single player game this is pretty fun - its quirky with some good puzzles that can be solved in many different ways.  The controls take at least 3-4 maps to really get the hang of on the PC, but its worth it.

Where this game REALLY shines is when playing with others.  The interactions of the characters are absolutely hilarious.  And if you use VOP to chat during gaming it makes it even better.

A solid 2 thumbs up on this game."
29239,The only game that made me shed tears with my friends.
29240,还不错
29241,Love this game! Wish there were more levels and content!
29242,good game would recommend
29243,"Grab a friend by the leg then jump, climb and ragdoll some fun"
29244,"It's fun for the first couple of hours.
but then puzzles start becoming repetitive, and after you beat the game once, it's just a game you'll never touch in your library again.

and it's only fun if you have a friend to play with, playing solo is just a waste of your time"
29245,Great fun. :D
29246,"My reason for purchasing this game was a bit biased, seeing as I saw it as a game on Play Pals. Looking at it from a non-biased angle, it seemed pretty simple and childish but like a fun was to pass the time. 

I'd like to point out that it was NOT the case. This game, while it looks cute, was actually a huge challenge. The mechanics are very loose which makes doing even the most mundane of tasks annoyingly difficult. 

And to be frank, I'm a rage quitter. There were points where I had to step away from the computer, reevaluate myself, then come back to it. Worst part is, at the time of writing this review, I don't even have a full hour's worth of gameplay. 

Maybe I'm just not that great. But regardless, the game is fun, quirky, and actually really entertaining. 10/10."
29247,"Super fun game, definitely worth its price."
29248,"i absolutely love this game but it needs more levels
it would be great if it had a steam workshop with levels"
29249,Update your game.
29250,"This fun little puzzle game is best when played with friends. I feel playing solo would be difficult and most of the fun and enjoyment is laughing and working with friends to beat the puzzles. One of the biggest laughs came from being able to do the Harambe and running around waving our arms in the air. Without friends, this game is a 7/10. When you add the comentary you and your friends will add and the quality time you can spend while beating this game, the game is a 10/10 for certain."
29251,so much fun with friends :)
29252,this game is trash if you play this your ugly
29253,"One of the best Coop puzzle games I've played specially with friends cuz its funny af XD, 10/10 absolutely worth it."
29254,boring game
29255,"This game was worth the money I paid at the time. It's very fun, and the physics in this game will just make you laugh out loud. Human: Fall Flat is probably the most fun game I've ever gotten on steam. Btw I was introduced to this game from the youtuber Aphmau, you should go check her channel out."
29256,my hand stuck in fucking wall
29257,If you playing this game with  friends  it will  be   funniest game  ever.
29258,IS FUNNY
29259,I Just Say 100% Recommended ♥
29260,Fun game to play with friend ^^
29261,GUCCI
29262,"When I first got this 'game' I thought it was a daft sandbox game where you messed around and killed yourself in daft ways (I don't know why).  Since playing the game to completion in co-op with my 6yr old, I can whole-heartedly recommend this game. The puzzles and control mechanics are very good. Fun game."
29263,"Half the time i fixed the puzzel by skiping 4. Had no idea that wasent the right solution. So i kinde did that for every map after that. Seems kinde strange it's easier to get out of the map confinments then to do a puzzel.

And how is the game if you would do the puzzels? Well, the puzzels are pretty easy to figure out. But the controles are so cluncky you can hardly do them. If you like bad controles play some B games on the NES. Because thats how this feels. Just made pretty."
29264,My kids and I love this game. It's a good time if you wanna just sit around and mess with fun physics and goofy levels
29265,"Good game, best in multiplayer. Ragdoll jumping and glitching this game is real fun."
29266,ok solo but great mulitplayer
29267,I like this game
29268,nice
29269,"Super fun game. online mode even more fun.
a bit short at the moment, 

In online mode it needs a better/easyer way to Kick/Ban people. a way they tell you who is who. 
some people seem to wanna be a problem more then solve it, other people running of the map just to end it strait away. 

beside that i would give it 4/5 raiting because it is a bit short."
29270,good game
29271,"Played the game alone and while it was fun for a little bit, I didn't play too much.

After playing with a friend in co-op, I realized just how fun and genius this game is.
The whole time we played, we felt like we were not doing the right thing or going the right way...but we were!

My only complaint is that this game is quite short but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a fun co-op game"
29272,.
29273,"The game physics Is extremely fun to play around with, you can also cheat almost every map by climbing over walls, jumping around them and climbing other people. I also love that you can litterally grab other players and throw them into the void. The only downside to the game Is that It has very, I mean very short gameplay, that Is exactly why the workshop exists, to save the game from dying. Another thing i absolutely adore with this game is that you can change your character almost exactly how you want It with the webcam and painting feature added to the game."
29274,Too easy if you mastered the skill of climbing.
29275,This game is incredible. It will make your stomach hurt from endless hours of laughing. The levels are engaging and fun to work through solo or with friends. Even after completing the game and unlocking all achivements it still is a lot of fun to play around in and learn new things. A must buy for anyone who enjoys co-op games! You won't regret it!
29276,The game is awesome but can you add some more level/stages please.
29277,"Lovely game to play with friends. With the upcoming user made levels it's going to be very replayable.

Edit:
Sadly, dropped Linux support. So no upcoming user made levels for the penguins.

Can't recommend it anymore."
29278,Not enough content for 12 squid
29279,It is AMAZING
29280,Short circuit is the funniest thing there is
29281,asdasd
29282,"It isn't worth the 15, for 5-6 levels with a small range of customization. While that being said I did enjoy the game, overall. It was hilarious to play with my goof ball friends, throwing them all, slamming faces against metal objects for a funny noise, secrets, etc. 
Lets hope they lower the price, or add something to the game that will make it worth it."
29283,Super fun & silly game to have a good laugh with your friends. Add steam workshop!
29284,nice
29285,kkkit's so funny!
29286,Really funny puzzle game great physics and hilarious drunken avatars.

29289,"This game is better suited to play with friends. I always have a blast playing this game with them. There's a good amount of maps to play through, but even if you finish those plenty of people make workshop maps that are just as good. If you don't have anyone to play with you can join random multiplayer lobbies but it isn't as fun as with friends. 
Worth the $15."
29290,Honestly just bought for the steam link bundle then launched it and had a ton of fun.
29291,"good game 10/10
got smashed by a boulder but you guys really need to make a workshop for custom maps because once you are done it doesn't really get funny and when you do everything on the whole entire game it just gets boring after that"
29292,Absolutely a blast to play with friends. But it really does need more levels.
29293,I died i rate this meme 10/12343
29294,"Human Fall Flat is a fun little puzzler with plenty of hilarity in its scenarios. The levels feel like playgrounds where you could do whatever you want. With the ability to play this alone or co-op, plenty of ways are out there to create chaos and fun.
I definitely recommend it. The game have got so many hilarous things (especially charecters typing and fun moments with your friends) in it, and there are so many ways to solve a puzzle in the game. Actually if u think different, u don not have to solve most of the puzzles. There is always a funnier adnd crazier way to complete the level.
Enjoy!!  :p"
29295,"I'm finishing community tasks, but I do like this game."
29296,"this game is TO FUNNY!, i played it with my friends and i was dying of laughter!"
29297,"Fun just fun 
"
29298,If you have a gay friend you'll have a great time.
29299,Too good to write a review. Recommended playing with friends.
29300,"There are so many ways to complete the puzzles in this game, absolutely amazing. This game has ten buttloads of potential, but needs more content. Don't get me wrong, it's still an amazing game."
29301,A ton of fun but extremely short. Still recommend
29302,Realy Fun :))))) #Best_Game
29303,A great little game with a gang beast style control over a customizable character. The multiplayer update is a wonderful addition to this game and can really test just how much you are friends with the people you're playing with.
29304,"Super stupid game (but in an awesome way). It was good by myself, and even better with friends. The levels are well thought out and make you think about what you have to do. Overall it's just a good game. I made a let's play of the game. If you want a better idea of it before you buy, then I'll put a link to it down below. Have a great day.

29312,"Constant camera stutter, not performance related"
29313,"Not bad...
Very funny gameplay"
29314,Much fun
29315,the most random game ever made which makes it the greatest game ever made
29316,"I honestly thought the game was very nice, it has a nice and warm atmosphere with as me being a person liking action, loved the game and had a fun time playing it with my friend and etc. Game has a okay amount of levels getting really hard into the game but fun and becoming a true puzzle.I enjoy the simple cartoonish graphics that I think most computers would run very well without any struggle. Up to 8 player coop so very nice touches. Make sure you have a oxygen tank near you I ran out of breath laughing.

Note for you developers,
                  Developers really nice job with the game love your work so far if you can please add some additional levels in the near future adds a nice touch to the short but fun series of levels. Maybe a steam workshop, guarentee that the whole community will make some fun levels for the rest to try out. Keep it going.

Final score 9.1/10

Must get :)"

29326,Fun to play.
29327,"5.5/10

A friend turned me on to this game once the developers modified the game to include online multiplayer. It’s a 3D puzzler, in which both you and your partner play as “Bobs,” these fully customizable humanoid-looking toddlers. Just like actual toddlers, these fellas can take a beating, only succumbing to infinite falls through space and drowning.

However, your Bob also moves and controls like a toddler, which can get a little frustrating when you’re trying to work towards a solution. In playing with a controller, each of your arms is activated by a trigger, left for left and right for right. Holding the trigger will cause your Bob to grab whatever his arm is currently touching. However, because of the behind-the-back view, it’s often not very obvious what you’re grabbing. During the “water” level, I repeatedly grabbed a post instead of grabbing the chain I wanted, to the point of absurdity. I often grabbed the ground instead of whatever item I wanted to pick up. Sometimes Bob gets one of his arms caught behind his head, and you’ll need to do that dance you’ve seen toddlers do when they’re trying to get in or out of a tight t-shirt. Lastly, your Bob will often add an extra bounce after jumping from platform to platform, which can make it difficult to land precision jumps. You'll do a lot of climbing, and this works fairly well. To optimize your climbing ability, you'll need to run around with both of your arms pointing straight up in the air.

The physics-based puzzling can be both awesome and frustrating in equal measure. On the “water” level, you’ll go from attempting to paddle this nigh-impossible boat using oars to then feeling awesome using a raft with a partner on the sail and a partner on the rudder. The most ridiculous thing the game asks you to do (in my opinion) is use a hook-shaped pole to latch on to a horizontal beam before swinging across. After failing this section over and over, my co-op partner was finally able to make it happen. He hit a checkpoint, and I jumped off into space to spawn across the gap.

The game is mostly bug-free, which is likely an achievement for a title of this nature. However, my co-op partner bugged out on a couple of occasions and had to quit and rejoin the game.

Human: Fall Flat was clever (I especially liked the electricity level), but both my co-op partner and I felt like we couldn't have taken much more of it upon completing the game. It typically didn't require too much thought to figure out the solution to each puzzle. However, once you figure out the solution, the challenge is actually getting your character to do what you want him to do. I guess I might've preferred more difficult puzzles and better-controlling characters."
29328,Really good game super fun also adventurous and you'll probably meet new friends.
29329,"after the basic tutorial i got dropped off in an abandoned train yard (literally). there i found a lantern which formorly guided the downed train engine. thinking to hard i started piling rubble to scale walls and other train cars. as i was gathering more rubble i found a door which lead into a darkened hallway. grabbing my new found lantern a traveresed this dungeon keeping to the basic rules of navigating mazes (stick to the left wall) i finally came upon a box. a box of all things. I was so excited to have found it this meager box and began dragging it out of the maze. I used this box to get me to scale the walls of the trainyard. later i would find that i could have just pushed the train cars out of my way, but i was armed with box and lantern in hand i cared not. scaling the walls i would have to eventually leave behind my box and the lantern was to cumbersome for me to scale the walls properly. 

i was never so excited to get a basic box"
29330,"Started out enjoying the game thinking there would be some good puzzles. Alas by the time I got half-way through the Castle level I was hating it. Trying to get my drunk lump of putty  to do jump after  jump. Guess I fell flat once too often.
There were some good parts but the repetitve jump, swing , jump, swing finished it for me.
Saying that however and as much as I hate it i still have to recommend it. 
"
29331,Just Fun.
29332,Pretty neet game...was able to recreate stalin so all is good
29333,"Just finished this game and oh what a great time I had, I played this with two other friends and they both had equally as much fun as I did. Although the game seemed short, I would be very happy to see new content updates with further levels as well as perhaps something like player created maps, that would make this game even better. But all in all, I would highly recommend this game."
29334,Great game to play with your SO relatively short though beat the game in under 8 hours
29335,It's very fun
29336,"Great game, tons of fun to play would recommend."
29337,I'm a human so i must like it!
29338,"enjoyable some bugs on the multiplayer mainly the spawn point one where one of you is sacraficed lol but saving them is part of the fun, me and my daugher are having some great laughs with this game it's silly and fun with a good grasp on the physics system well worth the money 
"
29339,"TONS OF FUN WHIT FRIENDS

10/10"
29340,"So much fun.  A real blast with a few friends.  No enough levels sadly, but the kids love it!!  Hence the hours."
29341,gay
29342,"This game started out well as I laughed from the drunk pillsbury doughboy and silly videos.  The climbing aspect in this game is AWFUL!  Never have I had a game where climbing is so painful and repetitive.  Solving the puzzles are easy.  Getting the drunk guy to do what you want is the challenge.  Also, puzzles are a bit of a rip off from Portal.  I was really hoping for a great puzzle game like Portal and this is not it.  Maybe my opinon will change after playing more, but so far I am not impressed."
29343,"I like this game, the physics and puzzles are just amazing, one drawback is that its short and can be finished in 2 to 3 days , but i totally recommend this game 9 out of 10 from me 👌
"
29344,I like it
29345,This is a Hilarious puzzle in wich i couldn't stoped laughing cause of the wonky stile of the animation and the general mechanics of the game. must buy for a Couch party. (get it on sale tho)
29346,This game was so fun with 4 friends that I went back and replayed it later with different friends. This is cheaper than a movie and totally awesome.
29347,"Its really funny physics game to play with your friends. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this game. But its too small and not have enough levels to play. Devs must add some more levels. Overall, this game is good enough for everyone who loves funny adventure type games."
29348,"It caused a ridiculous level of motion sickness to me. Changing camera FOV and smoothness didn't help. I never felt motion sickness in other 3D games. Maybe I'm the only one experiencing this problem, but I can't recommend this game.

Edit: I changed my mind. Playing in windowed mode rather than fullscreen worked for me and it's pretty fun."
29349,"Pretty good game, the only thing I don't like about it is that if you want to use both hands at the same time, you'll need an actually mouse, not jus the mouse pad that comes with laptops."
29350,"Midway through the game, i experienced an anomoly. I felt like I was getting watched in real life. Anyone who buys this game during the 7 dollar sale. It is not a good idea, you will most likely feel the same as me. It all started when me and my buddy were able to float, than the game was in slowmo. Soon after that I was disconnected from discord. Buy at your own risk."
29351,"Fun to play with friends!
Had a blast playing :D"
29352,"can look like a special dog by grabbing the ground and looking straight up.
also has some goofin' physics.
10/10"
29353,really good :)
29354,"Absolutely amazing game!  Would definitely recommend playing with friends...hilarious situations will have you on the floor due to interactions while ""helping"" your teammates.  There's no limit to the shenanigans.  Makes for some amazing screenshots and videos of you and your friends. Highly recommended!"
29355,"Ruined by lack of save points.

I'm done with this crop of difficult games that are then made artificially harder by staggering the save points such that you have to a lot of redundant busywork if you have to retry a particularly hard section. At some point a game has to be fun.

I got the castle level, which is both tedious and hard.  After having to restart more times than I can count, I'm done.

Do yourself a favour and don't even get into it. There are some good moments but they are really not worth it."
29356,Amazing game. Creates scenarios that leave you rolling with laughter. Best played with 2 or more friends. Highly recommend!
29357,"Boring and frustrating
Wants to be a platformer, but with the mushiest and shittiest controls possible.

Finishing a level isn't a sense of accomplishment as much as a ""THANK GOD THAT'S OVER!""

My playtime is what it is because of Steams asinine return policy.
Either way, I bought it because I thought it was going to be fun, and it ended up being frustrating and boring with controls sloppier than Tomi Lahren."
29358,great game
29359,10/10 would hold my friends hand again.
29360,"This game may really piss you off, but you still won't be able to stop playing it.

10/10 would scream endless strings of profanities at blob boy again"
29361,like qwop but with precision platforming
29362,commended and you'll really enjoy playing this with your friends.
29363,Art in fart form
29364,Very fun. TRY IT ! Workshop in this and we have endless hours gameplay.
29365,"Much more thatn i had first anticipated!
Very Fun with friends!"
29366,"This game is awesome, funny and great to play with friends. 9/10"
29367,ez
29368,"if you like struggling in real life, you'll enjoy this game as you'll only find yourself struggling more."
29369,Really boring.
29370,"Funny Game to play with your friends
I recommend it to everyone"
29371,amazing
29372,Would be a great game if it supports Steam Workshop.
29373,i smell like beef
29374,it sucks >:(
29375,"It's a funny game, but the control is very hard, like Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. I met a bug in the game that I can fly when repeatly jumping. Besides these, the game is great. The BGM is wonderful, it's a pity that it isn't played frequently."
29376,"Pretty fun game, has a really nice physics engine, which is to be expected for a ragdoll **physics** game; has tons of puzzles which can be fun, or you can just say ""fuck it"" and jump over ledges to progress, all around it's pretty interesting in single player, but the fun of the game is especially highlighted in the multiplayer, being able to throw your friends around, or just stare at em' all around pretty fun. Needless to say, the game offers some cool customization stuff, y'know if you're into that (like using a webcam so you can get a low quality image of your face on your chest)"
29377,Very fun to play with your friends. They should add workshop maps for more maps to play.
29378,this game presented me with the oppotunity to grab fef's dick
29379,OK so get alot of patience and a couple friends to play with becuase this game is tough and annoying but can be a bit of fun.
29380,"They should add steam workshop with maps, so you can have more variety."
29381,"I really enjoyed this game and i still do, It has such creative level design and soooo many secrets. my favourate thing about this game is you can play it through again and again and again, finding more stuff. Even better, there are no invisible walls and you can break the game in so many ways."
29382,a little too gay for my likings
29383,"This game is hilarious, throw your friends off the edge. Ignore the map."
29384,Very fun and enjoyable game with freinds. Always makes laughs and smiles.
29385,spend a half hour throwing eachother off the map and refusing to let eachother progress
29386,If you like to a Human And you Fall flat often this is the game for you! Fun Puzzle Adventure to go throw your friend off any surface 10/10 would throw again!
29387,"This is a very unique, funny, and strategical game. I enjoy this game, and I hope the developers create more levels of the awesome game! :DDD"
29388,"There needs to be a way to have your friend let go when they grab hold of you.  90% of the game, it's my friend and I dragging each other off the cliff."
29389,"The game is a lot of fun with friends and had a lot of potential. However the game has a huge lack of content, there is no community level creator, and the infrequent updates from the devs mean i cant recomend this game.


EDIT: They added Workshop! I can now change this review to positive"
29390,"Super fun! I can recommend this to everyone. Although you might play to solve all the puzzles, if you endup playing with a friend you just turn this to Gang Beasts. Cool game tho!"
29391,I think it is a very creative game it has lots of stuff to do but it needs a community workshop because it has very limited maps
29392,"muy bueno el cuestion de peso 2k18, lo voy a comprar 4 vecez por las dudas. 10/10 umbilabe"
29393,I am so inlove with this game but I wish the developers would CREATE and ADD MORE MAPS... it gets really boring to just do things over and over again... if there are any other maps please let me know... my friends and I would love to play this game again and again and again
29394,Very entertaining when your friends are online!
29395,"To  be honest, I enjoyed this game. I play it often and it's very entertaining. The glitches even can be hilarious. The only thing I don't like about this game is simply the community, which is not the game creator's fault. People are impatient and often immature online, but there are still some nice people."
29396,"Fun game overall, takes around 5 hours to play it through with a friend with rom for some screwing around time.

However, no workshop support and too few official levels at this time."
29397,"This is SUCH A FUN GAME! I mean, gather your friends and run around doing weird stuff. I’m surprised this game was created in Unity when we completed the game. It made a lot of sense of how the mechanics worked out with everything. I wasn’t surprised how close the mechanics were from ‘updated version’ of Gang Beast.

There aren’t much currently in this game. A few levels to go through and solve. If you play solo, everything is a challenge. With friends, your life is 20x easier. For example: One person can let their friends through a gate then complete the rest of the levels. Your way, choose how you want to complete the level.

If you have friends, get this game with them and have a blast.

"
29398,fun although can turn sexual really fast
29399,uganda skin is awesome it makes the game
29400,laggy
29401,This game is a lot of fun with your friends if you don't get stuck somewhere in the stage which doesn't happen often. I hope they make more levels.
29402,"Played through the entire game once, and it was incredible. The only improvement that could be made is obviously more content (only because all good puzzle games are inevitably too short), and more workshop tools would be fantastic. 

Important to note, I am nowhere near done with this game, there are so many different ways to approach these puzzles.

What I did, and what I highly recommend: get this game with one of your buddies and co-op it together. I think that was the absolute best way to experience it."
29403,Good game
29404,This is how I move in real life.
29405,ok
29406,"good 
"
29407,"Fun wit fren, checkpoints annyoing tho"
29408,"Do you like puzzles? Do you enjoy fourth wall breaking humor? If you do, you'll probably love this title. 

Human Fall Flat is challenging, fun, and simple. 

This title brings me back to the days when I would play a game till my fingers were sore. I found myself grasping my controller tightly as if that would keep my avatar from falling from a ledge. 

The level design is wonderful and varied. The developer has really done a great job including jokes and gotcha moments that set the tone for a game where you feel like you're interacting with them directly in this little world.

I certainly felt like there were a few awkward moments throughout my play time. I knew what I wanted to do but I wasn't good enough at the game to do it. In some cases, the game was just not forgiving enough to allow my feeble attempts to work. These moments, like trying to smash a lock unsuccessfully dozens of times, weren't particularly damaging to my overall view of the game. 

It is everything it claims to be. Worth a look and your time."
29409,"I'm not a fan of puzzle games but this one is well-executed enough to make me like it

THE GOOD
-Very fun and satisfying to go through puzzles
-Nice atmospheric soundtrack
-Can be super funny, especially with a friend
-Kid-friendly at the earliest levels
-Each puzzle has new interesting mechanics and will make you eagerly wait for the next one
-Physics and the devices you will be using are so much fun

THE BAD
-Not sure there is much replayability

THE UGLY
-None that I can think of"
29410,"This may very well be the best co-op experience ive ever had. Its kind like 2/8 of octodad meets your friends or something.
This is our playthrough if you are interested https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbxlLThtVJ5A2GS26VxZRErYPPIV1GlzM"
29411,its funny game rly fun and yeah missons too
29412,"Very tricky controls. But also very amusing!
Do try it with friends, the puzzles makes you pass the controls around to try the best solution.
Worth every penny."
29413,"Very fun game! im a big fan of physics based games and this one is very well made and plays really nicely :D
Definately recommend this game to anyone who enjoys physics based games and puzzles!
10\10"
29414,Needs A LOT more maps. PLS
29415,"Not t\fun, without friends"
29416,this game is amazing and i'm giving it a like but if there were a public workshop thing i would talk to my friends about it and try and get them to play the game so yeah please make this game have a workshop setting
29417,Needs workshop lvs and more content
29418,"Elon Musk was thinking about JimJam Pajamas again. JimJam was a big cowardly poop with infantile left testy and slippery right testy.

Elon walked over to the window and reflected on her warm surroundings. She had always loved moist Andy loudon's father's workplace with its glorious, grim goobers. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel angry.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a big figure of JimJam Pajamas.

Elon gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was an angry, black, male vitality pills and milk drinker with black left testy and manlet right testy. Her friends saw her as an expensive, empty el diablo. Once, she had even helped a better local nursery recover from a flying accident.

But not even an angry person who had once helped a better local nursery recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what JimJam had in store today.

The rain hammered like rampaging cats, making Elon . Elon grabbed a snotty wii remote that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Elon stepped outside and JimJam came closer, she could see the fragile glint in his eye.

JimJam glared with all the wrath of 709 vey black precious pig. He said, in hushed tones, ""I hate you and I want some more twitter followers.""

Elon looked back, even more and still fingering the snotty wii remote. ""JimJam, listen we both know ur a millionaire or smth tbh so why not giv me some even a lil not much trouble ? :)),"" she replied.

They looked at each other with numb feelings, like two fair, fierce fox skinning at a very lardy anti-globalist meeting, which had baby rock music playing in the background and two binman uncles carving to the beat.

Suddenly, JimJam lunged forward and tried to punch Elon in the face. Quickly, Elon grabbed the snotty wii remote and brought it down on JimJam's skull.

JimJam's infantile left testy trembled and his slippery right testy wobbled. He looked deth, his emotions raw like a kaleidoscopic, klutzy kenny's anime fedora.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later JimJam Pajamas was dead.

Elon Musk went back inside and made herself a nice drink of male vitality pills and milk.

THE END"
29419,"If you are looking for a light-hearted game that'll make you fall on the floor laughing, then this is the game for you. Essentially, the point of the game is to solve ""puzzles"" by interacting with the environment to move on to the next level. I highly recommend to play this game with friends as it would be insanely more fun.

What I like about Human: Fall Flat
- Teamwork
- Trolling Friends
- Flimsy Character Models

I couldn't think if anything that I dislike about this game.."
29420,"Pretty good game, tight controlls but still hard enough for it to be fun."
29421,"Weird physics based movement and puzzles, with multiple ways of solving them. You are free to go anywhere you can reach. The unique style of the game results in many very funny situations, especially when playing with friends. Once the workshop gets full support, my review will probably go from ""very good"" to ""amazing""."
29422,Goes well with bong rips.
29423,we all love sand box physics game right?
29424,"Absolutely love this game. One of the most fun I've had with friends. With that being said, this game needs more content. I still recommend this game but once player created levels open to multiplayer I completely urge you to pick this up with some friends."

add more levels please"
29431,For me the best part of the game is the exploration with friends. The goofy movement was funny for the first few hours but the exploration keeps you hooked in. Not much replayability after finishing it though.
29432,i am scared of falling but this was a good fall
29433,"I can't remember for the life of me how this game ended up in my library, but I was looking for something co-op to play with a friend and saw this pop up so we gave it a go.

First off, as it stands, the game is short. Real short. A few levels of puzzles and you're pretty much done. No story or anything. Just a goofy ragdoll making his way downtown. If you're looking for a long invovlved game then at this point I would recommend moving on. 

With that said, me and my friend had a blast with this game. It's a sandbox puzzler and as the levels advance so do your available options in solutions. There's always an ""answer"" for the level, but it was usually more fun trying to do the level in any way other than the correct path. Working as a team was fun, throwing your teammate over the edge was funny, and it never really became frustrating like a lot of co-op puzzle games can be. 

We beat this a few months ago, but we both check back regularly to see if there's any new levels or an online version of the workshop just because we had such a good time with this game. 

To wrap it up, in it's current form I give the game a solid ""C"". We had a blast, the game itself is fun and runs well(I don't remember anything too game breaking at the moment). If they ever get the workshop with custom maps available to playing with friends then I can imagine a lot more hours put into this one and would definitely bump the rating up. 

If it's on sale and you are looking for a goofy way to pass a few hours with a friend, then would say pick it up. At full price right now, a little harder to recommend."
29434,"Had a really good time playing this, I can't wait until there is more content is added. I would highly recommend playing this game, in general, but with friends, it's a whole lot more fun!"
29435,its all fun and games until someone latches on ya
29436,"After getting over the fact that the game only has a handful of levels - most of which you can skip the majority of the puzzles if you are wanting to speedrun or mess with people - then you can actually get to the fun part, which is, in essense a great little sandbox ragdoll adventure with your friends!

I love that there are lots of exploits and crazy bugs. This is a wonky physics game afterall.

Once online multiplayer was introduced, you're able to meet lots of interesting people from all over the world and start your journey all over again.

I hope that online multiplayer workshop will be available in the future. This will open up a whole new level of creativity within the community and fun for Bob to explore.

Here's to hoping..."
29437,"pretty fun. controls on keyboard/mouse are laggy and take some getting used to. it reminds me A LOT of little big planet and the lego games (i've played both harry potter ones to 100%). and, like both of those games, you get REALLY frustrated playing this but it's still fun. i also love the puzzle aspect of it. i'm excited to see where this game goes in the future."
29438,"super good game, playing with mates is the best"
29439,"Yeah, pritty fun."
29440,"Although very fun with friends, currently not worth the full price for 6 hours of gameplay - in which I played very slowly. Will be worth the full price once the dev releases Steam Workshop Support!"
29441,Crashed many boats. 10/10
29442,Great with friends (might be a problem)
29443,"Wao this game is so nice, i was laughing all day with my girlfriend XD"
29444,"Not worth the full $15 because the actual game is kind of short. The puzzles seem to be made for single player so having a friend lets you just cheese them most of the time. It's fun to dick around every now and again too. Mid puzzle you just grab a friend and choke slam their ass off the stage before they can grab you back or something.

$8 on sale or something would be fitting for this game. Also, it may be better with more people but I only played it duo a couple of times. It's pretty wacky when you want it to be...or don't want it to be specifically."
29445,Human fall flat is amazing!
29446,Fun with friends
29447,ehh
29448,Very nice. Recommend!
29449,"If you like messing around, laughing and thinking for about 4 to 5 hours. it takes like 5 hours to complete but you can always do it again or play multiplayer. I enjoy this game but I would wait for a sale or dont buy it at all."
29450,"Starting off by saying, if you're looking for a laugh with a friend, this is a great little timekiller/refreshment from the stress & rage you're still trying to get over from your last PUBG match. This really is a fun, humorous little game and relatively well made. Not bad at all; just not something I would reccomend unless you have a friend to play with or like goofy gameplay on your own.

Price: 
I would pick it up on sale or in a bundle, not pay the full $15 for it. 

Controls:
Takes a minute to get used to/understand, but really not difficult. 

Gameplay:
Interesting puzzles, not too difficult at first. Amusing gameplay, really good for a laugh with a friend. Not good for long play sessions however. Needs to add workshops to keep it interesting, the devs should invest in creating a community for the game to add variety."
29451,Best game ever! :P
29452,"this banger get's even funnier with your loved ones ;D


split screen seems to act little weird with my set up tho. i hooked controller on pc and played but using controller wouldn't let me move myself proper. like, it would some what distract me from my movement so i can't properly grab stuff and move around or hang up on some where.

hope they'll fix this issue soon!"
29453,"Amazing heavy physics-based game. Allows multiple approaches to solve a problem, including some pretty skill demanding moves. You can ""break"" the game by inventing new pathways, especially with friends.

Shame there is no workshop support, because this game would live forever if we would be allowed to create new maps."
29454,"It's a wonderful game, the little blob people are so cute and you can draw on them and customize them to make them even more cute! AAAH!

The objective is to pass levels by overcoming obstacles. The obstacles include things as simple as dragging a crate to a pressure plate that opens a door, to catapulting yourself over castle walls. Playing around with the physics in the levels is always a joy, and going through it with a friend who won't stop grabbing you and throwing you off the map is even better. I hope they add workshop support soon!

Cute and funny game to play with friends, fun for the whole family."
29455,It's like Skyrim with guns.
29456,I like.
29457,"it is ok, yes?"
29458,"gud

"
29459,"Im happy with the game, it lagged a bit but was okay. I am kind of disapointed that there was no workshop as i would very much like to share some of the character designs with my friends. Please make on soon."
29460,"Fun, lots of neat levels, very fun coop"
29461,"I loved it, just it was a little laggy for my computer!"
29462,I love how you can just play this game however you like. You can pick whatever level you want and skip through the levels if you want.
29463,"really fun with friends 
10/10
add workshop"
29464,"fun, silly game to play with friends"
29465,"10/10

29466,Amazing physics but needs more levels or at least a level editor and a workshop for this to be complete.
29467,Absolutely wonderful game. Pretty much spent the whole time laughing with friends. I hope more levels are added as I can't get enough of this!
29468,o_o
29469,"This game is hilarious!
Every time I play it with my friends, we just can’t stop laughing. We’ll try to do something, and then immediately, one person is grabbing onto a ledge, another person is grabbing their foot, and another is grabbing that person’s head. We love discovering all new things and having fun while doing it. I highly recommend playing for a fun time!"
29470,gud game
29471,mmm moving clay
29472,Fun with friends
29473,"This is one of my favorite games to play with friends but I wish the developers would add more levels with harder puzzles. They say it has unlimited replay value because you can ""think outside the box"" but each map can only be played a few times before you exhaust your creativity and get bored of it. A map creator/workshop would make this game truly replayable and I think the developers would be wise to include one. They frequently update the game but its usually just with character skins and so if you're already bored of the maps there's no reason to return to them."
29474,My brain got damaged
29475,it a good game trust me but they sould add more levels if they had more levels it would be my beast game
29476,.
29477,fun game yo
29478,爬墙大法好
29479,"create ur character cuz i made big smoke, waffen ss soldier and some useless famous memes xddd
p.s cuz why not"
29480,С другом весело проходить)
29481,Good game but it needs workshop for sure! :)
29482,Nice game.
29483,"It's fun game but I suggest you to play with friends but I dont have friends
I'm ok with it"
29484,Died of laughter. Being PC gaming unfamiliar makes it even funnier.
29485,+
29486,Really great game until my SIMPLETON friends decided to pull me off the map every 5 seconds! And don't even get me started on the boat map. It took a solid hour to even pull the boat off of the shore with a bunch of monkeys dancing on it. There needs to be parental controls on this game to deal with such children! 10/10 though
29487,"A very fun and relaxing game. Also suitable for unskilled players, as most of the time you may decide the pace of the game by your own actions. I've been playing local split screen co-op with a very inexperienced player, and we've still had a blast laughing even if I lead the way all the time. Gamepad is a must."
29488,"[strike]This game *SUPPOSEDLY* has full-controller support. I have tried time and time agian, but steam controller doesn't work.[/strike]
So things have changed, and stuff has been fixed. It's honestly a really fun and enjoyable game. It's funny and easy to pick up, go buy it."
29489,"Amazing game, it's super hilarious!"
29490,"Pros:

- Cheap
- Fun and hilarious 
- friends or randoms can be an awesome adventure your first time!

Cons:

- never any new maps
- Once you play 3-4 hours, you're completely done with the games maps. thus, always a repeat of the same maps.
"
29491,"Great game, but I wish they added the ability for players to create their own content, because they few maps in the game can be limiting.

Edit: They added the ability for players to create their own content. The game have finally achieved greatness."
29492,"this is a fun game with friends.. one thing id like to add is that it only has a few levels and its been out for a while now. hoping for future content
"
29493,Add Workshop please
29494,Its so funny. I laughed too much lmao. But its a good game sooooo I recommend it.
29495,"Received this as a gift. Great fun with lots of challenging puzzles for you to solve. You have quite a bit of freedom to come up with your own creative solutions to the obstacles you will face in the game.

You can explore the level freely and goof around with your ragdoll character to your heart's content. No time limits or enemies chasing you. You just go along at your own pace. No fancy graphics really but the environments are still quite stylish. Music is very fitting.

Character movement can be a bit frustrating at times because of the way the character control works (your arms go where you look). Every now and then I find a game that triggers my motion sickness and unfortunately the camera movement in this game did it. Had to take a few breaks during my playthrough but still had tons of fun. Definitely a game I can recommend."
29496,I love this game.  My friend bought a two pack a few days ago and we have both played it to bits in coop.  Tons of great laughs and puzzles.  The game is overall very enjoyable
29497,"DON'T BUY unless:

- steam sale < 10 $
- you like playing physic demos
- you have got friends to play with
- you like wabbly character controls
- you don't fear white CIS male puppets"
29498,"This game is a LOT of fun.  It can get frustrating at times, but it makes me feel like I'm some sort of parkour master and I love playing it with my 9 year old daughter."
29499,i whas in love with this game but somehow it would not open or even start so i whas sad to refund the game :(
29500,a fucking masterpiece
29501,Best game to play with friends had a great time but if you don’t have friends playing it by yourself is still fun
29502,You can infuriate by holding your friend for the whole game
29503,"This game is INCREDIBLY fun, challenging and hilarious to play!"
29504,"[i]“Human: Fall Flat” is an experience! This physics-based puzzle platformer is the ultimate in time-killing entertainment. With multiple modes to explore and multiplayer now supporting up to eight people, this game is stupid fun. Usually, I would complain when a game controls a little floaty, but it works hert. Everything about this game screams quirky and fun with a bunch of different maps, easter eggs, and puzzles. Explore and experiment to your own delight. You should definitely buy “Human: Fall Flat.”[/i]

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]

As you begin there is a “sort of” prologue with a narrator that throws dialogue at you throughout the tutorial. Talking about the fealty of man with posh and florid dialogue about how no matter how hard we try to fly, “we always fall flat.” Our disembodied friend disappears past this point allowing us to explore the levels the developers have left us alone with many different puzzles and achievements to complete and tasks to do. Most levels are made properly and are dense enough to allow for good replayability in most cases, excluding the tutorial. On that note, the game is just the right length to keep most players engaged, and not difficult enough to turn away anyone that is particularly “slow.”

Now the gameplay here is a little different from what may be typical. If you’ve ever played a game called Gang Beasts it is similar, but not exactly the same as you’re character uses their grabbing and pulling ability to traverse obstacles, interact with objects, and throw your friends off cliffs. The Single player experience is a fun sandbox, but the game really starts to become something special when you and some friends get together to tackle some levels. Like one level that on my own would normally take four minutes with the help of my friends can be completed in 4 hours. That may sound drastic, but if you’re working with your partners in co-op than you’re doing it wrong it’s all about dicking around.

Also, don’t worry about progress, you can’t die in [i]Human: Fall Flat[/i], the character falls for a couple seconds before landing flat back where you fell. Making the game not terribly difficult and possible through simple trial and error. Each puzzle/obstacle can be beaten in a multitude of ways with no one solution necessarily being the best. The creativity and small details of each level also add to the fun factor with hidden rooms and areas to explore and climb around in like an idiot. Add multiplayer onto this and you bet your left butt cheek it makes for a great time, but not always to the benefit of the game.

One issue I had with the inclusion of multiplayer was how stupid fun it was. Talk about a first world gaming problem, but when playing Human: Fall Flat with friends and randoms it was one of the best experiences I’ve had playing any multiplayer game period. The original title, without multiplayer, is overshadowed by the many different ways you can customize your character, screw over your friends, and absolutely break the laws of physics with your superhuman vice grip. It’s almost too much fun and takes away from the rest of the game very quickly as that initial high of building an eight-man conga line to swing to victory becomes progressively less enticing.

In conclusion, I think [i]Human: Fall Flat[/i] is an excellent 3D sandbox platformer that you should consider purchasing today. Especially if you have a friend group that you like to get particularly rowdy with. I can’t short sell how much fun the multiplayer can be. Also, understand the game only has a few maps and currently doesn’t support steam workshop for bonus content. So until we start to see more content buckle in for at least a five-hour experience that can be rewarding even through the single-player campaign. This has been my review of [i]Human: Fall Flat[/i] I hope you consider purchasing this excellent indie game!"
29505,This game is absolutely hilarious

Gameplay is amazing. There are numerous ways to finish any given level, as well as secrets in each. Playing solo has its challenges and so does playing with friends. Some obstacles are easier to pass with one person than 2+.

29507,kool
29508,"Nice, but too short"
29509,You are a drunk piece of sheet who goes jiggly wobbly doob trying to solve zelda puzzles. 10/10
29510,"BROS DIS IS AN AMAZING GAME GO CHECK IT OUT
"
29511,"Fun game
So funny..create more map"
29512,Waduuuu heck...........
29513,"Difficulty: Medium
Fun: 10/10
Game Length: Relatively Short
Visuals: Good
Bugs: Little to no bugs
Price: A little high for what its worth (15$)


Side Note: I recommend waiting to get this game on sale only because of how short the game is, if you really grinded it out you could definetely beat it in one day. You do not want to get this game unless you have friends to play with, prefereably a group of 3 or 4, but you and a friend should be enough."
29514,"Awesome, so novel and different
The first few parts seem too linear and then it really gets in its stride, I think these parts are ust to get you use to the mechanic
The COOP is great fun and guarantees some good laughs
"
29515,"very fun game with friends, hopefully they add more levels"
29516,"Funny AS game, only can play coop with your mates over mic!
Dont play with randoms..
Would be better with workshop / more content."
29517,good boi
29518,"This game is funny as hell. Good game, You will never go wrong buying this kind of games and playing with your friends.  The gameplay is similar to the Temples in Zelda solving puzzles. PLZ add more dlc."
29519,Great Game 20 outta 10 i like how its so derpy its funny
29520,FUN and I enjoyed this game... But I want more map
29521,Incredibly fun to go through with a friend!
29522,"good game, so funny if u play with mates"
29523,"fun game, alex u shud buy it so we can play it"
29524,This game is the only game i've got all the achivements on and still have installed. Just waiting for more content. I loved almost every bit of it and just want more.
29525,"It is the best physics game out there. It surpassed Gang Beasts. Athough, it would have happened, anyways, because Gang Beasts has been going down hill every update.

 Hey dev, maybe you can take this engine and make a game like Gang Beasts. You guys obviously know what you are doing. The devs of Gang Beasts could care less about their community, anyways.. 

I know this game deserves better than being compared to some hasbeen game. Buy this game. It is a ton of fun. It easily one of the best co-op games on steam. It will make your sides hurt from laughter. You will have a lot of fun playing with the physics. You can climb, pull switches, move objects, solve puzzles, break walls, etc, etc, etc. 

Now that I beat all the levels I have been trying to find ways to take short cuts through levels. I have found quite a few. There was 8 of us all grabbing each others arms and one person standing in the catapult launching us through the air. It was pretty funny. We were all hanging in a tree like barrel monkeys. 

Another time I grabbed someone who was AFK and jumped off and edge with him and grabbed a swinging light with my other arm. I swung him across to the other side and when he got back he was like, 'hey, how did I get over here?' Plenty of opportunity to have fun times like those examples. :D

"
29526,I think its pretty Nice. I Would recommend it. Pretty Great. Keep up the great work Gang Beasts!
29527,Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
29528,It's a great game but it needs a workshop support. Please make it happen.
29529,"Now, don't get me wrong, this game CAN be pretty short. But, that doesn't mean it lacks content. 

Sure, you could finish the game in a couple hours, if you blast through it, but that's not the way it was intended to be played. This is a game about exploring and finding new and satisfying ways to get through an enviroment. With each playthrough, I gain a completely original experience, from trying different (and some times un-intended) tactics. Not to mention the co-op (both local and online) that makes for some of the funniest experiences you will ever have. 

Human: Fall Flat is an overlooked gem."
29530,"This game is extremly fun and me and my friends laughing out loud multiple times. 

I think they've upped the price a bit since I got it, and you play through the content quite fast, so unless they add a few more maps, I would probably grab it on sale. :)"
29531,"It's like Assassins's Creed, except your arms are pool noodles."
29532,It's pretty gun with friends but there are a couple of caveats. First of all it is pretty short. Also there are a couple of ways to approach solving puzzles but there are a lot of places where you can just skip ahead which means that if one of you is impatient you can miss a lot of the game by just rushing to the next checkpoint. All in all it depends on the people you play with but it is pretty fun.
29533,"ITS A FUNNY GAME,ITS SO FUN TO PLAY WIT FRIENDS"
29534,"I laughed so hard playing this game tonight with friends.

No complaints.  I don't know how far into the game we are, but I hope it never ends.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update........... it ended shortly after.

MORE MAPS is what would make me play again."
29535,"Play this game with friends !!!!!!!!!!  
This is where the joy of this game lies~"
29536,Super fun to play with a group of friends!
29537,The first thing I could think to do was short circuit the wall outlet. 10/10 made my day.
29538,This game did what it was supposed to do: I am a Human and I Fell Flat while falling asleep to this game.
29539,"Overall, perhaps Human is a game that’s more fun to watch for a bit than it is to play all the way through. It’s not that it isn’t generally fun to play, but that it’s guilty of the cardinal sin of slapstick-style physics puzzle games in the vein of Octodad: Dadliest Catch and Surgeon Simulator: it creates situations where once you’ve figured out what you have to do, executing on that solution is a matter of battling the controls and trying over and over until you get lucky. Its charm, comedy, and cleverness built up enough momentum to keep me going when the going got annoying, but man, does it get annoying sometimes during its six* or so hours."
29540,"Poison. Spikes. Camoflague. All of these are great natural defences. But when it comes to humans, they just








Fall Flat."
29541,"fun game, kind of boring when finished"
29542,Its a really good game
29543,good game
29544,"Really fun game with interesting mechanics
Definitely worth the price and even more fun to just fuck around the map with a friend
I really can't wait for the workshop option to become available to be able to come back to this game even more to try out the new Bobs and new maps that will come up eventually"
29545,"Best Play-Doh, job simulator.

10/10 would play as Morph again."
29546,Fun to puzzle with other people
29547,"Great to play with your friends over discord

probably kind of lonely without them"
29548,mad
29549,Humans falling flat! Hilarious game with friends.
29550,The controls don't make this game any fun. Sorry to say that because I was looking forward to playing this with a friend. We both quit after two levels.
29551,"Human: fall flat is a good game you probibly should get it better with co-op so get your friends to get it or play split screen with a controller
"
29552,"good game, fun with friends"
29553,"This game is fricking amazing. The first few levels are really easy and pretty straight forward, but once you get near the end, it can take hours to complete a single level. The only thing I have to critisize this game is that it only has a few levels, like only 10. I wish they would update the game with more levels because it gets repetitive to do the same levels over and over again. Honestly, I can say I beat the entire game within 12 hours."
29554,"Great game to kill time with your friends. Rather funny and challenging all at once. 
BUT I wish it was easier to get community made maps. I looked into it, and its too much for me to handle. Plz make it easier, like portal 2."
29555,Do you want to throw you friends off a cliff? Then buy this game.
29556,Great game but relatively short
29557,"Good fun to play with some freinds, amazing map design and endlles hours of fun solving the puzzles. The only negative being the controls and physics can be a bit challening to get used to."
29558,"Awesome i like it
:D"
29559,"Very funny, especially with the company.
8/10"
29560,Best. Game. Ever.
29561,I likey
29562,"My cats played this game for ten hours white I was at work. They have good taste.
A great game to play with friends (or so they tell me)"
29563,Jsut buy it! You wont regret this I swear to god! Pick up 3 friends and you have the best time in your life!
29564,"this game, at the time, was the only thing my cousin and i could play together. this was 6 months ago, and we still play this game to this very day. there is only about 7 or 8 levels, after they all got finished we just messed around, theres a lot of things you can do in the few levels, like roleplaying or just making fun of the graphics all day. its a enjoyable and hilarious game, i highly reccommend it and get all your friends involved because its a ton more fun with friends :P"
29565,"a fun, playful, silly game to play with friends. it's ridiculous and the mechanics are weird yet addicting. lighthearted, no plot but an interesting premise. it's really up to the player and their friends whether or not the game is a fun experience. buy on sale if possible!"
29566,说实话，这款游戏有意思是有意思，纯粹就是单人模式进别人房间没人和你说话超级无聊
29567,"Really fun to play, had tons of fun and laughs playing it split screen with my son."
29568,10/10
29569,A challenging yet fun game.
29570,"Human Fall Flat is a great game. I especially love the soundtrack and art style of the game. It's hilarious to play with a group of friends and although it can be pretty hard at times, it never gets frustrating as there are always several possibilities to clear a level and not every player has to make it to the end of the level to be able to progress. I'd absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a funny and challenging coop game :)"
29571,i likey very much
29572,THIS GAME IS FUCKING AMAZING!!!!
29573,"This is a great game that makes for hilarious times, and lots of fun. It's best with friends and overall a great game.
"
29574,"Bought it with the intention of playing coop with my wife. Had a lot of fun, but the levels are not specifically designed for two players so even though sometimes both players can help each other, the solution can be reached by one player only, so sometimes the other player becomes redundant."
29575,Good game
29576,Have fun !!!! Great game!!!!
29577,This is a fun little puzzle game to play with friends. Trying to get the speedboat on the boat level in singleplayer actually made me want to die because it was so hard. I would definately recommend playing this game with friends but it doesn't really work great in singleplayer
29578,"This is a puzzle game with a differece the whole family can enjoy. The main character is a small construction worker who either just learnt to walk or has had too much alcohol. This is evident in the movement which takes some practice getting used to but can be amusing to watch.

You can climb (hands are like suction pads), jump, move objects etc. etc., and when moving onto the next level you leap off a ledge, falling like a rag doll landing in a heap on the lower level, where you dust yourself off and carry on.

This is a game for a rainy day or just to do something different to normal gaming. The play time to game completion will be short lived and probably doubtful it'll be played again afterwards. With that said, it's still recommended.


"
29579,TO FUNNY AMAZING
29580,"Floppy, Funny And Physics"
29581,fun game
29582,never had so much fun in puzzle game. cant wait for devs to add more maps
29583,"LMAO, LMBAO & LMFAO.. These are all I have to say."
29584,"very good game but little bit short. Played one night with friend and almost finish it. Yes, you can play it with your friend, by simply creat a host and invite others, drawback is the connection may be very laggy."
29585,This game is silly & fun while also challenging with puzzles that may even have multiple solutions you can get creative with! Catch it when you can!
29586,"Kept grabbing into my friends butts.
10/10."
29587,"This game is only really fun with friends, you can have some fun with strangers, but it gets boring when you can't talk to each-other, but I can tell a lot of effort went into this game! This game is REALLY fun if you find physics defying bugs with your friends. So if you have some extra money, and some friends to mess around with, you might want to check out this game! 8.5/10"
29588,REALLY good game to play with friends
29589,its good
29590,"The game ist great and funny. This says the media:

""[i]This game makes my live richer[/i]"" - Anonymos person.

""[i]Hahahahaha[/i]"" - All Humans in the voice chat.

""[i]Stunning[/i]"" - Some important newspaper.

10/10


Serious, it's a great multiplayergame. 

Like Portal2 CoOp, only this time with more friends (up to 8 humans are possible)."
29591,game very good
29592,SO MUCH FUN! I LOVE THIS GAME!
29593,"Probably the best couch-coop game I've played so far.
So much fun with characters' physics and passing levels in several different ways."
29594,This game was the funniest and best experience i have ever had ;)
29595,"Go fxxk ur self noobs
Y kids can got this game and fxxking messing around?
very interesting when you trying to solve something and a fxxking noob is messing around huh?
"
29596,:D
29597,"gud game




i recomand it to da peeapolez"
29598,Is good. i became the boat. made ocs. shipped them. got a kid. kid died. good
29599,lmao
29600,"This game is something else. The whole concept and idea is one ive not seen done so well before. To simply put it, playing a game where you can throw your friend with a trebuchet or bump them over a cliff with a wrecking ball, is very fun. Enjoy a more list-like review for the rest.


Pros
[list]
[*]Not hard to learn
[*]Fun with Friends
[*]Lots of Content
[*]Very Humorus
[*]Non-Commital (You can stop almost wherever and pick it right back up at a later date)
[*]Throw Your Pals off a cliff
[*]The Pricepoint can't be beat. (Especially if you get it on sale)
[*] Extremely Well Done Split Screen Experience


Cons
[*]Not so natural feeling controller controls
[*]If you don't have a specific group of friends with you the online multiplayer is awful"
29601,"I love this puzzle game, i've never laughed so hard ever, trying to complete missions while my friends are working against you, cause. well.. they can. lol 
If it only were possible with a workshop and a map making system to give this game infinite content. :)"
29602,"Very fun and puzzling. A great game! Everyone should play it!
"
29603,"It's a fun game but it's too short. To make the most of it, try to finish the game in a fair manner rather than cheating by skipping through levels"
29604,"Human Fall Flat is a puzzle game that includes physics. It is an amazing game. And trust me, if you get it, you'll never stop playing."
29605,"Interesting game, would recommend to people wanting a challenge or just for fun with friends. 
Good co-op and single player modes, with graphics and music suiting the game well.
Hope for the future that there can be a workshop feature for players or new maps added to the game as overall it is quite quick to complete and not that fun to redo - (especially on single player) 
"
29606,"It's a blast with friends but is easily completed in under two hours. 
I recommend adding workshop content so people can make custom maps"
29607,Needs more maps or the ability to download workshop maps!
29608,"very easy at begining but the difficulty gradually increasing. the picture quality and the light print are very good. all in all, this is a cheap but very nice game"
29609,"Wait theres no reviews for this game?!?!?!

Well heres one, this game is amazing to play with friends you'll get hours of enjoyment out of it and for a game that was made by ONE persone and ONE PERSON ONLY its outstanding best part is there is a right way to go through the levels and so many different other ways you can go through the level

10/10 Best played with friends

highly recommend"
29610,主要乐趣来自bug
29611,Really fun! A friend and I bought this for something relaxing to kill time and have a lot of laughs and it delivered.
29612,"The game desperately needs more content, but if played as is - a nice distraction for a couple of hours. [i]Until you get to Aztec. Aztec is the only map I personally cheesed through.[/i]

Simple sanboxy puzzle game based around physics and your little floppy body with tiny extremely adhesive hands. Bonus points for being able to paint your little human in all kinds or garish colours and free reign to piss your friends off with ruining an almost solved puzzle.

Recommended even outside of a sale."
29613,2/10
29614,Super fun game =D
29615,"this game super fun! 
graphic: ok 
why this game don't have voice chat? it'll be super fun"
29616,how do you refund?
29617,Fun puzzle game IF you play with a friend
29618,Awesome game to play solo or with multiple players. The puzzles are intuitive and there are lots of secrets and shortcuts hidden in the levels. The game has good replay value as it is but the addition of workshop content will hopefully keep it alive for far longer.
29619,A great escape from every other stress inducing game and life work out there. Could use a few more maps or some updates to make our own maps but other than that it's a fun game to play with friends
29620,Tried to grab a ledge. Accidently heiled. 9/10
29621,sweet
29622,Good game
29623,Good game very very good game.
29624,like. funny
29625,Fun Game
29626,"Love this game, thank you for adding workshop map creator."
29627,10/10 PvP better than any other PvP.
29628,This game become fun only when u play with ur fren
29629,"I honestly I wanted this game for my birthday and my parents got it for me earlier and apparently since my computer is old it doesn't work. I wish it would work, it would be a dream come true but for everyone else out there I highly recommend for you to get this game I seen other youtuber's play it and it's amazing."
29630,"This game is great for a few laughs, but very short, I highly recommend it if you have a bunch of good friends that don't mind being thrown off the map a few thousand times!"
29631,Just started playing. I love it way more than I initially thought I was going to
29632,Good
29633,"The premise and idea behind this game is great, but it's lacking so many ideas that could make it so much more fun. Yes tooling around with friends is fun, but no game modes? pvp? weapon modes even? races? obstacle courses? map builder? workshop maps? The fact that there are no consequences to any actions just makes it way too tame to me. Fall off the edge? No worries. pick up exactly where you left off. Too easy.

The maps are built pretty well and you do have to think through the puzzles (and i'll admit i laughed most of the time with my friend), but to me it's just too bland to be called fun. By the end of each level theres no real sense of accomplishment, just relief that you're done the level and hopefully something more fun will be next. The controls are frustratingly not controllable which is a definite no go in a game so specific to carrying, running, and climbing things. Gang beasts is the pvp equivalent, and having both ideas collide would make a far superior game (for gang beasts too). 

Buy if on sale and you have people to play with. Don't buy full price."
29634,yes
29635,Fun.
29636,"Terrific game. It's a lot of fun if you play it by yourself, but playing with friends definitely makes things more interesting. I wish there were more levels though. Besides that, I don't have any complaints. This game is definitely worth playing. 10/10"
29637,"Played this a lot with my 8 year old kid, having a lot of fun. Kiddo is now playing it with friends after school. Learning patience while your friends learn the game is a valuable lesson.

Game itself is very neat, lot's of fun details and puzzles.

100% recommended if you have kids, just make sure you have controllers for both.
Also, try to plug a battery into itself on the level where you mess around with electricity. Both my kids find that hilarious."
29638,i didnt ascpet much from this game but its very good for the price and the replay value is just amazing and even then im not giving this game enough from saying that
29639,"This was one of the most fun games to play coop with my kids.  The level design could be a little better, but overall it's a blast.  My only real complaint would be that you can play all the levels in a fairly short amount of time.  Half the fun is figuring out how things work and how to unlock areas, so replayability isn't great.  This game REALLY needs a custom level editor for sure.  Really hoping the developer follows through with adding custom levels via steam workshop!"
29640,"Human: Fall Flat is an excellent little physics based puzzle game with a wonky yet fun and rather deep control scheme similar to QWOP or Octodad.

This game brings back memories of playing through the puzzle sections of Half-Life 2 for the first time and being amazed at the possibilities and unique ways to solve many of the challenges. Almost always there are at least two obvious solutions to each puzzle, and several far more obscure and interesting ones. The games first few levels are very short, and serve as a tutorial of sorts, but once you got the hang of jumping, climbing, carrying and falling the game opens up with some rather huge worlds filled with things locales to explore, vehicles to experiment with and challenges to overcome.

The visual style is very simplistic and somewhat cute and dorky with the marshmellow-like characters, whom you can also customize quite heavily with different outfits, colours and even your own face through the use of a webcam. Music isn't anything too special, although some tracks did give off a very majestic and powerful feeling (something that very much clashes with the gameplay and at times made it even funnier.)

There is no story to speak of, unless you consider the narrator who makes sarcastic and funny remarks during the first few tutorial levels as story. I don't think this is a problem in any way though, the game feels more like a sandbox for you to play around with and each level simply consists of getting from point A to point B and then making a 'leap of fail'. Tacking on some sort of plot could instead have taken away from the focus of the game, which to me was solving the levels in fun ways while accidentally (or purposefully) screwing over any potential Co-Op partners.

Speaking of Co-Op the game can be made far more entertaining if you have a friend or two to play with. The puzzles are sometimes made extremely easy with multiple players, and some can even be skipped entirely like retrieving boxes for the buttons (you can instead simply have one person stand on the button as only one player needs to clear the level for everyone to pass.) However this is nicely balanced out by the fact that far more options open up when you are several players, you can climb on each other and pull each other up from heights or swing each other around etc. The vehicles are also even more infuriating (and fun) to manuver with several people trying to communicate and steer things the right way, often ending in the party falling off a cliff yelling at each other like friends do.

Human: Fall Flat was a very enjoyable experience to me, and the only issues I really had with it was a few bugs, most minor but one or two gamebreaking ones that I hope the devs will be able to fix soon. The biggest glitch I came across, and I believe it is a glitch although it might be some sort of dev-tool that the dev team forgot to remove when publishing the game, is that contrary to the narrator's beliefs you can in fact fly in this game. I will not write how to fly here, because it allows you to bypass all the levels in mere minutes, missing out on the whole game and I know some people may be prone to using it if they find out how to much to their own dismay.

The game also comes with achievements, tasking you with really exploring the levels thoroughly and solving some optional puzzles. They were a welcome addition and extended my own playtime by quite a bit as I enjoyed most of the extra challenges. Playtime can range anywhere between 3 to 10 hours I'd wager, depending on how quickly you are able to clear the puzzles, and if you rush through the game or decide to explore it fully like I did. There are only 9 levels, but the last 5 levels can easily take several hours to beat. Workshop would fit this game perfectly and if they add workshop support for player-made levels that would make my recommendation even warmer.

A very fun game to play with friends! Buy it at full price, or during a sale if you're not sure about the purchase."
29641,"Love the game , hilerious moments you can have with friends . Really recommend this game"
29642,"TL:DR Soops fun, deffs buy. But only if you have friends!

You probably wont want to buy this game when you see it. At most you might just be on the ropes about the idea. To be honest it's not a very long or clever game. It's broken in a lot of places and where it isnt broken you can always find a way to break it.
But here is why I don't regret putting this game in my steam library and why you should have it there yourself.
In this game you will use your friends heads to climb to safety from a lake of lava.
You will launch yourself out of a catapult to break the walls of a keep.
You will lock your friends in a small house.
You will attempt to jam lengthy blocks where they definitely wont fit.
You will try to climb a wall with your face and ultra sticky hands.
You will build things that were a waste of time and wrestle your friends because they knocked it down. You will sail a boat and operate machinery and do gymnastics.
You will wander around like a handicapable toddler and push your friends off cliffs ""just 'cuz"".
You will have alot of fun if you waste your time and money on this game. You should buy it and a copy for your friends and have a great night doing silly stuff because it will be great fun.

10/10 would wrestle a raft down a mountain again."
29643,The human may have fallen flat but this game surely doesn't. With the Gang Beast styled characters and dynamics you will be laughing with friends in no time if you give it a chance!
29644,"Human: Fall Flat
-----------------

Pros:
Very fun.
Very good physics.
Great multiplayer.
Online splitscreen, that's freaking awesome.
A lot of different ways to complete levels.

Cons:
Not a bunch of maps, they really should add a level creator. then this game would be perfect.
No workshop. (yet)
Possibly just me but sometimes servers make my game delayed.


Overall:
I highly recommend this game, it's very fun to do with friends/family or with strangers. I've had many laughs and great times. Even though there are not many maps there is SO much to do. So many different things and hidden secrets. I personally like breaking the game :). So yeah, if your looking for a fun multiplayer game i highly recommend.

Final Score: 9/10

29646," A hilarious game to play with close friends on a late night when you are bored out of your mind. It can provide a great sum of laughs for hours on end. The ragdoll to the hilarious customation of the charachters, this is 100% worth the small ammount of money you can pick it up for from 3rd party sellers (G2A, Kinguin etc)."
29647,So levels you can't even do it the other right way with out cheating or having a friend
29648,Fun little game with friends.

29650,"A fun physics puzzler that is an absolute blast to play with friends.

Unless your friends like to drag you off cliffs. Or ""accidentally"" knock over your meticulously stacked pile of blocks. Or throw that stick you were using as a bridge into the abyss. Or simply just hug you, making it a struggle to move.

...okay, maybe I did all of these things, but they started it!"
29651,"Long fun puzzle game.

The ending was satisfying enough to completely warrant the years it spent in development."
29652,climb
29653,"I have been playing this game with my friend, and we had the best time ever while we were 
-pushing each other off cliffs
-trying to solve a puzzle 
-screaming at each other  
-struggling to get achievements (like docking a ship backwards)
-trying to not get stuck in conveyor belts
-sucking at the game
-feeling like Indiana Jones (but instead of running from a big rock, standing on top of it)
-laughing till our heads exploded
-getting smashed 
-wondering what the meaning of life was
-telling how we thought the skeleton of the game’s players looked like
-dissing another friend who doesn’t have the game 
-and more wicked stuff.

Overall, Human: Fall Flat is an amazing, fun and hillarious game.
Go get it, and get your friends to do the same!"
29654,"Fuck this game, I laugh my ass off when play with friend, and it make my stomach hurt so much !!
BUY IT !!!!"
29655,"Finally we have an equally fun PC game as PS system owners get with Little Big Planet. 
Hope they will expand the level base so the game never ends.

You absolutely MUST play it with friends in a pack. That boosts the amounts of laughs You get to insane values. Still playable alone of course."
29656,"Game is fun to play, for the price i would expect more content but these days with game devs taking the easy way out with early access its hard to find any real games. 
expect fun content for about 2 hours then your refund period is up and so is the gameplay. 
As about every other review says they should add workshop compatibility to breathe new life in the game.
if you have a couple friends to play with and get it for sale i reccomend"
29657,Got bullied on Multiplayer.
29658,"Really wish it had a steam workshop, so we would have more maps to play on"
29659,Funny
29660,"All i could say is that this game is much more fun when playing with friends. I wish there was a community made maps though. Buy this game if you want to have fun with friends and dont forget to buy for your friends too because playing alone is boring -.- hahaha

"
29661,"very nice game i enjoy playing
"
29662,gg coop
29663,its a good game onile mutiplayer made it  better
29664,This game is an excellent recreation of what it's like to not have an inner ear.
29665,"Human: Fall Flat is a bonkers fun game, especially when playing with friends. It has a brilliant atmosphere and soundtrack that's as joyful as it is hilarious. As you blunder around the world with your ragdoll companion, exploring the environment and trying to solve puzzles to get to the end of your journey and onto the next level. It's simplistic, intriguing and enigmatic.

We found we were scratching our heads trying to work out how to solve a puzzle or get through a particular path only to accidentally blunder upon the answer in the most enjoyable way. There are multiple ways to get somewhere and when you're playing together it only takes one person to find the answer or you can do it together or help one person move onto the next part to then get both of you ahead. 

You can play on your own, but it's so much more enjoyable with a companion.

I loved the way this one felt to play, it gives you a happy feeling, even when you're failing, falling and failing again. If you want to play something different. Something that makes you think, but also relaxes and frustrates you in equal measure, then this is it. 

See some of our shenanigans here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdrRHfZ_nsM&t=54s"
29666,"A rather strange game where the main enjoyment of the platforming isn't really the platforming, but trying to solve the puzzle of what mouse movements lead to what action. I'd love to know what goes on behind the scenes because the way your character moves and reacts to the mouse is madness. It's not quite intuitive, but once you get your head in the ""just do stuff until you figure it out"" game it's a really enjoyable experience.

It helps that the actual levels are quite nice. There's a good variety of mechanics on display, but the game itself is somewhat short so all the mechanics don't get overused. I love the openess of the levels and the environments they've made.

Water level deathboxes could use some tuning though. Kept being stuck underwater in an unwinnable position waiting to die so i could respawn."
29667,Well it's really a fun to play with friends and i enjoyed the struggle to climb the walls and overall maps are great. I played like 28 hours so far. I hope they'll add more maps.
29668,6666666666666666666666666666666666666666
29669,So I recently brought this game and it is incredibly fun especially online the mission are all 10/10 I recommend this game for all ages
29670,its need more maps or Workshop maps
29671,Very good and funny game!!
29672,i would love to play  new stages of fall flat human make it come true ';p
29673,"Really well made game.
No heavy rig required - even a basic office laptop can run it.

Puzzle solving quality or level is quite ordinary but this funny af physics is making it enjoyable.
such as grabbing other player instead of object and throw them out.

Especially if you play with your mates sitting next to you, so you can do the same shit to them, or on discord so you can hear them screaming makes this game lit af


The only down side is  that it only has few stages so hope custom / user made stage to be implemented, or at least more stages."
29674,"this is an realy fun game and you can play online or ofline.

i HOPE you can build your own levels in the future.
SO BUY THE GAME NOW!"
29675,This is one of the better puzzle games that I have played over the last 35+ years of gaming. Most of the puzzles are intuitive and fun.
29676,"This game is a doozy. I played every minute of it with a good friend of mine, after we completed it I felt incomplete. I traveled the world to seek answers, to an unknown question. This game gives you that answer. I learned about the duality of man and just how our society runs. If you want to really find yourself, play Human Fall Flat."
29677,shits n giggles
29678,yes
29679,I kidnapped a random Japanesse guy that joined my game and locked him in the castle jail
29680,funny as hell with m8s and thats all you need to know about it worth the $$$
29681,Nice game need more levels tho
29682,I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard at a game.
29683,It is a great game. Really fun only issue is you cannot use the workshop maps in multiplayr with friends
29684,shitty shitty game that allows for sexual harrassment. I am utterly digusted and absolutely triggered.
29685,I didn't know that this game will be so much fun! Playing with friends is the best! From start to finish we are just laughing and having fun. Worth it every penny
29686,Great game to buy when on sale and to play with friends 10/10.
29687,"This game is amazing!
The visuals are great and the controls are sloppy, I LOVE IT!
 I'd definitely recommend it to people that have alot of friends, because then, I promise you'll have a GREAT time! The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it was too short. It was too fun to end so quickly, me and my friends had a blast!"
29688,"Too Much fun 
but honestly when i got to electric stage i can spam spacebar and fly like hell
it continue untill the end of the game"
29689,"In one of the levels, I found a fan that I could dislodge from the wall. I popped it off and carried it nearly through the rest of the level, til one of my ""pals"" decided to drive the coal truck off the road...

I respawned

Fan did not

I rate Fan/10, would carry again"
29690,this is a great game i have a trash computer but it runs great! You should definetly get this game
29691,King
29692,"I am a little disappointed on how this was made. i thought this was going to be as fun as gang beasts and it was before i realized how hard and laggy it was to control your character. I am barely able to climb or grab anything, partly because of all the lag, but mostly because you have to do all these difficult procedures just to climb up 1 inch. Long story short i am not able to do anything in the games. on top of that i keep getting disconnected from multiplayer servers. please fix these because i am kinda wanting a refund now"
29693,"You know whats also falling flat?











My dick"
29694,good
29695,"This game is definitely fun, especially multiplayer. 
If you're looking for a random, new fun game that's co-op, this is for sure worth the buy.
Controller friendly is nice.
It's funny, customizeable, and works out the brain!
The only CON in this game is that in multiplayer, when one hits the checkpoint, you all do, so if you die, you spawn at the checkpoint, which isn't fun sometimes, but sometimes also worth it.
"
29696,"9 hours straight with one of my mates, some of the best gaming moments in ages. Fantastic co-op game."
29697,JUST DOWNLOAD THE GAME!!!! IT DESERVES THEBEST AWARDS COS THIS GAME IS SO FUN!!! I PLAY NON STOP SINCE THE PHYSICS IS TOO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
29698,"Blyatful game, buoi
Brilient ragdolz, physicz and other stuuf.
But only 8 levelzzzzzzzzzz.But Still blyatful gem
11/10"
29699,Really great game! Thanks! But pls add more levels!!!!
29700,"This game was quite enjoyable in multiplayer.

I do not know if I would have liked it in single player.
In special it is worth it :)"
29701,"Cons:
i like looking where my character is going so i angle the mouse to be able to view my surroundings. unfortunately in this game this means that my character is hunched over all the time like he ""can't even"". 

you can spiderman grip the walls but for some reason you can't climb them like spiderman. i've tried several times to climb walls, vines, a train. each time the hands grip but no upward momentum is gained or not enough momentum. i release the button for one hand to reach up to grab the next bunch of wall only to find that the now free hand has no intention of grabbing any more wall and just dangles there.
There are times when i'm running around trying to grab things and when i let them go my character's arm swings uncomfortably around the back of his head. So the ragdoll physics needs work to have less jello like humans, and humans that are a bit more stiff and seemingly have actual bones instead of spaghetti noodles.

Pros:
That being said it's still a physics puzzler and those are fun, at least until they are frusterating and no longer stay fun
the Sense of humor is almost Portal-esque 
the announcer Voice reminds me of the narrator voice from Soul Calibur so it's weird hearing that voice joke around"
29702,"Sadly i couldn't find da wae here,but i found some brothas who were lost.

7/10 there aren't many waes"
29703,"Honestly, given the way you move your character around and manipulate objects, I'm surprised how well I can still steer the boats and other vehicles.

Fun little game, good for all ages and it captures the spirit of casual gaming perfectly. The online addition is much welcomed.

Now if we could get a level-editor or just some more levels in Steam Workshop or something that'd be killer, it would turn a 10-30 hour game into a 200+ hour game."
29704,wow
29705,"One of the best games for drunk 3 o'clock sessions with friends. Graphics are OK for this kind of game, it's meant to be a relaxing screw-around playground.

Needs more levels or better workshop integration. Last level was funny but had a lackluster finale. Buy it at sale.

Bodyparts were wobbled, laughs were had, 8/10"
29706,so much fun and joy in this game so much fun but not for one.
29707,Great game to mess about with your friends!
29708,"very good game , funny with your friend"
29709, Very fun with friends you can grab about 17 hours out of this game so if you have a team of friends go for this typee of game
29710,Awesome to play with friends
29711,"one time my friends tried to sacrafice me by putting me into a garbage can and throwing me off of a cliff.
Needles to say, best time of my life."
29712,"A great game to play with friends, not recommended to play alone."
29713,"We are waiting for the workshop maps! Great game, hours of laughing! BUY IT!"
29714,"I love it! So cute of a style, but also such a difficult gameplay style! Never seen before, can't think of anything like it!"
29715,"Bought 3 copies so i could play with friends, played for three hours, laughed my ass off for like a half of that, yelled at my friends for six minutes, and drowned them over 20 times, worth every penny, buy this game, or u mum gay"
29716,"this is a good game, but when you beat it the game starts to gt boring because there arent any new levels or a level ceator so please add one of these."
29717,"I highly recommend this game. I would say this game is a 7/10 when you are playing WITH OUT friends, and a 9/10 game WITH friends. One of my favorite things about this game is the fact you don't even need a beefy computer, or turning the graphics way down. You don't even need a controller (though I would recommend it) I have plenty of friends who play with  just a keyboard and mouse. My friends and I agreed to buy it at the same time, we all launched the game at the same time and happily played the game for 4 hours without putting it down. This game is worth every penny but if you can pick it up on a sale buy it then."
29718,"Great game and lots of fun with a friend... 

I'd even pay for DLCs with more levels and / or for a way to create and play user created levels.

Come on !"
29719,Umm i cant open up this game it would be good if i can get some info about to open this game or my brother
29720,"[h1] Must try even if you are adult [/h1]

Hi!

I like this game so much and everyone should play this game as music and gameplay of the game is so awesome and gives calmness. I like the music so much."
29721,Fun and cool game with friends. though it only have 8 stages. Making more would be nice. There are alot of custom made maps by users but still the preset ones are the best. Please make more! Patiently waiting for new maps to be released so we can play again! and laugh... haha!
29722,Great and funny game to waste some time with or without amigos.
29723,Fun with friends
29724,human: Hurt your friends.*LOL*
29725,"Have a girlfriend?  Wanna co-op game with her?  Why not Human: Fall Flat?  The puzzles are fun to solve together, the graphics are fun, and the music is pretty epic"
29726,Brilliant games and lots of fun to play with friends. I really enjoy to mechanics of the game ;-)
29727,"I witnessed a furry fist adolf hitler while my friends tried to wire batteries.

100/100"
29728,very fun game!
29729,wish there was more
29730,"It was Amazing!
"
29731,super fun but needs updated maps to play.. kinda bullshit they promised updates and they havnt done a thing for forever :(
29732,"good game
"
29733,"Awesome game just needs easy access to workshop maps and skins
OR
More maps created regularly :)"
29734,I love it but I wish we could use the workshop to have more levels
29735,"Amazing game, just that is really short, but is still fun trying to get the achivements"
29736,"First of all, I like the ragdoll aspect of the game, it clearly suits games such as goat simulator or that game whereyour a ragdoll and you create accidents (forgot the name), I also enjoy the music to this game suits the nice simplistic artstylethatit goes with. However this game can become a mess, me and my firned encountered some bugs such as if you have a laggy server then the host and guests can fly around if they spam the space button creating the ultimate cheese, sometiemes the props will get stuck inside walls and physics sometimes can act quite dodgy. Another issue is the lack of content it gives at the moment, I do not know if levels come in with patches but at the moment the game only offers 9 levels, witch is a struggle as I finished this game with my friends within 3 hours. I would really like to see some new content added to the game along finishing the multiplayer part of the game (currentlyin alpha). Overall great game to play with friends with great puzzles that one or more minds can tackle together :)."
29737,"Game is great for playing together with friends, when playing alone it can be a bit boring though. After completing all the levels, there's not much left you can do besides mess around together with friends... Just the messing around is quite worth it though"
29738,just so simpel and fun <3
29739,"A Very Good Game To Play, It's Good Because Only Just You Get To Roam Around, You Can Possibly Find Secret Achivements Before You Go Into The Abyss/Next World. What I Like About This Game Is That I Can Play With My Friends And Do Funny Stuff Like, Throwing Them Into The Abyss Or Fighting To See Who Can Finish First Before The Timer Runs Out! The Best About The Game Is That You Can Customise You Character However You Like, I Made A Police Officer As My First Guy And I Was Proud What I Made. Then I Started To Get Better Into It And Started To Make Better People Like A Snowman With A Tounge Or Princess Peach And Lots Of Other Characters! So What I'm Saying Is, You Should Buy Human Fall Flat! 7/10"
29740,fun game but laggy when playing online
29741,so damn fun
29742,Simple and great game. It is short tho. This game would have alot more potential and replay ability if they added a map editor or a workshop for easy use. I would gladly make maps for this game if they had those.
29743,"This game is insanely fun! with nice graphics, freedom to customize your bob, easy to learn controls, fun and somewhat challenging puzzles a new player can easily find fun in this game.

What really enhanced my experience though was the fun Multiplayer aspect of the game. Through hosting a game a lobby I was able to find awesome players to go through the levels and on one play session we all role played as daring adventurers going on awesome adventures like becoming pirates and and knights in an old medieval castle. If you wish to host a lobby though I suggest a maximum of 4 or 5 players any more than that I promise you it will become crazy and hectic! 

Now as much as I love this game I do have some complaints though such as , though there is a banning system it can get a bit tricky to track which players are the trolls and which ones aren't. I suggest adding player usernames above our bobs or at least maybe at the top-right or top-left corner of the screen there's a list of players on the server with their names and an image of their character. That way it would be a lot easier to see whose who.

Finally and I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, I would suggest to somehow implement a voice chat into the game. God knows how many times I got into situations where a player can help pull me up but I can't type in chat because I'll fall to my doom. If the developers could somehow make this an option in the game that would be an awesome edition :D

Overall this a splendid little game that you can play and invite your friends or find new ones where you can mess around and solve puzzles!"
29744,"""Stupid"" and interesting controling, just like playing while u're drunk. Playing this game individually is super fun and the co-op mode is even more worth playing.
Btw, Music 10/10."
29745,"the trailer first reminded me of fucking roblox or some shit but then after i played it i now know that its a masterpiece.
totally worth buying even though the game is short.
just buy it.
BUY IT NOW

29746,"Brilliant game, but we need expert simple Chinese, without translating by software and □□□

29749,Great game!  cant wait for steam workshop!
29750,i fell
29751,Pretty cool game :)
29752,"Great game to spend a couple of evenings with friends. A LOT of funny moments, good puzzles, pretty music. Totally worth the money."
29753,"This game is pretty fun but... theres this fly glitch and it comes out of nowhere please get rid of it
"
29754,"I watched this game for a long time and finally decided to do it. I got it cheaper than Steam and if it were a longer game I would pay Steam price any day. 

The game is incredibly fun. I wouldnt suggest even opening it if you anything else to do because you will be playing this instead easily. Its basically like being drunk and then thrown ragdoll into a world to figure out how to keep exploring. I play alot of story driven games, FPS etc etc and this is easily my new favorite for getting away from those games or relaxing."
29755,"Really only playable in multiplayer, and even that's dependent on the number of people playing. Generally, more is better.
Otherwise not much here. A good pick up at < $10 with some friends but otherwise not worth it."
29756,"Best multiplayer game that I have played with friends.

Can't wait for Workshop!"
29757,can someone fix the lag of the button presses for online multiplayer. btw good game
29758,Nice game and its so funny to playing this game with friends and laugh together!
29759,Its really funny co-op game! Love it!
29760,5/5 awesome game.
29761,Great Game grab some mates and you will laugh the night away!
29762,"I really love this game but the rooms/dreams are just the same, i hope there are a lots of them and mostly it would be so much funny if there was a voice chats,sometimes i'm laggy but it didn't crashed the game its just the loading screen is the one i keep on stucking everytime we achieve or complete the level, i hope there would be another update on this"
29763,you can climb over walls to complete puzzles 10/10
29764,"M'aiq laughed himself dizzy. ""Physics"" has never been so much fun. M'aiq agrees with the main complaint of there not being enough levels though. M'aiq and a friend casually playing with many sidetracking moments where we just did silly things with the ""physics"" of the game and playing the last level twice, we still beat the game in a little over seven hours. M'aiq would still recommend this game as long as you have a friend to play with. M'aiq wishes you well."
29765,you can play as hitler
29766,Epic game! I've never laughed so hard playing a game as I have with this one! Most enjoyable playing online with friends as well! Definitely recommending it to my other gamer friends.
29767,pretty goood joooob sooooo faaaar
29768,good
29769,"At times it can be very frustrating, but it's mostly enjoyable (especially if you play with a friend). There are more than one way to finish a level. I love the music. I hope that more levels will be made in the future."
29770,"If you have grit, determination, and patience... and the IQ of a turtle, You will get up that wall by spamming mouse 1+2 and flicking your mouse halfway through your monitor."
29771,good！特别好玩
29772,"I did NOT think I was going to complete this game when I first saw it. I thought it was going to be one of those games where you d*ck around for a few minutes and then get bored.
 
I was wrong. I finished the game and it was quite a lot of fun. While the way your ""human"" wobbles around like jell-o can be quite annoying at times, it makes controlling him properly and figuring out puzzles a lot more rewarding.

The best thing about the game though, is how it makes you feel dumb, again and again. Just when you thought you figured out a specifically tricky puzzle but it doesn't quite work out, you realize the solution to the puzzle is actually A LOT simpler, to the point where it's downright pathetic. E.g trying to build a complicated contraption using a bunch of pieces when all you need to do is create a platform to jump off from like a lunatic. The game does this again and again. Even when you think you will know better next time, you get tricked again. That's where I think its brilliance lies.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is definitely worth its asking price."
29773,"Probably the funniest game I've ever played. Workshop will make it even better, but worth picking up now regardless.

8.1/10"
29774,fun
29775,Can't stop laughing when play with my friends. A fun game!
29776,Great game! Didnt have that much fun for a long time. BUY IT!!!!
29777,RT
29778,This is my favorite game.
29779,"if  its on sale its well worth £4.99 have had over 18 hrs of fun with this game and the replayablity is prity good, its alot of fun with mates and they keep adding new levels."
29780,"I have never laughed so much playing a game EVER. It funny as fuck. Never played single player and i would assume its a complete bore. But with friends you will be in LITERALLY tears of laugher....

It is a bit short and could do with more content but for £6. Its a good laugh"
29781,5/5
29782,"Much fun, much laughts, much stomach hurting after laughts, such great game 9/10 (only needs more levels and workshop!)"
29783,This game makes me feel so good alongside with my friends and my brothers
29784,Super fun while playing in cooperative ! Can recommend to everyone =)
29785,"Good game with a friend and had fun with it. But then the game bugged and we could just press space bar and fly trought the levels without completing any of the puzzles (don't know if that is common with this game). That really ruined the game for me.

But if you want a fun game to play with a friend this is one option. I wouldn't recommend to buy it with the full price tho."
29786,Really fun game for lollygaging with your friends. Tho I do hope it had more levels
29787,This game is going to make you appreciate the fact that you don't control your body with mouse and keyboard.

29796,good gome
29797,This is a great game to play with friends if you are looking to mess around with each other! dont hesitate to buy well worth it.!
29798,Fun game
29799,This game is very fun. I love co-op games where you can do the entire game with a friend(s). I've been playing this with 2 of my friends and it is way too much fun to be healthy. There is a lot of possibility and freedom of where you can go and how you approach a level. It will be different every time you play it (if only you make it that way.)
29800,Very good!
29801,"[h1] Best Game ever! [/h1]
[list]
[*]First Onlinegame resulted in an 3 minutes long fall with another Stranger recreating the Final Fight in Matrix with some choking extras.
[*]Second Onlinegame a group of 5 players managed under great effort to plug a red cable in a red slot and a blue cable in a blue slot. After spending 5 of my best lifeminutes to slove the grabing function i lost a little connection.
[*]The third Onlinegame will stick with me to death. 
I was forcefully grabed by a stranger dressed in a leatherstrip/Policehat combo and draged into a corner. Only my leap over an eadge could loosen his deathgrip. 
Luckely i landed right next to him the next second. 
I keept running away from him tryed to explore the map, as a dog landed next to me. Or more like a man in a dog Costume. I won't assume gender here, but after he defended me from this village people nightmare, 
the Dogguy instandly started to grab me just like the Leathercop did, and started humping but it seemed he had more humping experience.

Physics in this game are Great! And its legal to say one of the funniest games i played. Serious i laughed tears. 
And lost a little faith in humanity."
29802,best WWE game to date
29803,Endless laughter.
29804,"If you like playing with friends and need a good laugh, this is the game. The puzzle solving makes this game fun. I would recommend this game to anyone no matter what age you are."

29811,"WE NEED WORKSHOP MAPS
This game is awesome btw"
29812,"Great game. Super fun to play with friends. You won't stop laughing most of the time. If the game had steam workshop levels, it would be even more timeless and awesome!"
29813,"Great Game!With the power to do almost anything you want,Real World Physics And Your own Wits this game is epic!also here is some ideas for the game maybe you should add Custom Levels/Maps!"

29815,"Boring singleplayer, awesome multiplayer."
29816,"I really enjoy this game and it was really fun doing all of the puzzles and acheivements. after you beat the game there isn't much to do on it anymore. I wish they would add co-op levels to play with friends.

29817,Has a certain type of adicting when alone
29818,"Saw this game a while ago and thought it would be great for little weekend relaxation with friends. 

-So bought it with two of my friends
-Try to connect to a game they made
-Bad syncing issues (couldn't see the same level they were in)
-Try to fix the issues for a hour
-Just as I was giving up, it worked
-Funniest 5 Hours doing stupid shit like glitching the system and finding shortcuts to levels and also fucking my friends over by making them drop down to their deaths

8/10 A great laugh with few friends, might be a bit chaotic with 4 or more"
29819,"This game is so fucking good.I won't foget it.I recommend everybody to play it.
这个太尼玛好玩了，谁不玩谁傻b。"
29820," This is by far the most fun I have had in a multiplayer game. I can explain if you are going to enjoy this game with a mathmateical formula.

 If You enjoy playing multiplayer games with friends is X and you enjoying this game is Y X = Y EVERY TIME.

(Or you may not enjoy it I can't read your mind but its real fun)"
29821,"This is that kind of game that you buy without much expectations and it just blow your mind. This is one of the most funny and satisfiyng games I have.
The learning curve is really great. Gave me the same feeling when I played Portal for the first time.

Pros:
-Easy and intuitive controls after ten minutes of playing. (watch the video tutorials in the first stages, they tell you a lot)
-Right difficulty level. Challenging, but not impossible.
-Ok graphics for this kind of game (potato computer can run so you can play with all your friends).
-VERY Fun to play single or multiplayer.
-Character customization. Clothes and painting.
-Nice phisics
-Decent amount of levels.
-Clever way to make you control vehicles.
-Low price for what it gives.

Cons:
-Fullscreen caps my framerate at 40 doesent matter if Vsync is on or off.
-Game crashes when I run with CPU overclock. Not the pc, only the game. No problems when playing at stock.
-No workshop. User created content would open so many possybilities in this game.
-No VR support. (would help a lot with depth perception).

Highly recomended. You know that kind of game you wish to forget and start playing again just for that feeling? This is one of them."
29822,"This game has as much replay value as many friends you have. Even if you walked this game all over till the very end with every possible route, you will be laughing your ass off doing this over and over with every single friend or several friends, either in splitscreen, or over the internet. The combination of physics-based puzzles, your clumsy attempts to solve them, and deep customisation of your character (or bob as it is called) that can use a webcam to put your grimace on the model, will give you many hours of pure laughter."
29823,"spent over 2 hours laughing because i could not jump on a boat

29824,"i'm not generally an emotional person. i don't laugh at things often even if i think they are funny. i don't cry over sad things, etc. but i genuinely could not stop laughing when i was playing this with friends. such a simple concept, but it's really a great game."
29825,"Do you enjoy surgeon simulator? Do you enjoy having a player model not do what you want it to? 

This game's controls and mechanics are extremely frustrating. Rage quit after 30 minutes. Requesting refund."

29836,"I only have three hours on this game, but so far it is very good. It is a little overpriced, so you should buy this game during sales. However, it is fun to play with friends, and requires problem solving skills which cannot be found in many modern games today."
29837,yes
29838,This is a game to get if you just need a laugh.
29839,"Slow, boring, and frustrating, from pretty much the first moment. I'm not sure how this got onto my wishlist, but it was clearly a mistake."
29840,"Its a great wacky game with a bunch of cool little puzzles witch will defenitly make you cry with laughfter

29841,This is definitely one of the best puzzle games that I have ever played. Just as good if not better than Portal 2.

29843,This game is just so great!
29844,"You can drop your friend off a cliff. 10/10 oh to be more descriptive, from my experiences i would say this game is best played split-screen with a friend or online with or without friends. but it's still great in singleplayer. Best if you get it on sale, currently around 8 maps or so but each one takes longer and is more fun than the last!!
yes i have all the achievements for this game..."
29845,Best soundtrack ever ♫♥
29846,"The Workshop for custom levels is currently WIP and the game itself is AMAZINGLY FUN when you play it coop with a friend. Helping each other, using each others bodies to solve puzzles, Frikin do things in a way noone would think of normally. 

Everything goes, and once the Workshop levels are out, itll be even better!

If its on sale, you should get it"
29847,"At a scale from No Man's Sky to Adele's Skyfall, this game is 8/10

More levels or at least a workshop option could make me give 9/10

Edit: Now the workshop has been added and new original maps also being added. This game is now a solid 10/10. Amazing puzzles with multiple ways to solve and astonishing beauty of OST."
29848,Silly physics game with parkour. It's pretty fun. Would love some more levels.
29849,INSANELY fun with friends
29850,Good game to play with friends
29851,it fun and funny
29852,this is a REALLY fun game. needs more levels and probably mor difficultes
29853,"Good, but not great.
Human Fall Flat is fun at first, wobbling all over the place and all, but it's when you go online that the game suffers.
There really needs to have servers just for the game, because since we have to host the games, there are LOTS of lag playing with friends. You can look past it, but it gets really annoying. Although the game is fun, I would wait 'till it's finished, as it's not yet. The levels are fun, but limited, the music is great, but short, and multiplayer works, but lags. 
Overall, I give this game 7/10"
29854,"Very fun game, especially with friends to join you in your adventures. Although there aren't many levels at the moment and you play through them within a couple hours. Hopefully more levels are added soon or Steam workshop content."
29855,"Game is fun but way too short for the price. That's the only major downside in my opinion. 
The rest of the game is fine. Graphics aren't meant to be crazy and they do the job perfectly. The mechanic of the game is a bit odd to handle a first but it's fine when you get used to it.

This game would also be much more fun with friends to mess around and laugh. And also, it could get great use of a workshop. It would give unlimited amount of content (as long as someone is willing to make new maps). Workshop is something that could greatly increase amount of content and make the game worths the price. I believe the dev is working on it. However, it sounds like dev team pretty low so it could take quite some time. 

I would not recommend it now. Not because it's bad purchase, just because it lacks a bit of content to justify the price. And i'm not super willing to gamble how much content the dev will add before stopping to update the game."
29856,"This game made me and my childhood bestfriend laugh until we cried.  Would have paid $20 for it.  Well worth it, absolutely hilarious.  Definitely play with a friend."
29857,Кажется я кончил
29858,"Amazing Game! Fun! Challanging! A brilliant way to have fun and burn your brain!

Tottaly recomended!"
29859,Workshop content has changed the game drastically. Amazing! Would highly recommend!
29860,Fun game until you get to vehicle heavy segments. The vehicle heavy areas just degrade into a game with bad controls and frusterating to use vehicles. I cannot recommend it because the second half of the game is mostly hard-to-control vehicles.
29861,Very very fun! Play with friends!
29862,"Good game
But I have no friend"
29863,Please a workshop for maps and skins *-*
29864,"If you take a great game like Portal and dump acid on it, the left over residue that is left is what makes up this game.  Hated the drunken controls and the music was just hokey.  On top of it, the controls and movement made me sick to play it for more than a few minutes at a time.  Refund requested."
29865,"i love this game, i realy do but it doesn't have controller support with my switch pro controller or my steam controller even though it says it has controller support. please fix"
29866,"Doesn't seem to support single player 100%, played one level then another level showed up but then disapeared, and sent to some other level. basically it seems I can only play the single player levels."
29867,"very very good good game
"
29868,"Great game to play with a friend or maybe more , I personally played it with 3 other friends and it felt great , but way too short for 15 euros..
I bought it for 7.5 and it still doesn't really feel like a 7.5 euros game
I recommend buying it at least for a 75% sale or 60% , whatever , it doesn't even have community workshop maps :("
29869,"Really good fun whether you play alone or with others, but definitely makes a really great couch co-op! It also has great replayability - as you get more familiar with the controls more possibilities open up on each level."
29870,fun game
29871,"I know that this comment isn't getting anywhere, but I just have to say that I found a gem of game. I really can't recommend it enough. From the fact that the developer is fully compromised with the game and the community, to every single detail of the game. Beautiful maps, challenging puzzles,great ambient music, silly and fun physics, everything...
I played 17 hours in two days, so I hope that says something ;)
Amazing game in every sense. I can't wait to see what future updates can bring!
By the way! Play the game while trying to get the achievements, it becomes much more challenging and sure a great fun!"
29872,"This game is really too simple

29875,A+ Rated Game from those from Velociti Entertainment. So far the game is alright. Can get boring after a while of playing. Don't buy this game if you plan on playing singleplayer. But this game is fun with friends but even better playing this drunk.

29878,my friend got me this for christmas and i love it has fun puzzles cutimize feature its great i reccomend it
29879,"This is a physics based puzzle game with few mechanics, but what it does with those mechanics is what makes the game so good. The amount of levels may be short, but they are a good length, not too long(if you know what you're doing) but not too short either. Overal, I think this game is a very solid experience best played with a friend on Discord."
29880,"Played this game for five mins, all of a sudden my game starts glitching out. Deleted and reinstalled and the same thing happened. WTF plz halp"
29881,Very fun
29882,I Only Saw A Black Screen And Heard Audio.
29883,"Human: Fall Flat is a physics game. Its a game that makes you think outside the box till your skipping levels just like that. i would say its physics can tend to ""glitch out"" time to time but otherwise is entertaining even with the glitches. 8/10 fun with friends would recommend"
29884,"BEST GAME EVER 10/10 LOVE KILLING MYSELF IN IT.
"
29885,This is bt far the funniest co-op game I have ever played!!
29886,"Will There Be More Maps
"
29887,Don't bother if you ever get motion sick. There's no option to stabilize camera.
29888,Add Workshop please
29889,"Достаточно интересная и увлекательная головоломка. Для тех кто не знает, в игре воркшоп есть, но играть в карты воркшоп онлайн нельзя, что не может не огорчать."
29890,"I like the concept of this game, but I think the controlls are a bit slow. It feels like im playing the game in slow motion, and the multiplayer is too laggy for me. Anyways, I think human fall flat has great potential, its just that it feels a bit shallow. Maybe the game can have some sort of build mode to where you can easily build levels or vehicles or gamemodes. There just isn't much to do after a while. I don't find the game enjoyable, but I still can see the potential in it. I don't like to not recommend games, but I honestly can't bring myself up to recommend this in its current state. I will come back to this if there ever is an update that makes the game faster, fixes server lag, and just adds more things to do. The game isn't a bad game by any means, it just isn't good either."
29891,"This game is extremely fun to play with friends and it took us a bit over 7 hours to complete all levels. Music in this game is awesome but I wish there were more tracks. Some puzzles were too easy to complete with help of friends it kinda ruined some of the fun. There could be even more levels to play and this game was totally worth the 7,50€ I paid for it."
29892,its fun
29893,It's quite an adventure when playing the game with good levels and each part of the level gets more difficult. Worth the purchase.
29894,"This is a really good game, but it has also the ability to induce several levels of rage, when the physics gives you the middle finger.  

The game is really fun to play and most puzzles have another way of completing them.  The little guy that handles like a bowl of jello on a bicycle has you trying to figure out how to use certain elements to get you to another area.  At time you really need to think on what needs to be done.  

Spoiler:  The water map was infuriating!!!  at one point you need to tether 2 boats together to get a box on a button.  This took me close to 9 tries, because the boats had a mind of their own and kept on running down the river.  

My only gripe with the game would be that, I would have liked a quick save option.  The autosave save at weird locations, meaning that if you miss time that one jump or grap, it is back to the last checkpoint, usually one that had you raging to get past it.

This game is worth a try and there is some fun to be had.  Get it on a sale though!!"
29895,"This game is really great with friends! I always have a blast playing it. It can be buggy at times but other than that if you're looking for a good coop game to mess around with friends (troll them etc) then this is the game for you. I'd easily rate this game a 8/10.

Heres a video! You will have a great laugh watching it.
