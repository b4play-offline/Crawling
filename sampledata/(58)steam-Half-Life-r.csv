1,"the gunplay is very fun but the hard to understand story, trial and error gameplay is kinda unfun. I recommend playing half life 2 instead since you don't really need any context for half-life 1's story"
2,Its a classic.
3,"A classic, and for good reason. This game is innovative, and stands the test of time to a remarkable degree. If you're looking for a great singleplayer FPS experience, look no further. This game does go on sale very, very often, so keep an eye out for that."

12,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

36,"One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"
37,is fun
38,"Still a work of art to this day. 

Not much to say that hasn't already been said honestly, the level design is phenomenal, exploring black mesa is just a joy, the atmosphere is unparalleled, and Gordon's journey is exciting from beginning to end. 

There are a total of 18 chapters, the first 14 are all absolutely incredible fun, full of frantic fights and memorable set pieces. Yes even on a rail is good (although I admit it drags on for too long). The final 4 are the infamous Xen chapters, which on replaying them I don't think are nearly as bad as people make them out to be, but also I didn't enjoy them as much as the Black Mesa chapters. And the Nihilanth boss fight ended up harder than I remembered or expected now. 

I encountered some bugs here and there, mostly with AI behavior and flickering textures, but nothing that would really ruin the experience. For example the Gonarch got stuck in place while walking to the next arena twice. But for a 24 year old game, the fact it has so few issues on modern systems is impressive.

Overall though Half-Life is still an absolute masterpiece even with it's slight technical issues and later chapters. I would love to see Valve patch the game to fix some of the bugs, and maybe give it a remaster similar to the one Quake got, to really bring this timeless classic up to date."

57,"Half-Life is a very unique game when it comes to its story-telling. Everything is experienced through the eyes of Gordon Freeman rather than told to you, the player, through any cutscenes. You're left in the dark about everything that's happening in Black Mesa and when the facility gets invaded, you experience and figure everything out first hand. This is especially powerful in the opening moments of the game when you're mostly defenceless and witness all the chaos around you.

The gun-play and difficulty are finely calibrated, the weapons are fun to use, the enemy line-up makes for a lot of unique combat scenarios and the game has a good amount of puzzles which halt progression. It is a remarkably solid game that feels very modern to play despite its dated visuals, it holds up very well!"
58,"yes
"
59,"This game holds up, it's a legend, you have to play it. 

Combining excellent gunplay with platforming and some horror sections. I will say the movement felt too floaty, it was like I was skating around the Black Mesa facility and I found that my finger was constantly hovering over the walk key while platforming. The audio especially from shooting the weapons feels extremely satisfying. There's a story here some of it is scripted and some if it is told through the environment. This game is worth playing despite some frustrating bits within the last quarter of the game."

75,This game is honestly solid until the final stretch of the game. I won't spoil it but for the most part the game is good and I understand why people enjoy it as much as they do. The last 25% of this game is annoying and repetitive and the final boss is extremely disappointing and underwhelming. Other then that game has good AI for a 90s title and shooting guns feel smooth. One thing this game does well is using the environment to the fullest by making you do parkour to reach a lot of places and using the theme to advance the decent plot while also providing a lot of cool locations to traverse through. solid 7/10
76,Lovely Valve game

80,"Half-Life: Full-life Consequences



John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went.



John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said ""its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences"" so he had to go.



John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon.



The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said ""its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys"".



John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs.



""I cant give you my lisense officer"" John Freeman said



""Why not?"" said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman.



""Because you are headcrab zombie"" so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking ""my brother is in trouble there"" and went faster.



John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw ""Ravenholm"" with someons writing under it saying ""u shudnt come here"" so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again.



John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house.



John Freeman said ""Zombie goasts leave this place"" and the zombie goasts said ""but this is our house"" and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece.



Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs.



When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said ""John Freeman! Over here!"" so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see.



Gordon Freeman said ""its time to end this ones and for all!"" and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said ""thanks i could help, bro"" and Gordon Freeman said ""you should come here earlier next time"" and they laughed.



The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled ""LOOK OUT BRO!"" and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said ""NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!"" and John Freeman walked real fast out.



John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry.



""I'll get you back evil boss!"" John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs.

90,"A good introduction to linear fps and a huge upgrade in gaming at its time of release. There are issues, such as glitches from its time of release and kind spongy enemies, but the weapon combat, story, and set-pieces make up for more than all of it. Just make sure to always quick-save whenever done with an encounter or else you'll end up frustrated when dealing with bits of the annoying platforming sections like I did. 

Also fuck Valve for 10 years of nothing but csgo and dota."

94,"The Half-Life series is (currently) my absolute favorite game series, with Half-Life: Alyx being on top, and Half-Life 2 and Episode 2 not far below. Still, Half-Life 1 doesn't need to hide at all behind its successors.

Run. Think. Shoot. Live.
This motto on the back of Half-Life's original packaging pretty much sums it up accurately.
The game can be quite unforgiving in some places, even on normal difficulty. You really need to be deliberate about your actions and strategy. (Quicksave is your friend!)
Once you are aware of that, the game basically turns into a combat puzzle game. 
The campaign and story are slowly escalating. You start off on a normal day of work that goes haywire. Most of the time, you are on your own, forced to adapt to the circumstances and prove yourself decisive in the bigger picture.

All in all, a classic that holds up after more than 20 years!

Note #1: Many recommend to play the original over the Source port. I myself played the Source version and didn't have any issues with it.
Note #2: You can also play this in VR! Just look up Half-Life VR by Max Vollmer.
Note #3: Black Mesa, the Half-Life remake by the community, improves upon the original in almost every way possible. Modern graphics, reworked levels, and great music!"

The movement is perfect, the gunplay is remarkable, the map design is splendid (well, maybe for some Interloper levels) and the length is just right. The graphics are outdated as hell but still have their own charm (particularly the lighting colour tricks throughout Black Mesa facility (settings you wanna have are Brightness 0.5, Gamma 1.8, Steam release broke the default lighting). The gun sounds are unique and memorable, the music, let's just say you'll want to turn the MP3 volume up all the way. It is just epic.

The vague and mysterious sci-fi story is still intriguing despite the dated voice acting. Worth playing through before Half-Life 2"

134,"[h1]They're waiting for you, Gordon.
In the [b]test chamber[/b].[/h1]

You can't go by as a gamer on Steam without knowing about the existence of [b]Half-Life[/b]. That is, of course, because Steam itself would not exist had it not been for the success of this game and the many others it spawned throughout the years. Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, Portal and countless other games and even more mods would all not exist if it weren't for this game in particular. For many years I had not gotten interested in playing the first Half-Life, despite thoroughly enjoying the second one and all the previously mentioned games as well.

On the 31st of August, precisely a week ago as of the time of writing I changed my mind and played through the game for the first time ever. It hooked me in so much that for a whole week, I could not put it down and by this point I had put [i]an unhealthy amount of hours[/i] into the game and had completed 15 playthroughs of Half-Life in a row. It is hard to recall a game that would've gotten me to do the same to this extreme extent, albeit DOOM and Quake being most probable exceptions, some of the most important games I consider my all-time favorite FPS games.
[b]Now I know which game I can confidently add to that list.[/b]

[b]Half-Life[/b] has been known to be described as a linear campaign experience, which is true - in return, however, it [b]is extremely well balanced[/b] from start to finish ([i]*khm*[/i] maybe with some exceptions, [spoiler]Xen[/spoiler]). Half-Life has intense speed and full-throttle action that stretches all throughout its campaign, while also filling the gaps between these encounters with map exploration, puzzles and environmental story telling, which compared to FPS games before Half-Life has not been the case and to ""boomer shooter"" fans might sound like a turn off - however, it is absolutely not!

After the game kicks off with the introductory prologue, the chapters are put together in the most varied and exciting way; so well that for 15 playthroughs (until the other half of some of the later playthroughs - we're talking a lot of hours and a human brain here after all) I hardly ever felt any frustration due to the pacing, as when there was action, it was intense and tough with the artificial intelligence being surprisingly mobile and smart, resulting in each combat encounter engaging and challenging, and when these fights would tire you just a bit too much, the game would gear back and give you breathing space, rewarding you with story elements of a somewhat clich√© yet as interestingly told plot as back then was possible (I personally love the concept of it and experiencing it first-hand each time), along with engaging environments and light-hearted but satisfying puzzles.

The movement and quick weapon switching also give you tremendous amount of freedom, as on top of the base running speed that is just as fast as it should be, you're also able to improve yourself with bunny hopping and long jump later on, and simultaneously if the story or environments so desire, the player can also slow down to walk and sneak, standing or crouching, with more possibilities than in most games before and even after it.

I personally, after so many playthroughs, mostly try to play as fast as possible and the storytelling and narrative, for the majority of the game and with a few exceptions, do not slow me down whatsoever. Although if I want to focus on those aspects with greater attention, I play slow and the experience is albeit moreover the same, obviously there is a huge difference in many different ways. This flexibility is something one cannot experience in many other shooters before or after Half-Life, and it gives a feeling of freedom that is unique and makes the game even better as it is up to the player how they want to enjoy it.

Technology-wise by now it does not surprise anyone that the game also runs and loads in lightning-fast, and due to its easy moddability and developer tools, the possibilities are countless and throughout Half-Life's almost 30-year-old existence, there were many people making their mark not just in the modding scene but in the grand video game industry as well because of GoldSrc and Source, later on, and Valve's accepting and encouraging policy regarding fan-made content.

[b]This game is a goldmine for FPS enjoyers and is really well put together.
[i]A timeless classic that influenced and still influences an entire industry and millions of people worldwide.[/i][/b]"

136,"It starts with one
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

138,Simply one of the best FPS I have ever played. Might be the same for you
139,"Love it, love the memes also."
140,"best fps of all times, the movment controls are a bit tricky tho . the graphics hold up well. DO NOT BUY THE SOURCE VERSION"
141,This game is a classic and i reccomend getting the enitre series.
142,this game is amazing!!! id recommend this to any new players to steam
143,To think all of this could of been avoided if Gordon had simply just bought his passport
144,GOOD
145,"it was fun
"
146,It is Half-Life. What more needs to be said?
147,good
148,Played it for the first time ever and all i can say is that it's pretty good
149,"As of writing, it's 2022, you probably should have played this by now.

Pros:
- It's a classic for a reason. There's little details that you don't get to see much even today.
- While admittedly jank at times, it's usually managable jank.
- Varied arsenal of guns that for some reason I don't get tired of.
-Mods up the Wazoo

Cons:
- Xen is an affront to human decency.

8/10 - the first 75% of the game is really good and it's a classic, so I rounded it up."
150,halfy lifey
151,"There's still some life in this 24 year-old shooter. Anyone reading this probably knows how influential this game is, so this review will focus on my own experience as a modern gamer playing for the first time in 2022. To be clear, first-person shooters are not a genre I am well-acquainted with. In fact, this is the first fps campaign I have actually finished, so I won't bother comparing it with others like it. Instead, I'll attempt to meet the game on its own terms.

Starting with what I enjoyed, Half-Life has an intriguing story and a tense, creepy sci-fi atmosphere. You play as a physicist escaping from an underground research facility after a lab accident causes aliens to teleport into the base and wreak havoc. Where the aliens are coming from and why they are attacking is a mystery for most of the game, and the question of what exactly the creatures [i]want[/i] is only partially answered. The real intrigue is in the game's cutscene-free storytelling, which puts you in the protagonist's skin and creates a feeling of isolation. You don't just watch the accident play out--you conduct the experiment yourself, and are forced to deal with the consequences when it goes wrong. And so, you tear your way through the facility, blasting any aliens in your path and walking past dozens of dying scientists in the hopes that maybe you can stop this mess after reaching the surface--but for now, you just have to survive. This is complemented surprisingly well by some of the cheesier bits of dialogue, voice acting, and sometimes strange AI, which offset the creepiness by providing some welcome, if unintentional levity to all the chaos. This may sound like a backhanded complement, but it actually works in the game's favor; these lapses are often so well-timed, you'd swear it was intentional. 

Now, as the game tells its story through mostly uninterrupted gameplay, I'd be remiss not to talk about both aspects. In the spirit of playing a lone scientist surviving an alien invasion, the game keeps you peeking around every corner, often building a sense of dread by letting you hear enemies well before you can see them. But you can't always rely on this, as aliens may teleport in at any time. These surprise attacks are generally reactable, as enemies have distinct behavior patterns and character designs that the player will already be familiar with before getting ambushed. These patterns help you to quickly make informed choices about how to avoid damage and what weapons to use. And this is good, because the game's weapon arsenal is [i]massive[/i]. All in all, the game does a very good job at forcing you to think on your feet while still allowing you to make plans and play creatively. 

Unfortunately, not all aspects of the gameplay are as thrilling as the excellent combat. Platforming in particular is terrible. The game often expects you to walk on narrow ledges and make precise jumps quickly despite having no indicator of where your feet are, and jumping onto some higher ledges may require you to crouch mid-jump, which makes the less-awkward normal jumps kind of pointless. Additionally, ladders control as though the player is simply [i]walking[/i] up a vertical stretch, which can cause you to slip off the side of the ladder if you aren't careful. This is worsened by the fact that the level design sometimes forces you to combine all of these awkward mechanics, and the final stages of the game are almost pure platforming. 

On the more subjective qualities of the game, some players may be put off by the fact that the game encourages a very slow, defensive playstyle. This is not helped by the fact that the game makes save-scumming easy--and tempting, thanks to a jagged difficulty curve. The latter problem only gets worse as you near the end of the game, when stages become noticeably messier and more gimmicky, resulting in needless confusion and some cheap deaths. 

On the whole, I give Half-Life a modest recommendation to anyone interested in an immersive campaign with a chilling atmosphere and strategic combat. However, prepare to put up with a lot of frustration along the way. If you aren't charmed by 90s graphics, prefer quick thrills to slow build-up, or [i]really[/i] don't like difficult games, then perhaps this game isn't for you. I have no nostalgic connection to this game, but I still enjoyed it, so it's fair to say that this game has more timeless merits than just being an influential bit of video game history."
152,good
153,Fun game
154,just buy black mesa
155,"Ha Ha Crowbar Go BRRRRRRRRRRR
"
156,controls are brutal. got fed up trying to run through the game even with god mode on.
157,a great prequel to hunt down the freeman 10/10
158,Loved it.
159,"Even though I recently learned that Half-Life exists (about 2 years ago), I have always had a special part in my heart for this game. Though there are many bugs (and some of game design is very dated), it's a 10/10 for me. Would 100% recommend this game to everyone."
160,"Old, but a banger!"
161,yoooo they ad wathua blanco to half life???????!////

164,Just get the game already

166,.
167,COOL GAME I HAVE HALF A LIFE!!
168,"Difficult but fun FPS where the enemy AI is much more complex than it needs to be (in a good way).
Surface Tension is a little too difficult compared to the rest, but its cool and unique sandy look makes up for it.

I recommend it to anyone who is up for the challenge, or even someone who just likes saving every 2 seconds."
169,A classic game that sadly doesn't hold up compared to other games released at the same time. Hard to enjoy. Story and setting was interesting and I can see why it developed such a large fan base.
170,what are you do here? Just buy the game. It's costs ¬£8.00p (if you have bad teeth) This game has complete blue up the way of gaming. Just buy it. NOW!
171,"I can't believe that this game is for 1998 and for me, who doesnt care about graphics, this game was a lot of fun for me , it can entertain you, but
Storytelling is boring but the story itself is amazing, but i cant believe in this amazing game there is poor level like xen which was one of the worst level from my entire games i played"

175,"Half-Life is one of the greatest games created and launched the industry years forward with its ai
The modding capabilities for Half-Life is none to be compared looking at moddb it has some outdated features but most mods fix it
Half-Life also has barely anything necessary as long as your computer is good enough for 1999 you can run it
It's also pretty cheap so it has that going for it
10/10 play it before you die
p.s Don't use hd models use the original models"

With the game‚Äôs release date in mind, it had me awestruck with just the tram sequence, not to mention being one of the first mainstream games to have every single story event play out during normal gameplay, be it dialogue, scripted climaxes, or just revealing a new area to explore, this game was way ahead of it‚Äôs time. With smooth and fluid movement, hectic gunplay, and an ending you‚Äôll never forget, Half-Life is one of the great pioneers of the modern FPS. Screw Xen though, really."

Although the mechanics in the game have dated and I did struggle to get used to the way the weapons worked, it was very enjoyable to play. I also did struggle with finding a way around the locations and how to progress, so I did have to search for a Youtube guide to help me advance through the game. But apart from that, the way the story was told was cool and I liked the soundtrack. I really enjoyed playing it and I will probably play this game again."

I wholeheartedly believe that we have peaked as a species, we achieved absolute perfection and the 19th of November of 1998 was the day we reached it. 

Without knowing it we developed a golden source of light, a magnificent creation which we loved so much that, six years later, we actually managed to recreate it's breathtaking aura, giving us a second taste of what truly being alive is like.

Since then we've fallen, lost touch with that which let us ascend into a higher state of being... but even in the darkest of times, as long as one person still plays Half-Life it will shine a spark of hope which will lead us to achieve true perfection once again."
211,good
212,"10 years after its release, gordon freeman shaved his head and became the infamous heisenberg"
213,still fucking good
214,"Have never played HL when it came out. Only played CS. Big mistake. 

If this game would come out now as a retro fps shooter it would still be the best game of the year. Except for the audio compression. That's that happens if you try and fit an entire game onto CD. 

The Level design in places can be unintuitive since you are often expected to go back the same way you came from which is not something you do in modern shooters anymore. And the bit with the minecarts drags on too much. 

As someone who played Portal and CS first, I constantly said: oh so this is where that came from. It speaks to the bleakness that is the real world that something as brown and uninteresting as Counterstrike came from something as vibrant as this, yet somehow became more successful."

226,"[i][b]This is an excerpt of a longer review available at [url=https://metrocop.net/articles/half-life-review/]Metrocop.net[/url][/b][/i]

Half-Life feels very much like two games in one, although, regrettably, that‚Äôs not a good thing. For the majority of its runtime, you have a nearly flawless romp that ebbs and flows from survival horror into full-on action, one that has aged wonderfully if you can look past the archaic graphical fidelity. However, as it reaches what should‚Äôve been a spectacular climax, it instead becomes a grind you‚Äôre almost happy to see end.

However, if the past twenty-five-ish years have shown anything, it‚Äôs that even the rush job that was Xen didn‚Äôt color people‚Äôs impressions of Half-Life. There‚Äôs a lot more good than bad here and a couple of, at worst, mediocre hours don‚Äôt ruin the overall experience. The original Half-Life is still a nearly flawless experience and one that every self-respecting gamer should play through at least once‚Äîthough there‚Äôs no shortage of extra content, from the official expansions to literally hundreds of mods and map packs, to expand your trip to the Black Mesa Research Facility.

If you haven‚Äôt played it in a while, go back and reexperience it all over again. If it‚Äôs your first time, then grab your crowbar and face the unforeseen consequences of your actions. Trust me when I say that life will be different."
227,it's f**king better than hunt down the freeman
228,People be playing HALF-LIFE but when its time to put HALF the amount of energy into something they end their LIFE!!! (lauging crying) (dead emoji)

271,because this is half life 2 and its awsome
272,"That game is awful. Not to mention frustrating. First of all, the parts where you have to ride around in vehicles are horrible. Those parts are long, boring, and frustrating due to the horrible controls. But the vehicle part of the game was only the first thing that made me hate it.
Then on top of that you have annoying characters. If it were possible, I would have killed all of my allies within the first 5 seconds of meeting any one of them. And believe me, I tried. Alex is the worst by far. Everyone is useless and annoying. Seriously, every five minutes it's ""Oh, look, Freeman's here. He'll do all of our work for us because we're lazy/incompetent/useless."" If I was Freeman, I'd just let everyone die. Or better yet, kill them all myself. The only thing that would get me to consider playing the sequels would be if I got to go on a murderous rampage killing all of my allies.

You waste more ammo than anything. With any automatic weapon, it seems that at best 1/3 shots hit their mark. It's impossible to aim with them because instead of your spray pattern being affected by how long you hold the trigger, it follows some kind of pattern. Your first shot might hit its target. It might not. It's horribly frustrating.

I bought the Orange Box back in January after hearing how great it was. Worst $50 I've ever spent, since the only good part of the whole thing is Portal. About 4 months ago I got killed somewhere near the end of the game. After this, I exited the game and haven't played it since. I have no desire to go back and finish it, or play Episode I or II."

274,Good game for who want a classic but good fps game.
275,played it with a conroler

few month's to be honest i had fun

trust me you will have fun playing Half-life Series"
284,"Overall: A timeless classic for any gamer to play, and complete. As Valve's Debut title back in 1998 it still stands up as a great stylistic title with lots of character and forward thinking mechanics and story telling. Highest recommend  and my go-to gift to my new PC gamer friends.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."

297,"This game is fun, scary, and action packed, I really love it!

298,this is a good game a 7/10 in my book i would give it higher but it just does not tell you what to do sometimes so sometimes you just have to guess what to do but a good game and you get the story as it goes on and  has a good climax and finaal boss good game overall :D
299,A true classic.
300,"Almost feels unnecessary to write a positive review for Half Life. An essential experience and a cornerstone of first person shooters. If you haven't played it already, play it ASAP. The games graphics may look dated but the gameplay and design have aged spectacularly once you get into the experience. If you still can't get past the games age, play the remake Black Mesa and then come back to this game."

yes I know it doesnt hold up much now on days, but its still enjoyable.

it can be hard sometimes but over time you get the hang of it.
I recommend turning off hd mode and change the resolution if you want to experience like the late 90s/ bigger hud."

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Half-Life is a series of first-person shooter (FPS) games developed and published by Valve. The games combine shooting combat, puzzles and storytelling. The original Half-Life, Valve's first product, was released in 1998 for Windows to critical and commercial success. Players control Gordon Freeman, a scientist who must survive an alien invasion.

[b] Story - [/b] Okay, well the story is pretty vague if i‚Äôm gonna be honest. I had many people recommend this game to me and told me that the story was a masterpiece, I must have been playing the wrong game. You don‚Äôt really get a mention of the antagonist. You just see him walk behind a wall or go through a portal. Not much screen time for the antonigist. All I knew was that you have to escape the lap and you end up facing the boss in the Xen (other world). The first half of the game was pretty good and I deeply enjoyed it. Once I got into that second half, my whole mood just switched. I did not like the second half, like at all. It was really repetitive and just boring. The other world was okay but didn‚Äôt bring my excitement back. It didn‚Äôt help that the last boss reminded me of the marshmallow dude from Ghostbusters. The story was a huge let down and maybe because I had high expectations (because everyone that told me about it hyped it up into oblivion).

[b] Gameplay - [/b] I will say that the gameplay is amazing! It‚Äôs fast and smooth and aged pretty well for a 1998 title. Only issues I had was that I would get stuck in some environments (clipping issues) and sometimes if I got to a checkpoint, I would be stuck completely having to load an old save to get back to the checkpoint hoping not to get stuck again. It‚Äôs an old game so I‚Äôll give it an excuse. The gunplay is really fun and you can use some really unique and fun weapons in this game. You can fight a ton of different enemies that require strategy and I love that difficulty. The atmosphere and environments are incredible and blows me away that this is a 1998 game. They did an amazing job in the gameplay/graphics section.

[b] Sound Design - [/b] The sound design is, well, average at best. The voices are so low and so hard to hear them, especially if the environment can be really loud at times. You don‚Äôt get any subtitles, which would fix the issue for me with the voices but no luck. Is there a voice audio setting? Nope! The audio is pretty meh I will say. The gun sounds are good though, so we got that going I guess. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Fun and challenging gameplay
	[*] Amazing environments
	[*] Incredible graphics for 1998
	[*] Tons of weapons and enemy variety 
	[*] Good and challenging puzzles
[/list]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Story was bare bones
	[*] Antagonist is uninteresting
	[*] The game balancing is a hit or miss
	[*] Game can be buggy (checkpoints can lock you in place)
	[*] Bad sound design
	[*] Second half of the game is repetitive

313,this game makes my booty hole wet
314,"I got this game from my parents during Christmas of 1998. My Compaq Deskpro 2000 at the time could barely run this game, but taking that tram ride for the first time has stuck in my mind as one of the most memorable video game moments of all time. There was a loading screen every 10-15 seconds during the tram ride, but it was so worth it. It wasn't until 2002 when I actually had a PC good enough to play this game fully and have enjoyed it ever since. We deserve more.

#hl3"
315,is good
316,"The good:
- Graphics are impressive for 1998, especially the weapon models
- Sound effects are good
- Game is pretty well paced and always has you moving on to something new, doesn't linger
- Satisfying combat
- Good ai on the enemy soliders

The Bad:

-Platforming leads to a lot of leaps of faith
- Alot of scripted sequences that result in instant deaths if you miss them (enemy pops out out of nowhere, floor breaks out from under you, sniper kills you from a nest)
- Game is pretty stingy with giving health versus how much damage you take. I was constantly running low on health even on normal
-Fall damage is annoying and very severe
"
317,wake up
318,based
319,"Even years later, I highly suggest giving Half-Life a play. The game has great compatibility with current systems, and the environment design - even though dated - looks great. The gameplay definitely still holds up, packed with action and countless weapons to try out on a lot of enemy variations. I highly suggest giving this game a go, especially instead of the source version. Please don't make the mistake of trying to play on hard difficulty, as huge difficulty spikes are around every corner."

325,"microwaved casserole.

played through it multiple times, its aged very well for how old it is and the gameplay feels like it hasnt aged a bit.
its got some clunkyness with age, like the physics objects and the way it tries to hog fullscreen, but aside from that the worst you have is that the game doesnt pull punches, its still a fun challenge.

for 1998 definetly a masterpiece, and for 2022 still definetly a solid 7/10."

 [b] I strongly recommend it [/b]"
380,"This game can be annoying, frustratingly trial and error and an evil bastard but you will love it for it.
half-life has lots of charm, has incredible gameplay, some great (if obtuse) level design and alot of memorable moments
its one of my favourite survival shooters, only rivalled by prey 2017 and duke nukem 3D."
381,it's pretty good
382,"The game has aged as much as you'd expect for a title over 2 decades old.
Still, play this if you want to experience some of videogame history.
It's good for its time, and it shows the industry has learned a few good lessons in game design since."
383,"It really stands well for its age, especially the Grunt AI thing. Also I highly recommend checking the modded community, there are many good mods, especially for people wanting more of Half-Life!"

389,Worst game I've ever played.
390,amazing
391,"I was surprised how well this actually aged. The movement especially didn't age very well, which is a shame because there is a lot of platforming. Thankfully you've got tools like quick saves and quick loads and, if you really have to, console commands to get around parts that are a bit rough around the edges. Other than that though, I don't really have many gripes. It's a good action game with some unsettling atmosphere."

401,game is older than allot of other games but still is better than box opening simulator 2022.
402,Oldie but a goodie
403,"Legendary game. The oldness factor plays it's part sometimes (funnily enough im not talking about the graphics), but it is still a really good story driven singleplayer shooter.
If you want to experience the story of half-life 1 in a modern way, i heavily reccomend Black Mesa, really well made remake.


(And if you're here for funny screaming scientists then this is the right place.)"
404,amazing.
405,I love This Game! It has Nice Gameplay But Old Graphics But It Doesnt Matter! The Game Has A Millon Mods!
406,game changing
407,An absolute must-play old-school classic shooter
408,Best game in history of mankind.
409,"How do you review a game which was one of the most innovative games of its time?  One of the best things I can say is that it still holds up as a great game even today.  Great action, great exploration and puzzle solving. A bit of good old humor.  A game rich in content and lengthy game play.  I've been playing recently on the steam deck.  It takes a bit of tweaking of the UI to get the controls to work well, but once you have a good setup the game plays like it did in the 90's.  It's the epitome of fun and I would recommend this game to everybody who enjoys great nostalgic games and appreciates innovative games of their time."
410,"Half-Life is an action shooter (yes there's a lot of shooting, but there's autoaim for some guns don't worry) with an OK story and a fairly significant puzzle-solving element. And honestly, I had good fun playing it, despite the ancient graphics and audio. The closest I'd come to Half-Life before this was GMod, but that didn't make a difference. It's decently long, too, about 10-15 hours' worth.
Many parts of the game feel impossible (they're not) or like you're doing something the wrong way (if it works it works), which are both uncomfortable feelings. As is typical with older games, you kinda have to figure things out for yourself.
Nevertheless, I had a fair few hours of fun with this game. 8/10

* audio & video: toaster
* computer requirements: potato
* plot: fine
* music: good
* gameplay: good
* length: decent"

416,HALF-LFIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
417,One of the best games ever made thats pacing and level design as well as the revealing of the story is nearly perfect... play garfield cart instead
418,Good
419,pretty good
420,A masterpiece but a curse at the same time because once you play this fps most of the other fps (even modern ones) are going to feel boring and lackluster.
421,FREEMAN YOU FOOL!
422,This game is legendary dont buy source he is bad remaster but the original half life is a giga chad game
423,Don't turn on Widescreen when its in full screen
424,"Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon astronauts; however, since the release of ""The Skeld"" spaceship, three other maps have been added in later years: the skyscraper ""MIRA HQ"", the ""Polus"" planetary station, and ""The Airship"" (based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles‚Äîmost are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors‚Äîwhich does not alter their appearance.[d] The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that is not resolved in time.
"
425,this game is so fucking stupid but incredibly fun cuz u pew pew and everyone doesn't die still but it good fun 10/10
426,iM STUCK AND ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH
427,"Half Life is just a cult classic 

after 24 years its still a pretty good shooter and it holds its title to this day.
so anyway, if you want to buy it then go ahead just remember its very old game

if you like half life but youre not fan of very old games then i recommend black mesa
i played it and trust me its a very good remaster

https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/

but just remember...

Never EVER buy Half Life: Source
That game is like Valve just replaced Goldsource with Source engine and never playtested it
just play original Half Life over it instead!

but overall Half Life is a good game despite being 24 years old
9.8/10 good game


"
428,It's Half-Life.
429,very fun
430,HAIF-LIFE IS AMAZING
431,this game is still a 10/10 in 2022 and aged quite well
432,it good :)
433,pretty good but its best to get source
434,goron
435,lasers what could it mean
436,Gordon Freeman shoot very fun jump crowbar cool haha
437,"WORTH. EVERY. CENT. Even though this game is 24 years old(as of writing this review), it's still amazing. I can just imagine how big of a breaktrough this must have been back in the 90s. The story is compeling, the gameplay is solid and overall it's very immersive. 10/10 would play again.
#rememberfreeman"
438,"Good game, but I'm not afraid to admit that I find it overrated "
439,"very funny polygons, would recommend üíÄüíÄüíÄ"
440,very gud gam and headcrabs walk on 2 legs
441,"Circa 2003 I had the luxury of being a 10 year old choosing between re-released boxed copies of Half Life and Deus Ex; I chose half life and it easily became my fondest game purchase. It's hyperbolic and cringey to throw 'best game evar' around and I dont think it is, but I do feel I should thank it for shaping my tastes for years to come and it is a classic for a reason.

Playing it again on the hardest difficulty with Re-Shade CRT filters, low res with chunky pixels and a bag of weed is some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time, and my fondness and appreciation for it has only grown.

The fact it still gets memes and fan animations to this day means it's never escaped my attention; I don't think a day goes by without one of those highly quotable scientist VA lines entering my head like ""Have you seen my coffee cup?"" If a game has that kind of presence in my life to that degree, it deserves to be near the top of my favorite games list, and it is.

Half Life, Doom 2 and Deus-Ex are essential installs and I cant imagine owning a PC without having all 3 installed at all times. They can run on toasters and cost as little as a star bucks coffee, there isn't much of an excuse to not try them."
442,"Still fun to play. If you have not, you should try it. Tons of mods to enjoy."
443,its a good game but its pretty hard
444,"I do not get paid enough for this shit.

Fun/10"
445,"Stop looking at reviews, just buy it already."
446,You do get to play half of a life of a person so it good. (I need to get original with jokes)
447,This is genuinely one of my favourite games I have ever played
448,good.
449,"This game is a masterpiece. It may be old, but its honestly great."

458,gidin freeman killed everyone. Kill Them All.
459,"I think that Half-life changed the way video games were made forever after it released. It is one of the most perfect games anyone will ever play in their lives. It changed the way developers wrote their stories, programmed their weapons, make their models and to make a game that will appease people. Half-life in this case was the first game to ever do that."

But in 2016, august i found out XASH3D-FWGS engine, that is compatible with goldSource, cross platform, made by few peoplw from Ukraine and Russia. I wanted to play Counter Strike 1.6 on my tablet, that my mom bought me, and found out, that there is a Half Life game client too, i played this from 2016 since now, and it is made Half Life, especially HLDM, one of my favourite games

495,It's Half-Life. Yes.
496,I pee in the shower
497,OK so this may be one of the most genre shaping fps games of the 90's. Aside from DOOM or Blood this game focuses on a narrative that doesn't take away control from the player and incorporates little bits of puzzles and physics which make for some of the most memorable set pieces in games at the time. The game doesn't sacrifice speed and the combat is frantic and is in my opinion the best middle ground of modern and classic styled fps combat with an interesting arsenal of weapons. However there I one thing that I think prevents me from playing it again and thats all of the end game chapters. After Surface tension the game falls off for me at the end with encounters feeling more like a slog as it goes on. Thats to be expected given that the guy who made the hardest commercially released DOOM expansion worked on this made the worst most dickish levels in an fps and that's Xen. Xen on paper sounds cool but it just does not want you to have fun in any capacity. Fuck especially the xen factory and the final Boss the nyalynth or however you spell it. Xen is the decay constant in half life to put it in an esoteric sense and makes me not want to play this game. Still give it a play through and on the rare occasion you feel like playing it again use console commands to skip the intro.
498,greatest game ever
499,I [b] am [/b] rather looking forward to [i] this [/i] analysis...

501,"Movement too slidey and like Doom, but it's not meant to play like that.  
Innovative for sure, but today it's janky and impricise."
502,"The original masterpiece that is as entertaining in single player as all the 'let's play' videos play it out to be, and stands well 20 years after it was released. 

Multiplayer is very fast passed, difficult if you're not already skilled at rapid-fire games. Could really use a team arena mode... then again, what is Counter Strike?"
503,It's old and it shows
504,Too    much    lag.
505,fun classic game
506,Back to the Childhood :)
507,"Childhood memories right here.

 10/10"
508,This game is part of me forever.
509,"(Note: the most of my HL1 experience comes from older and Steam-free builds of the game)

I am not going to say what everyone has already said about the main campaign and so I'll do a short review of the lesser-talked-about HL1 multiplayer.

HL1 multiplayer is incredibly high-octane and chaotic with higher player count. Mechanically, it's very much focused on smooth and unrestricted movement, as well as playing to the strengths of your current arsenal of weapons. Movement strongly prevails over aiming in this game so the duels when both sides don't have instakill/overpowered weapons are stupidly fun. It's very enjoyable to play from time to time if you're an experienced movement shooter player (moreso if you've been playing GoldSrc + Source games for all your life) but your mileage may vary if you're not.

I recommend giving this OG of arena shooters a try. Despite the age and somewhat shallow playerbase, it's not completely filled with pros who have 10+ years of experience so chances are you'll stumble across a lot of casual players who are also here to screw around in a janky but oddly fun GoldSrc multiplayer game.

P.S. I highly recommend looking up crosshair and playermodel colour fix mods even if you don't plan on becoming a multiplayer pro as those provide reasonable quality-of-life changes without making the game look too exotic and non-native."
510,"This game may be old but I think it's gameplay aged very well, I've played through the campaign almost 3 times now and still having fun."
511,one of the coolest and most innovative games of all time. one of my all time favorites

520,"Half-Life is a classic! I highly recommend the experience, it's both challenging & fun as a first person shooter. The control is very straight-forward, if you know much about modern FPSes, you should get the controls right away. The walking is a little slippery, but you get used to it. The best part is the interesting enemy design! Some are difficult to beat at first, but you'll become a pro by the end of it! Overall, great experience, I highly recommend!"

538,"- Half-Life is the defacto standard by which all first-person shooters are compared to. And as far as I'm concerned, nothing has come close to it since then. Its influence is so widespread that you'd be hard-pressed to find a PC player who hasn't played it. It's a title that was ahead of it's time, and still continues to hold its own in modern day. It also served as the platform of being the most influential title for the modding community, give way to the likes of Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, and Team Fortress to name a few. It is one of my most played PC games of all time. I have a lot more time in Half-Life than what Steam gives me credit for, as I was playing it before Steam counted play time.

If you're looking to play this on Linux, Valve has provided a native version."

Half-Life is not just a game, it is The Game, the one that really started it all.
Sure there were games before it but. Half-Life showed the world what games could be and changed the entire industry.

I can't wait to see the Half-Life world again I just hope its in my life and I can grow old enough to see it.

Ok, I'm surprised that it's a great game before 2000, I write this review after finishing the story mode of the game, eliminating the final boss with his yellow stones with his spawns, although I passed it in easy mode, it's my first time, ha been difficult for me, it's a bit difficult if it's my first time, I've had many deaths... I'm not going to lie to you, I think my opinion of passing the game saving enough resources, life and suit energy, for the end and have a lot of aim at the bugs that fly, because they take away a lot of life.

Do I recommend this game? - clearly yes
Now, after all this game... I'm going to finish Half Life 2 full.

Est√° bien, me sorprende que sea un buen juegazo antes del 2000, escribo esta rese√±a despu√©s de acabar el modo historia del juego, eliminando al jefe final con sus piedritas amarillas con sus spawns, aunque lo pas√© en modo facil, es mi primera vez, me ha costado, es un poco dificil si es mi primera vez, muchas muertes he tenido... no te lo voy a enga√±ar, creo que mi opini√≥n de pasarse el juego guardando bastantes recursos, vida y energ√≠a del traje, para el final y tener mucha punter√≠a a los bichos que vuelan, porque quitan bastantes vida.

Really made the experience BETTER. I like the part where choosing EASY mode does nothing. go buy it! very worht, much good.k

644,I had high expectations of this legendary game. I thought I would enjoy it based on the charm of it being such an old game which is nostalgic for many people. What I didn't expect is that it would hold up so well and force me to sink hours into it each day until I finished.
645,"I hated those fucking fish monsters. I, for a lack of better words, literally pissed myself every time i had to go into the water to fight one.
I will never forget the first time. The cage hanging above the water, the scientist warning me about it, the crossbow in said cage. Walking towards it and grabbing it only for the cage to break and drop me into the water. Watching it swim towards me as I equipped one of my guns. Trying to fire at it only for nothing to happen. Cycling through all of my guns to try and somehow kill it and save me from the hell known as 'the underwater level' but nothing worked. Watching as it shredded me as I stood there, unable to do anything but watch.
Every time I saw one after that I felt a sense of pure dread despite now knowing how to kill it.

(didn't want to search to much, as to not ruin the experience). Overall, very fun game, pretty good graphics for when it came out (1998 i think), and posed a challenge, as it wasn't clear on where you needed to go sometimes. I give it a 10/10!"

695,"One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

718,I've played this game since the early 2000's. We had no internet back then so this record breaker event may as well be my very first time playing in online deathmatch. I even held top spot for a good 10 minutes in a full 32 player server and I recorded all of it. It's a nice memorabilia for experiencing what I've been missing out back then.

836,"6.5/10

I love retro games and I played half life ps2 version way back in the day. I hardly remember any of it but I do remember thinking it was groundbreaking even though playing the ps2 version which came out a while after the pc version. somehow, playing through this again just didn't provide me with the same sort of nostalgia I get when i revisit other games. It was a decent game but it's filled with annoyances. Still a good game and as the first ""modern day"" fps it is a very important game for history but I just don't think it's aged as well as other fps games.
Well worth a playthrough for anyone who's never played it though and I'm in the minority here probably so you might enjoy it a lot more than I did."
837,#RememberFreeman
838,It is Half-life
839,"I played the Half-life: Day One pre-release demo back in 1998.
To this day, not a year has passed in which I haven't played one or more of the half-life games.

Only rarely have modern shooters come close to the level of immersion and quality set by the original Half-life and all of its successors.

If you haven't played Half-life, then give it a go. It's never too late to discover this game - heck, even after 25 years the gameplay does not feel outdated, the game runs well, and the story is still unrivaled!"

The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries."
880,great. half life 3 soon plsssss
881,"The game is great, I personally love the nostalgic feel of it. However, the experience most of the time is quite frustrating. It's really easy to get lost, or just not be able to find what the heck you need to do, most of the time it's not very obvious (at least for me).

Please consider playing Black Mesa instead, because it is literally HL but better in every possible way."

888,"There's either something wrong with my installation, otherwise I just don't get it. The game is almost unplayable. Strafe is too sensitive. Options seem to indicate that you can look up or down with the mouse but that doesn't fucking work either. Everything about the control is complete fucking garbage. This game is the same era as quake and there's just no comparison, Quake shits all over this game in every single measurement; sound, control, graphics. It makes this game look like a steaming turd."
889,IT IS FUN AF
890,A MUST play for FPS enjoyers
891,This is a
892,buy it it's worth it
893,Gordon... FREEMAN
894,"my favourite part was when gordon freeman said ""its half-living time"" and half-lived all over the headcrabs."
895,"What is there to say, really? Half Life is a classic, and every true fan of FPS should play it. Yes, graphics and game mechanics are dated (and the GoldSRC engine has some weird bugs, especially after quicksaving), but it's a game from the 90's. Computers had a lot less to work with then. AI can be goofy too (especially when marines frag themselves with their own grenades), but enemies still pose a challenge.

I've always liked 90's shooters. Half Life is no exception. Half Life  blends strategy and fast paced movement. You are rewarded for planning ahead, using cover effectively, and utilizing your full arsenal (like planting traps with laser mines, or using the guass to bounce shots off walls or blast guys behind cover). Some of the Xen levels drag a bit but overall it's good fun.

All in all, this is a must-play. It all began here, in the halls of Black Mesa. Go hit some headcrabs with a crowbar.

P.S. As a Linux gamer, I really appreciate that Valve has made so many titles playable on Linux. Here's hoping to see even more in the future. :)"
896,a true classic.
897,"The year is 1998, a very special era in gaming history, Sony and Nintendo were locked in figurative War to consistently manufacture phenomenal games to captivate their audiences, (A feat they both outdid, and continuously bettered time after time). Quite a wonder then how a small, unheard of studio nobody had ever heard of made history with a debut release, simply known as Half-Life.
    There's nothing else to say other than: Iconic. Even when I didn't have a PC, The name Half-Life was always present in my head. after a long time, I finally decided to play Half-Life last summer after a friend gifted it to me. While I had played my fair share of icons and legends, games like Halo, etc. Even then this game surprised me. In Half-Life: you play as the famously muted scientist Gordon Freeman. blasting through droves of zombies and aliens felt fresh and unique, despite being almost like every shooter in existence. (other than valves iconic no-zoom) Everything about it was fresh and interesting, the phenomenal mix of shooter and puzzle, The strengths it had back in the day are the same strengths it has today. Its old, and its not a well kept secret, but that's an after thought. Half-Life captivated me. cruising through ""on a rail"" with Mathew wilder's break my stride keyboard solos playing through my mind, is a memory i will never forget, or sneaking through the environmental hazards of office will never get old. Each location felt realistic and believable, as if they belonged in an underground lab. 
    Now is Half-Life a masterpiece, No, Not really, despite the great game play and flawless build-up (not including Xen) it tended to drag on ever so slightly, especially if your opting to play its two expansions, opposing force and blue shift. But even with that, Half-Life is an undeniable must-have and must-play, even if just to see the nexus of ideas that revolutionized gaming as a whole. more than 2 decades after release, this game is nothing short of phenomenal, Luckily for fans, They wouldn't have to wait very long for more."
898,"One of the best video games ever. Seamlessly combines Platforming, Puzzle and First Person Shooter to create a survival-horror (ish) experience like no other. A big contrast to how Valve operates today. If you have a PC, you NEED to pick this up, whether it's your first time, or you want to experience a big rush of Nostalgia. And the G-Man (He goes without saying)...."

907,"This game is very old, but I think it's still worth playing. Sure, there are some parts that are too boring or too frustrating, and the game starts worsening from Xen onward. But despite all of that, it's still a pretty solid FPS overall. The story is interesting at parts, gunplay is decent and the AI isn't that bad. You'd have to be patient with it though. A few tips I recommend are, save a lot and make sure to not waste health.

(Also I played this game for the first time in 2022.)"

936,"So you've probably heard of Half-Life before. Probably heard of it a lot, in fact, it's often touted as one of the timeless classics of gaming, a watershed moment that changed the way games were made forever. But the question remains: almost 25 years after its original release, does Half-Life hold up to that reputation?

The answer is yes, very much so! To begin, it still runs just fine on Windows 10, so unlike a lot of games that are nowhere near as old, Half-Life can be purchased, installed, and played without any further effort on your part. So, if that was what caused you any hesitation, don't worry, it runs just fine and is largely free of bugs and glitches. I never had any issues when playing.

Now, moving on to the game itself...

The Good!
-Half Life holds up. No questions asked. Modern AAA titles can't hold a candle to how good and complete and whole the moment-to-moment gameplay of Half-Life is. Combat is intense but not chaotic, exploration is easy and you rarely get lost, there's basically no cutscenes that break the flow and make the player a passenger to the experience.
-Tutorials? In game? lol. This is a good thing- the game expects you to pay attention to what it shows you, and remember it moving forward. No gametips on loading screens, no tutorials in the middle of levels, nothing. This makes it a rewarding and intuitive experience!
-Fairness. Half-Life is tough, but very fair, it is only rarely that I ever felt like a failure was beyond my control. Enemies all make noises, have well-telegraphed attacks, and all have weaknesses that can be exploited to your advantage.
-An actual, honest to god save system means that whenever things get sketchy, you can just make a save. If things don't work out, loading that save is free and easy and quick. This alone makes the game much less frustrating, as losing progress to experimentation and risk-taking is not an issue.
-A coherent story told through the game itself. Things the player sees and hears as they wander the facility do much more to tell the story than any cutscenes ever could.

The Bad, because even Half-Life isn't perfect
-Health, ammo, and especially armor can be a little too scarce at times. While the issue is eased by being able to break open crates for goodies, there were more than a few occasions where I felt pressed to do really weird and tedious things to scrape by.
-The Black Mesa facility is great! What comes after is... not. I won't spoil anything, but the grand finale the game builds to is a massive let-down, a result of very rushed development. There's no shame in turning off the game once you leave the facility.


The Ugly
-Half-Life has a lot of really cool sci-fi weapons it adds to your arsenal. Odds are you won't use them because the MP5/M4 (depending on what textures you use) is easily the best gun in any situation.
-This game released in 1998, and it shows. Graphics limitations hinder it when it should be at its best, something the fan remake Black Mesa fixes. This isn't to say you should play that instead, though it is very worthy of playing, but instead that Half-Life was built around its limitations and you can feel it.
-An emphasis on ""show. don't tell"" tutorials can result in it not being very clear what you're meant to do in a few levels. Normally I could figure it out after a few minutes, but don't be shy about looking up guides for some sections.

Overall, Half-Life is easily a 10/10 game not in spite of, but because of, its imperfections. Valve knew what they had and worked around it, creating a timeless classic worthy of 12-18 hours of your time to experience. It's not perfect, but what game is? This may be as close as we'll ever get to perfection in a game, and that, I think, makes Half-Life a game you should play. Fair warning, though: it's hard to respect a lot of modern titles after playing this. There's no going back from experiencing what a first-person shooter can be when it's nothing more than a game."
937,the graphics are so shit they remind me of my fucking toaster but the game is so goated i flicked 3 zombies lololololol get better valve skill emoji x7

943,"i only speedrun the training room
i havent even completed the game"
944,
945,best game
946,TGIS GAME IS REALLY GOOD!!! you should play it.
947,GAME SUCKS COULDN'T GET UP LADDER WITH THE LEVEL WITH THEM FUCKING RED DOORS
948,"If you are going to buy any Valve game, add this one to you library first."
949,"Even though I press ""recommend the game"" I have to confess I did not have great time with it and was doing a playthrough just to get familiar with ""legendary video games series"".

I understand the universal praise the game gets and its role, influence on the scene but it is just not my cup of tea. The last levels, especially the alien areas just devastated my patience and determination. The platforming, jumping around, running, slipping off, everything was such a damn slug to force yourself through. Navigating areas became so annoying I have to admit I was on a brink of dropping game.
The mindfookery of story, atmosphere, sound work and alien thematics of levels in itself were amazing.
 
All in all, I'd recommend it if you have patience and determination and really really want to get familiar with one of the most well known games ever, then go for it. if not, then absolutely do not loathe yourself."

958,crowbar OP
959,"i have only played a bit except this has been a blast playing it, this collection of games is absolutely amazing if you want a alien shooter then this is the perfect game if i had to rate this out of ten it would be a 9/10"
960,i fucking hate this game.
961,10/10
962,A true classic never goes out of style!
963,very classic B)
964,post nut clarity
965,"[b]TOO SCARY!![/b]
so i know i have 7 hores on this game, but after the 7th i literally uninstalled on the spot. I thought this game would was gonna be just cool badass fun action like Doom, but as it turns turned out, this game is scary as FUCK! i couldnt get through half the game without my eyes close closed, there are too many JUMPSCARES! for example the ""head crabs"" in the vents (there were like 12 of those hoes), but the thing that made me uninstall on the spot like i said is the big Green monster with the claws, after he killt the scientist I couldnt take it so I uninstalled. I know this games supposed to be some classic essential or something but if u cant handle the heat, don't play it.

edit: grammar and spelling, also stop leaving ""found this review funnies"", I'M SEROUSE!"
966,"good game, but don't play on hard for your first playthrough, not the most thrilling idea. I'd stick with normal."
967,fun
968,Amazing game
969,I hate Surface Tension with a deep passion.
970,Old but still gold!
971,angry nerd with goatee literally murders half of the alien population and half of the us army 10/10 but its OLD????!!!??? AND IT HAS LITERALLY 1 PIXEL RESOLUTION TEXTURES????!!!????
972,epic pew pew game
973,The game is amazing until you hit a near impossible difficulty spike and you're reminded that you're playing a late 90s PC game
974,"If ever there was a game that I thought the title ""the Citizen Kane of video games"" was an accurate description, it would be this game. Just like Citizen Kane revolutionized how stories were told in movies, Half Life revolutionized how stories were told in games. It shows how the story can unfold around you in an interactive medium rather than being shoved in your face through cutscenes. Truly a game everyone should play.
P.S. If you are a first time player, here's a tip: Don't play on hard for your first playthrough. I did and it seriously hindered my experience, as I wasn't familiar enough with the game yet. I still enjoyed the game, but still, play on normal first"
975,real bad made me sad
976,"One of the greatest and most influential games of all time. If you've never played it before, quick-saves/loads are your friend. I would recommend going into the settings and rebinding them to keys closer to WASD for easy access."
977,not my cup of tea
978,big brain baby
979,One of the most pivotal games ever released.

981,"fitting to have a gonad as a boss, since this is a progenitor of its genre;
freeman is a scientist, one who knows the physical laws of the world and seeks to know further;

982,"Good game, have to use brain sadly"
983,Really Awesome
984,"9/10
Combat is great
Literally every level was great except xen its just a really low point for this game
Lore goes hard

985,its Half-Life who does not like this game

987,"good game, not for me."
988,yesyesyesyesyesyes
989,"I LOVE this game!  The story is great.  The graphics are great.  Game play is smooth and there is no latency.  I can't wait to get started on Half Life 2 !  I highly recommend this game.  Enjoy the mayhem!  There are also tons of fun secret areas, some of which I stumbled upon and the expert players didn't even have them in their walkthroughs.  Nicely done Valve."
990,"""Don't shoot! Im with the science team!"""
991,lmao the ending screen is so cool just pitch black
992,cool shooting sim robux
993, #RememberFreeman
994,"This game is older than me but it still somehow holds up. Yeah the game looks old but don't let graphics distract you. Gameplay is still great and I didn't have any issues with that, maybe jumping was kinda hard sometimes but even newer games don't get it sometimes right. Other than that I had a great time killing big variety of aliens that the game was throwing at me. Story is small and there's a lot of mystery, but I don't think it's a weak point, there's just not much talking and most of the time you have to figure out by yourself what's going on. Overall I highly recommend it, it's not without a reason called one of the best games ever made and for it's time it sure was!"
995,"its really good
"
996,"It's a classic, revolutionary milestone for gaming. Unfortunately, it is dated mechanically (movement, physics-based puzzle-solving, combat, etc.) and doesn't have the best optimization for modern pcs and windows 10; it stutters a lot. Black Mesa is a superior experience, especially if you bring Xen to the conversation. It is still fun if you are looking for a product of the 90s era though"
997,Every character is a clone of the same 5 guys 10/10
998,"the game of all time
"
999,"""Uh...it's probably not a problem...probably...but I'm showing a small discrepancy in...well, no, it's well within acceptable bounds again."" But it WAS a problem!"
1000,old game
1001,"i almost tried jumping into a rope
then i remembered there were no ropes in this game"
1002,Oh hey mister Freeman

1044,"Playing this game gives me a massive headache and I don't know why. I had a lot of fun playing what little of it I did. I think it's the sound? I don't know, I'll try Black Mesa later and see if that works more for me.

""But if it gives you a headache why did you play it for 128 hours?""
I didn't. Steam thought I kept it open when it straight up wasn't for multiple days on end. Can't do much about it now."

1047,"Good
"
1048,Gordon Freeman is badass as fuck.
1049,Very good game. Took me forever to complete.
1050,"This game was made in 1998 and it has the jank to prove it.
Despite that fact, it IS Half Life-1 and holds alot of history in its genre and videogames as a whole.

A friend said it's kinda easy to get motion sick because of the slidey movement, so if that happens and you didn't exceed 2 hours don't feel too bad about missing out on this game.

there's a Remake called Black Mesa that is considerably more modern and made by fans.
Up until the end it's very faithful to this game and is in my honest completely anecdotal opinion a better experience across the board.

Otherwise, I'd recommend you play this first. It's an amazing experience seeing the leap in technology first hand and playing BM first would sorta muddle the waters."
1051,yes
1052,"-Really exciting story but inefficient storytelling
-Awesome gameplay and fluent combat
-Multiplayer is funny and popular
-Still playable in 2022 and very cheap
"
1053,"I died cheap for zen, una, and a bad relationship, but true good outweighs bad."
1054,good game :)
1055,the game that started it all
1056,do not play on hard
1057,"Half-Life, one of the best game series ever made.

This game still manages to hold up even after all this time, maybe not graphically but gameplay and mechanics wise. The gunplay is great, the A.I feels fun to play against, and the story is interesting enough to keep you playing and wanting to discover more about Xen, ""G-Man"", and the Black Mesa facility."
1058,Half Life? i sure hope it does!
1059,Amazing Pretty Hard Wise they would give rules to help u in the challenges
1060,fun in vr

1067,Best game
1068,"while the graphics have aged like skim milk, the presentation of the the game is top notch and impressive for 1998. once you get around the old graphics, the game is very immersive and still has effective environmental storytelling. while the shooting and the guns are mediocre, the gameplay is very well paced and very fun.

1103,"The mf's posting whole essays in their negative reviews have no taste in videogames.  One of the most goated shooters of its time, go play it."
1104,"I was planning on skipping this title and watching a letsplay so I could jump straight to Half-Life 2. I was more interested in the story and I knew the slippery controls would be a pain in my ass, but on a whim, I decided, ""eh fuck it, might as well play it"" and I am so glad that I did. While yes, the platforming sucks ass, I can't deny that this game is super fun. The puzzles were super rewarding to solve and I easily found myself immersed in the dark halls of Black Mesa. I can't believe it took me this long to finally play this gem. I adored the ending and I am so excited to play the second game!"
1105,"So cool, right? Theres a bug that made jumpy pads broken and i almost couldnt beat the game. Otherwise. SHooty shooty boom boom. Look Gordon Ropes!"

1115,KURVA BUGOS DE JO
1116,i dont own the game and i can write a review on it B)
1117,"hello gordon,"
1118,"Weird story, cranky controls, lota(lota) guns, scary aliens, strange bosses.., stupid jumpscares makes this game a masterpiece. Released in 1998 and still fun to play!
10/10 Story."
1119,ass
1120,letter green
1121,"A real classic and super glad to have played this. It really is amazing to consider that this game was released in the 90s, it has more variety and excitement than many games released recently. 

I only experienced one real game-breaking bug where I got stuck in a door on the train ride, but fortunately this was early on in the first level so I could just restart. Every other part of the game played perfectly on a modern machine."
1122,"I never played the first 4 half life games until now, in fact as the writing of this review, I have not even finished half life 1 (I got the bundle including blue shift and opposing force btw) this is because I was born right after half life 2 came out, and I played that on the orange box, good times. But besides that, half life 1 so far is probably one of my personal favs atm. I am currently at ""Forget Freeman!"". I don't know anything about opposing force or blue shift or decay, but I can say that half life 1 is probably my second favorite valve game, first is of course half life 2. But, please, PLEASE, get this game. It is so worth it, in fact, get the half life complete bundle to get all the games. So worth it. (also, the reason I have so much hours already, is because I have restarted 5 times due to disatisfaction of my playthroughs. That does not mean its a bad game by the way! I just think that I could have done something better, or just because I like the earlier chapters a lot more. Also,' on a rail ' sucks but I'm not here to talk about that.)"
1123,"Half-Life is truly a masterpiece of a series, and that statement still shines true in the first game. For 1998 this is still holding up today and has aged like fine wine."
1124,"Half life is a classic game, still holding its great reputation status for decades. You would be crazy to not know this game. 10 out of 10 rating!"
1125,half
1126,"Look gordon, Ropes!! we can use these to help with pits!!!"
1127,try sex mod
1128,"its a very good game but there's one chapter that makes me want to punch a computer, the blast pit, i mean i consider it impossible because you have to avoid 3 unkillable tentacle monster which if it already is hard it gets harder if you finish powering the rocket and opening the fan you have to go back to where you started and press the test fire button but it doesn't work and so i tried and tried until i googled how to press the button and some guy had the same problem and a girl (maybe) said there's panels somewhere and pipes that you need to follow and i was so confused because i couldn't find the panels nor the pipes. but it will probably still be a fun game after the impossible chapter."
1129,still holds up
1130,"Damn, who know blasting aliens and humans would be so fun! i recommend this game!"
1131,This one hits different when you finally own this game after a decade of playing it to your family computer
1132,I beat my son. He is now only clinging by a half life. Thanks Valve.
1133,changed a whole industry with a small team

1170,how the fuck do i have 249 hours in this game
1171,"this is epic, it's my first pc game"
1172,"This game is a masterpiece, the way it tells its story is amazing, it only takes the player out of their controls once, and even that's debatable, the gameplay is amazing, and after finishing this game on the hard difficulty I felt so accomplished. 

If you want to shoot your way through inter-dimensional aliens, special forces marines, and fight your way through vents with a crowbar, this game is for you."

Story: 11/10
the story is amazing, and its environment tells its story just as well the game-play dose, you a worker at black mesa gets into a [u]freak disaster[/u] and survive with [strike]just a crowbar[/strike]

Multiplayer: 8.5
the multiplayer is rough around the edges but other than that i learned how to play in about two minutes, how ever there is not a hole lot of players playing anymore but do check it out once in a while ""who know's"" you might find some"

1205,fun game good graphics especially for 1998 if you like fps games this is a must play!
1206,"this game is pretty hard later on but it is still fun, although i dont think it has aged that well, especially compared to half life 2
still a good game though"

But goddamn Xen is annoying"
1208,"bouuuuw, doooow bou now"

1210,"Even 24 years after its release, Half-Life's gameplay is still one of the greatest by far; the story is perfectly crafted, the characters are lovable, and the enemies, while somewhat frightening to new players, are still incredibly fun to play against."
1211,I didn't know dev added HD models. Looks better than I remember.
1212,"This was sitting in my steam library for just short of ten years.. I decided to finally play it. I really enjoyed this game. The old graphics are cool, and the gameplay is an enjoyable mix of FPS and puzzles. I enjoyed the story and how it unfolds. There are not many cutscenes,  most of the story plays out with the characters and action right in front of you, with you still in control. 
TL;DR: You can hit the boxes rapidly with the crowbar, and it makes a funny sound. 10/10"
1213,"Classic first person shooter still a great game in 2022...""Have I been that much of a burden?"""
1214,I honestly cannot fathom how people played this back then. Black Mesa is a much more enjoyable experience if you want to play Half Life
1215,big caulk
1216,Awesome classic ground breaking game for its time. Even with current gen games it still holds up! Definitely worth a play if you've never played it before.

1230,"I know I will get a lot of hate for this, but I can't recommend this game 25 years after release.

I'm sure everyone who played it when it came out thought it was a masterpiece, and I'm sure it was for it's time. Unfortunately it's aged like milk.

Pros: Okay'ish gameplay and story (ended in cliffhanger)

Cons: Movement
Combat
Bossfights
No help at all. Not even how some of the weapons work differently (Like laser tracker for the rocket launcher and how to remove it)
Saves are useless. You'll always be pulled back 10 minutes of your progress because some enemy was hiding inside a wall or blew you up because the scripted event came too late...

I will unfortunately give this one a 1/10. 
I can't remember the last time I was frustrated by how badly a game was. Again, 25 years ago I'm sure it was the best. But now it's really bad in comparison. An updated Half Life would have been nice, not remaster but updated controls, removed glitches, crashes and better saves."

If there's anything I want VR for, it's to replay the original, goldscr half-life in a way that can match my original memory of it."

A true 1998 classic with a great soundtrack and a great story with engaging gameplay."
1275,Hahaha boom boom monsters
1276,"The world of gaming splits into two defined eras - pre Half-Life and post Half-Life.
That's how revolutionary this game was in 1998.
If you find it hard to play games with dated graphics, I would highly suggest picking up Crowbar Collective's 'Black Mesa', a graphical remaster of this game."
1277,Good
1278,ICON
1279,"Gameplay - 8/10
This game has, somehow, one of the most addicting gameplay loops ever, even if it is incredibly simple and sometimes annoying

Graphics - 9/10
For the time, its probably the best looking game in 1998

Performance - 10/10
This game would run on a roll of Cellotape and still be able to get 16.234859fps

Story - 6/10
Its a pretty engaging story and is probably the first game to have a story that doesnt develop around you, but in front of you

Price
This game is worth the price of ¬£7.99

Overall, This game is worth it to anyone who wants a fun 7-10 hours of fun that sets up the whole story of Half-life 2"
1280,There's a reason why people say this was revolutionary to the industry.
1281,i have nearly 14 hours in this game and i have only just gotten on to the 13th chapter of the game. other than that its an all time classic that everyone should play
1282,a cool sci-fi game. i am amazed!
1283,you know it's good
1284,my love
1285,"Put yourself into a 90's mindset, and experience just how mind blowing this game really is."
1286,I wanted to see what the hype was about.  the game was pretty good for a older game.
1287,Half Life Mesaposting sent me here
1288,"While dated, its important to the history of games, and is something everyone should play at one point, but if you the extra cash, black mesa is a great remake."
1289,"Best game ever.
Wish games like this were still made, no offence to other games creators."
1290,"This game is so good it needs a sequel, ahem  ""Full Life""."
1291,i mean i got a couple so not really a half life kinda misleading of a game name
1292,It's FUN!
1293,a
1294,go outside and get milk
1295,"This is a timeless classic. I just recently got the game and I just beat it. The story is awesome with a pretty good mystery, it doesn't hold your hand whatsoever, and it's only aged in visuals, however that's not a problem. It was extremely influential, and chances are if you've played an fps game, it was somehow influenced by Half Life. I recommend Normal Difficulty, since that gave a really good challenge but didn't make me rage-quit. All in all, a solid 9/10."
1296,"one of the games ever made

ok jokes aside this was a revolutionary game for its time and i love the old style graphics"
1297,like 5 pixels
1298,"the best classic 90s shooter experience out there. the story is amazing and holds up very well, some parts are a drag like- literally any of the cart segments but other than that this is a solid W"
1299,I dislike the G-man
1300,"Had a long parragraph typed but deleted it, to lazy to re-type it. Gud game, 10/10, would show my grandchidlrens children when the flying car is made."
1301,"christ i suck at this game

edit: I finally beat that STUPID fucking baby piece of shit and it was ok"
1302,It's Half-Life
1303,the kids had their fun now its time for the grown ups
1304,Look Gordon! Ropes!
1305,"this game is overrated yet it deserves all of it.  You can't call yourself a gamer without playing this game.  Its super special to me and alot of other people.  This game changed how I look at gaming as a whole.  It changed gaming forever, Its legendary."
1306,its half-life
1307,fun
1308,"Half Life is a classic game. For its time, the Half Life series was revolutionary in its gameplay mechanics and design. The graphics are somewhat dated, but playing for the first time recently, it was still a good time. 

"
1309,"crashes way to often, and thats not even mentioning the horrible bugs still in the game."
1310,"Fun game, made me invent new"
1311,Pretty sure my dad told me something like this happened at work.
1312,"When i was a child, i was feeling so stress and pain the beginning scene that guards die. Now, i grow up and i'm feeling the same. Something never changes."
1313,It's half-life. It's amazing.
1314,"It's fun for many, and its design is really good, but for newcomers to Half Life, I think Black Mesa is better."
1315,BEST!
1316,EY ABOUT WHITE MESA
1317,cool i guess. xen sucks and so does on a rail.
1318,it good
1319,"real fun game
have played it 3 times
i loved every playthrough
the only problem is the graphics but the game was made in 1998 so i wont give it too much on that."
1320,d
1321,"good shit, will run on your potato"
1322,Gud.
1323,Modded my game so that when you put on the suit it plays 3 hours of ripsquad beats
1324,"i think i unbound e, that thing must be costing a fortune"
1325,Made me hate bugs 10 times more than ever. I literally get fight or flight for a milisecond when I look at a bug flying around the room now. Also the platforming feels like Gordon has ice skates on. The game with its many branching paths and secrets is superb for something made before the 2000s though
1326,"A classic, still great fun."
1327,yeah i liked it
1328,"This Game Is old but its still fun in 2022, heck,  the game came out in 1998 or something. but a 24 year old game can be fun even with bad graphics :)  100% Recommended"

1334,"again, a valve game ahead of its time
but too outdated for someone llke me
"
1335,This game is hard.
1336,Played as a kid on PS2 and it's still as fun as it ever was. A true classic.
1337,it's a pretty good game
1338,It's a very interesting game with a interesting story but also pretty difficult but I think it's worth trying but maybe start on easy mode if new to the game which is what I did and even then still it's hard but probably worse on a higher difficulty other than that the game is really fun especially if you like fps and challenging games
1339,"Classic FPS from when you could have a deep story AND fun gameplay. You should definitely give it a go. 

Less glitchy than the Source port. xD"
1340,Half life just isnt that good
1341,if this is valve's first game then this is perfection!!!
1342,"get it nuff said, but really the gameplay is awesome and so is the story the controls and platforming can be stiff   or to slide-y but that's what you get when you play an old game.every now and then there is the stumping part but puzzle adventure games are puzzle adventure games but other than that,get it!"
1343,"not as good as people say it is but still good

1350,"Outstanding puzzle shooter. The game never ceases to throw you into the next stage through clever level design, demanding more and more out of the player's problem-solving, shooting, and movement skills. Additionally, the story is excellent, rewarding patient and observant players with a fleshed-out thriller that ties together all the setting elements. Definitely worth playing if you are interested in puzzles and can at least tolerate first-person shooters."
1351,very good action puzzle game
1352,borgir
1353,This game is A masterpiece!
1354,BEST GAME EVER
1355,
1356, looks pretty good can't belive this came last year
1357,"I originally gave half-life a negative review, but after finishing it and starting a second playthrough, I realized my problem was only a small part of the game. The storytelling is great - you can skip the entire story or you can stick around and listen to what people have to say. The combat is interesting as well, with several different weapons to use. My first problem lies in a series of three chapters - blast pit, power up, and on a rail. I could barely tell what I was supposed to do for most of these chapters, and I even got basically softlocked in on a rail with 1 health and enemies everywhere. I just used invincibility to get past that section. Every other chapter does a good job at telling you what to do, and they're all fun to play. We've got hostiles is a creative section in the fact that it's a big loop. The start was fun as well, where you're given just a crowbar and maybe a pistol. Also, I'm probably the only person in the history of the universe to say this, but I actually like xen. I don't see why people dislike it - All the levels are unique and fun to play in my opinion. Well, other than my experience with Gonarch - it was what I can only assume to be bugged, and I had to noclip to beat it. My second problem is that easy difficulty isn't actually easy. It's probably just me being bad at video games, but I've found myself dying several times on my first playthrough. This problem even persists in the expansions, and easy difficulty doesn't begin to be actually easy until half-life 2. Despite these problems though, I enjoyed half-life for the most part."

1364,good game till xen then garbage game but amazing if you play the black mesa sections
1365,"I just completed Half-Life 1 for the first time. It was very fulfilling to do so. I usually get stuck sort of early on in the game, but this time I powered through and am very happy I did so. I recommend this game. 

The start is incredibly powerful and an absolutely iconic scene of Gaming. The following levels are equally strong, although as I am sure we all know, On A Rail can prove to be a very contentious level. I didn't mind it too much, but honestly just abandon the little traincart, making your way on foot is more effective. Otherwise, the levels after that were quite great. This game is difficult though, which I think is a good thing, but one should go into the game with the idea that at some points it can be as hard as Dark Souls. 

Xen is another iffy chapter of the game. Really slogged through it using the Hivehand because I hand no proper ammo. Quicksave is your friend. I prefer HL1 Xen over Black Mesa Xen, beause it lasts only an hour which I find a lot more tolerable than Black Mesa's Xen. The Nihilanth fight in HL1 kinda sucked because there isn't a clear aim, but die enough and you'll figure it out. Again, I quicksaved a bunch in this game and I'm not ashamed of doing so. 

To conclude, I think anyone and everyone should play this game, and I think it is a good game. However, I'm not delusional and it's clear that in some aspects the game has grown quite clunky. Got into playing it properly commited and willing to put in the effort, and you'll be rewarded with the wisdom Half-Life can give you."

1404,"People will hate me for this, however, i didnt enjoy Half-Life.

I got stuck multiple times, as in, IN the ground or an elevator.
Multiple times i got lost in the level, because you need to go to a specific place, that doesn't stand out at all. An example of it, is the ""surface tension"" level with the broken building, where you need to jump to a doorway. However, there is a 2nd one, where there's nothing in it, so you just assume there is nothing. 

But yeah... I can see how it was better earlier."
1405,"The Game would have been fine if it wasnt so outdated, running it on a modern pc is awful since the game randomly just stops working, for a few seconds, and the audio is obnoxius, play black mesa if you want to experience what ppl felt when they played halflife when it was first released"

tiene sus contras bastante grandes: el sistema de guardado es nefasto, asi que asegurate de andar guardando manualmente porque vas a estar perdiendo horas de progreso de lo contrario. las fisicas y movimiento pueden sentirse algo surrealistas, y por momentos sentis que no estas en control del todo de gordon. la pelea con el monstruo de tres garras es la peor ""boss battle"" que jugue en mi vida.

pero de lo contrario me parece un muy buen juego. half life revoluciono el estilo de contar una historia, y es uno de los juegos mas importantes de la historia. must play"

1447,no alien sex
1448,godly piece of work considering it was released in 1998
1449,"This game has a very well crafted atmosphere. It feels like you are experiencing something nobody else could comprehend. The lab environment is almost other worldly, full of strange rooms and surrounded by locations that fill you with questions.
The idea of scientists accidentally unleashing alien creatures into this world is a great concept. But I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed when it was revealed they already visited other worlds and even experimented on the creatures before the incident. Gotta admit it would be cooler if this was for the first time they opened this sort of portal, maybe accidentally, or they didn't realize it could be filled with dangerous creatures.

The alien designs and their combat styles are great. I must say they spooked me through the whole game. One of the reasons is a perfect sound design. It really does sound alien and very uncanny, especially houndeye. Even when I didn't consider them to be very dangerous, they still made me feel uneasy just because of the noises they made.
I feel like this game did its best to be scary without trying too hard. Maybe the older graphics contributed, I do have to say I feel like the graphics just fit this game perfectly. I would say it's very ingenious design-wise, they knew what they could create and chose the best possible setting.

Gameplay-wise, there were some parts the game could get a bit challenging, but that's one of the best things about older games ‚Äì not expecting the player to be a total dumbass. Also, clearing the challenges was satisfying, because the story was interesting and I just wanted to see more. The aliens got progressively stronger, constantly bringing new enemy types, and I really enjoyed that. I do have to say I preferred battling the aliens than H.E.C.U. though. They just got a bit boring after some time.

There's a wide variety of weapons and I think they were all well-balanced as I constantly swapped them around. Getting some alien weaponry was cool as well. The hive-hand was super fun to use, even thought it sometimes murdered some guard I needed to progress.
I just really enjoyed this setting of you travelling through this giant mysterious facility, meeting random people from time to time, trying to figure out what's going on, resolving issues and progressively realizing you aren't just trying to save yourself from aliens, but from god knows what.

Ending it off in the alien world was a great finish. Once again, a great atmosphere, well designed otherworld. Meeting the big boss aliens like Gonarch or the Nihilanth was exciting, even though the final boss wasn't as hard as I expected. But it was still a great and satisfying ending, and I wish it truly ended there. Supernatural ending for a supernatural game. I played it for the first time two weeks ago, I cannot stop thinking about it, and I would rather pretend it doesn't have a sequel, which I played after.

Also, bullsquid is the best creature. Why there's no official bullsquid merch is beyond me.

1453,the game is a classic and revolutionary
1454,"What more needs to be said? Game still holds up to this day, and is a helluva fun experience, but if you're someone like me who has only played more newer games compared to Half-Life (Like Bioshock for me) then prepare for hell even on normal difficulty, this game will show you why people say that games from the 19""s are significantly harder than games nowadays. I've completed games on their hardest difficulties before, and yet this game gave me hell on NORMAL difficulty. So if your'e someone who doesn't like a hard challenge and don't wanna be tested both mentally and physically, save your money for another game. But if you're on for a challenge then grab that rusty crowbar and wear your HEV suit and prepare for one helluva journey"

1466,"Just to preface my experience with this game. I was not alive before this game came out so it really means nothing to me. No nostalgia, no real knowledge of why this game is considered so great.

             --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game does not hold your hand. I made a new game and immediately realized that the game has no identifiers for things you can interact on. So, you have to look up what your key binds are in the settings. This is just flat-out poor game design. You have just loaded a new IP from a new developer, so you‚Äôll have no clue what the mechanics and nuisances of the game. They should have small pop-up notifiers to indicate that a button is pressable, a scientist is interactable, or that a door can simply be pushed open. Yes, this is a problem, you can‚Äôt tell whether a door wants you to push a button, push it open (by rubbing up against it), or wait for the sensors of automatic doors.

Dozens of times I sat wondering where I should be going, so I just end up wandering (and wasting resources). Sometimes this will lead to the proper areas, others not so much. Many times, there is a small hole in the wall, or a vent that needs to be bashed in order to proceed. These so called ‚Äúhole in the walls‚Äù do not look obvious, in fact they look like a clipping texture or a dev didn‚Äôt get the wall moved down just enough. 

Things such as tunnels have a pretty serious problem with you getting stuck on them. Even when your not in tunnels you could run up against something the wrong way and be trapped on it. This has resulted in probably a dozen reloads.

Hit detection was pretty abysmal, which I guess I should expect from a game made in 1998. But there was one instance where I unloaded a M4 rifle (all 50 shots) into a soldier‚Äôs head from point blank range. Believe me when I tell you that the crosshair on the center of the head and it did nothing‚Ä¶ 50 shots and none of them seemed to register. At that point, I knew to hop off the game for a little.

             --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With all of my gripes out the way I must commend the games creativity. The Gauss and Gluon guns were really cool to use for the first time. In general the weapon diversity is pretty great considering the release date. The mob diversity would still put modern games like Destiny to shame. Each one has its own mannerisms that distinguish themselves from another.

Honestly, it‚Äôs worth a try at $0.99 USD. Just keep in mind that some of the game doesn't hold up to modern standards. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad game, it just needs a little patience. 

Something I don‚Äôt have‚Ä¶"
1467,"Great game, can be confusing but overall it's a fun game"
1468,gorgon freshman
1469,i am way too invested into the lore of this game
1470,"I wanted so badly to like Half Life. I really, really did. But I just can't. And it has nothing to do with the graphics, the clunky aiming, or the ridiculously loud audio. It has to do with almost the entire last third of the game.

The first problem: Helicopters. Helicopters are just the f*#$ing worst. They have high health, and deal SO much damage. And when introduced, they, for whatever reason, are put in a spot with minimal cover. AFTER you fought your way past a horde of soldiers which you likely took a lot of damage from and lost a lot of ammo dealing with. Every time a helicopter shows up, it is either in a small area with little cover, or a large area with no cover. There is almost no in between. And the first two or three encounters, they do not give you the rocket launcher yet. They only weapon that could effectively damage them. (Side note: When introduced, they are introduced in an area where you have to swim in a large pool of water with a shark alien thing. An area that give you no ammo for the crossbow, the only weapon that can hurt them.)

Problem two: Levels past the facility (as in the section just before you see the first 'copter) began to get cluttered with enemies, and the levels began to get... worse. It felt like Valve started to run dry on ideas after that point and just kinda slapped random levels together and dropped in enemies for the sake of not boring the player. They aren't repetitive but just annoying. The puzzles at times made no sense, enemies were in really annoying places, etc etc. 

Problem three: The entirety of Xen. There is not a SINGLE good thing I could say about Xen. But I can say plenty of bad;
One- They introduce a new enemy type out of nowhere. Flying aliens that shoot little balls at you. They aren't that bad alone, but for some reason, Valve decided to shove them in areas that are cramped and full of enemies. Or if they aren't cramped spots, they are in areas that have no way of dodging them. Like say a floating platform with no where to run to without losing all your health. They are often shoved in places full of vortigaunts, a high damage high range enemy. (There's a section that is a cramped, tiny hallway full of egg things that if shot, release heavy enemies too along with vortigaunts, which is a horrible spot and I hope whoever made it regrets it for eternity). Also they are floaty, and while their projectiles are slow, they often can't be focused on and will catch you off guard.
Two: The levels. The levels are just so stupidly laid out. They are frustrating, confusing, and overall unclear. A lot of areas are tightly compacted and full of enemies.
Three: The gonarch fight. Nothing to really say here. Confusing and annoying. That's it.
Four: The bossfight- The boss fight is horrible. There is no way around it. It is horrible. The boss (I am honestly not in the mood to look up the name) teleports you around to different areas. Areas with enemies that can waste your ammo. Killing it took me like an hour (granted, this is my fault. I didn't realise you had to destroy the crystals. I had just gotten off the anxiety trip that was the last like two hours so I wasn't thinking clearly) and once I did figure it out, it was still frustrating to deal with the summoning of the flying pricks constantly, and the never ending teleporting. It was one big shit show from beginning to end, and none of it felt rewarding. I wasn't glad to beat the boss, I was glad that it was over. I wasn't getting that bittersweet feeling of the journey coming to a close. All I felt was relief that this horrid anxiety filled hell trip was finally over. (Apologies if my structuring is wonky. I am a bit tired, and equally stressed, so a clear head is not exactly what I have right now)"

1478,"I had a good swim in some green colored water, although my skin started blistering afterwards, but thats probably not related."
1479,"Classic Gameplay that reminds me of when I would play on my old nintendo.
Fast and to the point action, with puzzles you need to discover in order to move forward. cool game."

Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"
1516,its an amazing game although the parkour part in the final boss gave me 3 STDs and turned me into a discord mod plz send help
1517,"Finished Half-Life and honestly, I can't say I was too enthralled while playing the game but honestly now that I've sat here in this Jump-filled black void of an end screen I can safely say with 100% certainty that this game is fantastic and I do not regret trying it out  24 years after it's release :)"
1518,"it is a game
"
1519,"I got a mod that replaces the vent footstep sounds with scouts metal bat, I hate it."
1520,"I both recommend and not recommend this game. the game on Windows is perfect and a true masterpiece, but on mac the mouse look is absolutely terrible. reason being it resets when when you move the mouse 2 centimeters. the worst part is that this issue is in no other half life game, not even this one's expansions. in conclusion, for a good time, play this on windows, not mac."

"
1543,"[i]My opinion[/i]: You know, this is a good game. 
[i]My journey[/i]: I had a very long journey with HL: approximately 22 years. I bought a license version, played a lot being kid on my father's Win98 machine with 266MHz Pentium II, 8Mb video card, 4Gb HDD, huge square lamp monitor, mouse with a ball instead optics and dial up internet... 
By the way, my grandfather had Win95 with boost button. When it was boosted the speed was 233MHz. My uncle had a machine which was loaded via 5.25 floppy. It had a 3D game where you was driving a tank against other tanks and the graphics was simply a bunch of white geometric lines. 
[i]Proceeding with my journey[/i] : In 00s' my saves became broken two times. Probably it was a problem with HDD but it doesn't matter. Then the disk was stolen (actually not the disk, but the license key. the box was simply replaced or someone thew away the paper with key...), I deleted the game because of small HDD and lived all these years thinking of HL. Finally I bought it 2nd time this Summer 2022 and spend 9 hours playing till the end. I am simply happy : )"

1549,"Half-life as a game is a timeless masterpiece that i recommend everyone to play atleast once in a life to the end.
I also recommend you play this before playing Black Mesa for better experience.
"
1550,"Half-life? More like half my life. That's how long it's been since I played this for the first time. 

Wait another half lifetime, and still, I bet, Gabe would not release the third part.

Screw you."

1552,"Monumental title that changed the landscape of gaming as a whole.

Pros: - Great atmosphere and world
         - Responsive controls and relatively good gunplay
         - Interesting story and storytelling techniques
         - The sequel is Half-Life 2

Cons: - Level design, while immersive, can often feel obtuse
          - Hitscanning
          - Checkpoints aren't very good

Generally just things you would expect from a 25 year old game. It's not badly designed by any means, but is held back by modern standards due to technical limitations of the time.

Still holds up surprisingly well though.

6.5/10"
1553,What could I possibly say about this game that hasn't already been said? Play it.
1554,Freeman is the ultimate chad
1555,PLAY THIS
1556,"Man, I just... Damn... wtf. I don't believe many people born after 1998 actually beat this game.

I say that because it just drags and drags and drags I don't get it.
The first 4 or 5 hours are great, they still cared about the horror aspect, you as a player still care about the environments which stay fresh and feel like there's more to learn about the incident, there are still friendly NPCs around, the enemies have manageable weaknesses. Here I understood why it was foundational, between the uninterrupted flow of gameplay and bits of narrative dropped in through NPC speeches, the vents everywhere peppering levels that loop back and contain (often player-triggered) dynamic events.

And then you hit this point, Ch8/9ish, where the game jumps the shark and everything just starts to feel annoying and pointless. Open, ""military base"" levels where they just throw everyshit at the fan in arrangements of sand, rocks, and concrete, use every enemy they have access to, put little bunkered down turret manning guys in spots with no vulnerabilities, they abuse the big grunts that are bullet sponges unless you have ammo for a few key guns and then have guns themselves that obnoxiously curve around corners and across cover. The war breaking out just feels braindead, the atmosphere and narrative cohesion of levels weakens.
We hit Questionable Ethics (11) and it's like okay? Cool? So they were [spoiler]experimenting with Xen aliens[/spoiler] the whole time? Yeah? Like I didn't guess? 12 we hit the big spectacle cliff-face and it could've easily ended there, instead we go BACK IN.

Lambda is fine. Back to intricately designed corridors with ambiguous science shit going on, yay.
I'm in the apparently rare camp who actually didn't mind Xen; I think long jump added a lot to skirmishes and lessened the pain points. Enough that had it been introduced earlier obviously the levels would've had to have been designed for it but at least 12 and 13 I would've had a lot more fun.
Nihilanth was a fuck though. Great, redirect me out of the high health boss that already includes a ton of downtime in jumping and falling to some contrived platforming rooms that completely break the tension of the fight and the pace of gameplay. I get it ammo but jesus. Cool design but like whatever.


All of this being said, while I probably won't try Black Mesa, hit that instead. 
I generally think this game's aged pretty well but I'd bet good money that the extremely ungenerous fall damage, very difficult to adjust to ladders, loading zones every few minutes, egregious lack of autosaves in combination with rare as fuck heals that led to a ton of save-scumming for me, and FREQUENTLY getting stuck in geometry by being next to it during aforementioned loading seriously held down my experience and were at least half of why I hated the pacing so much."

1579,"This game was a masterpiece at the time. The beginning of this game will forever be one of the best intros to a game ever... However, most of the game doesn't hold up today. The game becomes confusing and frustrating to play, even with a walk-through. The combat gets old after a while and the goals get muddled. The intuitive map design becomes maze after maze with annoying enemies and traps. The game's auto-save starts out really good, but about half way through the game becomes useless. It leaves checkpoints up to the player and so I saved at every turn. Resources become scarce, but it's in a way that becomes frustrating rather than rewarding. The movement is momentum based, and that leads to some trouble with some of the tighter jumps the game expects you to make. In summary, it's old. It doesn't have any kinda modern polish, but it also doesn't have that old game charm. It's a game that has been done better a thousand times since its release. It's not a game I would play unless you really want to be able to say that you beat Half-Life 1."

1591,"I wanted to beat this game so I could have more knowledge when playing half life 2 as I only wanted to play hl2 and Alyx but not one, but the more I played  the more i started to love this game. I don't really play games from before 2009 and I gotta say getting used to how different it was coming from games that would hold my hand to me needing to do everything on my own was challenging but fun. I loved the story from the minute the game opened and all the enemies were all so creative and fun. I loved all the levels and only really disliked parts of Surface Tension due to human error. All in all I'd give this game a 9/10 with it's small character moments with the scientists, the excellent sound and world design, enemies, and ending."

The intro was a bit of a slug, but the game is pretty fun.
i am so happy i don't have enough money to afford the VR title, because I don't want to die of a heart attack at my current age.
anytime your think you've got a hang of it, the game throws another fork in the road, keeping you constantly on your toes.

1683,Fuck Xen all my homies hate Xen.
1684,gordon looks like walter white
1685,"for a game the same age as me it's pretty neat. i've only played 6.9 hours so far but i have like 69420 hours in half-life 2/portal/portal 2/team fortress 2 so i'm pretty well-versed in the half-life world. i'd say give this game a play if you like half-life 2. it's cool because it gives the backstory of black mesa and xen and everything. but yeah, it's not great but it's pretty good for when it came out and without it there would be no half-life 2 or portal so. it's like an 8/10 which is better than a 69/420."
1686,"Half-LIfe is a game made by Valve and it takes main character, Gordon Freeman, across many areas and has him uncovering Black Mesa and its secrets. I don't need to say much, play this game, seriously. It's amazing and really fun. Not to mention the very unique and interesting storyline, music, and characters. The game was made in 1998 and still holds up for the most part. I had major difficulties with the final boss fight and some other areas as well but it was still great overall. The game does take a bit to pick up and it can get repetitive at times but it's 100% worth it. Overall, a great game and a 9/10."
1687,Pretty Infuriating.
1688,forsen.
1689,Great gameplay and visual style. Has that awesome 90's aesthetic.
1690,"10/10 
I don't need to add more"
1691,good
1692,"I freaking love this game, I love to kill all the science team even though I can't progress the main story"
1693, A
1694,"Good story line, intuitive controls for anyone who's played an FPS game before. Online play is convenient, and it was easy to find lobbies which were orderly and polite. Also, due to this games age, it runs great, even on a lower end computer. Altogether, a great experience."
1695,"Ok, I missed it when it was launched. Not my genre, but fascinating. Even it isn't my favourite type of game, I had fun. Positive review."
1696,game so good I was wet the entire time playing it
1697,he is scary (Genitalia-Man)
1698,"A pesar de la edad este juego a envejecido de manera majestuosa, dir√≠a que es incluso mejor que algunos juegos de la actualidad"
1699,good game
1700,This game is amazing. I will not be enabling comments simply because it is impossible to change my mind.
1701,"Although it's not my favorite game out of the Half-Life series, it still is pretty good itself.  The game controls are pretty clunky too, but yet this is a game from the past, so this was pretty impressive before.  It's a good 6/10."
1702,played for 2 hours got bored and skipped to the final boss battle
1703,A Classic early 2000s game
1704,Very Gud
1705,better than whole life
1706,"In this game you play as Gordallahan Frimehoviƒá, a soldier in AR BiH.
It takes place from 1992 to 1995, the entire duration of the Bosnian civil war.

Your objective is to kill aliens (VRS soldiers) and HECU grunts (HOS soldiers).

You begin in a secret weapons lab. As you're testing top secret nuclear weapons, an EMP attack is launched by VRS. This allows them to teleport into the nuclear weapons chamber, and attempt to steal the uranium crystal.
Though unsuccessful at stealing the uranium crystal, the entire facility gets destroyed.

Your job now is to escape the secret weapons facility, and assassinate the president of the Serb Republic, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá.

After many, many clashes with VRS and HOS, and committing many, many war crimes, you get transported into Xen (the Serb Republic).
After a few more clashes with the Serb soldiers, you reach the Nihilanth (Radovan karad≈æiƒá).
A deadly clash ensues between you and the president, which ends with a Bosnian victory.

You are transported to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, where you're congratulated by president Alija Izetbegoviƒá, and hired to become the new chief of the army, and commander of the 505th Bu≈æim knightly brigade.

Overall, 9/11 could use more Bosnia."
1707,crowbar game
1708,It's old (1998) but still holds up. Some of the levels are confusing and crowded. Some of the physics are strange but make for interesting gameplay. Hard to believe this game is 24 years old already.
1709,This game is so stupid. All you do is just walk around small tram. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1710,good!
1711,it has gordon freeman

1758,"Good feeling when playing, even in 2022"
1759,"Pain and misery are the two words that describe my experience of Half-Life.
I played it on hard mode because I'm retarded and hate myself. 

Most of the game is mind numbing repetition. 
Never have I wanted to end my life more.

Some parts are pretty fun though. Just as a whole, it's a pretty bad game.
"
1760,can you imagine buying an rtx 2060 to play a game from 1998 haha thats so weird who would do that

1774,where to begin with this. idk if there is anything i can say that everyone else hasnt said already. lets just say ive beaten this game 3 times and i keep coming back to mess with console commands and death match. its good. really good. one of the first games i ever bought on steam actually never regretted it
1775,"Well worth the purchase. I went into this game blind expecting a basic but enjoyable fps single player game. However, the experience i had playing this game was much better. The atmosphere of this whole game is very eerie and honestly towards the end starts becoming a horror game in some ways. The gameplay is also very engaging and fun. All in all, if you are thinking about getting this game, DO IT!!!!! It is very fun and you will have a blast playing it."
1776,"It's old and kind of unfair sometimes but I love it. I know it was really important at the time. I'm playing it for the first time, before playing Black Mesa."
1777,theres half my sanity after playing this
1778,"Even though it released in 1998, it's still a pretty good FPS. My only complaint is that sometimes I would get stuck inside a prop or part of the map, and I would have to noclip myself out."
1779,"mas dificil de lo que pensaba xd. Buen juego, voy a jugar al 2, espero que sea mejor..."
1780,Cool shooter game

1797,i ragequit after doing the wrong shit for an hour
1798,memory game
1799,"I remember seeing the Orange Box on Walmart shelves growing up and always thinking ""I want to play that."" Young me had the right idea. This game is great. In the 2020s it definitely feels outdated in terms of the graphics and the old game jank. However, if you can play this game through the eyes of a kid in the early 2000s you will love it. 

Pros:
- nostalgic feel
- great story told through observation 
- combat is enjoyable (although not incredible)
- fantastic sound track
- hilariously bad and iconic voice acting 

Cons:
- some minor bugs
- horrid platforming
- some irritating sound design

Minecraft fans, play this one."
1809,"Great game. Wish I could play with controller but still, great."
1810,"I mean, it's Half-Life, the game is amazing. The only part about the game i didn't like is the two levels one earlier and one near the end of the game that didn't feel as much fun but other than that i can recommend this to anyone.

1811,Fun
1812,good game
1813,"Fue uno de los mejores shooters en primera persona, y todav√≠a se mantiene all√≠ arriba.
Quiz√° otros shooters tengan mejores mecanicas, pero el entorno, ambientaci√≥n y dise√±o de este juego no lo puedes ver en ning√∫n otro, realmente.
Hazte un favor y juegalo antes de comprarte el pr√≥ximo call of duty que es lo mismo de siempre por otros 60 dolares. Half-life es menos de un d√≥lar. (En oferta)

Una cosa que s√≠ ha sido afectada por la marcha del tiempo es que el camino adelante es a veces poco intuitivo, y aunque eso en cierta manera lo haga especial, puede ser un problema especialmente cuando la l√≥gica se va de las manos en instantes. Estuve demasiado tiempo disparandole al feto hasta darme cuenta que ya lo deber√≠a haber matado y buscar otra soluci√≥n.
Esto no es suficiente como para cambiar mi concepci√≥n de que este juego es una maravilla, veas por donde lo veas signific√≥ un pico en entorno y ambientaci√≥n para los shooters y los videojuegos en general."

1825,all time classic video game. 10/10... 11/10 even
1826,One of the best games ever.
1827,ok
1828,
1829,"very good game, can kill final boss with crowbar."
1830,Nunca se puede olvidar al primer amor.
1831,Nice
1832,"Interesting game
probably gonna play it again"
1833,good
1834,I do recommend this game because it is fun!
1835,gordon is hot
1836,i bunny
1837,hl1
1838,"stop, I'm with the science team!"
1839,It took me way too long to beat this
1840,Don't shoot! I'm with the science team!
1841,You play as Season 1 Walter White escaping the meth beasts he accidentally created. Not too bad.
1842,spedrun
1843,"Generally not a shooter fan, but the atmosphere is so engaging, bit buggy but better than source atleast. Story is superb. For a 1998 game it is incredibly playable in 2022. A piece of gaming history, and a good one at that. If you can get past the things that come with a game being 24 years old, like outdated graphics and some bugs you will enjoy yourself. 8/10"
1844,alien killing game
1845,Good game 10/10
1846,good
1847,Wanted to live half as long. Still alive. Didn't do as promised.
1848,"Why the fuck can't I sex the Gman???????????

Good game tho"
1849,Gordan dosen't need to hear all this hes a highly trained professional
1850,Pretty good
1851,its alright i guess
1852,"Morgan Freeman more like Morgan Gorgan

EDIT:
Actual Review. Half-Life is by far the best shooter I've ever played. The characters don't talk to you for 3 hours. There is no dumb exposition dump. It get's straight to the point on what matter's most to a game. Game-play and Story. Most games I play now, I just play them for like 1 hour a day. and then that's it. But when I play a game that has a lot of worth and really feels it innovates the genre. I play for 4 hours or more a day until I beat it. When I first played Half-Life I stopped playing 5 hours in. 

The Story is damn, how did they do this? They made a story where you can just speedrun everything and still get the story. It tells the story through environment and the scripted sequences. One moment Black Mesa is clean, the next moment there's zombies and aliens everywhere. You go down the stairs, you see this scientist calling help to the army man, and the next thing you know the scientist is killed by the army man. That right there is how you tell a story, not some guy talking to you for 3 hours saying that the man is bad. 

The Game-play feels so fluid and precise. Each section feels unique because it showcases a new idea and if it does not showcase a new idea, it incorporates multiple ideas and it's so seamless as well. It has rich sense of variety, One moment you'll be in the sewer, and in the next level you'll be shooting some giant spider in space. It has that 30 seconds of fun. Even after you think you've seen everything this game has to offer. You get your ass whopped by Ideas on top Ideas. There is always that freshness, that innovation. That keeps you interested in exploring further. It innovated the shooter genre and went above the stratosphere.

I give this game a 5 out of 5."
1853,"the games name is half life but im still dead inside while playing it

10/10"
1854,game is so fuckin good
1855,"this game is a literal classic, lots of community mods and 2 expansions  up and ready to go!
the story is actually nice and creative!
the plot is the same as the story and a little bit more quote on quote ""interesting"" or perhaps ""unique""
weapons are actually really fun to use
graphics are nostalgic and even if you didnt like that try out Black Mesa or there is the ""Load Hd Content When Avaliable"" so yeah have that i guess
it also has use for Garry's Mod

10/10 amazing.. favorite first person nostalgic shooter ever!"
1856,Amazing game. Brings back memories. Felt a little buggy but gorgeous game.
1857,half the time spent trying to figure out where to go next
1858,"Old


I like Kleiner"
1859,"An amazing sifi horror that made me come back each time I got bored or angry just a little.
Also crowbar cool"
1860,very very fun
1861,very good although kinda dated
1862,"played and beat this game on 2022. too late to play it I guess but the overall gameplay and graphics were for its time. never expect a game like this to be a bit challenging. story is great with its events. and most importantly, you play as Gordon Freeman."
1863,":
"
1864,I can see why it's a classic.
1865,is gud
1866,There are scientists that die every 5 seconds
1867,A true classic that never gets old. I just wish Valve could count to 3.
1868,classic
1869,I have lost half my life playing this game. 12/10 this game is a must play.
1870,gordon
1871,"To whomever said boomer shooters are not fun, this game is proof that you're objectively wrong"
1872,"Bro, It's Half-Life."
1873,coooooooooool
1874,"What can I say? A classic, a game that makes you think, Half Life never gets old."
1875,great game
1876,i like this :)
1877,very good game
1878,"–ó–∞—á–µ–º –Ω—É–∂–Ω—ã –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—ã, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å Half-LIfe?"
1879,why so red
1880,"Naaaah not today's standards. The game is boring at very beggining dunno what to expect. At the second hour playing I realized that nothing will be better it's all the game gonna have. I didn't complete it and I won't hope half life 2 is much better. The game gives you lots of uncorftable levels. 
  So the best game in 90's is ofc One Whole Unit Blood and then Doom but in fact lots of people enyojed it me not. And they're a lot better than this MR Marchino Vodka Burritto Payne :)
"
1881,playing hard got so mad that my heart started hurting
1882,good classic shit
1883,fun
1884,Cant find the hazmat suit ):<
1885,Best game to ever exist
1886,"Half-Life is a legendary, must-to-play 1998 FPS game developed by Valve. To consider yourself a true gamer, you must have this game under your belt. A game strongly recommended for everyone and an excellent game for people that are starting to become gamers. Give this to your kids as their 1st game, you won't regret it and they will be thankful in the future. 

Playing a badass dude and a legendary gaming character named Gordon Freeman, Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, which I guess Ph.D. gives you knowledge of every weapon you touch and just kick ass. Works for the Black Mesa and gets involved in an experiment that goes wrong and opens a dimension to another world called Xen. Through each fight and puzzle, you piece together the story in the game. Also, in the game, you will meet another legendary but mysterious character, G-Man. He plays a huge role in this game and the Half-Life sequels. Won't spoil them and the story. You should experience it all with a huge jaw drop and dilated pupils.

The game consists of 1 Training room and 3 modes, easy, medium, and hard.
The training room is strongly recommended for new gamers and for gamers that haven't played a Valve game in their life. Get to know how the game functions and its controls. If you skip it and act all tough, you will have big difficulties.
Now the modes:
1. Easy mode: Recommended for new gamers. Not difficult at all and not even a challenger. Great way to observe the game, it's surrounding and the story behind it without any fear of getting killed instantly. Difficulty 1/10;
2. Medium mode: Great for players that never played a Valve game before but aren't new to FPS games. It's the same as the easy mode, just with the challenging fights. Difficulty 5/10;
3. Hard mode: This mode is for veterans and people that enjoy pain. It's challenging as hell and keeps the adrenalin pumping. Difficulty 10/10;

Of the various weapons that are offered in this game, I must praise the most powerful weapon in this game. Equivalent to the Doom 1993 shotgun (not as powerful and impactful as the Doom 1993 shotgun), the 44. Magnum. Its amazing power strikes down all foes, no matter their sizes and the difficulty you will play on. If you ever feel endangered just whip out this bad boy and it will do the job. The best weapon in this game!

Personally, the worst weapon in this game is the HECU RPG, the bazooka in the game. Proved unworthy and cost my life many times. It has a guiding option to guide your missiles, and boy did they miss, a lot. It seems like it was a hit, but it goes through them. In hard mode, it barely does a thing. I prefer using the crowbar and the pistol over this thing. Almost always I barely use this thing, because the rest of the arsenal does a better job.

Multiplayer: After so many years, it's still alive and you can easily find a couple of good and full servers. The multiplayer is awesome and you need to check it out. You must experience it."
1887,This game is cooler than Half-Life 2
1888,my wife left me
1889,"This game has not aged well. There is an argument that this game is ""good"" because it has historical significance, but would you rather drive a Ford Model T or a Tesla Model S? Go play Black Mesa instead."
1890,Kino
1891,IT GUD
1892,Crowbar go brrrrrrr
1893,Masterpiece
1894,Half life 1 + half life 2 = whole life
1895,"No comment!Simply good game,real old school."
1896,"nice game, recommended"
1897,"Second game I've ever bought.
Thanks Dad"

1911,half life was my favorite game as a kid and even the series and will always be to this day!
1912,Yup it's Half-Life.
1913,The half-life franchise is AMAZING perfect environmental storytelling unique ai it just takes the typical shooter idea like oh no an alien invasion happens but makes it ACTUALLY AMAZING this game is nothing like other shooters it is just perfect.
1914,Playing this game should be a requirement.
1915,Amazing game
1916,great game all around

1918,if you dont like it your a normal person that has an opinion that i respect
1919,"i like it

also to make the textures better 

type ""gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST"""
1920,"this game is really good, i still have not completed the game but so far everything works really nice, if you get too confident with amo you'll spend it all but if you're careful everything works perfectly, its also suprisingly imersive because so much storytelling is happening around you, all in all, really fun"
1921,After beating this game I say its pretty good difficult but good
1922,I'm going to admit : I've never played this game. So I decided to try this classic. This game was amazing. I can't imagine playing this in '98. Would have blown my mind.

1940,plz play on hard other than that its half life = best game ever made in the entire galaxy and universe
1941,"As someone with no nostalgic connections to this game, I have to say that Half Life lived up to the hype. Plays quite well for a game released in 1998 and you could see how it revolutionized the FPS genre and focused more on other things besides mindless shooting. In Half Life, you have to solve puzzles, rely on NPCs, parkour (rather extremely I might add. You are going to have a rough time if you don't know how to crouch-jump), and observe your surroundings.

The high point of the game for me has to be the NPC interactions with you and the environment. They react when getting hit, they talk to each other, they talk to you and are your primary source of story-telling, and come off as real people. Reminds me of older Halo titles where the NPCs would talk about their surroundings and actions to make the game world feel alive. Too many games simply put a name tag on their NPCs but I can say that Half Life does a great job in making their NPCs feel real, I always felt the need to keep them safe and was sad if they died.

The only downside I had with the game was the audio direction. There is this weird audio effect where sounds will play slightly after they played for the first time, giving this echo effect. At first I thought this was a glitch but it turns out this was intentional to give the feeling of noises bouncing off the walls in the cramp spaces of the Black Mesa Research Facility. After I learned this was intentional, I felt a bit less aggravated but I wish there were an option to disable it. There is a command to disable it although it resets back to the usual echo when you enter a room designated for the audio effect."
1942,good morning gordan
1943,really good so far i didn't finish  it but everything is perfect
1944,"Me when i see a head crab.






Fuck"
1945,This game gets confusing time to time if its your first time but its good
1946,Pretty good.
1947,Crowbar smack 1
1948,Half life is a good game. Is it as good as half life 2? no. but it is still good. I liked it and will probably play it again.
1949,hello gordon
1950,Half-Life is obviously a fantastic game that changed the FPS genre forever. Still the greatest fps ever made!!!
1951,Classic
1952,I cant get past the tutorial
1953,"This game is wonderful! The pacing is perfect, I played through the whole games in just a few days and never got bored of playing for long sittings. The game is able to move from a small scale survival horror style game to a big military shooter to a weird space alien shooter/platformer without ever changing it's core game play, only changing the weapons available to you and the level design. The graphics hold up very well for a game so old imo, nothing stood out to me as looking bad even if the game does obviously look dated since it's like 24 years old at this point.

A game that can stand up 24 years later, that can be very enjoyable for someone just playing it for the first time so long after its original release is a really amazingly well designed game. It has some issues but nothing that held me back from seriously enjoying myself while playing it."
1954,great story and gameplay!
1955,even more fun

1995,hello there gordon freeman *aggresive E pressing*
1996,"I have heard of this series my whole time gaming, however due to me growing up with mainly RTS games for PC and everything else on Xbox I never actually got to experience Half Life the ""real"" way. While I've played the PlayStation port as well as The Orange Box on the Xbox 360 when Hollywood Video still existed. It took me 10 hours to beat Half Life on normal now that I own Half-Life and Half-Life 2 with all the DLC packs finally. 

While granted I have watched quite a lot of videos about the lore, mechanics, speed-running and everything else to do with both Half-Life titles, that was because of how badly I wanted to experience one of the best game series ever created. I would 100% say that I used tricks and whatnot that I remembered while getting to explore and have fun with the famous momentum kink in the game engine.

Overall, I'd say this game lives up to the hype surrounding the series; The amount of puzzle solving I was doing mid-firefight was insanely fun considering one misplaced step while throwing a grenade, satchel charge and firing a rocket from the rocket launcher can completely kill your run and cause quick F7.

10/10 - Half-Life lives up to the word around the net as well as feeling somewhat refreshing compared to FPS titles currently being played. I honestly would call Half-Life somewhat of a precursor to the ""Looter-Shooter"" genre; At times I felt like I had to back off and sit in a corner to evaluate my ammo and how many enemies I could shoot to pass through an area instead of clearing the area. At one point I even recall long jumping through an entire section with (I don't know the enemy type) armored aliens that have flamethrowers. Basically I enjoyed this title because it was fresh and new to me while also providing me a whole new way to experience not only an FPS game, but also having it blended with puzzles and platforming as well as micromanaging your ammunition and any guards or scientists you're escorting since they love to just stop following you."
1997,when will full life be released?
1998,"first got this on the playstation 2, brings back so many memories, such a classic game."
1999,10/10 freeman no voice
2000,can't play because headcrabs scare me..
2001,Game doesnt not hold up well but it is a classic
2002,Truly classic
2003,Old but gold
2004,"It's the classic game you've heard so much about! It was a surprisingly long game. I didn't expect it to take almost 12 hours to complete, not that I'm complaining. The gameplay was pretty fun although some sections are very difficult, the controls were also kinda strange to get the hang of in the beginning. Totally worth it to pick this game up!"
2005,"Hello, Gordon!"
2006,please make half life 3
2007,Dope but the other half is missing
2008,look its alex from the crew
2009,mjujhh
2010,"Man, Gordan has spent Half of his Life time"
2011,"Half-Life is a watershed game in many ways. Story driven FPS games can be clearly divided as either pre Half-Life and post Half-Life because of its innovations in story telling, level design, and interactivity. Nevertheless, some of Half-Life's gameplay has dated it a bit, more than its sequel or even classic FPS like Doom or Quake. Still, Half-Life is certainly worth playing and is (mostly) a fantastic game.

PROS:
- Great storyline and experience
- Great enemies and impressive AI for the time
- Great weapons and variety
- Mostly great level design presenting an unbroken, linear narrative
- Expectedly great performance
- Decent value, taking around 9 hours on a first time playthrough

CONS:
- The final levels in Xen are notorious for a reason: they suck
- Some of the movement and clipping feels unrefined

* Do not get the Source version of this game"
2012,yes
2013,mid tbh
2014,very fun difficult game with an interesting concept.
2015,[b]c r a b[/b]
2016,"Its old, but its gold"
2017,"its good if you like games that throw a challenge at you that takes 15 minutes to understand and solve, then making you feel like a god like chad thundercock mastermind."
2018,"Overall good gameplay mechanics, and the graphics are good considering its age.

I get that it's a game with puzzle elements, but sometimes there's so little guidance/hint on where to go, which could make me run around in circles for minutes on.

like once I was stuck in that office complex level, and it turns out there's a vent hole you can break to get inside. Things like this are so subtle, which makes it hard to figure things out.

in comparison, portal 2 has way more hints on where to put your portals. Sometimes the walls that you can portal on has a different lighting, or the props like gel pipes, which can guide you"
2019,this game is just great. please buy it.
2020,"its good
"
2021,very painful :)
2022,Oh god
2023,Fun game! Has that old school gaming goodness to it.
2024,bro klaxon beat was fire

2026,better then cs:go
2027,"What a game. Amazing characters, Amazing gameplay, Good graphics, Good mechanics, Amazing story and a Godly OST, a classic must buy."
2028,Freeman implies the existence of Captivewoman
2029,what the hell are you doing looking at the bad revews. buy the game. its great. its the fps game tha changed the world
2030,"It's Fucking Great, And If You Haven't Played It, You're Stupid."
2031,Half Life
2032,gud game
2033,Good game
2034,"I like to review games when I've finished them, even a super simple review so:
It's most certainly dated and janky but a fun enough experience.
Worth purchasing the whole Half-Life bundle, especially when it's over 80% off."
2035,cool game :)
2036,Old but Gold. This game is part of my life.
2037,"Don't play with HD models on looks ugly. Watch Half Life VR, but the AI is self aware. Funniest shit I ever saw. The game was fun an immersive. Takes the right mindset to want to play it, but when you get good, the game is fun. I am a big fan of the -1 health door right before xen, it makes me able to beat the game with some sanity left. The only time I beat xen without 9999999999999 health was my first time and let's just say NOBODY wants to play xen normally ever again. Do it once to experience it and never again."
2038,dcrfvtbghmn
2039,"Here is my honest review to Half life 1 without the nostalgia factor. 
This game is a classic and i know its was revolutionary by the time (you don't need to play this game to play half life 2 or the episodes), but the game didn't aged very well having confusing parts like some puzzles, and sometimes you can find yourself lost in the black mesa corridors.

The game got some fun parts but are very short compared with not fun parts like the train part that take ages to end or the surface part.

Taking a little bit about the end without spoilers, its just ugly, some people with tripofobia can see the textures as a red flag, and it's not fun. If you still want to play this game bring lots of amo to the last part/final boss or don't waste it in dumb ways and prepare yourself mentally to hard platforming parts unexpected enemies placed in unpredictable places that almost insta kill you if your not paying atencion and a 9/10h of gameplay. I played the game on medium but i encorage everyone to play it on easy (not joking the game is hard as hell).
If with all this you still want to play the game have fun!"
2040,good game
2041,"I mean... it's half life. We all play it one day, don't we?"
2042,Best game series I was ever gifted
2043,awesome game play it
2044,d
2045,this game is ok
2046,absolute CLASSIC
2047,"My favorite part of the game is when Gordon Freeman says ""its time for half-lifen"","
2048,"If you want a good game, this is for you. It has puzzles, decent storyline, and graphics that still look good (In the old days.) So try it out if you enjoy it."
2049,Classic. Best word to describe this game. 100% classic.
2050,I can say this. HALF LIFE IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED LFMAOOOO. From the spiders jumping out at me to the little puzzles and things. just wow. LMAOO this is such a weird funny game NGL. Recommend (and so glad that it works on my computer considering its a game from 1998!).
2051,cant refund cause i play 5 hour so yeah lol
2052,Half-life was cool before half-life came out
2053,"Great game even tho the graphics are old.

Valve always makes great games so its obvious that this game was gonna be awesome."
2054,"Why are you looking at the reviews? It's half life, it's good by default"
2055,Wow such a good game
2056,I prefer full life imo
2057,Crowbar :)
2058,V good
2059,"This game is as fun as my cousins said it was.
"
2060,"amazing
"
2061,"I now know why this game and series has lasted in gamer's memories as long as it has. This certainly shows its age, but not nearly as much as I expected. The movement is great, the gunplay is nice, and the flow of the game is spot on. While Black Mesa is arguably the better version, this is still worth playing."
2062,Awesome story game
2063,Gordon Freeman is hot
2064,"Amazing classic game. Although there is a steep difficulty curve early on, the game is still a master at teaching you mechanics and making you feel smart. The attention to detail is amazing, you can literally turn off lights and dry your hands and the AI will react to your input! I think anyone who is a fan of FPS games should definitely play this game."
2065,"The Benchmark for the modern FPS game. What more can be said? An excellent game on it's own, yet completely defines the genre when stacked up against not only the peers of it's time, but also today."
2066,"I have finally played the original Half-Life after I played Half-Life 2 back in *squints* 2019. That was longer ago than I thought but here is my review for game number 1.

Age really shows. I got stuck in walls and objects about 8 times during my play-through. One for every hour. Had to load a previous save. half were from loading into an area and the other half was jumping on the wrong place. Sometimes it wasn't clear what to do or where to go which resulted in having to look at a guide. The end of the game also doesn't actually end and you have to quit manually after the credits.

Aside from the bugs, it is the original half-life and it is a typical linear first person shooter. Steam sale puts it at 80% off usually meaning it is 1.99 USD most of the time and that's a fair price for a game this old."
2067,Wonderfull
2068,Worldcraft Pro When
2069,"Best story, better than most modern games."
2070, What better way to experience the Gold Source engine.
2071,auugh

2075,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT FINISHING IT IN ONE DAY
2076,Best Game Ever i recomend to play (Sorry For Bad English)
2077,everyone knows that Half Life is one of the best video game in Video Game History. although it's old but it still shining(:
2078,This is definitely a classic you must play at least once! Such an amazing story and frustrating at times gameplay it makes you want to come back to play it again I haven't played through Half life 2 yet but from what ive played Half life 1 I am now a very big fan of the series! Thank you Valve!

2103,Better Than Assassins Creed Origins 10/10
2104,"HL1 is as brilliant as it is obtuse. Nothing is properly explained and it leaves it up to the player to just figure things out through trial and error, even still most modern games couldn't hold a candle to the level of atmosphere and world building this game managed to deliver way back in the stone ages. Be ready for a good time but come prepared with a Walkthrough or something."
2105,"Like portal, except it doesnt have portals and your not solving tests. and theres guns"
2106,"no joke pretty much the best game ever besides hl2

2130,"I really wish more people would look back and respect this game as deeply as I do, this is one of the best FPS games on the PC. The fast paced movement, great AI and intuitive gameplay keep me coming back for a good time whenever I remember it exists."
2131,When the life is half üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥

2151,"This game, despite it's age, still holds up. Everything from movement to combat still feels good to play. I did have a good time, though I often found myself not knowing where to go next. That might just be a me problem, though. This game is also a lot longer than I expected, taking me 11 hours to complete. Or maybe I just suck. And after playing Half-Life 2, I think this one can just be skipped.."
2152,nostalgic to say the least never had a bad time playing this game
2153,its ok
2154,Hell fucking yeah i love half life and this will be my best gameplay ever!

2156,very nice very good
2157,"Half Life 1 is a great game. It may look old but it holds up quite well. The only things that are a little annoying is the flashlight, and the head-crab vent startles. Its not a scary game but it can be creepy in some areas. The story is great.
8.5/10"
2158,"It's the best, valve's debut game after all, also good for mods"
2159,"A must-play classic, Half-Life's influence on gaming as an industry, art form, and subculture is undeniable. It's a quirky, mysterious, and incredibly well-paced experience. The mix of fast, endlessly fun FPS action combines with an utterly intriguing plot where minimal dialogue and environmental storytelling draw you in. I constantly found myself wanting to keep playing to see what was next, what new foes would I face, and figure out what exactly was going on in this dark, top-secret facility. Half-Life offers some of the best classic fun a gamer can enjoy and is worth delving into full force, crowbar in-hand."

2171,there is a lot more content in this game than I thought there would be since I kind of compared it to portal. The actual gameplay is rather old but is still really good and that is only added to by the awesome story line. I would recommend this to friends just not at 14 dollars I would wait for a sale grab the bundle and have some fun.

2193,It was pretty fun i say you should NOT buy half life: source if you want a suarce game get counter strike: source
2194,Gordon freeman more like semen
2195,revolutionized the fps genre and launched valve as a company.
2196,pretty hard but good
2197,"[h1]Xen = best part[/h1]
(visual aesthetics, atmosphere, action, platforming, stealth segment)"
2198,cerified hood classic
2199,Portal 15?
2200,good old game run good on new computer
2201,"Prior to 1998, in the PC world, first person shooter games such as DOOM ruled the domain with an iron fist, legendary and infamous in its own right as it essentially was the father and creator of the genre. 

However this was all to change. If Doom was the father, then Half-Life is the son.

The late 90s essentially was the ""golden age"" of gaming. The SNES was phasing out, the N64 was ripe and the Playstation was dominating the market.  Pioneers and trailblazers such as Starcraft, Diablo and Age of Empires were being released, celebrated and played around the world, it truly was a time to be alive.

In November 1998, Valve Studios in conjunction with Sierra Studios published the game Half-Life, a game, that changed the perceptions of us Millennials from that day forth on PC games forever. This game essentially turned the tide of FPS and still reflects the fundamentals of games we play today in the modern age. A freakish evolution within the gaming industry, Half-Life itself has won of 50 game of the year awards, has been the cornerstone of mods, shown in the media, has overwhelming positive reviews from all gaming affiliated outlets and is considered the most influential and greatest game created in video game history.

One of the games creators, president and part owner of Valve and Steam Gabe Newell said ""Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first-person genre"". 

Its so famous infact, that one of the most played online multiplayer games in the world ""Counterstrike"" is a mod of the game, including its infamous remake ""Black Mesa"". The game also had two spin off expansion packs called ""Opposing Force"" and ""Blue Shift"". Both these expansions intertwine and give context to other characters and factions within the story.

In this story, you are the Theoretical Physicist Gordon Freeman, who works within a fictitious site known as the the Black Mesa Research Facility located in New Mexico. This Facility is absolutely gigantic and is the crux of the game, which comprises of an in depth railway system,  office complexes, laboratories and a dam to say the least. The facility shows a mundane, corporate work life but industrialized, dystopian with moving and advanced technological hardware. The Facility is imbued with cloak and shadow, being a military-scientific facility in research and secret experiments akin to the secrecy of area 51.

Without going in depth nor revealing any spoilers, during an experiment, you are faced with an alien invasion from a fictional place called ""Xen"". You must fight your way through the facility doing anything you can do to survive. During so you will come across friend being other scientists/security and foe, being the military, aliens and perhaps some covert ops. The game is broken up into chapters, there are no cutscenes so dialogue dictates the storyline along with scripted events. There is also no talking by the protagonist which gives an enigma like effect.

For the late 90's, the graphics were amazing, still to this day they hold up to the test of time. The environment is intuitive and interactive. including being able to be exposed to certain elements such as radiation, electricity and fire. You have at your disposal a range of weapons that come as the story progresses, but it all begins with the famous crowbar which manifests itself as a symbol. Characters can be interacted with, will help you and talk with optional dialogue punchlines. This also extends to some enemies who will give some scripted dialogue. Scripted actions will occur as you progress through the game, including interesting ways that lead to certain character deaths. Characters can also ragdoll and explode. Blood and gore was included for realism. There are also many traps in your travels and ambushes to be aware of and puzzles that need to be overcome in the face of overwhelming odds.

As you progress deep into the game, things will start to make sense about how and why, the game comes to a close as it does, but continues on through its expansions and its successor Half-Life 2.

This was one of the very first and most memorable games I played as an 8yr old. I used to be able to remember the levels so well I could probably play it blindfolded. This game truly put me in the drivers seat, that would be my inception to the love of gaming I have today and I thank the creators. No game has had an impression on me like this in 24 years.

This game 24 years later, still manages to beat the polished crap that is released today! Devs and game companies have no soul, they put in no effort, no good story line, just micro transactions, money and a quick turnover! this is why so many AAA titles today are rated so poorly. Creators cared decades ago when games required imagination, creativity, inspiration, intuition and a solid fan base because that's what mattered and equated to success. Rather than today's standards of buying a character skin for $20. 

So! If you want a true authentic, untouched gaming experience, fire it the fuck up. 

With my brains and your brawn well make an excellent team!"
2202,"It's Half-Life, what more needs to be said?"
2203,Greeat game although the characters look weird
2204,"Steam asked if I'd recommend HALF-LIFE to people.

As if my random review reiterating decades of praise and comments regarding it as one of the greatest shooters/video games of all time will sway anyone more than the title itself already will.

Play the darn game if you never have!"
2205,"For being a 1998 game it isnt too bad. Glad I played it and there is definitely game design of the time. The only thing I really had issue with is there is a few parts I ""got stuck"" at only to realize that it was a ""glitch"" but because of the internet and save scumming it was easy to go back before the glitch and do it properly."
2206,Why haven't you played Half-Life yet what are you doing
2207,"One Of The Best Games Ever, So Simplistic but yet so detailed and complicated What A Masterpiece I Need To Get Number 2.
I made the mistake of selecting hard mode long story short i got clapped !

2218,"I'm 46 hours into this game and I launched a rocket into a headcrab, launching me off the cliffs of Arizona to my death."
2219,"I wanted to like it because it's considered a classic, but the game play is often simply annoying. Obtuse directions and stupid gotchas bog down the experience."
2220,"It's a nice classic. not much more to really say about it, even though i manage to breaks something every time i play"
2221,"EPIC GAME

2225,"The best game for killing anything that moves, scientist or alien"
2226,cool
2227,how are you even supposed to write a bad review for this game?
2228,"I played this game over 20 years after its release, and was still amazed. Some games are intriguing because of their story. Half life is a game, where you play it, you win, and then you think ""what in susan B anthony's name was this dingleborg of a game?"" You basically go around and then eventually fight a fleshy mommy thing. WTF. This game kicks ass, and without it, we wouild not have the best game ever (CS)"
2229,Most accurate portrayal of the dangers of the military-industrial complex.
2230,iconic
2231,i fucking love freeman
2232,"man i love goofy scientist game, i had a wild experience"
2233,"you could do anything, even internet s3x!"
2234,Few games get better than this classic game.
2235,because yes and fun
2236,It's pretty good.
2237,"Half-Life is a great first person shooter, with action-packed combat and an incredible story. From escaping Black Mesa to traveling alien worlds, each chapter is unique from the last. There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of memorable characters but you get very invested into the ongoing battle between you, the aliens, and the military. The AI is also very advanced: enemies will try to run away from bombs, and you can even find aliens and the military fighting each other when you‚Äôre not involved. The game has aged in some ways, such as the buggy physics engine and some frustrating sections, but overall this game is well worth your time."

2239,"Virtually every game I have ever played would not exist without this masterpiece

11/10"
2240,+++
2241,One of the best fps of all time!
2242,"One of the best games every created, still fun 24 years later."
2243,"It's ok, I am unfamiliar with 2000's graphic, but it's ok."
2244,its cool
2245,I've played this game for more than half my life...  ironic.
2246,"I didn't really care for HL2, but I decided to try to play the OG. The OG is leaps and bounds more fun than HL2. The only thing about this game that I didn't care for was the fact that you can accidentally soft-lock on some levels, so be prepared to save often as well as use god-commands if you don't want to replay a given level."
2247,Half life might have been innovative for it's time but looking back it doesn't hold up well. The platforming is unique but frustrating and at times poorly designed. There was barely a story. The combat was decent enough. All in all it's mediocre.
2248,I like the world of Half Life and the story behind it but the gameplay is rather not impressive. it probably was back in the day but today? eh. I still enjoyed playing through it
2249,Wheres Gnome Chompski?
2250,I am now afraid of theoretical physicists.
2251,the amount of OSHA violations in Black Mesa is very impressive

2256,blast donger.
2257,"Just plain ole good fun and I played it all the way through to the end!  Reminded me of my earlier days when first introduced to this game!  All I can say is, ""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED""!  By the way, please feel free to visit my hobby website at WWW.BACKDOORSALE.COM !"
2258,still stuck on on a rail
2259,"This will forever be one of the greatest staples in all of game history. To the next generation of people, dont ever let this game get forgotten. From the gameplay to the eery atmosphere this game will have the player hooked all throughout. I suggest just getting the valve pack [every valve game] because a lot of their games are fantastic."
2260,I really like the noise that the crowbar makes when hitting stuff.
2261,Its still great to this day!
2262,"You must make a choice, Mr. Freeman. Either you by this game, or I can give you a fight you cannot win.."
2263,Great game play and content especially something from 1998. Highly recommend
2264,not enough life
2265,good gaem
2266,fucking awesome.
2267,Great game but pretty dated and frustrating at times.
2268,no! I'm with the science team!!
2269,Where's 3?
2270,"the singleplayer is a masterpiece, but is easily outclassed by the multiplayer, where if you play a certain way, you get to listen to children using the delightfully garbage voip to scream slurs at you. 1998/10
p.s. I should also clarify I played the game on a dell inspiron 9300 for the true early 2000's experience"
2271,"Not a very good game on its own, but it has such a nice old computer feel to it."
2272,really fun and would always recommend
2273,a classic game that changed the fps genre forever
2274,Gerber Freeboy
2275,"even though this game is over 20 years old, its still fun and entertaining"
2276,That game is just THE biggest evolution of gaming!
2277,Yes.
2278,"I beat it, is fun"
2279,"Arguably one of the best games ever made. One of the first 3D games ever made, the first being wolfenstine in 1992. Overall a great start to an amazing game series."
2280,you could say we're in a hazardous environment
2281,"Classic easy to play game with a vintage feel. Decent story line and ability to make sequals are a plus. Graphics are decnt for an older game, but simple commands and easy to understand the controls. Always a quick go to game."
2282,"Ladies and Gentlemen, the game that started everything."
2283,gt dfbdfb
2284,Good stuff also Gorden Freeman is very good looking (wink...wink)not as much as Coach from left 4 dead 2 but he's up there
2285,Y E S
2286,"still feels like one of the most vivid explorations of the phenomenology of video games. i have no patience for valve as a company but i gotta admit as someone who cares ab this medium and who thinks technology is cool, their never dying pie-in-the-sky idealism can make for some art that rly compels me. love the rough rhythms and genuine claustrophobia here, predictably lost in the (probably still good?) sequel.

ive recently acquired a VR set and have been periodically playing half life alyx, and even putting aside anything superficial they do kinda feel like they belong together in terms of their bright shining stabs into the dark of what it means to Exist In A Digital Space. ig thats why i prob wont ever let (singeplayer) valve games go in my heart of hearts.

also i kinda liked the xen levels tbh"
2287,"It is such a great game with such an amazing storyline, the only problem is that there is a lot of hard puzzles."
2288,"While I personally prefer Half 2 for it's more accessible gameplay and setting, this game was such an influential impact on the early gaming industry of the early 2000's
It helped bring forward the idea that FPS's don't have to just be ""Run and shoot demon"", and would influence future games in terms of gameplay and game design
The enemies that have intelligent AI who use human tactics against you (Especially HECU soldiers and Assassins) rather than recklessly running towards you
And the uncompromising gameplay that is clunky due to the age and limitations at the time, but rewards doing what the game's iconic back cover line says ""Run, Think, Shoot, Live""
It's easy to see this game as a dated old game that's hard to care about, but please, give this game a try, I love it"

2299,half-life
2300,government man
2301,A simple yes. Mastercraft of the ages old.
2302,"I have no idea why some people complain about the platforming, maybe I'm just too used to it I feel like it's not broken."
2303,"Fantastic FPS, one of the best"
2304,"What can I say, we're almost at the 25th anniversary of this masterpiece. Revolutionary back then and still a solid brick at the bottom of the wall of FPS games today. Many games have taken inspiration from it or are secretly referencing to it one way or another. Countless mods have been made using the pioneering Source engine as the framework and the game has seen remakes, remasters and follow-up titles. YouTube is choke-full of Half Life related videos, whether they are speedruns, mod playthroughs, gmod bullsh—ñttery, spin-offs, fan animations or other media, the love for the game runs deep in the gaming community even today, and for many years to come, without a doubt."
2305,if you want to buy this game buy it and jump straight into modded half life it's extremly easy to install mods and there are alot of fun mods out there
2306,"no gay sex, disappointed"
2307,Beautiful
2308,"The only thing I can say about Half Life is, it's not very new for me. But it was new in 1998, considering there was actually cutscenes and story telling given to you while playing the story. It was kinda long, but it was enjoyable. The Xen areas kinda made my ammo run out, so most of the time, I was just quick saving and yolo'ing everything. I beat this in 3 months or so, 1 of the months was a whole break."
2309,"I mean, what can possibly be better than this game? It's a true classic with endless reasons to play it over and over. From the story, to deathmatch, to the rest of the series. This game has changed my life in a lot of ways and it was probably the first shooter I ever played over 12 years ago. PS: Be a real one and play this before Black Mesa pls :)"

2353,"Its currently 2022, and i dont regret buying this game! This game throughout the time is still fun and interesting to play. It helped me with an anxiety! When i played Gmod, i spawned a headcrab and was terrified of it, now that i play Half-Life, i'm not afraid of headcrabs and other creatures in the game! I definetly recommend playing this game!"
2354,plain good.
2355,half life is pretty great
2356,half life 1 + half life 2 = full life 1
2357," 
"
2358,"This game is goated with the sauce with a little bit of swagger bustin it down sexual style.

Give it a try."
2359,You can't really go wrong with Half-Life
2360,very fun
2361,"Great gama, too bad they didn't release Half-Life 3. We're still waiting for it, Valve!"
2362,"The customer doesn't need to read reviews, they're a highly trained professional."
2363,"good game
"
2364,"I finally decided to write a normal review.

It is ok."
2365,yes
2366,cool game. What if they added walter white
2367,CHEESE
2368,"I think the thing I find most interesting about Half-Life is the story. This is one of the main reasons I play video games, is due to the epic storytelling involved. Half-Life is no exception, and I've found myself constantly coming back to it. It's not as glamorous or as showy as Call of Duty, or some other more popular titles. Still, I think it's Valve's baby, and always will be."
2369,"if game old, why fun"
2370,Not much to say
2371,can kill weird scientists tho
2372,can i see your passport?
2373,"Never played? Jump in raw. Tweak some settings and appreciate this milestone in gaming history for what it is: a fun survival-horror-inspired action-adventure FPS game - a game that served as a benchmark in several different ways and spawned Counter-Strike in the form of a mod that grew to its own distinct property. 

Why are you still reading? 

Just go play this, it won't take too long, then go play Black Mesa. Alternatively, you can play the Source version - blitz through it even - and have yet another point of comparison. It's roughly a 15-20 hour game your first time through if you scour, subsequent playthroughs can be finished in a single sitting."
2374,"I cummed every time I booted up the game

10/10 game would play forever until my balls gets chopped"
2375,it is half life
2376,"If this is what Half-Life is like, I can't wait for Full-Life"
2377,Full-Life when?
2378,epic game
2379,STAHP! that is enough to get the game
2380,very fun game 10/10
2381,"Very fun single-player experience with lots of variety. I like the world that's been created here and clearly there's a lot of care put into the environments and the concepts to flesh them out satisfyingly. Some of the ""old game-isms"" are in here (like having to figure out some of the controls on your own, having to figure out where to go, etc) but really, that's part of the charm. Very soulful game."
2382,"Not my personal favorite, but it's the best game I've ever played"
2383,This game is a classic.
2384,"Yes and No actually. Yes ONLY if you want to experience the original half life in it's goldsorce glory.

The actual review:
The game starts out great. It's a lot of fun to play and is very nice. I don't have much to comment on here aside from it being just as people told me it was. A great game.
Unfortunately past Office Complex is where I begin to have issues with the pacing, difficulty, and various other aspects. It really begins to show it's age late game. I found myself just wanting it to end. Getting stuck, unsure where to go, low on health and ammo frequently, constantly reloading a save because of one wrong move that I had no idea would kill me. The finale felt extremely rushed and boring. The final boss almost pitifully easy.

I recommend this only if you want specifically the goldsource version of half life for mods or what have you. If you just want to play half life or are new to the series. Go play Black Mesa. It's a massive improvement over this in both graphics and almost every other aspect while remaining very faithful despite having brand new additions. (I have played both of them)"
2385,A classic.
2386,"Stating that this is the best video game franchise ever made is an understatement.

With that out of the way, The game is certainly very difficult (even on easy) But the actual experience throughout gives a feeling of dread.

On modern systems the game runs VERY fast, after all, It was made in 1998 but that doesn't make the game any worse.

I highly recommend this game."
2387,:)
2388,Fun but hard
2389,"Half-Life is an old game, but that doesn't mean its bad. Actually its an absolute masterpiece, I won't say the graphics are good (by todays standards they're terrible) but I didn't mind it, the gameplay and the enviromental storytelling make up for it and have room to spare. It just felt like a marvellous experience even without knowing its inmense impact in the gaming industry."
2390,"Before I played Half-Life i had a small wee wee, no girlfriend no friends and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good."
2391,[h1][/h1]
2392,if you are prone to severe motion sickness then it is better for you and the smell of your gaming area to take regular breaks... trust me no one wants to smell your lunch from last week... but it is still a fun challenge that's been around longer than most games
2393,when the military rolled out the tank i did poopy
2394,do you know who ate all the donuts
2395,"banger
"
2396,"this is epic

i played medium mode cuz im not a cry baby, this is what i assume inspired many fps games and it is longer than i expected

my only problem is that there are loding zone but i will just blame that its from 1998"
2397,"In this groundbreaking FPS, you play as Gordon Freeman, an MIT graduate with a PhD in Theoretical Physics, who is employed as a Research Associate at the Black Mesa Research Facility. He is needed for an experiment that winds up creating the worst day at work ever. You know how in the original Doom, the UAC was doing experiments involving portals from Phobos to Deimos, and they end up having demons from Hell invading? Well, something kinda similar happens here: while experimenting with with a strange crystal, Gordon finds himself accidentally initiating a ""resonance cascade,"" which brings aliens from another dimension to Earth, wreaking havoc in the facility. After sh*t hits the fan, its up to Gordon to find a way to close the interdimensional portal, while also dealing with a special unit of the United States military sent to deal with the aliens, as well as silence all Black Mesa personnel.

As I stated before, this was a groundbreaking FPS in the late 90s. Enemy AI is more complex than its contemporaries were, and thus you need to be more careful with how you progress in the game. Set entirely in first person, there's a strong narrative focus here, with NPCs being a somewhat important way to progress the game, along with various setpieces in each level. Oh yeah, and the levels are interconnected rather than pushing a button and moving on the next level immediately. 

The atmosphere of these levels are fantastic, and the puzzles will get you thinking. The combat meanwhile, is great, due to the weapons you get to use. While some enemies are frustrating, at the very least there is a variety of them, which means things will never get to stale in that regard. The soundtrack, whenever there is music, is incredible.

Overall, a great way to start a legendary FPS franchise, and one I can recommend as just a really good game."

2403,"This is a recommendation only insofar as if you want to experience the original Half-Life, this is the version to play (as opposed to Half-Life: Source). This GoldSrc version is far less buggy/more polished than its Source engine counterpart, with the only drawback being that the flashlight is almost completely useless instead of game-breaking.

If you're thinking about getting into Half-Life as a series, though, I'd recommend starting out with Half-Life 2 instead. Half-Life, solely by way of old age, is clunky and ugly. I thought I hated Half-Life until I played Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2 makes Half-Life 1 look to Half-Life 2 the way Half-Life 2 looks to Half-Life: Alyx, if that helps."
2404,"Half-Life is a journey that's well worth going on, even nearly a quarter century after it originally launched. While the game has managed to influence countless others, it still manages to stand out on its own."
2405,It's a good game. Even though it's 24 years old it's still better than most games today. I find I hop in the game for 20 minutes and then end up spending a couple hours playing it. It's also easy to mod. In conclusion you should buy the game.

2422,"The legendary Half-Life existed to me only as whispers and mentions on the bespoke wind. I had never played it or  thought I'd play it. 

Eventually I found it, bought it... and even though I have not come very far *at all*, I already find it impressive, I can understand why it's so esteemed, and I can recommend it.

In terms of FPS's, I am very inexperienced, so the best I can offer is this: Compared to the big-name FPS's I've seen clips of, Half-Life is (relatively) slow-paced. Big sustained shootouts are unlikely; this game is largely around picking and choosing where and when you shoot, rationing your munitions, and using the environment to your advantage.

In terms of story and lore-building, Half Life succeeds in an immersive way. Spoken word between fictipersons, announcements overhead, blink-and-you'll miss it sightings, big signs, visual context such as machines being present working correctly or incorrectly to various degrees, are used to make this odd sci-fi story was really happening around -and to - me.

In terms of cons, I can't think of many, largely because I have not gotten far. The most immediate that come to mind are that if you're looking for a hero, you won't find it here. The playable guy Gordon allows- and sometimes outright does- some very awful things in order to progress, by necessity. [spoiler]As an example there's a device that a scientist has cleverly perched upon to stay safe. He insists on staying there, which frankly makes sense considering the circumstances. However, that part he's perched on is conductive of lightning.

Instead of offering an option to help him off and help him find shelter somewhere else in the facility, the game requires us to intentionally reactivate the device, which will cause the scientist to be shocked to death. For me personally this was stomach-churning, which to be fair was likely the intention given the scary elements of the story and setting.[/spoiler]

There is much to discover in Half Life 1, and if anyone's interested in PC gaming history, I recommend it. Among other things it could be darn well worth it to see and even play for oneself the game that help launched Valve as we know it today - without which this platform we write and read and share and make history on and through which we can access more games than we could have ever dared imagine possible in the 90's, might not exist."

2434,"One of the biggest leaps in the FPS Genre. Half-Life is an absolute masterpiece. Taking the role of ""Gordon Freeman"" a 27 year old scientist on his way to work at the ""Black Mesa Research Facility."" However when he performs his experiment at the ""Test Chamber,"" a disaster strikes. Alien like creatures from the world ""Xen"" have come & invaded Black Mesa & even destroying it, leaving hundreds of employees dead, but not Gordon. He takes on the brutal task of escaping Black Mesa, having to shoot his way through the hoards of creatures and... Marines? Black Mesa is a military funded lab, & because of that, they sent marines to cover up the disaster. So they go & kill every employee at Black Mesa so there is no trace, & Gordon must fight his way through these strong forces. The Game play is simple yet fun. Think, run shoot. That's your main goal. However there are a few puzzles along the way which can help enhances the game play even more. Half-Life shows how much you can do with a simple story & simple game play & executes it amazingly. I highly recommend it. 10/10"

2489,"[h1]TL; DR[/h1]
This game has undeniably aged. It's still a good game, arguably a great one, by modern standards, but the fact that its influence is so vast and powerful means that most of modern games employ its techniques, and as such, most of the ""surprises"" in this game are staples of modern FPS design. Its shadow is greater than itself, and in parts, the game has turned into a history lesson more than anything.

[h1]They're waiting for you, Gordon... in the test chamber.[/h1]
""What makes a good game?""
This is the question that crawls in my mind when I sit to review this game. Should one take its historic context? Its lineage, its influence? Or should one just take its state as-is and review it like any other game of the present era?

Here's what I think: if you have any interest in the history of first-person-shooters, this game is a MUST. Its influence is one of the most reverberating of its time and its shadow looms over many classics of today, such as Counter-Strike, TF2 and Borderlands. Not only that, but for its era, it had a lot of impressive features such as dynamic storytelling and robust enemy AI.

On the other hand... well, look, it's not a bad game, not even by modern standards. Its pacing works well, its enemy roster is creative enough and the gunplay feels pretty good. But other than that, when played today, Half-Life is not that good. I mean, it's good, but it's not unmissable.

Due to the amount of influence it has, if you have played any modern shooter campaign, you kind of already played Half-Life in a way. Not only that, but its story, while somewhat mysterious and arguably intriguing, is still way too basic and non-specific to genuinely wow anyone. It has some great setpieces, and it also has some pretty boring sections. It's, you know, a normal game.

So... yeah, I do feel it gets a bit overrated at times, but not in the sense that it ""was never that great to begin with"", just that it has... aged. It was great, and now, well... it's just good."

The last 20% is a nightmare. Like many older games, it struggles with difficulty progression and ramps up the difficulty to the point where it almost feels like a different game. Everywhere becomes a labyrinth filled with countless enemies you're never equipped with quite enough ammo for, all the while it starts making you utilize the antiquated movement system to make complex maneuvers while getting attacked on all sides. Quick saving is your friend - always. Honestly I mostly recommend it, but maybe just watch a playthrough for the remaining 20% because while I did complete it - I kinda wish I had saved my sanity and just watched someone else do it. 6/10"

Honestly half life was a bit before my time (I was born in 2002) so I never got into the franchise, but recently I thought maybe it was worth checking out and I'm glad I did.  It's really different from most fps games nowadays and I'm kinda shocked it was made so long ago considering how good it is.  The graphics and audio obviously are a little dated but everything else is pretty spot on.  One thing I didn't like was how much story you can miss if you aren't paying close attention."

Valve's first game did things that everyone thought would be stupid, but they showed that it clearly wasnt. Half Life created environmental story telling if you ask me and it was done so well. Without Half Life, we wouldnt have games like Halo, Call of Duty and... Half Life 2. This game is a must for any fps or game fan as a whole. Only reccomendation is play this before Black Mesa and skip HL Source it's terrible."

2648,"I see why people like it, but the level design is very confusing and there is no real indication of where to go. It gets repetitive quickly and the military's motivation doesn't really make a lot of sense. The long jump is fun and the final boss is good, but the best part of the game is the beginning, where it's actually trying to be a horror game, but then it tries to turn itself into an action shooter. Overall, when I got to the surface, I was just kinda waiting for the game to be over. A complaint I've never had before is that the game is actually too long, it kinda drags on, which takes away from the experience. 6/10, closer to a 7 than a 5 if that makes you feel better. If you enjoyed it, I'm happy you can enjoy something I can't! But this is just, a bit too redundant for me. Expectations were probably too high though, sorry bout that!"

2711,"This game seems fun, but buggy. The most noticeable problem is the Might and Magic VI soundtracks being played at odd intervals, like the game's trying to use MM6's music files as its own, something disconcerting and utterly distracting, as the music is much louder than the dialogue. This resets whenever I make an adjustment to the video settings, which has been the only solution I've found so far. I've also gotten stuck in place once already, and I haven't even gotten past the test chamber.

2724,"[h1]Review of Half-Life[/h1] 
Revolutionizing the industry with a story about a simple man, who's late for work. Honestly, what could go wrong at Black Mesa? An ethically sound, well guarded, and secluded research facility. Surely no experimentation could cause a quantum destabilization that opens inter-dimensional tears bringing forth hostile denizens from a border between realities. An event of which would later lead to the downfall of Humanity. After all, the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario, is extremely unlikely. 

[h1]Redefining the First Person Shooter[/h1]
Before Half-Life, the FPS genre was defined by a series of separate arena maze-like levels filled with enemies, where your only goal was to kill any and everything that moved. What if.. there were a first person shooter that drove you through a seamless & breathing world. One where you'd live out the events of a story, like an interactive movie. Today, this might seem silly, but in the late 1990's, this wasn't the vision, or idea, of what an FPS was meant to be. Nobody cared about such things, I mean, you bought an FPS to shoot things from a first person perspective, right? The genre could be nothing more or less than that. Or at least, that was until the talented folks behind Half-Life's development wanted to try something new, and as a result, played a huge role in changing gaming forever. 

Half-Life presents a narrative to the player, not through cutscenes, pre-explained exposition (Which isn't a bad thing, mind you), or walls of text, but instead through NPC dialogue & world building. You learn the events as they play out on screen, and progress through a consistent & seamless world. Not cut together by levels and loading screens, but chapters that are connected one after the other. Tied by in-world loading disguised by hallways or corners. That keep you in the world, and make the environment feel like a real place. Never taking you out of the experience. It's not about getting kills, or reaching a highscore. It's about survival, and fixing the mess that was inadvertently your fault. 

In the beginning you'll be living out just another day at your job. When an experiment goes terribly wrong, creating a 'Resonance Cascade' that opens rifts allowing creatures from the borderworld; Xen to freely pour into Black Mesa, your only hope of safety is to reach the surface, and escape the facility. You have no idea just how bad the situation is outside the lower levels you're fighting through. If the situation is even being contained, or if it's spreading. It's through other scientists and security guards, that you'll discover a military unit is responding to the emergency. You and your fellow coworkers are rescued, all you need to do is find them. Of course.. this short lived hope is abruptly shutdown when it becomes apparent that the military is there to clean up. Including all facility assets. The entire narrative shifts 180 degrees, and instead of running to the surface, you're running right back down into the dark depths. Your new goal, to reach the opposite end of the facility, as it's said there's a plan to end this once and for all, in the Lambda Complex. 

The world of Half-Life is alive. What I feel is underappreciated is just how advanced the AI was for its time. Xen creatures have a complex algorithm of behaviors and reactions, these.. animals, will fight and eat each other. They're creatures from all corners of existence, not best friends. Beings that appear to have a high level of intellect, are reduced to mindless slaves, fighting for.. someone, or something. The HECU, or military that's present, work in squads. They'll retreat when wounded. They'll speak to each other. They'll search for you. They'll drop grenades when you're chasing them, or throw them to flush you out. They will fight the invading Xen army. The roaches that're no bigger than your toe will feast and scatter. Scientists & security will react to smells. It's incredible to look back at this game and see just how ahead of its time, it really was. Simply incredible. The only limitation is that the AI is only able to perform one action at a time. However it's so easy to overlook this with just how well it all works. 
I highly suggest MarphitimusBlackimus on YouTube, for his detailed analysis videos on the inner workings of this game. It will really open your eyes, if they're not already.

[u]Never Stale[/u]
The gameplay and environmental systems never overstay their welcome. You'll explore all kinds of areas, never spending too much time in any one place. Nor doing one thing enough times to annoy you. Clean and slick interiors of advanced sectors in Black Mesa. Dark, and rusted halls of portions that're in disrepair. A rocket test silo. The hot scorching sands on the surface. Scaling a sheer vertical cliff face. The bizarre and alien Xen. To name a few. 

Environmental puzzles stay relatively simple, with the biggest challenge being not getting lost in some of the chapters that have you searching about to activate or deactivate something. 

As an FPS, you'll have access to a sizable arsenal of weaponry across a playthrough. Every weapon is varied, and different. With most weapons having an alternative fire mode that provides advantages in specific moments. Managing your ammunition is crucial. You have to scavenge for it, find your way into rooms or pick it off dead soldiers. It's easy to run low on ammo. Health works similarly, as well as your HEV suits power. Both of which are definite non regenerating pools. This type of old school difficulty, is a great satisfying mix. Which for me, is important, since I pick up on artificial difficulty easily. Half-Life is almost completely free of such things. 

Visually, the game's textures and geometry are dated by today's standards. However, the palette used, and the style it creates, allows Half-Life to hold up better than its sequels, in my opinion. Add on the advanced & detailed AI, varied gameplay, and everything else - Most of which.. is completely gone in the franchises later titles, to make room for physics simulation. But more on that in a future review.

As it stands now, Half-Life is my favorite entry in the series. I believe it's timeless, iconic, and important to see for the legacy it created. My only complaints about the experience, are the chapter ""On a Rail"", a poorly paced chapter that can be easily walked through in a quarter of the time, and the ""tentacle"", because I'm salty and that thing is scary as Hell. I would love to breakdown this game in a monster sized review, but with Steam review character limits, that's just not possible. 

[h1]Conclusion (Pros & Cons)[/h1] 
Half-Life is no doubt already in your library. For good reason. If it's not, then I suggest you at least try it when you get the chance. Put yourself into a 90's mindset, and experience just how mind blowing this game really is. A first time player can expect around 10-15 hours for a playthrough. A returning player can finish as early as 4~ hours. 

They're waiting for you Gordon, in the test chamber.

2727,"Although the graphics are a little out of date this remains one if the most famously revolutionary games on the planet, and for good reason. Halflife is one of that greatest games iv ever played and the start of the greatest series in video game history. This game was the first real ""campaign FPS"" i played and if you are thinking of buying it, it is worth every cent but if youed like a more modern fan make take of the game i am given to understand that the game Black Mesa is the way to go i personally have only played alittle bit of it soo."

You should play it through just for fun and experience, but don't expect it to be anything like modern games. 5/10 for modern age game and 8/10 for memories..."

A question arises in society from time to time: ""What is the greatest ___ ever?""
Who is the greatest NBA player ever?
What is the best music ever?
Who is the coolest person ever?
And finally...
What is the greatest first person shooter ever?

I've got answers to two of the above questions. Who is the coolest person ever? Gordon Freeman. What is the greatest first person shooter ever? Half-Life.

No game has ever been as influential to the gaming industry as the one you have on your screen right now. Half-Life wrote the rules for all future first person shooters. Halo? Yup. Half-Life 2? Duh. Deus Ex? Mmm-hmm. System Shock 2? Abso-hecking-lutely.

This is the game that started it all. As the Valve Corporation's first game, Half-Life created an emphasis on story and player control that had never been seen before in a video game. In addition, this game has an... interesting multiplayer mode that is very exciting. 

Unlike other games, its motto actually tells something of value to the player. ""Run. Think. Shoot. Live."" These are all options. You can run away from your enemies. Most of the time, this works if you're good at it. You can think about how you will dispose of the man who accuses you of ""Killing all my buddies."" Do you use the satchel charge or do you throw a grenade? You can shoot everything you see. There's enough ammo. Trust me.

There are an infinite number of ways to play this game. Are you a serial killer on the loose who doesn't care about story at all? Have fun shotgunning scientists. Are you a pacifist who waits to be shot at before shooting? Don't shoot the alien slaves in Interloper. Are you a French literature major living in an apartment in New York? Listen, my dear sir, and weep.

This game is my favorite FPS and its story is impeccable. Every time I play this game, I am brought to my knees, shouting ""WHY? G-Man, WHY'D you do this?!""

Good bye."
2756,"TOP 10 of best FPS in history. No doubt. If you can play their expansions and sequels, u will not regret it."
2757,good
2758,Really fun game with a nice story
2759,This game sucks
2760,Do I need to explain why this game is good?
2761,"This game is not only still lots of fun to play and re-play, but it's a big part of video games history. If you don't have this game, GET IT!!!"
2762,pp
2763,"Classic. Amazing, seamless blend of platforming and FPS that makes your heart rate soar. It's pretty hard imo, but you can savescum as much as you like. The result is a playthrough that viscerally feels good; the unkillable Gordon Freeman dodges every bullet and grenade while doing parkour through deadly machinery and shooting at otherworldly horrors (and the speedrun elevates this to comical levels). Narrative and gameplay support each other in that I'm compelled by curiosity through every obstacle. The graphics have ""aged poorly,"" as some would say, but I find the 90's low-poly style quite charming. I mean, the 5 or so recycled NPC models have names! Plus, the simple design lends itself well to the sterile, utilitarian lab environment. More games need to be made like this."
2764,I'M WITH THE SCIENCE TEAM
2765,Loved it. This was my first time playing Half Life and I was not disappointed.   Can't wait to play the rest of the games.
2766,"Despite it's older graphics, and some funny voice acting, this game is a blast. The gameplay is very smooth for a 1998 game, and the amount of different ways you can complete an objective tests the player's creativity. It also has a lot of speedrunning potential."
2767,"Got this on the cheap to see if it stood up to the hype. It did, and now I just keep coming back to it!"

2784,For 1 playcoin I can give a review with words.
2785,This is a very good game. I love these old 90's fps games.
2786,"A classic of the FPS genre, if you're into First Person Shooters, don't mind if a game is old or not, can't count to three and have the money, then you better play this game before Goredon Freeman finds your adress.

Simple controls, cool music, cool characters, nice combat, great AI if you don't count the soldiers standing on top of their own grenades and some more crap like that, cool enemies (don't you like a Four-legged Ballsack spider?) and maybe a lot more. Overall, it's a nice experience.

Of course, I can't deny that compared to newer games, Half-Life might be a tiny, wee little bit outdated.
But who cares bruh, get your crowbar and start beating some Headhumpers.

2796,I used to be terrified by this game and possibly still at various memorable moments in playing Half-Life. The inclusion of modifications for this game makes it more interesting and is not far from the feeling of playing Quake because of the game engine GoldSource which is a modified Quake Engine according to what i have read and seen on the internet (wikipedia - [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)]Half-Life[/url]).

2813,"Half-Life was (or still is) a pioneer in interactive narrative which is why it still holds up extremely well 20+ years later. The controls are tight and responsive, the levels are varied and reward critical thinking; there isn't much to say about Half-Life that hasn't already been said so if you're debating playing the first game--definitely do. It's a landmark in video game history."

2887,I FUCKING HATE THIS GAME

2889,yeah its pretty good
2890,this game turned me into the fucking joker
2891,"This game changed my life.
Before this game existed i had no life, but when i got this game i had half life. So thank you Valve for making this ‚ù§"
2892,This is classic Valve FPS Half-Life
2893,Simply a must-play for anyone who enjoys single player games. I could spend an eternity describing what makes this game great but there are many who have already done such over on youtube. You could watch those aforementioned videos or you could be playing an absolute classic witch due to its success led to this very platform where you are reading my review.
2894,An immersive and seamless start to arguably the best shooter series of all time
2895,could probably live a full-life if he didn't hang out in underground research facility's full of aliens! Silly Gordon! 13/13
2896,good game lol
2897,Dated. Jank as hell. Uneven in presentation. A timeless classic.

2900,"I've played through this game dozen and dozens of times and have to say how ground-breaking brilliant this game really is to play through. Its storyline, gameplay, graphics, NPCS, soundtrack, and sci-fi setting along with more really set up its place in the game making it a outstanding FPS games to play so far in gaming history. All of this efforts showed itself how breath-taking and hard it took the developers to make this which turned out highly good at the end. I highly recommend this game to anyone who's interested in playing it.

Thank you, Valve!"
2901,"Ah casi 25 a√±os desde su estreno en el lejano 1998, Half life 1 se sigue manteniendo como una de las mejores opciones de fps en el mercado, debido principalmente a su solido gameplay + una muy buena historia con incre√≠ble lore, si bien peca de algunos defectos de la √©poca, como por ejemplo de bugs, falta de originalidad en el dise√±o en algunos mapas y un entendible envejecimiento de los gr√°ficos, sigue siendo uno de los pilares de la industria y padre y madre de los fps.

7/10
recomendadisimo si tenes una pc de bajos requisitos.
PD: rip half life 3 :("
2902,A classic
2903,very nice
2904,"good game, fun and gives nostalgia"
2905,bunnymodxt make game better
2906,"Still holds up as a solid single player FPS in 2022. Obviously shows some age, but the core gameplay is fun, movement is fluid and satisfying (albeit a little bit slippery), weapons are fun to use, enemies have decently good AI for 1998. I think I like it slightly more than Opposing Force, and quite a bit more than Blue Shift, though I recommend playing all three back-to-back for a solid 20 hours in the HL1 universe."
2907,"You play as Gordon Freeman
which isn't free at all"
2908,"THIS IS MY GO TO GAME, WHEN EVER I AM BACK AND REPLAY"
2909,half-life
2910,"As good as it's cracked up to be, and as good today as it was in 1998. One of the more intelligent FPSs ever made with a wonderfully engaging story, well-executed gunplay and puzzles, and top-tier pacing. Provided that one can handle '98 graphics (& the visuals here are not ugly by any means-- quite the opposite, in fact!) then this is well worth a purchase and playthrough even 24 years later."
2911,Played a little when I was young but really got into half life 2 on x box. That being said I said you know what let's try and do the first.....boy oh boy. The controls on movement is something else. Can barely get on a damn ladder cause you move so fast. Definitely have a pc set up with desk and all cause I had a hell of a time just trying to do the tutorial. With that I would rate this game 3 out of 10 donkeys. Just go play H.L 2 or something else
2912,this is a nice change from the modern triple A games
2913,i like the weird dog things they are cool i want 10
2914,Do you know who ate all the donuts?
2915,"Jank and sometimes frustrating for new players but it has an incredible atmosphere and once you learn how to play it, it becomes incredibly fun to figure out how to get around each section, it almost feels like a puzzle game at some points."
2916,"it is very hard

1000/10"
2917,the houndeye are so cute omg
2918,Amazing Game! Amazing Team! It's the game that keeps on giving! This game has it all! A great game at a great price for all ages! Must recommend!

2933,classique
2934,"It‚Äôs one of those rare old games that I I can play, and not feel like it‚Äôs the most dated thing."
2935,"gg

2936,i suck
2937,
2938,i shot demon dog
2939,bestest game I haven't beat yet and most likely never will
2940,"absolutely worth the money, but if you REALLY want to get the bang out of your bucks, get the half-life 1 anthology pack, it's half life and both expansion packs for like 2 bucks more."
2941,This game sucks and Valve's are frauds.
2942,"Full review at: https://thegamehoard.com/2022/04/28/50-years-of-video-games-half-life-pc/

The revolutionary intersection of character control and storytelling certainly helps emphasize the player‚Äôs agency in Half-Life, an idea that extends to area navigation as platforming and puzzles can utilize most of the available environment. That exploration can be strained at times due to limitations or harsh punishments for small mistakes, but allowing liberal use of the save system dampens such issues and the gun play between moments of navigation packs in plenty of enjoyable weapons and varied enemy types. The first-person shooting never stagnates during the story, and while the hectic multiplayer isn‚Äôt too appealing, the single player manages to curate plenty of distinct and engaging moments that mostly offset the rougher elements."
2943,"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.
It took longer that I thought and I enjoyed it from start to finish. The graphics arent awful and impressive considering this game is from 1998. On Black Friday it gets usually a 90% discount and can be bought for 90 cents. At that price its a steal! If you havent played it its worth it even in 2022."
2944,It's an old cheap game but really fun.
2945,"(alt account)

its better than csgo and the modern games, recommend half life been playing this since 2013, honestly no regrets at all playing the game

10/10"
2946,"If you're reading this you're telling me you haven't played the original Half-Life yet?
While Half-Life definitely shows it age in an era of modern gaming it's a classic movement/cover shooter that deserves to be played from start to finish."
2947,is gud
2948,Wallah good sh!t
2949,this game is indeed boppin.
2950,it is a very good game but it is VERY hard and i was not playing on hard mode but if you want to play it you should
2951,"I give it a 9/10 due to its bravery to not show me boobies and having some water, with and without feces."
2952,"Go places and do things, cool guns kill aliens much fun."
2953,gotta love the NPCs

2963,I like game

2967,"good game

2984,"[i]‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù[/i] carries the announcement of a soothing female voice all over the Black Mesa Facility‚Äôs transport system tunnels, where the compact, but convenient train takes you, newly hired physicist Gordon Freeman, on somewhat of an opening tour of the complex. The chairs inside the train entice you by their presence to sit and relax for the time being, and the astonishing views of Black Mesa suggest accepting the offer since the trip presumably will be interesting, and sure you would have if it wasn‚Äôt that short. 

The train stops at an enclosed station with a floating fence-like platform leading to massive gates. Nearby is the security guard, who shortly notices your arrival and comes to open a train‚Äôs door. ‚ÄúMorning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you‚Äôre running late.‚Äù A step forward echoes around the station‚Äôs cube. The guard opens the gates with an interconnected mini-computer, and you walk into the evoking a little of a claustrophobia passageway. That‚Äôs a common feeling in Black Mesa, get used to it.

Walking through, you enter a bright lobby full of personnel of clear-white fellow coats, busy preparing for the experiment on an alien crystal used for the development of teleportation.

[i]""An alien? Teleportation?""[/i] Everyone wishes a good morning, hence what can go wrong? One blown-up casserole of some scientist is a bad thing enough for a day!

Slipped into a Hazardous Environment suit, you head to the test chamber. Getting even more comfortable with another package of greetings and seeing a peculiar businessman in formal wear of dark blue on the way, you meet a group of scientists. They inform you of readiness and a boost of Anti-Mass Spectrometer to provide better results; ‚ÄúA little gamble,‚Äù they call it. Silently agreeing with the risks, you move on.

Something catches your ears as two scientists run towards just damaged equipment in the hallway, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about to go critical.‚Äù Things start to get evidence of uncertainty that is being strengthened in an argument of another pair of colleagues waiting for you in the elevator -- the last downward step of your prelude wanderings, finishing them with pre-catastrophic foreshadowing.

You are in the test chamber. Surrounded by high orange metal walls, you are locked in with a gigantic device with a claws-like lower part and somewhat of a gun muzzle hanging from an unreachable ceiling. That‚Äôs an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, and you are about to give this lonely creature its crystal breakfast that is soon due to arrive. Until then, ‚Äúclimb up the ladder and start the spectrometer‚Äôs rotors.‚Äù 

After ascending on a noisy ladder and pressing the right button, emitters begin to spin. They light the room with trembling sets of lightning bolts in yellow color, like orange wasn‚Äôt enough. As the carriage with the sample has been delivered, you gently push it into the machine‚Äôs throat, and‚Ä¶ 

[i]‚ÄúOh, dear!‚Äù[/i]

The chamber, once orange, covered in dazzling green; lightning bolts‚Äô trembling now transferred to the whole research facility. Nevertheless, the experiment has a positive side of results, for portals has opened, and now you can use them! But first, welcome a bunch of aliens dropping in.

Incapable of treating the guests with tea, you are dragged to unearthly places for an instant and suddenly back again, now to the fully collapsed indistinguishable room with the ceiling parts of the Spectrometer evened out with the broken by the powerful strike paw of the floor. The experiment is over, it‚Äôs time to shake up the Unforeseen Consequences."

2997,Its really hard but once u get it done its SO SWEET
2998,its good
2999,"I walked into this game expecting a masterpiece, and while that wasn't exactly what I got, the product is still excellent. It's hard to appreciate the original Half Life nowadays because all of the things that this game was the first in are now commonplace in the genre. However, this game was extremely influential back in the day, so I'd recommend it just to see what its like. Despite this, the game still rough around the edges. The horrible On A Rail chapter, some primitive AI, poor enemy design, terrible final chapters and a horrid final boss all hold this game back from the praise it deserves. At the very least, play it to give context for Half Life 2"

3002,"A true classic, the game that started it all and truly revolutionized first person shooters forever.

Please play Half-Life, you wont regret it."

3004,Legendary game
3005,funni man shoots aliens in New Mexico.
3006,no indication on where to go. 9/10 game
3007,"Half-Life, like a lot of the games from its era, is a powerfully 90s thing. Not so much in terms of aesthetics, as I feel like the game actually has a pretty timeless look to its art design. The technology powering the game, though, and certainly its design, are very much of their time though. That's not a bad thing, of course! It's still a masterpiece of game design, particularly for the period it came out in. This game doubles every technological advancement made by Quake a few years prior, and it feels extremely modern next to pretty much anything else that came out in 1998. 

It's a little clunky and janky, and it certainly shows its age in some places, but Half-Life is a great time nonetheless. If you've got ten bucks burning a hole in your pocket and you just need something classic to play, I can think of way worse games to spend your money on. If nothing else, it's a piece of gaming history that should be played simply for its historical value."
3008,"Graphics are terrible and very bad AI programming. Shame I can't refund this piece of garbage, waste of 4$."
3009,Soon.

3019,"for a game that was made before the 21st century, i'm amazed by the depth and how advanced this game was for its time. the fact that the npcs properly follow you and talk to each other and interact with you properly is amazing for a game this old, and honestly, a lot of it still holds up to this day. obviously a classic, and for all the right reasons.

i will say though that some parts of the game were kinda anticlimactic or trite because after a while it felt like the game overstayed its welcome (the surface tension chapter in particular lmao). final boss fight was pretty boring and some enemies got stuck at times, but other than that, i have no complaints."
3020,"A gaming classic, I decided to finally play this game after playing HL2 years ago. Although itll take some getting used to, it's a pretty fun game. Some difficult and annoying parts that I recommend a guide for when you get to them, but overall fun."
3021,"Perfect story, perfect gameplay, really interesting and a great experience! Love this series and i want to play all the other games of the series. This game really deserved to be more popular in my country, because it's so incredible! Half Life is for life!"

<spoilers for the begining>
the story is an amazing story starting with you as a newly hired scientist when everything goes wrong

I think this is a good way to start a shooter at the time it was straight into the action but this game starts of with a show case of the areas you are going to explore. 
But if you are playing the game because of its graphics I would better recommend black mesa by crowbar collective, I would recommend playing the original then playing black mesa to have the true expirience of half life.

3063,"Prior to Half-Life, first-person shooters were simplistic. You‚Äôd dash around settings such as a base on Mars infested by hellish beasts, or a giant castle controlled by fascist maniacs. The game‚Äôs box and manual offered a brief plot summary, and you were let loose into levels which were mostly shooting galleries, and amid the carnage finding keys or keycards to unlock doors.

The gameplay was adrenaline-packed and fun, however it consisted entirely of shooting whatever moved across level after level, occasionally finding a bigger gun, or a secret room with power-ups. After say twenty of these levels, you‚Äôd fight a big boss that‚Äôs more of a bullet-sponge than normal enemies. Once this monstrosity is killed, the game concludes.

Half-Life upends this formula in totality. The intro consists of standing aboard a railcar transiting a ginormous research facility. You‚Äôre on your way to work, and must spectate to get a feel for where you are. You hear security announcements, watch colleagues chatting and going about their day, see heavy machinery operating, witness life proceed in a sophisticated, high-tech setting.

In a matter of minutes, Half-Life delivered more world building and atmosphere than any FPS title ever had. That‚Äôs before you even start‚Ä¶before you play an unwitting role in a disastrous science experiment which leaves you fighting for survival across the sprawling Black Mesa research complex.

A detailed story develops through the game; events are explained, and we feel immersed in the world before us. Characters have names, dialogue and personalities, and progress isn‚Äôt divided arbitrarily into levels with a singular objective of completion. Half-Life is comprehensively designed; the scientific and industrial environment of Black Mesa feels engrossing and realistic, in spite of the violent events and encounters the player must endure.

The puzzles make sense, as they are presented as functioning parts of the facilities you explore. They‚Äôre much more than finding a red keycard to unlock a red door, then proceeding to get a blue keycard to unlock a blue door. Likewise, this environmental problem-solving surpasses the worn FPS staple of pressing a button which opens a door on the other side of the level.

In Half-Life, the enemies require imaginative strategies to defeat. The soldier AI was revolutionary for its time, with squad members mobilizing together against threats. On a few occasions, certain opponents can only be killed through ingenious operation of machines. Gordon Freeman‚Äôs signature crowbar works both as a destroyer of easier enemies and as a tool to break vent covers and debris, allowing progress.

There‚Äôs obvious thought in the pacing of the adventure. The game waxes and wanes between quiet puzzle-solving and discreet navigation, and intense, explosive, nerve-jolting firefights. The soundtrack emphasizes the dramatic changes in mood with a synthesized mix of softly foreboding ambient tracks and energy-filled, bass-heavy adrenaline-pumpers.

The player‚Äôs armory is gradually upgraded, and each weapon satisfies a logical role. Even the placement of certain weapons is sensible; ammo and guns are awarded by accessing security offices or fortified checkpoints, rather than the secret rooms of earlier shooters. Your movement, health and armor are overseen by a futuristic hazard suit you don early in the game.

Here in the 2020s, what I‚Äôve described in this review are bare essentials of story-driven first-person shooter games. In the late 1990s though, Half-Life was a groundbreaking effort hitherto unseen and scarcely even imagined. To this day it inspires narratives in videogames, it has received both official and unofficial expansions, plus the excellent fan-made Black Mesa project which expands and graphically revamps the game in the Source engine.

Half-Life is a part of videogame history. It elevated first-person shooters from jaunty, arcade-style distraction to a serious art form; an equal to literature and film."

3079,"Half-Life 1 is a very simple and straightforward game, with little story about it. Basically, [spoiler]an experiment went wrong and now you just move forward killing all the hostiles, while avoiding dying.[/spoiler]

Difficulty wise, it's not too easy but not too hard either. You can save whenever you want wherever you want, so that makes things easier too.

There are several weapons to pick up throughout the adventure to make your life easier, depending on your situation and in case one weapon is running low on ammo."
3080,This game revolutionised storytelling in the FPS Genre (seems a lot of old FPS games were revolutionary after Quake came out). It's very good.

3089,Original game with extraordinarily exciting gameplay.  This is better than Call of Duty Vanguard.  Buy this instead.
3090,"At first you may think this game is a dork puzzle game because you play as a nuclear scientist with a beard and he's just riding around in a little doohopper for the first 15 minutes. BUt that scientist is named Georgy Freeman and he goes completely insane and pushed an orange rock inside a laserbeam to completely fuck up the universe. He did it just because he was bored at his job and wanted to kill everything. He is a complete sociopath loner who never says a word to anyone, he'd rather sink his crowbar into their skulls and feel their warm blood spatter all over him! Pretty cool!"

I recommend"
3111,This game rocks
3112,"Still holds up, even after 24 years. Revolutionary and really important to gaming as a whole too. Honestly, if you haven't tried it I really recommend it. There are some really lameass levels and sometimes it's cryptic on what you're supposed to do, but for the most part it's a really damn good game. The gameplay allows you to pretty much tackle the game however you want with the more weapons you unlock. It's a must, if you're looking to play more valve games."

It included

- A plot

The gameplay was quite fun to play through"

3126,This is a good classic game! I recommend it to anyone who likes fps games.
3127,good
3128,"Great FPS, one of a kind, I grew up playing it."
3129,"Man I really often have to remind myself, this game was made in 1993, refined by 1998. Back then, PCs used floppy disk storage, had under a gigabyte's worth of HDD and RAM, and ran on the ugliest screens there could be.

This game is revolutionary, and it would've been more than a tripleA in its time, it's a founding father. It was years ahead of its competitors, going a completely different route than DOOM, straying away from Nintendo's family games and being years before other older FPS games like Halo, yet still made by some of the same geniuses who made DOOM, ID Software.

This first piece of work that Valve made on the Source Engine would go on to create an environment for their future games, multiplayer and singleplayer alike. Back before all of their achievements, this stood by as a root and erupted into what Valve is today, it blew up.

Valve has had great achievements, but within the sheer success of their platform, the innovative design of their servers and engines, the choices of launcher, hardware and OS/software, nestled within it all are the games they make. Everything about them reeks a sort of awareness and precision that no other developer has ever mastered as well as Valve. They toy with the player, analyse every possible perspective someone could have and strings along a story and atmosphere that this mind could traverse and feel immersed in.

AI's reactions, pre-written events, environments, interactions, Half Life kinda has all of them. There are moments in Half Life where I can't help but notice little gimmicks that make it feel so alive, which I never see repeated. There are moments in the story where things happen, and they tie into the game's atmosphere. As of recent, seeing alien encounters slowly ramp up higher and higher, the game had just put me through a combat-heavy section against the human task forces. Now I see them fighting among eachother as I stand back and watch. I really felt like a battle was ongoing, as tides slowly shifted and radios began broadcasting panicked cries of ""Forget Freeman, we are retreating!"". I've not fought a single human since then, but I hear them down these corridors shouting in their walkietalkies still. This game has me invested in a way I can't describe. I want to run with these people and flee. The world's looking redder and redder, there are tendrils and monsters I haven't seen before surfacing. Bumping into scientists running and scattering, saw this police officer once at the top of a roof pull his gun on me for a second thinking I was a taskforce guy before putting it back down and saying ""Ah, hello"". I haven't seen any others react like this, and I feel like the developers put him here to show me a mirrored image of myself. I was just as scared and startled as him, and I was seconds away from shooting em back. The relief of a friendly face I soon probably won't be seeing again. The way I'm talking about it in this manner, almost as if I'm mentally living Freeman's life, is giving me chills as I write it.

This goes with everything Valve makes, and it's so noticeable in their very first games. Where less focus was on graphics and all was on how they could use every other field in their favour to grasp the player's attention. Games aren't considered art because of their visual directive or their sound design; it's how they play with a player's viewpoint, it's how they interact with our perception to create a free and dynamic yet deliberate and coherent canvas which we paint our experiences and memories upon. And with developer commentaries, you will begin to realise a dozen more things that you never even previously thought of. Things as little as the colours of the environment, or the starting area and sequence, add up to this image of what you perceive and feel playing it, it's the true art and craft of making a game. They've thought every last pixel of it out over years of collective and collaborative effort.

Portal and Half Life, in my opinion, are masterpieces. They are pure works of passion that extract the essence of what a game is meant to be, and Valve has nailed that vision. They deserve the spotlight of being featured in a museum somewhere, discussed in some louvre, just to make a point.

And yet, instead of being hung up behind bulletproof glass for you to gawk at from 5m away? You're here buying it and enjoying it to its fullest extent for a f***ing dollar."
3130,iconic game
3131,"Better shooters out there. A relic of it's time.

Worth a look though if you like gaming history.

1998 5 stars.

3148,Really happy with this game. Easily the game with the earliest release date that I could see myself enjoying without the benefit of nostalgia goggles. It becomes very clear early on that this game had a huge impact on the games that came after it.
3149,I mean it's a legend. You really can't go wrong playing this.
3150,Ok my last review was kind of mean. Sorry. I still am not a fan of Half-Life tho.

3154,HALF LFIE
3155,"This is not the game that started my path as a gamer, but it's certainly part of the cement that it's made off."
3156,Its nice to see valve cares about their legacy by having their most iconic game in an absurdly broken state the brightness level is completely fucked there are bugs here that aren't in any other version animations are broken in some segments and overall its a pain in the ass to fix its worthwhile if you can be bothered to fix it but do some research first.
3157,headcrabs r EVILL!!!!
3158,"Amazing Game, even though it's old, it still has a lot of fun to give. I'm always impressed by valve, especially how they create timeless games like this. Looking forward to play Half Life 2, whenever I buy it."
3159,The first ever crowbar that went DONK
3160,It's Half Life. You aren't a real gamer unless you've played Half Life.
3161,A timeless classic.
3162,corn
3163,When the consequences are unforseen
3164,"Hello Gordon, Bye Gordon"
3165,"if you've never played this, you aren't a real gamer."
3166,One of my childhood favorite good old retro game that aged like wine.
3167,Love it
3168,"One of the best games I have ever played. Although it‚Äôs old it‚Äôs not gold, it‚Äôs diamond. The gameplay is perfect. I love this game and play it every day. It‚Äôs honestly amazing. 
Graphics:3/10 It‚Äôs an old game the graphics aren‚Äôt great, if you want good graphics play black mesa.
Gameplay 9/10 The only bad thing is that there is a cut character who is a cool robot but you can play as them in multiplayer.
Story 8/10 Very good story but it‚Äôs told through multiple different expansions sold separately.
Price 11/10 It‚Äôs only 10 DOLLARS and on sale 5 DOLLARS. I would pay a full 60 for this. The price is amazing. Overall amazing game 10/10"
3169,"I hate writing this because I wanted to like this game but the game was overrated. Don't get me wrong, it was good sometimes, but most of the time it was confusing and boring. The only important parts only happen at the start and the finish."
3170,fucking awesome gaem
3171,ok
3172,nice
3173,"they're waiting for u gordon, in the test chamberrrr."
3174,gman swag
3175,Aged like a fine wine.
3176,"A fantastic single player shooter that really doesn't show its age. I never played this when it came out, but was shocked to see how fluid and enjoyable the movement and shooting was. There is a decent variety of weapons, and you are always challenged to conserve your ammo as best as possible. Enemies are very diverse and interesting, and the story is fantastic."
3177,"i love to sample the announcers voice, also yes, this was the birth of a generation of fps, i truly respect how far it came"
3178,I got it for free it was a good game it just suddenly deleted by itself :(
3179,"Blue Shift was the first FPS I ever played, and it changed my life. If you haven't played this before, try it -- it holds up."
3180,yes very good
3181,Absolutely Phenomenal.
3182,best game
3183,only for mods
3184,the game may be old but it's great i recommend it!!
3185,Good game.
3186,"it is very good
"
3187,"One of the most iconic games that ever hit the market and changed my taste for gaming ever since Crowbars Flagship Title came out! Half-Life was out on PC and had hit Playstation Systems in the early summer of the 00's and boy was that a summer to remember. With the games immersive story line and excellent character development, you quickly began to not only play as Dr, Freeman, but become him. As you engage with the staff of Black Mesa, you come to see that Freeman was highly loved and adored. Losing staff members actually hurts a little. The gameplay is both intense, immerse and entertaining. You will find yourself reliving memorable moments in the game that the crowbar community has often quoted many a times. Well spent hours playing enjoy!"
3188,game awesome lol
3189,"nice

"
3190,Great game
3191,Why can the aliens firebend?????? valve please fix your stupid piece of shit game.
3192,fucking awesome
3193,Makes me happy!
3194,"Good Puzzles, Good Story, Good Level Design. What's not to like?"
3195,The first fps game I played and a classic
3196,"Makes my bootyhole tickle but i like it
"
3197,good game yes
3198,"took me 7 hours to beat the game. and i have only beaten it once so i am not the best when it comes to lore and easter eggs.

The graphics are average 2000s graphic, not the best. But where the graphics are lacking the gameplay are stacking. The gameplay in half life is the best experience i have ever had with an game. The story is super good and you can understand everything that is going on. The gun play is good except that it feels impossible to spray with the smg lol. 
Everything about this game is good! And it is not overrated or anything it is actually as good as people say it is.
Personally i think i could replay it 3 more times and try to finish the game as fast as possible and try to find funny glitches/tricks you can do.

So in short: If you like games with a lot of guns and action half life is the game for you. If you like puzzle solving then half life is for you, if you like story rich games then half life is for you."
3199,half life
3200,buddy it's Half-Life you already know how good it is.
3201,HALF LIFE
3202,"Best game series. The game is good, has unique weapons, a lot of mods, few bugs (as a weapon too!), positive reviews and more!"

3209,The remastered classic
3210,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
3211,"After being introduced to Portal in 2021, I was then encouraged by a coworker to check out the Half Life series. I normally never liked the idea of FPS games - but after a while of playing I became quite addicted to shooting aliens and bad guys. I'll be honest, as a new PC gamer I had not yet ventured into playing with a mouse and keyboard. I had only played with a controller. But because this old game had no controller support, I was forced to try it and became more proficient with it. I now prefer it (of course) over a controller for this genre. It was cool to see the old graphics - from which we started. It kinda reminded me of playing an old DOS game: Corridor 7. It was after this game I was hooked and had to play the other games in the series!"
3212,amazing expirience whip na na
3213,this is more alive than the weeb jokes
3214,"Giving it thumbs up for the historic and nostalgic value, it's pretty dated now.  Black Mesa a vast improvement."
3215,"Classic but sometimes when you get stuck in a place you can't get out, and have to restart the entire game. Would play it over and over though"
3216,This is THE absolute classic when it comes to FPS with storytelling elements. This really takes me back to the PS2 era and I enjoy every second of it minus the train section.
3217,such a good game I came just writing this
3218,My all time favourite game. Thanks for a fun childhood.

3230,"This game has aged remarkably well - a compelling narrative shooter with some genuine thrills and impressive AI to this day - worth a shot.

It hasn‚Äôt aged flawlessly though; the quake engine‚Äôs physics objectively make the first-person platforming worse and some of the level direction and puzzles can be vague to say the least. And the final act is a real downgrade; feels super rushed and unpolished. Because it is. 

If you‚Äôre interested in playing Half-life now? I recommend you Start with Black Mesa and then go on to half-life 2 MMod - the most cohesive and richly nuanced version of this series you can get; but classic vanilla still holds up; a testament to valves design chops.

3234,"its a good game,even though its from 1998, its still a good game, have f"
3235,"A revolutionary game that changed the gaming industry and the FPS genre as a whole forever. You should absolutely buy and play this game if you're into first person shooters.
However, it was my first ""boomer shooter"" ('90s shooters like Classic Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D), and my first playthrough (circa July 2021) had some problems I accidentally caused myself.
Don't let this happen to you. Here are some tips and stuff that you should know in general:
[list]
    [*] Play in OpenGL if possible. Mixing software mode and widescreen (a requirement if you want to play on a modern 1080p monitor) breaks the game (just trust me, it does) requiring launch arguments to fix.
    [*] I'm not someone  that tries to 1:1 replicate the 1998 experience (I just told you about widescreen, that wasn't in the original, after all), but please turn off the ""HD"" models. They do not fit in with the game and are a downgrade.
    [*] Planning on buying the expansions (Blue Shift, Opposing Force, Decay) or Half-Life 2 and its Episodes? You should probably play this first. If you're already decided, check how much are the Half-Life 1 Anthology (Half-Life, its expansions except for the PS2 Exclusive ""Decay"" and Team Fortress Classic), the Half-Life Complete Pack (HL1 Anthology + Half-Life Source, a terrible buggy mess I'll talk about later + Half-Life 2 and its episodes) and the Orange Box (Half-Life 2, its episodes, Portal and the premium version of TF2, which you'll need plus a non-limited Steam account in order to chat in that game). [b] Don't get overwhelmed, though. Start with this one and see if you like it.[/b]
    [*] What about the Half-Life: Source remaster and the Black Mesa remake? Do not, under any circumstance, play Half-Life Source. Half-Life in Valve's former flagship engine sounds like an excellent idea in theory but HLS executes it terribly. It's a broken, buggy mess. You should play the original Half-Life and Half-Life 2 before playing Black Mesa, which is fine.
[/list]"

3245,I love half life I Love Portal and Love valve valve is a really good comedy with their popular games like half life portal team fortress counterstrike. And left for dead like these games are a masterpiece like half-life came out in 1998. This game was really old but this game will be stilled play to this day everyone love the original half-life game and a half life series cloning half life Alex half life Alex is a really good VR game but I don‚Äôt have a valve index because it cost a lot of money üíµüí∞üíµ and also I saving up for the steam deck and also can you please make half life 3 like half life Alex don‚Äôt count as Half Life 3 like really when G man show Alex the future when his father die  Eli Vance died and half life 2 episode 2 like really we didn‚Äôt get a new half-life game for ages when half life Alex came doubt I was just saying please valve all pretty please give us half life 3 thank you valve for giving us the best games over the years

3252,2nd most important shooter that was created. Beated it 2 times and its really fun.
3253,"A timeless classic. This game arguably revolutionized PC Gaming and was a blueprint for all that followed. 
Despite the outdated visuals, Half-Life holds up surprisingly well. Buoyed by a strong narrative, weapon variety, and different enemies, Half-Life is a blast to play. Playing this game is like an adrenaline shot; you feel like you've been thrust into the Black Mesa facility and must survive.

Half-Life offers an unforgettable experience. If you haven't already, buy this game."

3274,such a menafce
3275,"I thought I'd show respect to the original after many hours of Black Mesa, and damn does Half-Life still hold up well.

Of course graphics are outdated but it doesn't even matter; I played on Hard, and while it was certainly frustrating at times, the gunplay and diversity of weapons just feels too good. I think I regularly used every weapon throughout the my 6.5 hour playthrough, which is kind of insane when in most FPS games one weapon is almost always the best choice. The level design is (generally) great and the spatial consistency of moving throughout Black Mesa feels amazing. It doesn't feel like I've just teleported to the next chapter, but of course the lab experimenting on alien lifeforms is directly connected to waste management. It just feels right.

There are a [i]few[/i] bad sections in Half-Life though, like On A Rail and Zen, that dampened by enjoyment‚Äîbut then right after I'm in a completely new location, with unique challenges to overcome that keep the game constantly fresh.

This is by no means a long game, but it sure is fun while it lasts... just don't pick hard unless you're somewhat masochistic."

3289,"Valve's 1998 debut hit Half Life is an extraordinary game, because it was set on innovating gaming as a whole.
For years the FPS genre had followed in the footsteps of DOOM and Quake, legendary games in their own right, and as a result FPS started to feel samey. But Valve refused to follow the trodden path and masterfully created a quantum leap in new technology, pioneering into new territory, and crafting a strong narrative in an industry where in the words of John Carmack, co-founder of Id Software, ""Story in a game is like story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but its not that important""
And valve did it again with HL2, but now when you look at the Industry today, we see history repeating itself, AAA games are feeling samey and refuse to bring something new to the table. We need to relearn how to innovate from old games like these to move forward and create truly impressive titles in the modern era of gaming. 
This is the Legacy of Half Life"
3290,Half Life is when you
3291,halflife is gud and u know it buy dis game
3292,Great classic. Final boss aged like milk though.
3293,"I didn't really know what to expect when I first played it, but it really subverted my expectations. This is a game I think every ""hardcore video game player"" should play at least once. Just make sure you turn the HD models off in the settings"
3294,ocarina of time but with guns
3295,This game is beautiful
3296, ;)
3297,timeless classic
3298,this is one of the games of all time
3299,yes cause shoot alien
3300,lots of  fun and  is  challenging at times
3301,"I like the Half-Life franchise and have almost all of the games, including Half-Life, Opposing Force, Blue Shift,  Half-Life 2, Lost Coast, Episode 1, and Episode 2. I plan on getting the rest like Half-Life: Alyx, but as of this moment I don't currently own a VR headset to do so or own a good PC to even run a game with intense graphics as that. (I also plan on getting Decay)

If you are new to the franchise like i was a while back this game is a good start, sure it might be old as it was made in 1998 and the sounds weird and stuff but its good to play through the first game more and allow you to understand the next games and how you may have met people that are important to the story. I'd say get this game if you really want to start getting into the franchise. GL!"
3302,JUST YES
3303,poggers great story.am trying to mod it and it seems very mod compatiable
3304,I had so much fun with this game 100% would recomend
3305,Every Half has its Life
3306,"Great game, a lot of fun, great story to the game, the game has a lot of action but you also have to use your brain a lot while playing it"
3307,"   There's a reason people call this a classic.  Half Life changed the FPS genre so much and for the better.
   First off this game doesn't just drop your into combat and give you a single line explaining the bad plot that's just used to give you a reason for shooting people without mercy.  Half Life starts with a scene were you have no weapons or enemies, gives you an explanation for what is going on while also showing you around Black Mesa and giving you an idea of what is happening without it being told to you directly (one of the many examples of Half Life being amazing at environmental storytelling) and, giving the general mood of the game all while letting you figure out the main motion controls.
   Never forget that Half Life also had some of the most strategical gameplay of any FPS at the time.  Grenades, trip mines, satchels, and snarks are some of the most obvious examples being able to draw out enemies, time attacks perfectly without aiming, kill enemies without even being there, having other creatures do the dirty work for you, clearing out mine fields, and a million other uses but every weapon has unique uses.
   Of course the enemies are all different and interesting.  From long range attacks to being able to avoid your            weapons these bad guys are creepy, cool, and delightfully challenging to fight.
   You can't forget the incredible pacing in this game.  The story never seems to pass by super quickly or drag on to long (other than a few parts) and keeps you interested for the entire time.
   I don't have the time or words to express my love for this game so I will simply tell you to buy the game.  If you're anything like me you'll love it."
3308,good
3309,epikness
3310,"Half-Life is such a masterpiece.

It's an old game, but it's still absolutely great. It has received 50 Game of The Year awards, and is (in my opinion) one of the best games ever made.

Alright, it runs on the GoldSrc engine, which means that the graphics aren't exactly great; But I love them! The graphics have a charm to them that I don't find in a lot of other games...
The sound design is also brilliant. Whenever you're in a vent, all the sounds have a bit of a reverb added to it which is very immersive. The NPCs have conversations with each other (kind of), which makes the world and characters feel alive [i](that is until the 'incident' happens)[/i].

Since it is over 20 years old, you might think that the game is pretty dead. Well, you'd be wrong. I myself, as well as many others, are still mapping and modding for this game to this day. You can easily make a map by setting up the right tools which takes less than 15 minutes, and have fun for many, MANY hours.

The atmosphere is creepy, but somewhat relaxing. You can walk around for a while without meeting anyone (since most of them are dead), which made me feel extremely lost and helpless.

Great game,
9.99/10"
3311,just yes. immortal classic
3312,"Pretty good, and cool and I liked the music."
3313,"Playing this in 1998 was amazing, but It hasn't aged well. I can't recommend playing this in 2022."

Game world is crafted with care and it keeps throwing cool set piece after set piece to keep you interested. Gameplay is fast and your arsenal gives you few different ways to deal with the enemies. Graphics may not look so good nowadays but I love something about these polygon graphics, mostly because they feel nostalgic. What else can you say about it other than play it if you haven't and it's a masterpiece."

3347,"[h1]Go[strike]o[/strike]d Game[/h1]
I haven't finished the game as of the writing of this review, but no matter the rest of the game, this is, still in 2022, one of the best games I've ever played. 

I didn't know wut to expect going in; I mean sure it's Half-Life, ya' know? But is it ""HL"" for its historic novelty alone, or does it still hold up today as a game worth ur time? Plenty of older ""masterpieces"" I'd tried, turned out to not have aged very gracefully at all.

Before I jump in further, I want to clarify: It's not my nostalgia goggles speaking; I wasn't even born when this game was released and I started gaming much much l8r (less than a decade ago), well past the age of games like this.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
Is the combat good? In principle.... n-noo? But it works. Whether it be thru level design or pacing or just careful attention to the design of the encounters themselves, it's stupid fun.

 To elaborate, pretty early on the game introduces an enemy type (that quickly becomes the staple) that does hitscan damage, almost always outnumbers the player, and takes a ridiculous amount of damage to go down without so much as flinching. In theory, this should just be an irritating fuckfest like COD4(MW), and my arsenal isn't too exotic either (actually their same weapons). Functionally tho, this plays more like a movement shooter (or some odd, super fun hybrid), the likes of DOOM Eternal (funnily enough), and not one encounter I've had has resembled COD4.

The game still has an impressive enemy variety with most of them being distinctly mechanically different.

[h1]Black Mesa[/h1]
This is an (Action-)Adventure game in the truest sense. Progressing thru the facility, completing mundane jobs in extraordinary circumstances, expanding ur arsenal, and coming across new threats, all capture that elusive sense of journey and adventure excellently.

The level and mission design here is phenomenal. The set pieces boast more player freedom and interactivity than most games do today, whilst the level design heavily leverages curiosity by employing secrets the player is meant and encouraged (thru, once again, subtle navigational clues embedded within the environment) to find. Everywhere one can expect to be a secret (underneath a dark staircase, thru a 'sus' looking door, behind the waterfall, etc.) the player will usually find one. The rewards are often not more than some extra ammo or armour, but it's an acknowledgement of the interest the players take in the game world.

Moreover, the level progression itself is fairly secret-y?-esque? Instead of the traditional linear corridor to setpiece/cutscene level design, the level progression here turns out to be just one of the many possible pursuits forward (the rest being secrets and the like), which also surprisingly never leads me to be stuck or get frustrated. 

No obj. markers, mini-maps, glowing interactable objects, contract-like quest systems, obviously coloured climbing elements, tutorials, pop-ups, corridor linearity to levels, and yet each time I felt like I was wasting my time going down a pointless tangent leading me to the dead end, the game threw an organic interaction or secret or, heck, the objective at me. This might have been Valve's first commercial project, but I've rarely seen level design this consistently good more than 2 decades l8r.

Each mission (of the ones I've played so far) is paced very well, with ample downtime, set pieces, new elements and environments, and variation to prevent it from getting stale or predictable. Furthermore, about halfway thru the game, the devs just decided (seemingly) to make a second game and attach it to the end of this one. A host of new weapons, new environments, new enemies are just casually dropped on the player. Different missions also bring in entirely different mechanics ([spoiler] rail cart, conveyor belts and acid vats, etc. [/spoiler]) and just as easily throw them out afterwards (tho not quite as game-changing as TF2, they still change mix things up enough).

The game's visuals, despite their age, still weave together an incredible ambience and sense of immersion, tho the Mesa part of Black Mesa is still a little hard to swallow. Inside the facility, however, the low poly count and dated visuals quickly fade as a detractor and are much easier to digest.  

[h1]Attention to Detail[/h1]
The introductory train ride may not work as well today, with its countable polygon dioramas, but the pre-fuck-up lab, with its player freedom and attention to detail, still astonishes me. So many little details have been catered for, and many elements of the game one would presume to be scripted, have an impressive level of dynamism to them.

The dialogue is also surprisingly realistic and genuine. In most instances, the game doesn't use more than a few short lines to make NPCs instantly likable ([spoiler]such as the guard u see at the start of the on the rail mission... or whatev it's called[/spoiler]). The grounded nature of the dialogue in this game is something most games continue to relentlessly fuck up even today (Horizon:FW).

As a testament to the attention to detail, here's an example. Right at the start (of the game) if u try and walk into the occupied bathroom stall door, the scientists will uhh... [spoiler]politely clear his throat[/spoiler]. 

[h1]Jank[/h1]
So there's a fair bit of it. It's a game from 1998 and it shows, especially in this regard. Angled surfaces, sometimes shoddy aim-assist, jumps not registering, awkward collisions, other utter bullshit, it's got the whole package and it bloody well makes use of it. But as much as it can make me pull my hair out at times, it has surprisingly not soured the overall experience for me. Ofc I would love if I didn't have to contend with the bullshit, but for a game as old as this, I mean I can't really get myself to complain.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Usually, I have a nice little wrap-it-up sorta note here, but I don't really know wut more to say. I could go on gushing about this game, but the bottom line is I haven't come across Xen yet; wut I have come across. however, easily makes this a masterpiece.

Sooo yeah, u should play it."

3355,"You know why you're here, this isn't some hidden gem that you've stumbled across buried deep within the steam store front. This is the font from which all modern FPS games have sprung. The blueprint for environmental storytelling. The game that built an empire, that changed an industry. The bar against which all that follow must be judged. 
This is, quite simply, the greatest game ever made."
3356,Mr friendly deserved better
3357,Accept no kitschy substitutes.
3358,No idea why the fudge it's so buggy
3359,"Well, the game is frustrating, but really fun!"
3360,"loved the game, love the second one, know i'm 20 years late (well 30) but they're just awesome"
3361,good
3362,Best video game ever released
3363,One of the OG FPS that every PC gamer should enjoy.
3364,"Still in competition for best game ever made. You get to play as a highly trained professional, who doesn't need to read all this."
3365,NO Im with the Science Team

3369,Game is actually pretty good but you still can't sex the headcrabs :(
3370,mods
3371,"Fun, cheap, tons of replay value, can run on a toaster, buy it."
3372,i don't even have the game how can i write a review?!?!??!?!?!?
3373,Crowbar: clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang clang
3374,"is this a ""fr?!"" or an ""on god?!"" moment?"
3375,"Its pretty fun and has very low running requirements so I really would recommend it to anyone with $10 to spare, though after you beat the single player(Which I still haven't) there isn't much to do, you can always speedrun and there is the multiplayer community which is kinda lacking, but still fun in general"
3376,classic
3377,i am half way from death
3378,good
3379,so much jank
3380,Half life moment.
3381,goated bro
3382,Aint got none on me
3383,Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?
3384,PlayAG
3385,gorbon freedom fuck up crystal and aliens come!!!! and he need to fight alien and a weird crab with one huge ass testicle
3386,this game is for pp poo poo lovers
3387,gordan
3388,"its clearly aged, but it plays well enough by modern standards. i probably played it too late to really appreciate it, as I didn't really find it particularly compelling."
3389,Still holds up very well for a 23 year old game
3390,"lemme just preface this: i have no nostalgic connection with this game. i didnt grow up with this, or half-life 2 for that matter, and only started playing this game fairly recently. as such, i had a lot more complaints that were less a problem with the game and more a problem with the time period this game came out in. i wont delve into that here, however.

this game is genuinely one of the few games from pre-2000 that i've actually completed. despite feeling dated in some regards, the gameplay is just plain fun. there are sections of the game, specifically towards the end, that just feel a bit too weirdly designed for me to enjoy them. i'd say the game kinda starts to trail off in terms of compelling level design after [spoiler]the military leaves black mesa, and the border world felt like such a chore.[/spoiler] this is pretty much the only negative, however.

onto the positives. my favorite aspect was easily the environmental storytelling that the game has. there arent really any cutscenes, and you can get a lot about the story just from observing your surroundings. this does lead to some slight confusion on the story if you just blazed through it, but for those with a keen eye, it's very compelling from a lore aspect. the overall setting of the game generally feels very realistic (well, realistic in the scenario that theres an alien invasion that starts in the science lab you work at). it's very easy to put yourself in gordon's shoes, since he's just a normal guy. no superhuman abilities, just pure skill that is completely inherited from the player who controls him.

in order not to ramble too much, i will cut this here. overall, would 100% recommend the game, even to people who dont like shooters. prior to this, i'd never really played a shooter and saw it through, and im glad this was my first adventure into the world of fps games. 

tldr: game is very good, albeit dated. if i had to rate it: 8/10"
3391,Outdated tbh. Play Black Mesa if you are planning to play through the Half life series. But if you like really old games go for it.
3392,fun and easy to pick up still pretty difficult for me on normal still very fun
3393,"overrated and boring
praised like a god
plays like a pile of shit
move on to better games and stop holding on to this inferior piece of shit"
3394,gud
3395,Probably THE best game of its time! This game had 8 year old me absolutely terrified. This game had so much influence on games that followed!
3396,This game is very cool üòÉ
3397,"""yeah yeah, good to see ya, now where's dog?"" I haven't cried in so long at this beautiful writing"
3398,"not a lot of plot or anything to follow for a big part of the game but endgame and the ending were super dope. Great game, a bit old (u can fill it with every jump) but still awesome"
3399,This game made me a man.
3400,"gman's pretty hot
"
3401,very sex
3402,wow
3403,"the multiplayer is 1000000x better than any counter strike, the game is made in 1998 and still better than lots of games made today"
3404,just download it to experience what half life is all about
3405,GOOOOOOOOD

3412,it's arguably the greatest game of all time.
3413,give me my vision back
3414,soucse
3415,"it's a bit of an oldie but its really worth it especially since it's only like, 10$"
3416,"A absolute classic from the late 90's, albeit one that hasn't aged that well, with a lot of the visuals and sounds being rather rough, and the gameplay not always being to fun either (especially on hard difficulty). despite all of that tho, it still makes for a great time if you like FPS games and can get past it's age and more rough aspects. If you do play this tho, remember this: Run, Think, Shoot, Live."
3417,"Valve makes good games. When they aren't flawlessly hosting a better games retailer than EGS, Valve is busy making couplets of games. Half-Life is one of said game couplets that has managed to weather the test of time and remains, to this day, one of the best designed, most engaging FPS titles of all time. The combat is incredible for a game that is >20 years old. The world design is top notch, arguably the best in the industry until the likes of BotW and RDR2 came around. The story telling is beyond what could have expected from a 90s title, much less one with a silent protagonist. The puzzles are rock solid, evidence that the Valve design mantra that has held through to modern titles was present from day 1. All that and the game on the OG engine was update 22 years after the game was released and replaced by a remake with an updated engine. Don't be scared off by the age of the game, pick up the entire Orange Box and give this classic a playthrough."
3418,very good
3419,It's Half life.

3422,"I have yet to play a more immersive game period. From the word ""go"", I found myself completely engulfed into the pseudo world that is unfolded before your eyes."

It‚Äôs pretty old so my laptop was able to run it pretty well with it not exactly being super taxing performance wise.

Great if you need an fps but don‚Äôt have a good pc, and it aged well."
3452,"9/10
Excellent FPS. Graphics aren't really an issue, and the story is good enough to stand on its own, but the great part really is the gameplay."
3453,"Nice to see where it all began. It can feel frustrating at times, but a fun experience all the way through."

3469,"While I believe that hl2 is the better game. it still is rather good, the problem is that I was going in like the doom slayer for every fight. don't make the same mistake. I made it all the way to Xen playing like this and only after looking it up i realised that i was playing the game wrong the entire time. But make no mistake, as a member of Gen Z this is 8 out of 10 by FPS standards. By valves standards it about a 7, flawed but fun

Overall, I enjoy Half Life and recommend it, assuming that you play it right

3480,"So after all these years having played games like Team Fortress 2, Portal and its sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, and Garry's Mod, I finally sat down to play the game that started it all: Half-Life. Needless to say by the score, I enjoyed it.

The game provides an interesting and satisfying blend of puzzle solving, platforming, and combat, all of which was satisfying to complete for the most part. Admittedly, there are parts of the game where I needed to cheat a little because I was provided with less than sufficient resources to get past certain areas (or maybe I'm just not the best with these kinds of games, but no matter), but nonetheless this game's age truly shows in its difficulty and its occasional bugs. However, this doesn't mean it's not worth coming back to play Valve's claim to fame, because in the end, it was still a fun game with a good story to it. I look forward to playing Half-Life 2 when I have the time to."

But now that I'm familiar with HL1, I can confidently say that it blows HL2 right out of the fucking water. The pacing in this game is much faster, and the variety of weapons and enemies is more rich. This is a no-brainer if you enjoy FPS games."

3528,"Strong ""cinematic"" start is very impressive first time, but if you don't know english you are stuck and play it like a sierra quest (it's published by sierra, get it?). And every time you want to replay the game the ""cinematic"" 2 hours long intro is utter trash you have to suffer through. You already know the story beats, now you just want the gameplay.
First hour after the event was kinda weak in the 90s: without internet full of walkthroughs it is very easy to miss the crowbar and the first gun in all of the clatter and be stuck.

Then it's hours upon hours of pretty mediocre insane corridor shooter, where the most fun part is pressing buttons. Your legally blind nerd protagonist single-handedly destroys more army-men, tanks, choppas and giant enemy crabs than duke nukem or doomguy. You even have to fight hordes of sexy-time girl-ninjas. At one point you are even captured in a teerible trope of ""now we take away your inventory"". The army guys drag you somewhere looking at you while you are looking at them and leave you alive for no reason. Talk about dumb bad guys.
Once you start to get sci-fi and alien bioweapons you finally start to see that this is not a stupid shooter where all cool guns were replaced with stupid boring realistic military stuff with weak damage. This isn't the Wolfenstein 3D on a 3D engine. Bioguns were great then and they are great now. Even today there are still like 3,5 games that have them. One of which is called Opposing Force.
So okay it's a mediocre FPS with primitive gunplay where you can press E half as much as in the Duke Nukem 3D (but now in 3D) and it has some cool sci-fi and bioweapons you never saw anywhere else. You finally finished it and a science dude tells you to jump in a portal and win the game.

OH DAMN XEN! NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER! An alien world with extremely fun reduced gravity, now we are talking! There are some alien and sci-fi games. But it's always you invading a civilized space or defending human's colonies with civilized spaces, so same corridors slightly different skin. But this time you run around alien wilderness and then invade an alien sci-fi factory! The last boss is pretty weak. It's not as bad as in Quake, but it's still a stupid puzzle. It will take some time but it is possible to understand it without a walkthrough.

And then there is the multiplayer deathmatch. Quake 2 is absolute garbage without MP, and HL would not be the same without it too. You played with all those weird weapons and gadgets, half of which are utility tools with no use to them, and now you can finally place traps for fellow humans or rain aggressive naked rats into their hiding hole. You can run around with vacuum cleaner reducing live players into bloody chunks.

Amazing Xen and great deathmatch make this corridor game with bad gunplay one of the greatest games to this day."
3529,"AMAZING GAME!!! The campaign has a pretty good story for a game from 1998, has a lot of cool weapons, and has an ONLINE multiplayer! It even supports custom maps, making the multiplayer part so much better! First game I got on computer, and best game I got on computer. 10/10"
3530,Just play it already
3531,Good old game where VALVE made quality games
3532,cool
3533,"""They are waiting for you Gordon, in the test chamberrr...""

I remember Half-Life was a big thing when it was first released (nearly quarter of a century ago now!), and no doubt had a huge impact on gaming and popularising games with scripted sequences and a story telling that wasn't confined to just being an FMV animation or a wall of text. Basically, the birth of modern ""cinematic"" FPS games.

You weren't the ""only one against the world"", but could and needed to recruit fellow scientists and security guards. You wielded an arsenal of (mostly) realistic weapons, such as Glock and MP5. There are many parts/levels, that other than the dated graphics, are still memorable and gripping, such as the fight against the Apache gunship. This game still oozes atmosphere.

But it's not perfect, and the big problems are the platforming sections (the bane of FPS games throughout their history IMO) and Xen, the ""Gigeresque"" alien world you get to visit in the latter part of the game. Put those two together, and you have a rather frustrating and unsatisfying ""epilogue"" to an otherwise great experience.

But overall, I feel it is a game that can still be very much enjoyed, even without through rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. And for those of us who played it back in the day, it will no doubt bring back lots of memories of a certain ""golden era"" of gaming."
3534,good stuff
3535,"This is a pretty good game since it's from 1998. It's an FPS/Sci-Fi kind. I heard that HF2 is legendary, I can't wait to try it out! I'll give Half-life a solid 9/10. Very nicely built for its time"

3556,"Coming from Half-Life 2 to this game and man, its 24 years of age shows, I don't mind the graphics, it is more of getting stuck on the world, unresponsive controls, clunkyness, etc, I have had to reload a save TWENTY TIMES because I was stuck in a wall or the floor. Now I understand, it is a VERY VERY VERY old game, but man who would think this game that feels foreign would bloom into the creators of Steam, L4D, etc...  

I personally can't recommend this game, due to how it has aged over the years, but if you want to experience Half-Life 1 and NOT the fan made Black mesa remake for the game, try it out, it definitely changed the FPS genre in it's day. But yeah the gun play is fun, but man getting stuck, clunkyness, and having unresponsive controls due to collision i.e jumping, being flung in a weird direction, or getting stuck on stuff. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON XEN. I personally would recommend either trying out the Remake for the game by fans, or try Half Life 2 Instead. 

Overall 5/10"
3557,Good.
3558,"How do I start with this game?

Oh! I know, since its an INSTANT CLASSIC! 

Half life, and the Half life series has blown me away over the past couple of years.

The plot, characters, map design, EVERYTHING! It's all amazing

Half life was an amazing game even tho its old, I still play this game from time to time and this game has aton of mods to play with. 

10/10 Would get friends to play!"
3559,this game sucks
3560,An all around classic. def top 10 all time games ive ever played. i always find myself coming back to this classic
3561,The first FPS game I really enjoy. FPS cult classic

3563,A classic game that everyone should give a shot.

3568,good story telling awesome game just wish it came out around this time so it had more better grapics
3569,hard to know when you're going but cool 10/10
3570,It's an old game but still playable. It has a very rich story.
3571,This game just might live forever. It hold up to this day.
3572,"This game is fucking amazing, not only the gameplay and shooting, but the puzzles are just on point, not too hard to feel like you are on a math competition but not too easy to make going through the game super fast, would recommend everyone this game, just be ready for some REALLY CRUEL HITSCANNERS. Also the boss is a giant fetus and its so bad that Quake bosses are good now but thats really the only disappointing part of the game, especially the mysterious ending and the credits music which i immeadietly jumped out of my chair and started dancing, i love this game."
3573,"The first game in the Half-Life series, this game in great. The classic combat, puzzles and platforming as well as the story make for a very good start for the series. I highly recommend this version if you're starting out, but if you're coming from Half-Life 2, you could either play this version or Black Mesa, do be aware that in Black Mesa some maps and puzzles are very different from the original. Overall, Good Game. Sure the graphics and GoldSRC it's self are a bit dated but, it kinda adds to the appeal for me."
3574,"Pretty much equally good as Half-Life 2, but I still prefer HL2 over this. Phenomenal game."
3575,not bad
3576,Epic
3577,it's a half-life
3578,"A classic game, fast paced and constantly moving with great puzzles and a simple but interesting storyline. The latter half of the game does slow down a bit when compared to the beginning but it's overall a fun experience and should be played by any PC gamer at least once due to how foundational it was."
3579,kinda cool bro
3580,"Very Exciting Trilling adventure with good mechanics for its age, great story and very enjoyable."
3581,"Half-Life - is a first game in my life, which meeted me with shooter games. Thanks to its design, mechanics and story, this game can be played forever. Personally, I also like the soundtrack of this game - each melody corresponds to the chapter in which it sounds. Because of this, this game is one of my favorites. Yes, as in all games - there are bugs here, but this will not affect my attitude to this game in any way. Thank you Valve for Half-Life!"
3582,the sound design in this game is insane
3583,hard game but for a game in 1998 its smooth and a charm
3584,mmy... employers...
3585,Its Half-Life I mean what else can I say if you haven't played it yet you better get on it you got some overdue work.
3586,The liberal media is attempting to erase Donald Trump
3587,"Absolute pleasure to play! I can't believe I waited almost twenty-five years to finally buy and play this title. This was a well constructed and well thought out FPS. The story is pretty good, the controls are great. I'm definitely looking forward to subsequent titles and trying out other games from Valve."
3588,worst game ive ever played !!
3589,"It's buggy as all heck, but the load and save feature works great, so just save a lot. I'd say there are many times you'll die through no fault of your own, so don't feel bad for save scumming. The game has a lot of variety of stuff you'll be doing, riding trains, elevators, platforming, scratching your head where to go next and so on, thankfully the internet became easier to search since release. I am glad I got around to playing this. Thanks covid. I want to play Alyx one day... But I have it spoiled from let's plays and don't have extra funds laying around to throw at VR anyway. Maybe we'll get something with a three at the end till then."
3590,"Half Life, the game which apparently did many things. I had a fun time playing half life. I played through the whole game on medium back in december 2020, and now it is march 2022 when I am writing the review. Considering all the new advancements in technology this game does not hold up the best. But regardless of that this game was really fun to mess about in. A solid 8/10. For its time a 10/10"

3605,"I've gotten this game, and other Half-Life games as a gift from a friend of mine, and honestly I'm happy with the gift. While some chapters were challenging, it was still enjoyable. After completing everything, including the difficult chapters, I am happy that I've played the game to its fullest, and will be ready to play the other games that come along with it."
3606," I think it's actually aged pretty well. I never would've thought that a nearly 30 year old game could play like a modern shooter, yet here it does. More a testament to how influential and foundational this game was to its genre."
3607,"I hope old graphics don't bother you, because this is a classic."
3608,"Back then this probably was incredible game and mind blowing, but today standards this is not a great game. At least for people like me, who enjoys story more explained by characters, notes etc and a little bit more guided, but still keeps player thinking by themselves. Like seriously I don't know or understand what the f happened in this game. Game starts with some explosions and hell has landed. That's it. Controlling Freeman is HARD in some chapters and some levels are so hard/confusing so you need to watch walkthrough. But still, I think every self-respecting player should complete this game."
3609,"The game is so incredibly boring, the gameplay sucks, there was only 2 times when I was scared which were a headcrab in a vent and a fish monster, it took me almost 70 hours to beat and I didn't even fully beat it because by the time I was halfway through the game I put on cheats and just gave myself infinite ammo and noclipped whenever I couldn't figure out where to go. It's not worth buying and playing through, just read a summary"

3649,"As a lifelong Half-Life fan (or at least what has felt like my entire life up to this point) I am ashamed to admit I never played the original until now. I played a bit of HL: Source while I was ignorant to its issues and I played Black Mesa, but I never sat down and just beat the original. Having now done that, I can say that those that are looking to get into Half-Life or those who are like me and loved Black Mesa, HL2 and its episodes, and even Alyx, I wholeheartedly recommend you play this version. It is shorter than all of those other games, but it packs a nice punch. I will be sure to replay it again in the future!"
3650,"I've heard that this game hasn't aged well. At first glance, I expected it to hold up as well as I had heard. I've played games from this era in the past, on emulators or otherwise, and they've never not been underwhelming. I know I should probably curve the opinion I form when I play games from this era, because I wasn't around when games of this era came out, and I didn't grow up with them, and I don't have nostalgia for them, and I don't have their frame of reference for what the cutting-edge was when they came out. But I also don't really give a shit. Personal experience is the rawest and most valuable material you have to make a subjective opinion on something. 
With all that being said; this game is a fucking banger. The game lacks polish and can still be refined, sure, but the core gameplay and story are still an incredibly strong foundation for a game.
I can't really speak to the gunplay, movement, or puzzles too much. I didn't spend my adolescence getting a fucking master's degree in learning how Source engine works or designing FPS games. With that in mind, I think the core design of the game still holds up today. Each area feels different and realized while having a tight grip on the themes and story being presented. In Black Mesa, you'll be crawling through tight air ducts while trying to stop fucking alien headcrabs from biting your head off while trying to not shoot your pistol too much. The corpses of scientists and security guards pepper the hallways, and you will see people being fucking ripped apart and brutalized. You'll finally get to the surface and then immediately have to deal with the entire fucking U.S Armed Forces while on like 26 health (I'm probably not very good at this game don't make fun of me). You have to launch a fucking rocket into space for some reason while fending off a leviathan creature with just 8 grenades. Every moment, you're trying to figure out how in god's name you're going to make progress while fending off threats from all sides while managing all of your ammo for your guns and your health. Once the game finally tells you there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it immediately puts you in a literal alien world. You're overwhelmed, it feels hopeless, and a lot of the time you don't even have an idea as to the effects of what you're doing, but still you move forward and do what you can; that's the beauty of Half-Life. It's always aware of what it's trying to say on the whole while providing unique, moment to moment experiences backed by gameplay that still feels solid today."
3651,"Half-Life is the best game I've EVER played in my entire life. It's truly timeless, and that's coming from someone who wasn't there to see it launch. it has amazing story, great mechanics, and overall fun game play. all that's aged in the entire game is the engine, and the visuals. and that's what other companies fail to realize. a game isn't good for having good graphics, its good for having fun game play, and interesting story."
3652,haf lie
3653,"I have only played this game for a few hours but already i am thoroughly enjoying it. Even though the graphics aren't great, you hardly notice as you are so wrapped up in the game. I would highly recommend this even in 2022"

3674,"I enjoyed this game after having played Black Mesa first. I wanted to see how good it compares backwards rather than forwards to see if it offered a more unique perspective on the game

Honestly this game is great, I can see how it became such an industry changing title the second it released.

However, Black Mesa is just a better game. Before any pitchforks get raised at me, let me just explain that Black Mesa spent years in development, finely recreating every single part of this game into a wholly optimised experience. Black Mesa also had 2020 technology to build its game on, and this game didn't even have 2000 tech. Half-Life 1 just cannot compete with Black Mesa, and tbh that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's amazing that we got two great games out of this, but when it comes to which one someone should play, honestly I'd say Black Mesa. 

The only reason I recommend Half-Life is that if you want to see just how important this game was, keeping in mind this is a game from 1998, absolutely DO play this game. It IS worth your time. But if you just want to play a fun game and have a good time, while you can find that here, you'd have a better time in Black Mesa.

Edit: Also I played the whole game on hard difficulty. Turns out the game isn't all that hard, people probably just suck. Pro-tip: Use more than one weapon. Don't be afraid to use the magnum even though you really like your SMG/M4."

3679,Why would you not play Half Life?
3680,this game is very fun and has good character design
3681,Greatest game ever made.
3682,"Honestly this is a terrible game, i am incredibly disappointed with this game and I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing it. The graphics are sub-par and the map design is lazy. The levels don't have clear direction and I often spend far to long wandering trying to figure out how to progress. his game is really boring, ugly and frustration."
3683,"Overall:

Half Life is a game changing, FPS that led the genre into a new era, with its immersive, realistic environments and storytelling. In this context, it's a fantastic game, and at its core, it still holds up as a fun game, instead of a mere historical curiosity. However, as many transitory pieces of art which redefine genre conventions, many of its aspects, both design and technical, have dated as well as milk, making it a quite frustrating experience.

7/10


The good:

One of the innovations that Half Life brought to the table was its commitment to seamless storytelling and realism. Its levels flowed into one another without interruptions, and without ever taking control away from the player. All the story was conveyed through character dialogue and scripted events, never using non interactive cutscenes. It basically took the complete opposite approach to storytelling to Metal Gear Solid, a game from the same year. The entire game is viewed through one seamless take from a single camera, Gordon Freeman's POV. This is something that games boast and market themselves on, like 2018's God of War, and yet Half Life did it very effectively 20 years prior. It's very immersive, and it helps the player really inhabit the character, who is appropriately enough of a blank slate, for players to express themselves freely through him. Black Mesa is a very interesting environment, being realistic enough to be believable but fantastical enough to allow for clever and versatile level design. There's also a surprising number of memorable, distinct environments, given that most of the game takes place in a single location. The pacing is very good, switching between exploration and resource gathering, to combat, and to light puzzling often, without it becoming tiring. The enemy AI is very sophisticated for the time, and holds up fantastically to this day. The human soldiers are especially impressive through their use of squad tactics, and grenades. Gordon's weapons arsenal, while not the most balanced (the assault rifle is pretty OP), is quite satisfying to use, and allows many different approaches to each situation.

The meh:

The game's commitment to realism also translates to its level design in a very impressive way, but it also creates problems. Often, the way forward is not communicated very well to the player, and I stumbled around a lot looking for how to progress, often relying on a walkthrough. This obtuseness however, can simultaneously be rewarding. Thinking of the environment in imaginative ways is the name of the game, and it can be surprising to see what the game expects you to do to progress. I found myself thinking that I had found an exploit, or a bug, only to realize that I was following the intended path all along. In a way it reminded me of my first experience with Super Metroid, or the final stretch of Portal. Fantastic highs, and super frustrating lows. Some enemy attacks, especially those with hitscan weapons, are pretty cheap as they deal massive damage very quickly. While that adds frustration, it also helps put the player in Freeman's shoes. He is up against an alien invasion, and an entire army, of course it's not a fair fight. You have to survive using your wits, employing on the fly guerrilla tactics, and your luck. Also, the game's mysterious unresolved ending can be quite underwhelming, or add to the game's vibe, depending on the player's engagement with the story, and the subtext about the hubris of mad science. 


The bad:

My frustrations with Half Life are mostly centered around one thing. Platforming. The game designers lean heavily into platforming segments during exploration, which the controls simply aren't built for. Gordon Freeman runs too fast and has a sense of momentum in controlling him, which combined with the first person view makes for a very janky and imprecise platforming experience. This is further exacerbated in the game's final stretch [spoiler] in Zen, where platforming is emphasized even more, with the addition of space gravity and a long jump ability. During the final boss, I often found myself jumping into the air only to find myself dying from the fall damage. [/spoiler] Also, climbing ladders in this, and other Valve games, is straight up garbage. Other than that, the bosses are pretty bad, either being complete pushovers or frustrating as hell. Finally, the most surprising thing about the game that annoyed me, were the bugs. From getting stuck on terrain while crouching, to broken scripted events, to audio and music tracks stopping abruptly, there was a significant number of times where I had to load a previous save to restore the game to working order. Considering that this is Valve's first game, and one of the hallmarks of PC gaming history, and that it's on Valve's own platform, where it has been patched multiple times over the years, this is unacceptable."

3707,(Insert funny and relevant scientist quote)
3708,I really don't see the hype
3709,"An absolutely revolutionary game.  Just... buy it.  This game is DEFINITIVE, and especially if it is on sale... get it."
3710,good game i will say hard mode is hard
3711,its half life we all know about it by now
3712,The start to one of the most amazing series of games. 10/10
3713,"I bought it purely to speedrun WON offline when im bored, best game ever <3"
3714,best game 10/10
3715,Great game that revolutionised the genre
3716,This game is old af yet still holds up to this day with its gameplay. Had to switch to thinking in logic of old games and had a lot of fun. Just [i]never never never ever[/i] delete any of your saves until you're done with the game. Mistakes were made.
3717,fuck this game it's just as bad a source
3718,"Fun, challenging and immersive.
(people w/ trypophobia.. WATCH OUT!)"
3719,"""Hello Gordon"""
3720,spooky
3721,yes
3722,Half-Life still stands out from other shooters not only with its story but gameplay. Cons are: Platforming can get annoying especially near the end and that's it. If you like shooters and you haven't played this do yourself a favor and play this. Its only ten bucks trust me you wont regret it.
3723,Do you know who ate all the doughnuts?
3724,this is a certified 1998 classic
3725,"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said 1,000,000 times? It's a classic and should be experienced by every PC gamer at least once IMHO. Try it!"
3726,very classic and creative game.

3733,even being from 1998. this is one of the most unique shooters i've ever played
3734,Definitely worth it!

3749,It's half-life. Buy it already! Around 14-18 hours of first playthrough (even more id you want to see everything).I'll recommend you to buy it at sale if you for the low price of 1‚Ç¨.
3750,Everything except for Xen (the final act of the game) is great.
3751,WAIT YOUR TELLING ME THIS GAME WAS ONLY 4 HOURS LONG?
3752,"The complexity makes this game very fun, would recommend for anyone of age if they can use a mouse and keyboard, is it hard? yes, it really is, is it fun? if you like shooting and puzzels, then very much yes, at the time of write, i have not finished the game yet, will do soon."
3753,this game is like 8 years older than i am and i still find it amazing to this very day. its hard but the fun kind of hard and its fun to mod.
3754,Just started playing it and it is a blast. I love the  story.
3755,"too tedious,and very confusing at times. if you can get past those,you should but it."
3756,"Half-Life made an effort to ground its game world in realism in contrast to other shooters of its time, and that decision still pays off well twenty years later. Black Mesa is memorable setting, and its distinctive sights and sounds help reinforce that. However, this was Valve's first commercial product, and that shows in various ways. It's no secret that the game's emphasis on set pieces was to make up for its fairly mediocre combat, and while the enemy AI is impressive, the emphasis on hitscan and otherwise difficult-to-avoid enemy attacks does sting. The boss fights, though few in number, do also tend to be some of the weakest parts of the game.

Still, to write off Half-Life as a historical curiosity would do it a great disservice. It's still a fascinating world to explore, and even if the game's age turns you off, there's also the remake Black Mesa available as an alternative."
3757,i killed a testicle monster
3758,it's good and fun but a bit tricky and some areas really use your brain look all round and fun the stupid logic cause there's a lot of it here in the game :)
3759,Fain.
3760,Hello gordon
3761,Timeless classic.
3762,Old but gold.
3763,I played this game for the first time in 2022.  It was a lot of fun.  The boss battles and puzzles were challenging but very rewarding.  The story is also very cool.  Highly recommended for those interested in the classics.
3764,very good first person shooter
3765,good
3766,"Half life is a game I played when I was young, and to this day will still go back. As much as modern games have changed my opinion on old games, half life is one of the few games that's actually fun to go back to. There's something about the classic graphics and simple plot that's just really enjoyable to play through"
3767,yes
3768,"Really good game, even though the game is old and don't have really good graphics but still a good game. Puzzle game, shooting, etc.."
3769,Legendary game that gave birth to Counter-Strike
3770,"I've never been so late to the party when it comes to games, but, I can easily say over two decades after this game came out that it's better than most modern fps games I've played."

3776,"Absolutely brilliant game!

The combat is brilliant, at first because you can basically move like doom guy you think you're practically invincible...typical strong FPS protagonist. 
However, soon you figure out you have to think to survive. 
Playing with caution and skiull instead of blindly rushing corners.
very clever game with fun puzzles, parkour, fighting and expolration.
Pretty good sound effects that genuinely immerse you, especially the guns- you feel as if you're actually handling a deadly weapon.

Overall, very fun game, basic story but very immersive and fantastic for its age! :D"
3777,
3778,"This was a proper retro gaming experience for me, loved it! Even today with it's old visuals and sounds it is a very fun experience and was worth every penny. One thing I will say is it's very difficult, even on easy difficulty, that may just be me but I have heard similar things from many of my friends so perhaps its just the way it is. Regardless, great game!"

3799,"dont fuck with the interface thing, i zoomed too close and i dont know how to stop it, i cant play the game anymore. other than that its a great game, would recommend."
3800,"Recently beat the game, and although the game looks like my eyes went through a cheese grater, the story, sounds, and charm are more than enough for me to 100% recommend it. Besides, $11.49 CANADIAN?? Cheap as hell."
3801,"Incredibly immersive exploration and design. The love that Half-Life has garnered was easily recognisable from the opening sequence. Combat is accurate and timeless. My only letdown would have to be Dr Freeman's Quake-streamed rollerskating when it comes to timed manoeuvres, slippery rungs, and the odd finicky jumping puzzle. Saving often is advised. Despite the technology of the day, Half-Life remains a classic that has managed to retain a wholeness to its vision that few games achieve and which Half-Life 2 performed to even greater excellence."
3802,good puzzles!
3803,"i didn't give this game a bad review because i hate it,but because theres sven co-op which is a free and more improved version of this game,so i'd recommend you to save your money and download sven co-op instead."

3808,i left this game running i dont have 200 hours on it
3809,i killed an innocent man in the game
3810,this game goes so hard
3811,"I think going into this game knowing next to nothing about it is the best course of action. It was a great experience, plenty of good visual storytelling and next to no hand holding, which is a nice change of pace when comparing to today's video game titles. I can see why there are plenty of people hailing it as one of the greatest games ever. But if you go into this game fresh, having never played it before, with that level of expectation, I think you might be setting yourself up for disappointment. In my opinion it's a great game that held up well, especially for a 1998 game. A solid 12-16 hour experience worth every penny. 

This game made me want to try finishing Half-Life 2 next, and excluding the 4 hours I put in at the time of this review, the only thing I know about it is that people REALLY want Half-Life 3 for some reason, so I'm looking forward to seeing why."
3812,"After completing the game, I just have to say that it was absolutely fantastic. The story is amazing, the amount of content is amazing, the gameplay mechanics are amazing, I could go on and on. If you don't mind the old graphics and the length of the game (it's pretty long) than I'd say give it a shot, it's fantastic."

3817,Iconic and timeless
3818,This is good game.
3819,"starts amazing and ends very very low, i only have 26 hours because i just like the combat and style of the game"
3820,Its good
3821,this is easily a single player game ever created
3822,"half life is awesome for many reasons 
"
3823,ah a classic game it is very enjoyable still now but it is very outdated and has graphics that look like was made in 1998(because it was made in 1998) but it is still very enjoyable .
3824,it's a classic so I recommend you play it but be warned It hasn't aged the best and it can make you frustrated at times (it often made me) the controls are weird you seem to go sliding even for a tiny bit after you stop walking and the enemy AI can range from annoying to rage inducing still if its on sale I would give it a go it shouldn't take skilled players long.
3825,"Despite a slow start, and rather unsatisfying (or even boring) ending, Half-Life is a great way to see where a lot of the fundamental tenants of modern fps design come from. Playing with its historical position in mind really opens you up to how revolutionary some of these gameplay elements (standard by today) would have been at the time. Despite being a historical document, the game is also merely very satisfying to play: level design rewards critical thinking and gunplay feels satisfying."

3830,"good. 1st time playing it, pretty good. make sure you do a lot of quick saving, or the game might get a bit rough at times, but rewarding non the less."
3831,"This game is really good so far, I heard the sequel was great too. Not too sure about the third one though."
3832,I played Half-Life when it first came out and I still love playing it.
3833,It's good.
3834,it fun and it challenging
3835,"This is a great game for everyone, and while it may be a bit outdated, and some parts will take a while, it's a great game story-wise and remains in my top games of all time. Just make sure that you DO NOT forget your passport. Big mistake."
3836,A Classic That Everyone Should Play At Least Once
3837,"Look, set aside from the outstanding amount of mods made for this gem, you really have to just step back and look at how game changing this game really was. Valve made a character that everyone could imagine them selves to be, because you know a lot people work at factories and blue collar jobs, not all but a lot. It brought interesting weapon selection, lots of different enemies to fight and understand. It wasn't just a walk in the park, you had to think a little and figure each situation out. Most games before this didnt really put the time into the character developments and story to make you want to play it to the end. I played this game from the very beginning when it launched and to this very day I have never played a game that wowed me like this one did. Its in my top 3 best games of all time. 10/10 It really don't get much better than this."
3838,still one of the best single player games out there.
3839,"yo mister white, we gotta defend black mesa"
3840,Epic game aged really well as well for the most part
3841,half life
3842,"i finished half life one finally i'm late to the party and i know other people are to, i finished this game in 28 hours which is longer than expected, but overall this game is amazing no joke highly consider buying this game or watch someone play it, but either way valve buts effort in the games they have."
3843,"*jumps out of window and does a flip*


g r e e t i n g s !"
3844,"Amazing game, Although the tags dont say it's a horror game, I do believe it has some horror aspects to it like when you go in vent and a headcrab suddenly jumps out at you from the dark, But lucky for me im a horror fan."
3845,"It would be an understatement to say that this game is up there as one of, if not the greatest FPS games of all time.

Over 20 years later this game holds up spectacularly well, the gunplay, story and overall aesthetic are absolutely marvelous and cannot be replicated.

Wake up, Mr. Freeman.

"
3846,"True Classic. Good worldbuilding.
Although sometimes it's a bit unclear what you're meant to do."
3847,crab
3848,It's good. Really good.
3849,10/10 This game got a sequel!
3850,"A classic game, definitely a must play for almost anyone.
 It is very different from today's games, Half life doesn't guide you through the whole game. After the initial tutorial, the game is like ""Here's a crowbar. Do ya thing."" There were (embarrassingly many) instances where i had to look at walkthrough videos to find out what am I supposed to do. 
However I enjoyed the time I spent on this game and I think it's worth checking out."

3852,"Xen sucks
everything else 10/10"
3853,"its pretty good

3855,"In Half-Life we play Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working at Black Mesa who is late for work. After witnessing unexpected events in the experiment that Gordon is part of, he has the mission to go through the Black Mesa facilities and help his colleagues and then teleport to the Xen dimension and end his journey with an unexpected ending. As for the gameplay, the aiming system and the gameplay in general is very good and still very enjoyable. It is true that the graphics are not its strongest section (let's be fair they are from 1998), but they take a back seat when you are immersed in the story that this game has."
3856,on a rail isnt even that bad
3857,
3858,love this game fr fr
3859,"Just beat the game as I'm writing this review, gotta say for a game from 1998, It has impressed me, it lives up to today's standards even if the graphics aren't the best, but it does have that classic charm to it. I had a lot of fun overall, the story was quite interesting, and the gameplay wasn't bad really other for a few bugs that occurred, but It was manageable. Definitely must say it was an extremely long game, felt endless at points, but if anything It made for a better story in the end as well as introducing some interesting puzzles. Not really much else to say, but overall I think this is probably one of the best games series of all time. Thanks valve for the dedication to this game over the 24 years its been around."
3860,"DONT LET IT OVERCHARGE
-vine boom-"
3861,ewfwfrwe4rf
3862,black ops on hard are way too annoying other than that this game is bloody amazing
3863,"Super fun, super classic!"
3864,"This game has been in my Library for a few years now and I've started it a handful of times. Well, after ordering the Index, I wanted to play through it before digging into Alyx and oh man, this is a great game. The graphics and controls are definitely dated, but there's still a lot of fun to be had for someone who's never experienced this game before. Definitely recommend."

The only fault would be Xen, but even then its not that big of a problem. This is a game so important to gaming history that everyone should play it. If you haven't, go play it."

Playing on the hardest difficulty is recomended, you'll die pretty easily and unless you're really good you will never be at 100% health most of the time, but it really adds to the immersion that you're out of your league.

3903,Good game. I played my first playthrough like it was a normal shooter and got my ass handed to me but if you play smart you'll be fine. Oh and for some reason playing this game actually makes me sick not because its bad but something about the visuals or motion makes me feel woozy.
3904,Its really bad when i click PLAY it just goes BLACK SCREEN and nothing is happening is just BLACK SCREEN!

3918,"Run, Think, Shoot, Live. Sums up this game to a T. great boomer shooter well worth playing today if you don't mind the dated graphics. Gordon controls like he is made out of soap so when the game asks you to platform its kinda annoying and can lead to many unfair deaths, however, because of the super fast movement you can do things they you can't in other fps of this era and latter. In half life you can run up to an enemy shoot him with the shot gun move back behind cover throw a grenade run back shoot him with the revolver then throw bugs at him.
great game"

3943,"This was not my first time playing through this game; however, it was been a long time since my last play through and I have mixed emotions towards this game. While yes, I do recommend this game and it is one the most revolutionary games to date, that's not to say that it is not without flaw. The bad. Many times I found myself frustrated on the lack of clear directions, as well with how ""slippery"" the movement felt. This made moments in the story that required precise jumping and movement annoying to deal with. On top of that, the amount of times I died to random environmental events, as well as glitches where my player was stuck has become too many to count and that also frustrated me. The good. The story, atmosphere, and world-building of the disastrous 'Resonance Cascade Event' was amazing. I love the Half-Life franchise and the way Valve managed to truly bring the scope of this event to life was amazing. The 'run and gun' type game play is very fun and satisfying at times, the game makes you feel at the center of the action.  Overall, I would give Half-Life one an 8/10, highly recommended."

3964,"[h1] My thoughts: 10/10 [/h1]

I know it's kinda corny to rate a game a 10, you'd probably see a 9 more often, but just... wow.
The story, soundtrack, and gameplay is just pure amazing, [b]EVEN[/b] for a game in the 90's.
It's a really fun experience, but most of the time, the game doesn't tell where you're supposed to go, so you might have to look up a walkthrough or something.
If you're having trouble picking [b]Half-Life[/b] or [b]Half-Life: Source[/b]... it's really your choice. Source has some improvements, but it also has its flaws. In my opinion, I would get Half-Life.
Anyways, if you really liked playing this game, I would recommend getting the [b]Half-Life Complete Pack[/b] or [b]The Orange Box[/b]!
https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/231/HalfLife_Complete/
https://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/
Either way, this game is a must have."
3965,Half Life. Need I say more? Absolute banger of a game.
3966,screw the marines smh my head
3967,"The game is amazing don't get me wrong, but it is way too buggy to recommend buying. If you bought the Valve Collection, give it a shot because you may not get any bugs. It depends on the device really."
3968,"Finished the game on Traditional Chinese. Other than destroying my brain, the credits glitched and I was stuck on a black screen, while being able to jump. 10/10 would play again."
3969,my god what are you doing

3977,"One of my favorite games, an instant classic. This game follows the intense survival of one Dr. Gordon freeman, a scientist working at black mesa. After an accident in the test chamber, its up to you to save yourself and anyone else you can from an onslaught of aliens and even other humans!"
3978,"After playing this game I can see why it gained the ""classic"" status it has.  The game is a product of its time when the term ""Run and Gun shooter"" was literal.  You run around killing anything that walks and to top it off the story is fairly interesting too.  I enjoy the DLC expansions that show you different perspectives of the Black Mesa incident.  

However, my main issues with the game are two things.  1) I found myself getting lost a couple times while playing the game, resorting to the internet to help me.  Sure, I could've figured it out on my own I guess, but it was a tad annoying.  2) Near the end of the game the platforming does get troublesome, however, I suppose it wasn't that big of a deal.

Anyway, at the end of the day I really enjoyed this game and will revisit it in the near future in the form of Black Mesa.  Off to play Half-Life 2 I guess."
3979,"BEST GAME EVER
"
3980,"Half-Life is highly enjoyable for a game of it's age. Despite being 24 years old at the time of writing this review, it still remains an enjoyable and sometimes genuinely frightening game to play. Valve did a great job making the environment of the game, as details can be seen sprinkled lovingly around every corner. Everything from the sound design (as crunchy and compressed as it is) to the scripted sequences is executed in a way that gives the game a lot of depth. I certainly found myself enjoying the dark humor that the game presents you with. 

The shooting is pleasant, albeit a bit dated in execution. The movement and platforming feels a bit loose; it's easy to miss a jump, slip off the edge of a broken walkway, but that's to be expected of any game from Half-Life's time. All in all, this is a classic example of Valve's quality game-making capability. For a game from 1998, Half-Life is an impressive and enjoyable game.

I recommend this game, it's worth buying. I rate this game a solid 8/10."

3994,"If DOOM made the FPS genre and QUAKE refined it, then Half-Life added world and life to it. The story of Half-Life is remarkable to say the least while still maintaining a fun gameplay loop. It still has the mechanical elements of 90s FPS but it branched off through its story, creating a truly unique experience at the time and one that's really only been topped by Valve themselves through the sequels. The steady delivery of story between, and sometimes during, action helps to keep the player engaged with what's going on in the story while not spending too much time on it and taking away from the fun. I'd say the best way to enjoy Half-Life is to go in blind and just enjoy the ride; pay attention to the details 
 and just experience it. It really is hard to find games much like Half-Life these days."

Of course the graphics are terrible compared to the games created today. However this game still manages to captivate new players and give them a euphoric experience."

4020,"I was born long after half-Life earned its place as a industry-shifting experience, and as I experience HL for the first time, the revolutionary aspects aren't as prominent to me as some of the more dated aspects of the experience. Half Life wasn't a blast. I'd argue, it was not even great. But, I enjoyed it. I recognize how important it is, and I see a lot of low-key smart design choices that improved the game, but I'm mostly hoping for its seuqel to push the potential of this first entry to higher highs. And based on what I heard, it did."

A great classic that I'm glad I'm finally playing!"
4029,"I've just recently completed what many consider one of the all time first person shooter classics. This game, like DOOM and System Shock before it, refined the model for modern for fps's. The gameplay is very well made and enjoyable. I did, however experience one major glitch during my game. Every time I  would start the game from my desktop, I'd receive a warning that steam cloud failed to backup my saves. I thought nothing of it until one day near the end of the story, I discovered half my saves (the most recent half) missing. I solved the issue by using console commands to load the level I was really on. So I'm glad I didn't have to restart the whole game, but very frustrated that I had to go through the trouble. I really hope the same issue doesn't occur for Opposing Forces and Blue Shift. My other negative isn't much a negative as it is a lack of a positive. The story in this game compared to System Shock 2 and even the original System Shock, is extremely lackluster, leaving this game to rely almost entirely on the gameplay. I won't say any more except that I hope the DLC and/or sequels improve on this aspect."

Got it for myself and the rest is history. Love this series and have played or at the very least seen every entry multiple times, the only reason I have waited so long to own it on Steam ( and Steam itself) is that I have only just been able to get my actual own PC. This was a no questions asked first buy.  If you are new to this you may find it dated obviously from a technical point of view, but experience it for what it is and find out why it gets the acknowledgement it has."

It's still fun talking to the same 4 scientist faces scattered through-out the facility, and the support never does seem to follow you as you patiently line up your 78th crouch-jump manoeuvre to get through a gap for progression.  The neck-tie physics is well ahead of it's time, accurate physics and an independent tie model mean you stay 'in the zone' while that familiar scientist crumples to the ground and the tie flails exactly as you expect it to.
Highly recommended."

But I want to keep playing, the puzzles (while occasionally a little janky) are really fun to solve, and when the combat is good, it's really good.

Pros:
- It isn't broken
- It's constantly being updated
- This game is marketed for what it is (The source version is not a remaster like they said it was).
- Way more mods available for this verion than source.
- Settings are easy to change and gameplay is reasonably challenging
- The mechanics combined with the great story work great unlike the source version
- Multiplayer is better than source
- Can be used to play Half Life: Decay
- Great music score created by Kelly Bailey
- Soundtrack is free

Cons:
- Water doesn't look as good as it does in the source version.
- No ragdoll physics like in the source version.
- The source version has a chapters menu and animated backgrounds unlike this verion which requires the console to load in a chapter.

This game is a solid 9.8 if you like retro shooters like DOOM. The constant updates from Valve keep it relevant and very easy to download, install, and get to playing the game.

4159,Half-Life is an excellent game right up to the last few levels. You know the ones I mean. It's this that soured me badly on the game as the game takes such a nosedive in quality and should really have ended with you reaching the surface. This pains me to be negative about it but I don't want anyone to get to such a late stage of the game and be jarred like I was with the sudden change of design and quality.
4160,"I absolutely enjoyed going back in time and playing  half life 1. Cleared it on hard for the first time ever playing it. 23.7h compleation time. It unfortunatly has some bugs and glitches here and there but nothing that made it unplayable at any point.
There is a big  variation on monsters, bosses and soldiers and the soldiers weapons. You as the player finds many different weapons to use over time, but remember to save your ammo...  It takes a while on some chapters and you need to figure out where to go and how to do it. Especially on hard difficulty.

It's a very great game overall and it would strongly recommend Half Life series to anyone who loves first person shooter, sci fi and fast paced games."
4161,The campaign is fun but the multiplayer is better. Not as good as Half-Life:Opposing Force though.
4162,"the game is great, it just needs quite a lot of tutorials to complete especially for the last bossfight, that thing would be almost impossible without one and not because its hard but because its complicated
i think there should be more story but i think this is great for a 1998 game considering how much it influenced the gaming industry as a whole
the most impressive thing for me is how the guns felt so smooth compared to other games as old as this one, the weapon animations are basically better than all call of duty's before mw2019 except for the missing ads which wasn't really introduced to videogames yet at the time so its aight

4186,"For me its a really interesting exprience. I only got into gaming LONG after this was cool new tech. But somehow it is still an enjoyable exprience. It is however noticable that open world game design isnt quite on the level we know today. Not in terms of graphics, but it is sometimes not really obvious what you are supposed to do. Sometimes it takes me 5-10min just to figure out what the game is waiting for. Still, Im having fun :)"
4187,played the game for 30 mins and the graphics are 10/10 but the game would not close I had to restart my computer

4190,"yes

4191,Its a game
4192,"Half life is by far the most incredible game I have ever played, and was ahead of its time for 1998. Highly recommend and even if you don't want it, I suggest that you play half life at least once in your life. I will say that the game has not aged that well, but it is still an amazing and unique game that influenced many of the modern games that people play now."
4193,"Awesome game, ignore the lack of playtime and achievements as i did most of my experience in with the lambda vr mod. Theres not really much i can say that others havent already said about it, while it may not be the perfect vr game i can see why this was so big and im excited to play half life 2 in a few days when i get my house back"

4195,"I only play this to explode the microwave lasagna, 10/10"
4196,game fun
4197,its better than Half Life Source without any mods
4198,i wanna kill myself it took me 20 hours
4199,gud gAM
4200,"I recently got into VR and decided to buy Half Life Alyx and before playing it I wanted to play trough Half Life 1&2.
I also bought Black Mesa (Remaster of Half Life 1) recently, but wanted to play the original before playing the remaster. I mean this title is a big milestone in gaming history after all. so everyone that cares about pc gaming should definitely try this game out.

Altough dated, I found this game quite good. 

The first 3 hours of this game are amazing. And should definitely be experienced by anyone that has a pc that isn't older than 25 years.


The only negative thing that comes to mind are the last 1-1:30 hours of this game. 
I was confused what was going on and felt lost most of the time. 

Other than that great game!"
4201,Yes
4202,"THIS GAME IS SO GOOD. I had heard really good stuff about this game, and i finally got it and it's one of my favourite games I've ever played. I 100% recommend."
4203,"Greatest game of all time. Especially if this is your first fps game, you should try it. Put it on the hardest difficulty too, because as we all know, the game lies. The hardest difficulty is actually the easiest. This game is also very much rage-friendly, so you can make your 7 year old son play it."

4214,The game gets better when you encountered the human grunt for the first time
4215,"Better than fortnite

4216,Yes
4217,I just completed the game and I can tell that this game story is very captivating. Although game mechanics feel outdated in comparison to today's standard. But I would recommend to try this if you want to enter half life series.
4218,"Favorite game of all time.

Nothing compares.

period.

4219,Not a very good game. Controls are bad and the graphics are terrible. Just watch someone play it and you'll have a better experience.
4220,game sooo bad
4221,I hope they make a sequel!
4222,this game is an hoursteal
4223,"The Game is pretty good, there are sometimes the lack of objective, but that's what make makes this game unique. Every map feels like a puzzle, it lets you figure out for yourself what you will do, the game is pretty fun honestly, even when it feels so frustrating to play sometimes, I still feel the fun it is. I really liked the weapons used in this game, the mechanics are very awesome, especially the Gluon Gun, it's like the most OP weapon in the game, even though it consumes like a lot of ammo. Should you play this game? Yes. Should you finish this game? Absolutely. Should you play this game first before the sequel? Depends, this game tells it's story on what on earth happened in Black Mesa and on Earth, but if you do not want to play, I'd say your gonna miss out honestly. This game was pretty fun, even when times you just wanna skip the game, it's still worth it. 8.6/10. Thank you Valve"

4247,"nostalgic, innovative and revolutionary. 

that's how I would describe Half-Life with 3 words. I was born right before the millennium and haven't gotten into HL1 for a good while. people may say this game is severely outdated in terms of everything, but it has the excellent charm of late 90s PC games. Half-Life is an incredible, 3d linear action FPS, with mind-blowing scenario for it's time. everyone who's into good games should take off their ""modern games with good graphics"" goggles off and play Half Life with it's massive nostalgic value."

4293,"The long half-life of radioactive materials has presented a fundamental challenge to generations of scientists, politicians, and national and global communities alike. With a half-life of up to 4.5 billion years for uranium-238, the legacies of nuclear tests, uranium mining and radioactive waste management linger. It is Australia‚Äôs intimacy with the nuclear that Ian Lowe hopes to untangle in his new book Long Half-life: The Nuclear Industry in Australia, his latest contribution in a series of endeavours to enlighten the public on Australia‚Äôs ill-conceived pursuit of this industry.

The perplexity that surrounds radioactivity is central to Lowe‚Äôs work. Early in the piece, he quips that the long half-life of uranium baffles politicians as their ‚Äòtime horizon[s] rarely extend ‚Ä¶ beyond this year‚Äôs budget or next year‚Äôs election‚Äô (p. 1). But it is not just long half-lives that induce trepidation. Lowe notes that meta-data on the effects of radioactivity is lacking and scientists have never been able to confidently agree on its degree of danger. As scientific opinions differ wildly on many aspects of the nuclear, confusion reigns. In response, laypeople ‚Äì minimally informed and bewildered by the mixed messages ‚Äì fall in the middle of the mess. The tendency has been for ‚Äòpeople to choose the one [opinion] they would prefer to be right‚Äô (p. 27). This, Lowe implies throughout, has been the case since the dawn of the nuclear age in Australia, guiding arguments both for and against the nuclear industry since its emergence in the 1950s.

But it is nuclear energy, rather than the nuclear industry writ large, that most concerns Lowe in this work. Despite nuclear energy presenting itself periodically as a ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô and ‚Äòcheaper‚Äô alternative to fossil fuels since as early as the 1950s, its use was (and is) indivisible from other uses of the nuclear. Lowe argues that the ill-fated British nuclear tests held in Australia (1952-63) ensured that questions of the viability of nuclear energy were entwined with desires for nuclear weapons (p. 42). Such intimacy between energy and weaponry persists. Lowe evokes this by placing this debate in its contemporary context: earlier this year, the Doomsday clock moved the closest it has ever been to midnight in response to the determination that the biggest threats to humankind in 2021 are nuclear weapons and climate change (p. 186). Lowe shows that nuclear energy sits at the nexus of these threats, as it always has.

But, further to this, and from the beginning of Long Half-life, it is clear that Lowe does not believe nuclear energy is economically viable. This will come as little shock to Lowe‚Äôs target audience: an already environmentally-conscious and presumably anti-nuclear one. Lowe uses Long Half-life to platform renewable energy as an alternative to the physically, environmentally, and financially damaging nuclear option. In doing so, he weaves together arguments against the nuclear with a call (to the Australian Government especially) to do something meaningful about climate change. Lowe draws upon his expertise in physics and environmental science to assure his reader that, while it once may have been, nuclear is not the answer to Australia‚Äôs current problems.

By placing our nuclear past in conversation with the current threat from anthropogenic climate change, Lowe provides insightful social commentary. However, it is easy to forget while reading Long-half life that it has been marketed by the publisher as a ‚Äòhistory‚Äô, specifically a ‚Äòsocial and political history of Australia‚Äôs role in the nuclear industry‚Äô. While reading, I was struck that the chapter on the development of global nuclear politics and the beginning of the Cold War was afforded seven pages, and only three endnotes. On the other hand, contemporary debates in South Australia regarding the disposal of nuclear waste are generously given nearly thirty. Yet there was little acknowledgement of the historic efforts of activists to overturn previous dump proposals in South Australia, most notably the 1998 National Waste Repository floated by the Howard Government.

Lowe deals with the contemporary politics of the nuclear in Australia in some depth (albeit omitting key scholars on the nuclear such as Wayne Reynolds and relying a little heavy-handedly on former-diplomat Richard Broinowski‚Äôs Fact or Fission? for historical analysis). However, the lived experience of the nuclear is markedly absent. In Long Half-life the human element of this story is mostly limited to the male politicians and scientists integrally involved in policy. Those most impacted by this policy dilemma are unfortunately lost among reports, scientific debates and statistics, with only vague mentions of the various communities who have pushed back against the nuclear, generation after generation.

This is not to say that Long Half-life is not a worthwhile book. Rather, it has been potentially mismarketed. To sell this book as a ‚Äòsocial‚Äô history is a disservice to what Lowe has done within its pages, chiefly in illuminating the debates surrounding the nuclear industry from the perspective of someone intimately familiar with it. I agree with Monash University Press‚Äô assertion that Lowe is ‚Äòuniquely qualified to tell this story‚Äô. His status as a ‚Äònuclear expert‚Äô is undeniable. And, as one makes their way through Long Half-life, it becomes increasingly clear that it has been written from the perspective of someone who fears for the consequences of his generation‚Äôs actions on those to come.

Ultimately, Long Half-life is a treatise on how to consider the adverse effects of our actions. Indeed, Dave Sweeney and Peter Garrett endorse this volume as a ‚Äòcautionary tale‚Äô and a ‚Äòclarion call for sanity‚Äô. And so, in keeping with its overall themes, Lowe concludes Long Half-life with a powerful call to arms: ‚Äò[o]ur decisions are creating the future in which our descendants will live. I believe we should be working to give them the legacy of a clean and secure future, not one clouded by radioactive waste and fear of nuclear war‚Äô (p. 208). Effective social history or not, it is hard to argue with that."

4297,"Ran into many game breaking bugs. Most notably when in the fight with Gonarch he would not move and became invincible, so to actually beat the game I had to glicht."
4298,funny crowbar
4299,"first few levels are fun. overall, hasn't aged too well"
4300,a classic masterpiece
4301,"love it, moving on to Opposing force."
4302,PLUTONIUM
4303,its good but i dont like the hd models i like the original but i do like this one.
4304,"This aged like shit. Awful controls, awful graphics and sound design. DO NOT BUY IN 2022. Buy black mesa, which is a good remake of half life 1, if you really want to play this game.  Other than that, stay away, the good reviews are either from the 90s or from nostalgia wankers neck beards"
4305,Im no critic but the original is a dissapointment compared to halflife 2 but for story puposes play this ok 4/10 wouldnt recomend.
4306,One of the best games I have ever played and you should most definitely play it too and don't judge it just by its age.
4307,game
4308,still holds up
4309,A great game! Despite it's graphics due to it's age the game play is truly amazing and lives up to anything you would expect from Valve.
4310,nostalgia
4311,"As a person who generally doesn't enjoy the FPS genre, Half-Life is a wonderful game that has aged phenomenally for the most part. From a basic but intriguing premise, to fun and interesting environments, to some really funny voice acting, Half-Life has got it all. It does have a few issues IMO, such as the game not being exactly clear on what you need to be doing at all times, as well as Xen not being as fleshed out as it could be and the final boss being a bit lackluster. I won't hold that last point against the game however, as it's the only boss in the game so there wasn't really anything to compare it to. So overall, Half-Life is a wonderful little game with a few flaws, but not enough to make a big difference. 

9/10
Would play again"

4343,"Finally played through this game. I enjoyed it, you can definitely see its age in certain spots. Going in, I had heard about how bad Xen was going to be, but honestly it wasn't that bad. Like it was frustrating in a couple spots, and I checked a guide a couple times, but no where near what I've heard other people describe it as. Overall, a fun game that I'd recommend at least trying for a little bit."

I am astounded by what Valve achieved in 1998, this is one of the greatest singleplayer first-person-shooter game's I have ever played. Would really recommend."
4373,there is a lot of creatures that you gonna hate. :)
4374,YES.

4381,"El juego est√° genial, pero ya hace mucho que lo sabemos, as√≠ que en cambio te dejo una receta de un postre casero delicioso:
Vas a necesitar:
-1 litro de leche
-5 cucharadas de f√©cula de ma√≠z
-4 cucharadas de az√∫car
-4 cucharadas de dulce de leche o chocolate en polvo
-Esencia de vainilla
Pasos:
1) Disuelve en una taza de leche la f√©cula de ma√≠z hasta que no quede ning√∫n grumo.
2) Coloca en una olla el resto de la leche junto con el az√∫car y la esencia de vainilla. Cocina a fuego lento.
3) Cuando la leche est√© bien caliente (sin llegar a hervir), agrega la preparaci√≥n que hiciste en la taza con leche y f√©cula de ma√≠z. Revuelve bien sin sacar del fuego.
4) Cuando est√© bien espeso y por hervir, saca la preparaci√≥n del fuego y agr√©gale el dulce de leche o el chocolate en polvo. Sigue batiendo con cuchara de madera hasta que baje la temperatura.
5) Servir fr√≠o y conservar en el refrigerador!"

4384,Very Cool.
4385,I love this game. Even decades after i love it.
4386,"This game is one of the best single player games I've played. It has a lot of action in the game. 

Graphics and audio

The audio and textures aren't as good as they are for newer games obviously because this game is old but its good for the year it came out.  9/10 (for its time)

Gameplay

This game took me 10 hours to complete and in those 10 hours I had a whole lot of fun.  Tons of weapons and enemies. Good storyline 10/10.

Bugs

There are some bugs you might encounter such as the second last boss getting stuck (which is what happened for me) but they are mostly easy to fix just make sure you keep a lot of normal saves and not quick saves just in case it bugs out.

Overall this is an amazing game and for $2 it is worth it!"
4387,"this game has lots of shit moments, but the ideas are so good, that it gets you going, how many games out there have so many different encounters like this one has? every single level of this game has a great replay factor, which is good since this is an hellish, unforgivable shooter.

The thing that sticks negatively with me is the combat, yeah cool that you have all this nice ideas and a great script for the gameplay, but if your shooting sucks so bad that you can't even have the pleasure to try to approach levels differently with the guns, why would i have fun? it's just the same thing over and over again, but this time there is a catch! 
The movement is sloppy as hell too, and even tho this is a shooter, you need to platform several times, and it sucks so much to try to control Freeman's buttery feet.
I could go all day talking about how the combat isn't good and how the fun of the game is on the new ideas and encounters, but it's a thing that only you can understand when you experience an encounter where you are spamming three soldiers with your rifle and it takes about 4 seconds to take one of them down.

If the gameplay wasn't as dated and the shooting wasn't as unpleasant, this would be a perfect fps, but as of right now it only stands as a classic for me."

4408,"Half-Life is one of the greatest video games of all time due to what it launched forward, it was one of the first story based first person shooters. It has incredible story telling and very good game play, it still runs surprisingly well on new hardware considering its age. The graphics may turn some off but the game is too good to pass up, while I enjoy the game I still prefer Half-Life 2. But you should play this first."

Fun fact: This was my first ever PC game and I'm not used to the functions of PC games, so I beat the game thinking it was meant to be done with my right hand on the arrow keys and my left hand on my laptop's track pad.  C'est la vie."

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

4446,"Amazing game! 12/10
This is definitely one of the best games period. 

My only problem with it is that the hard difficulty (the only difficulty I played on) is similar to halo 2 on legendary . Where the enemies do stupid amount of damage (especially you helicopter and zap guy). But that's understandable due to the age and what game engines and what not the had accessible at the time.

The story, gameplay, level design (mostly lol), is just so amazing and I wish games were still made with such care and love.
this game, is so amazing, and so cheap! only being 10 bucks and frequently on sale. Basically any computer since 2000 can run it. So get it!!!!

I can't believe this game, 20 years old. Is arguably better than most if not all AAA games that have come out in the last 5-7 years (if not more)."
4447,Other than the chapter On A Rail it is good.

4454,All I can say is Valve knows how to make games
4455,There is no recommendation needed. This game is an epic adventure. Bad ass graphic design for its time. Anyone who ever had a pc back then knows about it and those who didn't used to go to pc halls and play their. One of BEST Games EVER!!!!

4468,"I'm not much of a gamer, but I tried Half life: Alyx, and well.. now here I am. Back at the day, I was too young to appreciate Half-life when it was out (and besides, I didn't have a PC), so now I did some homework and read why this game is a LEGEND. But it's hard to embrace this thought retrospectively, so here is my impression as of year 2022: despite dated graphics and simple NPC AI, Half-life is still challenging and absorbing and probably could beat modern games in certain relations. I must highlight the elaborated plot with many details. It's obvious that the overall idea is great, but there were less possibilities to unleash it's full potential 20+ ago. Of course I'm going to walk through the whole series, but I already wish for the sequel."

But there are plenty of moments when you realize how outdated it really is. Gunplay can feel awkward at times, the equipment selection is unconventional, and at times it‚Äôs fucking cryptic. But overall worth the ten dollars. 7/10"
4509,Based as hell.
4510,Very epic gorgon freeburger
4511,a good game
4512,"This game came out years before i was born. And it still puts modern Fps games to shame. The only thing most modern fps games do better is the graphics. But the story is worse, The handholding ridiculous and the game play is meh. Meanwhile  in 1998 valve and gearbox made a fps with an excellent story, pretty good game play and ‚Äòpuzzles‚Äô to break up the shooting. Yes half-life is not perfect. But it‚Äôs really enjoyable even in 2022. So I recommend you buy it."
4513,"Grandfather of first person shooters, great game! Would highly recommend. However, if you plan to make maps for this, be aware that the SDK is difficult to work with, and the Source SDK is much easier to use."
4514,"It was a good game when it came out in 1998. Now? It holds up just okay. Slippery physics leading to you overshooting and dying of fall damage, level design that can leave you somewhat confused. If you can look past these artifacts of its age, then go ahead. But play at your own discretion

Also the direction is horrible you often find yourself lost hopelessly with no idea where to go

And the Xen levels are crap"
4515,best 2022 AAA release ive ever seen
4516,Maybe the best First-Person Shooter ever made.
4517,i laughed for over half an hour at a dead scientist
4518,.
4519,legendary game. Loved it.
4520,"Obviously since I have 26 hours so far I love this game no doubt. Its way of storytelling through immersion and barely having any cutscenes is a big plus for me. The only times I can think of having no control of Gordon was for a few seconds when you get ambushed and thrown into the trash compact. The gameplay is not TOO special but is still enjoyable and lives up to today in my opinion. Despite my praise there were some sour spots. Mainly on a rail. The slow beginning was definitely a turn off first time, but its fine because of how smoothly and shockingly the resonance cascade happens. You truly get to see how different black mesa gets after the disaster instead of just being thrown into an unknown place thats all destroyed. Xen was a bit slow to but not as atrocious as on a rail. The nihilanth was a fairly easy fight and was over in 2 to 3 tries for me. The ending was amazing also.




9/10 great game"
4521,it good.
4522,Funy gordon swing crowbar

4526,"EEEEE very gut vetr
Mein taktik is szkusit ≈°≈Ø≈°n."
4527,Great classic game! Can be a little tricky at times but really fun!
4528,"So recently I've been going back and reviewing a lot of classic FPS games. Half-Life is one of the greatest FPS games of all time. It's story might not be the most innovative, however, the way the story is told is what made the game revolutionary. I would recommend anyone who calls themselves a ""gamer"" to check out Half-Life. It was definitely worth the 58 hours I have put into it at the point of this review. I know that I will continue to put more hours into Half-Life since it is simply amazing."
4529,ITS JUST A CLASSIC
4530,It's good. Play it. Now.
4531,This is also one of the best single player games ever. That's it.
4532,Played tho whole thing hard bug fun
4533,"Good game, revolutionary at the time but Valve managed to make the game feel like every death is the game's fault. Even though yes, it is my fault that I didn't throw a grenade around that blind corner in the same looking stairwell which usually has a health station and an HEV charger, yes it is my fault this is a video game and every company MUST surprise you at blind corners it still feels like Valve was trying to pull a cheeky one on me and make me lose about 30 minutes of progress. Otherwise totally fun game and it is right before the point where retro graphics become ugly, as long as you have texture filtering off and stay on the SD pack, it still looks great 24 years later."
4534,I lost my crowbar.
4535,10/10

4537,"aliens are cool 
but gordon uncools them

then they come back and haunt him and 
THE G MAN EATS GORDON FREEMAN 
the end :)
"
4538,"A revolutionary game responsible for redefining the entire industry. Sadly, it's core shooting mechanics are a bit basic and the levels aren't quite as good as its ID counterparts. The game hasn't aged perfectly, but the core emotion of feeling hunted through every hallway, that desperate drive to escape, is still as strong as ever. Solid, and worth remembering as the watershed game it was, but unlike some other classics of the time, it isn't quite as fun now as it was when it was new and mind-blowing."
4539,its half life
4540,"this be looking great runs great and if it does not run great then  may god save your pc
"
4541,One of the best games of all time.
4542,"yes and yes why to and fowarrht to left, me when suussy bakkakak. oooaaaaaaaaaaaoaoaoaoaoawa i rec the mend game for you and me and grandma. but grandma dead aaaaaaaaaa noooo god at this game and when i finish rakabak this gamme, and also when cdr rom bb jj amongsus weapon big insoration for you and me"
4543,"sure there`s some annoying dated stuff in this game like On a Rail and Xen, but that doesn`t change that this is a damn fun game will i`ll probably put tens of more hours into from modding and just replaying the normal campaign."
4544,a pretty decent game great story most recognizable game in the world 10-10 would play again
4545,Good.
4546,"one of the most world changing games out there. because of this game we have: half life 2, portal series, every counter strike, and arguably valorant because of csgo. The way this game does NOT hold your hand is beautiful. its not terribly difficult to figure out what you have to do but just exploring a bit and combat not being too difficult is such a nice feeling."
4547,"what I saw down there will forever haunt me and destroy my life, I will never speak to anyone ever about this.

but i got to shoot walking burgers with a spas 12 so its ok"
4548,"It's fun, not much else to say"
4549,"So good it doesn't have a hentai rip-off called ""Half-Wife"""
4550,old game but still amazing

4555,"Undying classic with a number of mods available for it.
C'mon, it's Half-Life!

Originally owned this on the Half-Life Generation box with the expansions.  Bought recently on Steam for better compatibility on Windows 10."
4556,"This game is hard, but the scientists are funny and there are guns, so I recommend."
4557,"Honestly, pretty good game. Just don't play it on hard difficulty, lol"
4558,"Half-Life is a pure classic FPS, maybe one of the best in the genre. A story is told through the gameplay itself which was revolutionary for its time. Complete immersion from the first minute of the game."
4559,all i know is hes been killing my buddies

4567,This has to be one of the best first person shooters I've played.  It's a classic!  Strong story and good soundtrack.  It may not be the latest thing but it still rocks!
4568,The game that started it all for me and PC gaming!
4569,11/10 without a doubt. This game revolutionised games forever and i am truly grateful!
4570,"nice
"
4571,I guess It'll do while I wait for Half-Life 3
4572,"The best 90s FPS, maybe the only one worth playing if you typically don't like older games. Thanks Gabe, you really made it big"
4573,"I mean it's Half-Life. Come on. (get this game if you don't have it, you'll thank me)"
4574,half life 2 doesn't exist
4575,"I thought I would give this game a go and if it was interesting I would go deeper into the series with the rest of Half-Life, unfortunately I just couldn't really get into the story or game play of Half-Life 1."
4576,.
4577,This game has a very good storyline and combat sections and its a really fun game to play.
4578,you can kill everyone in the game 10/10
4579,awesome game for its time but really difficult
4580,"This was my first play through of the game as an adult. I never played it as a child either but I watched my older brother play it through and I have little recollection of it. It's an old game but I can understand why it's still gold!
Here are my thoughts on:

Graphics:
Good for a game from 1998! Although the rendering of humans in Half-Life isn't very good; the environment and the creatures are quite believable. After about an hour, you brain will adjust to the graphics and fill in missing details. There were a few stages where the graphics clipped through objects but nothing too bad. 

Gameplay:
This can be a little frustrating to a modern gamer. I forgot how direct and linear older games tended to be, so there was less hand holding than modern games and more ""you figure it out"", it took only a minor psychological adjustment and it's not difficult to solve puzzles and tactics. 
The game employed more than just 'puzzle solving' too; there were several stages as a platformer where you had to leap from platform to platform. These sections were frustrating to play because the controls were a little too sensitive. So for example jumping from one platform to the other, landing teetering on the edge and controlling you character to move forward a bit, only to have him take 3 strides and now you're dead.
I'd like to suggest to save the game regularly so as to avoid needing to do painful jumps all over again in case you die. 

Story:
Not much goes into a narrative but a brief understanding of ""scientific experiment goes wrong, opens portal, government conspiracy and interdimensional aliens"". 

Extra Notes:
Take care of your health and ammo when you quicksave. There are many spots in the game where ammo is scarce and health is also scarce. 
Has some replayability as a fps.
"
4581,One of the first games I played and won't be the last
4582,this game is amazing the storytelling is beautiful by it
4583,its an amazing game with a great story 10/10
4584,"Wonderful piece of work by Valve. However in all honesty, unless you're in it for the nostalgia of things, I highly recommend Black Mesa for a better experience."
4585,This game has aged incredibly poorly compared to it's predecessors from the same exact decade in every aspect sure (basically a diet build engine game but without the varied enemy roster & good level design imo) but the modding scene for HL1 makes up for all the massive shortcomings with the vanilla experience and justifies the generous price tag that the bundle is going for
4586,"very good game. Portal 2 got me into valve games(as my friend gifted it to me) so i bought the valve pack for the winter sale. Then i tried half life and enjoyed it a lot. Now i have completed all of the games except for opposing force, blue shift and lost coast"
4587,when Full Life gonna come out?
4588,"Playing this game for the first time 24 years after release date.  Better late than never.  Great game all around.  Can definitely recommend it, though I don't think it's needed, as I've read that some say it's like the ""best game of all time""."
4589,"This is one of the best games ever made, even though I just finished it it 2021 it still holds up."
4590,a
4591,The game is so cool even if it's more then 10 years old. Where you're set and what your objective is. It just amazes me!
4592,It's Okay
4593,zamn!!!!
4594,"This game is honestly Legendary, Right after the remake of Black mesa I can honestly say that this game is great."
4595,i only have to use cheats for game i just need to useded
4596,FREEMAN YOU FOOL
4597,good game shoot aliens

4600,prettty cool
4601,a great game in terms of combat puzzle solving and pace
4602,"I highly recommend this game. Runs smooth as butter on most any computer, excellent story and gameplay, nothing to complain about in terms of bugs so far. If you're in the mood for a classic FPS, this game is for you."
4603,ei sun tarvi pelata t√§t√§.

4605,Guy in Dumpster
4606,"game good and fun
"
4607,this is were all games starts thank you Gordon for a good childhood
4608,"If you want to buy this for the nostalgia, go ahead. But do you want a game that has stood the test of time, then go buy Black-Mesa."
4609,my favourite game
4610,its to goood
4611,"Half Life in the flesh, or rather, in the code"
4612,5/5
4613,It blows up your computer bc of the ultra hd graphics ------- joke btw
4614,"The original Half-Life. I have beaten this game multiple times, and I have to say that other than the graphics this game has aged quite well. The gunplay, AI, movement, is all pretty good. I haven't played the multiplayer, but the single player was a fun experience all the way through. This is fun game that I believe everyone should complete at least once."
4615,must i explain?
4616,"Very good game
Aged pretty well.
""Why do we have to wear these riculous ties??!""

4617,good game for good players

4635,no contest one of the best games ever made period and the poorly aged and easily modded gold source engine is an endless source of top tier meme fuckery I give this game HUEGH NO STAHP out of 10
4636,"good game, i shoot the aien. good, yes."
4637,Its pretty good
4638,This game is so good i highly reccomend!
4639,half-life1 is very hard
4640,Oh my god. If you are 30 like and grew up with this game in your heart just do yourselft a favor and play it . you wont regret those few bucks. As of 22.1.2022 ppl still playing this game :)
4641,i don't have this
4642,breaking bad
4643,"Good game, works on my potato with more then 40fps ''me like''"
4644,"It‚Äôs like the prequels prequel to watching paint dry, but the paint is really just two half naked dudes fighting over a jar of green olives. This game is pretty fire. My only complaint is why Gman never removes his shirt‚Ä¶ 15/10 #1 Valve game."
4645,"This game absolute rules. It's genuinely impressive how much of the game still holds up today. The puzzles and exploration are where this game shines. I loved searching every inch of Black Mesa and finding extra equipment to aid me. The weapons are also pretty fun to play around with. Despite the game's age, I did not have too many issues with the allied AI either. The enemies are generally fun to fight against. I preferred the human enemies personally.

Performance wise, the game runs smoothly but the loading areas can be pretty jarring. I thought the story was pretty nice. It wasn't anything too crazy or mind-blowing, but it was pretty solid.

The game does fall off in the endgame. The alien world is such a slog and it was frustrating at times. I thought the aliens were cool and mysterious from a story standpoint, and it's a darn shame the alien world was as boring and frustrating as it was. The platforming of this game is by far the worst part of the entire game. At no point was it fun to platform, but it could just be the game's age. The headcrab queen thing and Nihilanth were really tedious boss fights. 

Despite the Half-Life's faults and age, it is still a fun experience and downright impressive at times. I would highly recommend this game."
4646,how do on an rail help please i try to use bomb on the dor blowed myself up
4647,Apart from a few dated design choices this is the ultimate old school FPS experience. There's really nothing to say about the original Half-Life that hasn't already been said.
4648,Very Good Game
4649,"H Œª L F - L I F E, although released back in 1998, and might be despised by its aged graphics, it's still an amazing game in my eyes. Follow the role of Gordon Freeman, a quiet nerd who is running late at Black Mesa. Originally it being a normal work day, a failed experiment goes wrong and aliens start appearing around the large building. Now, your job is to survive with whatever weapons you have, and get the hell out. If you're thinking of getting it, buy it. It's worth it, and the ending is as confusing as ever like the rest of the game, but in a good way.

4652,"Holy crap this game is fantastic, it holds up surprisingly well. There are a few wonky stuff but its expected for a 20 year old game. Awsome game def worth a play!"
4653,Its half life. buy it.
4654,"Mark this one down as a ""you had to be there"" game because my experience has been mostly unpleasant. Half-Life consistently violates game design principles: bad platforming, unfair enemy placement, and occasionally, an unclear path of progression partially due to the low-detail objects and environments. Quick save and load is a necessary but band-aid solution to dealing with the level design of HL1.  Gunplay lacks the satisfaction of modern first person shooter titles and the setting loses its appeal after the first hour or so. The appeal of a fully 3D rendered DirectX 6-era game with lip-synced voice acting doesn't hold weight over 20 years later."
4655,good
4656,Classic of classics.

4659,Absolutely fantastic milestone of a game. Maybe skip the last few chapters. 9.5/10 total masterpiece
4660,A timeless masterpiece
4661,very good
4662,"One of the greatest FPS ever, holds up pretty darn good for a 1998 game. Wouldn't be surprised if this game is still talked about 25 years from now, it's just that good."
4663,"Fun game, old graphics, pioneer in early FPS genre, lots of weapons to kill things with. Me likey."
4664,"Good game, though definitely a bit dated in a number of ways. But if you're fine with older games, or are willing to be lenient, I think it's well worth playing, especially considering how cheap you can pick it up on sale."
4665,"Old school game. Not upto the 2021 standards but speed running this game is pretty fun with the bhop + speed cap removed.

Well, I thought I'd write something about one of the forefathers of computer games... Half-Life, the ""pioneer"" for all coming story shooters...

Well, Half-Life is like any other game. Either you like it or you hate it.

[b]One shouldn't forget that the game is from 1998 and is therefore one of the really old games.[/b] 

Due to the age, it is of course absolutely not comparable with current games, even if they are retro games. Whether they are created from scratch and with a retro look, or are simply technically polished, a Half-Life will always play differently than ""younger"" games.

I'm a total Half Life fan. It's no secret and I don't make any of it.
This is probably due to my age and the fact that I played the game for hours after it was released. I even have the packaging with CD-ROM somewhere (if anyone knows what that is).

[b]What makes Half-Life so great is that without it, many of the games we know and play today wouldn't even exist.. [/b]

The Half-Life engine was then an ""evolution"" of id Software's great Quake engine and Half-Life is still rated 96 / 100 by Metacritic to this day and even made it into the Guinness book as the best-selling first-person shooter.
Half-Life was [b]the first first-person shooter to have a story, scripted cutscenes, and an AI.[/b] 
If I remember correctly, the Gordon Freeman story was inspired by the Stephen King novel ‚ÄûThe Mist‚Äú, but I'm not entirely sure.

I know some who have tried to play the game and I can understand some saying ""great game, I just can't play it because I don't like the control / gameplay"".
If you're not used to it or don't know it, then it's an absolutely strange feeling, I'll admit that. 
I just recently played all the sequels again and it's really a weird feeling at times. You can say that, yes.

Half-Life and Gordon Freeman, for me, an absolute cult classic that you should definitely have played if you can.
I can warmly recommend [url= https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890]Black Mesa[/url] to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the Half-Life universe, but doesn't get along with it in the original way. 
Black Mesa is really fun, looks better and plays a little differently and is definitely worth checking out.

This version supports widescreen 1080p to 4K res while staying true to the original visuals. Works fine on any modern systems ""straight out the box'.

Definitely picking up Black Mesa after finishing this one."

4752,"Half Life is a great game. An amazing game. I would even go as far as saying that it belongs into videogame history and you should absolutely play it.

Half Life is a Game about 27 year old Gordon Freeman, who experiments with some crystal accidentally opens a portal to another dimension while doing so. This causes havoc because aliens start teleporting into the facillity and not only that - The U.S. government comes in to help by cleaning up this mess [i]and everyone that experienced it.[/i] Freeman has to fight his way through the facillity and completes countless of tasks to stop the chaos and manages to defeat a giant baby called [i]the Nihilanth.[/i]

Look mate, I never played Half Life before. The only game that I played that was kinda similar was probably Bioshock but I think I have to say that I adored Half Life so much that I'd say that Bioshock isn't as good as Half Life. As soon as I started it and as soon as I got into the suit and the music started playing I was super pumped up and addicted. It only gets better and better from this point on because you collect weapons, kill aliens and go through the different areas while totally feeling badass.

The Writing is basically very weird but I don't think it's a weakness. The player mostly has no idea why the fuck you are getting swarmed by aliens or why the fuck you have to launch a rocket and it really adds because that's how Freeman probably actually feels ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

The game keeps being cool and badass until you arrive at ""On a Rail"". That is my first tiny problem with the game. It throws to many enemies and you, it gives you too little health and expects you to keep up when you are getting shot at from four sides with 20hp. Look mate I normally like hard games. I'm in love with Dark Souls and I went into the choosing the ""normal"" difficulty thinking that it probably won't be that hard. I was so wrong. I died countless of times because of stupid stuff and there were times were I felt like I was doing a no hit run :I

On a Rail wasn't even that bad. It gets bad once you get out of Black Mesa and wander around the New Mexico deserts. It's stupidly difficult from that point on and don't get me started on fucking Interloper... I played the game normally until then but I couldn't fucking take it anymore. I used god mode to get to the final boss because I was basically trapped in a giant room with 4hp getting shot at from all sides.

Half Life is fun but I should have chosen easy mode for it to not be frustrating at all. Maybe I just suck but I don't think actually think that I'm bad at videogames. -1 for the absurd difficulty.

Also a small thing: I encountered some annoying bugs like on time where I was just stuck in a pipe so also -0,5 for that.

All in  all: Half Life is an amazing game with interesting areas, perfect combat and a huge difficulty spike. I love it.

8.5/10"
4753,it good
4754,Its said that he made it out with only his crowbar
4755,This game is a great representation of a storyline and first person action combined together although tough it is still a great game
4756,"[b]This game was, unironically, one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had.[/b] I've tried this several times, could never get into it that much. This game while it sure was phenomenal for its time, now it's just garbage, because nothing that was impressive at the time, still is. Most of the time spent is just wandering around not knowing where to go, or what to do either. I can't name a single thing that's good about Half-Life, best parts about it are average at best. It feels like a chore to play, and that's because it is.

[b]+[/b] Gameplay - mostly due to the engine, but enemies are well done, and aside from that, movement is kinda fun, gunplay is just average.
[b]-[/b] Weapons - while it does have variety of weapons to choose from, they're extremely imbalanced, you're only gonna play with 2 or 3 of them, since most of them are trash, and some of them are broken.
[b]-[/b] Story - would be average at best, but it's worse than that because of how much stretched this game is, 90% of the time nothing's going on.
[b]-[/b] Level Design - absolutely horrible, you can almost never know where to go or what to do, hardly anything makes any sense, it's mostly very confusing.
[b]-[/b] Bugs - it's not that big of a deal, but there are bugs than can be really annoying, some of them can even block your progress.

Overall Score: [b]2/10 (Very Bad)[/b]"
4757,8/10
4758,Very fun... Its a classic
4759,"It is still a good game. However, it is quite antiquated in many aspects. This ranges from constantly not knowing where to go next or what to do, cheap one-shot deaths, random difficulty spikes, finding your self stuck not having enough health or ammo, glitches, and just general jankiness as a whole. I had to reload a save several times. On a similar note, I had to look up a guide to know where to go several times as well. It's not a masterpiece anymore by today's standards, but it is still fun and probably worth playing for ~$5 or so."

4780,very cool game!!
4781,This game has one of the best stories in video game history. Change my mind.
4782,"Half-Life is a video game that every gamer should play at one point. It has a perfect mix of gameplay, storytelling and fun. You can beat it in around 4-8ish hours. 

If you enjoy the game you can also play Opposing Force, Blue Shift, and Half-Life's sequel Half-Life 2 and its sequels (Half-Life 2 Episode One and Two). There is also a ton of mods you can play for free so its a no brainer to get this game if you haven't already. Just, don't play Half-Life: Source."

4786,"Amazing game worthy of all the praise. Sure the graphics are primitive now, but they remain charming. I tend to play through this every couple of years or so and have a blast each time that I do."
4787,dis gem gud. : )
4788,"Unironically, one of the best videogames in history, and one of the most famous and classic ones.
The game is entertaining and has a smooth gameplay."
4789,Good 64
4790,"Good fun, glad to have finally played and finished this one after having it in my library for so long. Had some trouble on normal difficulty, but nothing too extreme. Didn't take long too complete."
4791,THE BEST FUN GAME OF ALL TIME 100/10
4792,"Walks into Black mesa.
Opens up a portal to an alien dimension. 
Commits several war crimes on humans and aliens.
Refuses to elaborate.
Gets hired by a business man.
Leaves."
4793,"One of the best shooters ever. Fantastic levels, for the most part. GoldSrc is such a fun engine for shooters, so the gameplay is excellent. There were only two levels in this game that I disliked, those being Surface Tension and Interloper. The rest is amazing and feels like a game made long after the year that it released.

Score: 7.5/10"

4800,"Basically quake 2 and red faction 1‚Äôs child, except the child came before red faction. This game is amazing. Great weapons, great levels, great enemies. 10/10"
4801,best game of all time candidate
4802,If you like retro stuff or fast paced shooters this is the game for you.
4803,good game gamers
4804,1999 was cool
4805,I love this game so much
4806,i have beaten this game 5 or 6 times
4807,good game. 10/10 Would play again.
4808,"An often janky, irritating and dated game, feels like a prelude to HL2, with annyoingly tanky enemies, weapons that (bar the revolver) feel like super soakers, and an overall sense of not knowing where to go or why to go there. Play HL2 instead, it is infinitely better.

3/10"
4809,good game but very hard
4810,Game's really good but the last boss is just horrible
4811,ok
4812,"I have killed dozens of innocent people, but in the sequel the NPCs say that I saved as many people as I could've.

would recommend"
4813,"Half-Life is an action-adventure first-person shooter set in the bowels of a mountain in the US state of New Mexico. It is there, according to the plot, that the federal research center of gigantic proportions, bearing the name ""Black Mesa"", is located, and it is there that a number of top-secret studies are carried out. The main character of the game is a young talented researcher Gordon Freeman, who works in the laboratory of anomalous materials.

An average-cleared scientist is unaware of the dangers of the work ahead. One morning, Gordon is sent to the test chamber for routine crystal analysis. The consequences of the experiment, however, are disastrous. The explosion of the crystal breaks a gap between the dimensions, from where alien forces begin to attack the Earth. Gordon, caught between the aliens and the US Army, seeks to get out of the complex before he is found and destroyed."
4814,"couldn't take the drink I got from the vending machine at the beginning of the game, very sad."
4815,Play NOW!
4816,can be scary at times. well within acceptable range.
4817,this is great
4818,Yo this game is so kino until the Marines show up and it becomes fucking terrible lmao.

4825,"GREETINGS

The best classic. Everyone need to play this game. The plot, the music, the locations, the physics still good for our days. Of course, old graphics, but it's classic (classic lives forever). If you don't like this game, try Black mesa. It's the same, but more modern and a bit better)"
4826,d
4827,half life has to be one of the best singleplayer story games out there. even though its from 1998 its still a really fun play and i def recommend to anyone looking to have some fun

4832,"I never enjoyed this game and I honestly struggle to truly understand why. It left such a mediocre taste in my mouth that it took me 8 years to get around to the rest of the franchise - Which I now love. It's for this reason that I wouldn't recommend this to new players, yet I strongly enjoyed Black Mesa (a modernised remake). I would recommend buying that instead as it does what the rest of the franchise does well and adds a bit more of an atmosphere. I can't write too deep a review as it's been 8 years since I played it, but having remembered parts through Black Mesa I would say that conceptually it was fantastic and anyone looking for an old school shooter without any modern visuals should go ahead and buy this over Black Mesa. Honestly a true technical marvel of it's time, but it just didn't resonate with me in any way."
4833,This game is the  best thing that I saw in my life.
4834,its a good game
4835,"Just finished this game and it took me way longer than i expected, partially because i finished portal in a couple of hours and expected the same of half life. 

I think its a fun game, graphics, bugs, weird movement, dialogue volume too low compared to environment noise in certain sections i can excuse to it being an old game/ being an fps. 

I haven't played an fps before and maybe that's why i struggled with this game a bit but on several occasions i had to load last save a ton of times in order to get a section done or clear enemies with enough health/ammo (this holds true especially for the later sections). 

Some parts took way too long but that was sometimes because of me missing an interactive button or lever. Or not knowing that there was passage through that particular area but that's okay. That's what exploration is about.

The later sections were really hard for me and I had to look up a walkthrough for the final three sections due to not being able to figure out that i could destroy crystals/struggling with a fight/again not know that there was a passage in a particular place.

The story was a bit hazy for me since we travelled a lot and things were very diverse from what we originally started with.

Overall i don't know I give this game a positive or a negative but I think its worth trying out anyway. Gunning down enemies is always fun."
4836,"It's Half Life. Don't need to say much more but as someone who had never played the game until a couple of days ago I couldn't really explain why Half Life is so special. There are a million of videos out there that do capture that feeling but honestly buy Half Life and try it. It's an experience. One of Gaming Histories Milestones and earns every bit of that reputation.

But honestly F that helicopter in Surface Tension"
4837,nice
4838,nice
4839,not bad
4840,i was wrong

4842,"I decided to play this after 20 years and holy ****, the game industry surely regressed. It still proves why it is a classic and a pioneer of a certain genre. I can praise a lot of things, map designs, the story etc. It is challenging, like other games of its era, which is really fun for me because I really don't enjoy the games being made too easy to appeal to everyone. Some of the stuff are really basic but the way I could interact with the environment sometimes made me think ""wait, was this possible 24 years ago? then why I can interact less in modern games"".

If you played it years ago, give it a shot, you'll like it even more and appreciate it a lot."
4843,life half

4845,"Yummy game. Actually caused a strange liquid to seep into my Lego Batman undies. Luckily, mommy was there to clean it up! :)"

How do you not have this game

Stop looking at reviews and get it... unless you can't afford it..."
4855,you know why
4856,Very good story! I love this game! For anyone who hasn't played it even after 24 years (1998) I really recommend it.
4857,A must need.
4858,"Growing up I always heard about Half-Life but I never got to dive in to the series as I was always a console player as a kid. 

Now that I have a gaming PC, 20+ years after this game released, I finally played through it.

Had a really good time. The game still holds up and getting to experience the series that influenced so many games to come was really cool.

I am officially a fan. Now onto the expansions and then Half-Life 2."

4860,"Half-Life, I‚Äôm my opinion and I‚Äôm sure in many others opinions half life is one of the most important games ever. Up until the release of half life in 1998 by valve corp and published by seria studios, games were just spawn and shoot; not really any story. Half life added an entire story with a fun multiplayer that you could play for hours. The story has an amazing storyline and very fun puzzles. With new enemies to encounter at ever corner, to zombies taken over by head crabs turned into a human host, to hazardous environment soldiers and the black ops unit! This game is not just amazing but extremely important, 11/10. Extremely recommended, worth its price if not more!!"
4861,"One of the games from the past that holds up EXTREMELY well today. The gameplay is pretty good, though sometimes can be...don't play on hard mode basically.
Graphics are fine, temper your expectations, it's literally from another century, but the way they are made, set up an atmospheric style that is really effective at some points.


For a cons section, the default fov is pretty garbage, I'd recommend bumping it up by like an extra 20 (""default_fov 90"" is the command to change it). Also, at certain points I started getting...nauseous? If you start playing for extended periods and start getting a headache, GET OFF! At least for like an hour or two because that nauseous feeling is pretty bad, I've never had that happen with a game before. Lastly, there are some glitches, geometry being number one, but they're few and far between, just make sure to save often as the autosaves in this game are pretty hit or miss.

All in all, a worthy purchase if you're going in with the right mindset, I personally bought the Valve-whatever-the-fuck-bundle, and I'm getting a pretty good mileage out of it."
4862,"What an amazing, yet frustrating experience!"
4863,Don't buy the source version. Otherwise its quite simple really released in 1998 and still top notch today.
4864,"Buen juego solo que XEN me parecio muy corto y tremendos bugs que me comi y no me dejaron continuar el juego, casi tuve que reiniciar varias veces."
4865,greatest game ever
4866,"good
"
4867,"It's extremely controversial, but I truly despise this game. The platforming is awful and your character is on ice, the sound design is at first charming and quickly becomes jarring. Especially when you are in the metal tube with the tentacle monster. The encounter design is really good, and I had fun in some parts, but it cannot compensate all the little things that make this game so annoying.  The number of times I got stuck in a wall or an object cannot even be counted with my hands. Sometimes it's just snipers that I couldn't kill and others, it was the level design totally confusing me and the countless time I just didn't know where to F***ing go!

I want to like this game, and I do like most of the fight encounters, but it's not enough, I hate it so much... Sorry

4883,"Playing Half Life was perhaps the worst and most grueling gaming experience of my life. 3 hours felt like 30. Every single encounter is, simply put, insufferable. Health drops are scarce, enemies are not and will shred you. The very act of MOVING is appalling and is as if you are on ice at all times. Playing this game can best be described as a chore. Overall game design is terrible and there are numerous points where the game sets you up for failure and I had apparently only just barely made it halfway through. how people enjoy or enjoyed this game is beyond me."

4895,A true timeless classic. This game offers the right kind of difficulty without going overboard. The ability to save multiple times no matter the difficulty is also a plus. The assortment of weapons from handguns to alien tech make no two gameplays exactly the same. This game is really worth the few bucks.

4899,This amazing shooter still has plenty of life left in it.
4900,good game
4901,"Amazing game, love the movement and story"
4902,Das Game is Game so Game is GAme so play game thus great game!
4903,I think the G-Man speech hit my G-Spot.
4904,video game yes
4905,"I killed everyone who tried to help me and it never went wrong. Ever.
10/10"
4906,do you know who ate all the donuts?
4907,"play the video game
"
4908,"epic :)))))
"
4909,"What can I say, it is the game that revolutionised the whole RPG and First person shooter gaming."
4910,Classic.
4911,This is a certified hood classic.
4912,One of the best FPS ever.
4913,Prepare for unforeseen consequences...
4914,Better than the second game.
4915,"This is an older game, so you got to be ready for lower graphics. All the reviews I read online were true and I would give it a 8/10 for the story arc and would definitely recommend it as long as you look past the graphics. It has a nostalgic feel if you played any older games, like for me, it brought me back to my halo 1 days in a different game that was just as good. One thing, the little aliens jump scared me a little too much, so watch out and may they all die."
4916,"One of the best story telling games, if not the best.
"
4917,very nice
4918,"an oldy but a goodie! its not... great i'll admit, a tad frustrating, even, just moving around is a slippery endeavor. (no joke it plays like the floors are covered in soap) BUT its a classic and it's on sale super frequently for real cheap so if you can you might as well! :D"
4919,Really ended up enjoying this a lot. Except Chapter 17. Otherwise worth the hype.
4920,"I thought this game was shorter, glad I am wrong."
4921,I loved it but I hate that Gordon decided to wear his non-traction shoes to work. I slipped off so many platforms that it felt like I was playing an ice level. Still a great game
4922,It's good
4923,
4924,help
4925,Gorbin freedmun is my favorite charactur
4926,good game
4927,Please buy it.
4928,funny headcrab exploded and died
4929,frustrating to play. the game does jam so save frequently.  The last level was just a painful exercise to get through. Graphics are very dated.
4930,old is cool
4931,fuck this game
4932,Funny crowbar man go brrrr
4933,its cool ig but its a worse version of cod basically but it came out in 1980s so i can give it credit
4934,"It has aged, if you're fine with that you'll have fun"
4935,I cut my teeth on this game when it was new. It has aged like a fine wine.
4936,lol
4937,fuck this game
4938,Lol gud
4939,"good game, good moments, and good level design, and that's all you need for a good game 100/10 perfection"

4941,"very nice, big rocket, 10/10"
4942,it good
4943,"""So who is this guy, Freeman?
They say he was at ground zero.
Science team? You think he was responsible? Sabotage, maybe?
Yeah, maybe. All I know for sure is he's been killing my buddies.
Oh yeah, he'll pay. He will definitely pay.""

That, is some great world building. 10/10, Valve classic."
4944,A 20+ year old game that still out-does many titles today.
4945,Nokia status
4946,"A good game that has a lot of bad parts. Its aged like an old car, lacking many newer features and overall being harder to drive but still fun to drive."
4947,"what can I say I've been playing half-life since I was about ten or twelve.  Replayed prob over 20 to 30 times in that time. 
This is by far my favorite game of all time. I am a half-life fanatic, I just hope valve will actually make half-life three. I want to get a valve index so i can play half- life alyx PLEASE VALVE HALF-LIFE THREE!!!!!!!!!!"
4948,see the joke is you're constantly at half life cause grenades have a bigger blast radius than your mom

4954,Yey!

I'm composing this the second I completed the game. I got it on Christmas, and I completed it seven days after the fact after work. It was anything but a dreary game by any means. I'm truly astounded that 7 hours of interactivity felt like it was significantly longer. I guess this is a direct result of the way that it was a totally different encounter for me, and I would accept that the another playthrough will feel fast.

I'm in wonder. I'm past dazzled with Half-Life. For a game that delivered in 1999, for a game that is more established than me, for a game that was plainly the best unrest in FPS games since Destruction and Tremor, I'm totally flabbergasted by the experience."
4958,Timeless clasic ! A mastercraft for anyone who wants to experience a game like this !
4959,"  It's Half Life, what more do I have to say? An absolute classic that you will definitely enjoy."
4960,This game is probaly one of the best old games I played during 2021 going into 2022. The one thing that is annoying is where you dude acts like he is one ice all the time.
4961,I like everything about this game
4962,AVOID INTERLOPER AND ON A RAIL AT ALL COSTS
4963,Masterpiece
4964,"although i have died a lot during my playthrough on easy (my name should explain why) its fun, have'int had this much fun playing a game while repeatedly dying"
4965,One of the best games of all time.
4966,"gotdam freman
iz l33t"
4967,"it was f*cking amazing!!! I played this game first time in 2022, and I'm under deep  impression, like I was there and G-man lied TO ME!!! I'm steel feel like I'm in game"
4968,√ÜUH
4969,Half-Life is good. (really good)
4970,One of the best games I have ever played. It can get difficult at times but 100% worth it
4971,A great game
4972, CX
4973,Brings back childhood memories.
4974,im sorry gordon... this aint it
4975,its cool
4976,DONUT
4977,in what world do you go to the reviews for half-life to determine if you should buy the game
4978,oh my god
4979,it is a great game that doesn't require a beefy CPU
4980,Its not only a classic - its a must play or else
4981,stop reading reviews. buy NOW!
4982,"Still getting used to mouse and keyboard, but good game. I think you should give it a try."
4983,is is good would get killed by a head crab again 11/10
4984," Really good game, I love it."
4985,corn and regulatoins
4986,"Fun, fast paced action shooter with science stuff"
4987,"This game has very cool and super realistic graphics. 
I like gamlololololo"
4988,I was trying to save luigi but i saw a scary monster and got scared!!!
4989,"EDIT: I just realized I played on easy, I thought I was playing on medium. I'll probably play it again soon after I finish Half Life 2.

EDIT 2: Beat it again, more fun than my first playthrough!

Valve's first game is a monumental achievement in the gaming industry. It's certainly old and not the most balanced game ever, but if you are interested I would get it. Just don't play the Source Port, Half Life: Source."
4990,hard as fuck but good backstory for half life 2
4991,Gordan doesn't need to hear all these reviews he's a highly trained professional
4992,its good just dont put on software mode or the game breaks
4993,"really a classic, simple graphics, and great gameplay changes."
4994,hE-hE
4995,game of the year 1998

5022,"You shoot and, very good and game d. moster"
5023,murdering innocent scientists is my pass time
5024,"While it's been over a decade since I played a first-person shooter with a mouse and keyboard, I can safely state that despite my admittedly bumpy re-entry, Half-Life remains a vibrant and engaging PC experience and a seminal work of the medium."
5025,"finished on hard difficulty.

last level i was quick saving after each kill.

fk me..."
5026,"it's like if you took half life 2 and made it into half life 1, good game"
5027,"In many aspects, this has aged quite well, and gave birth to three of the greatest games of all time. In others, I really can't recommend it, given how much of a slog several of the chapters are (especially the last 4). Just play Half-Life 2 and Black Mesa."
5028,yes
5029,Good soup
5030,Classic
5031,"Can't believe I waited this long to try out this series and can see why it is considered a classic. Graphics may be dated but gameplay, exploration, and lively npcs makes up for it. Crowbar/10!"
5032,I bought this game back in 2014 when I was about 11 years old. Seven years later at age 18 I finally sat down and played this game. This game was special. Really freaking special...
5033,"Muy bueno, hay cosas que no envejecieron bien pero sigue siendo perfecto"
5034,"One of the best games I have ever played it is practically a MUST play game. You should consider playing the whole Half-Life franchise before, you grow up.

 As you're playing you'll realize how open and wide the environment is while still having a clear idea or path of what you should do (in the game) without indicators like a mini-map with indicators or anything like that, It is fairly straightforward and simple what you should do and where you should go, etc etc, As well as the more you immerse yourself basically all the early VALVE games the more you realize literally so many other game industries have ""copied"" (got inspired by valve games) half-life 1 - 4 has the same vibe as games we have now but they feel original the feel raw and basic yet so empowering 

-Portal 1,2
-half-life 1
-half-life blue shift          (we don't mention the green one) [we don't talk about that]
-half-life 2 and other episodes 
-Left 4 dead 1,2
-Counter strike franchise 
-Gary's mod
-TF2


These games all hit hard and have so much orgasmic wholesomeness to them, They all possess mostly the same vibe in gaming although each game has its special feeling, Portal being Eire and lonely making you strive on completing objectives with music and sounds that fit your situation with amazing writing and storytelling with a deep thought of lore, half-life being completely original and deep lore that ties with portal making it way more diverse and incorporating rich gameplay and Puzzleish combat. They were one of the first games to introduce 3D zombie combat (mutant creatures) and a set goal (don't wanna spoil), And finally counter strike arguably the most famous shooter game there is, It has basically inspired counter-strike, valorant, and other games it was one of the first shooter games and a game that managed to incorporate strategy in-game vs other players it was originally a half-life 2 mod just like Garry's mod WHICH IS THE BEST SANDBOX GAME THERE IS gmod holds many precious memories of mine and I've had countless funny nights playing gmod with friends and having fun all around as well as having a wholesome community gmod is the best sandbox game period. Moving on to team fortress 1,2 Those games basically inspired Overwatch and valorant in terms of many features and genres as well as mechanics as you can see VALVE keeps coming up in every genre there is and having a big spot in each genre even serving as foundations in some genres like sandboxes and single-player storytelling.

VALVE is great and their games are getting they never get old people have adored them for ages and sadly those days are coming to an end with the valve being relatively quiet and not living up to expectations on recent game ""innovations'. So I urge you to play and experience all the VALVE games, all of them. GIVE THEM A CHANCE.
thank u all

I don't get why people like this game? Because of the combat? that is what my friend said, but in my opinion the combat was also shit.

Really the only points i enjoyed in this game were the beginning and the end."
5038,headcrabs are very important
5039,It's Half-Life. Play it.

5043,"pretty good game. liked using my mind.
didn't like anything (besides the ending) past chapter eleven.
the illusion of free choice this game provides is amazing"
5044,"This game is just awesome. It really is timeless. Honesty after fighting myself and struggling with Black Mesa's unreasonable difficulty, I developed a very strong appreciation for the original Half Life, even though prior to doing so I had a salty taste in my mouth from the poor graphics in virtual reality, temporary lapse in judgement. After going through Half life 2,and beating Half Life Alyx twice, I went back to the original to notice it really isnt that much of a difference in graphics, plus you get sooo immersed in lore of Black Mesa and the story that you hardly even think about it, and in fact its a very well made game and it looks fantastic."
5045,The game's story is good but I had to watch alot of tutorials to actually find what to do. I would recommend  Half Life 2 though since its better.
5046,This game will still be fun no matter how much time passes
5047,mans named gorden gets to kill creatures and army while walking around a building that is breaking 8/10 only because i suck at easy and the npcs are annoying but fun yea lmao

But, after it went on sale this year, I figured it's not very risky, and wow.
This game is brilliantly designed, a perfect balance between horror and making the player feel like a badass.

5063,brings back lots of memories

There are a million of videos out there that do capture that feeling but honestly buy Half Life and try it. It's an experience. One of Gaming Histories Milestones and earns every bit of that reputation.

But honestly F that helicopter in Surface Tension"
5087,"a classic goldsrc game, would recommend this game to play it without the hd pack."
5088,this game is timeless and amazing every time

(Gordon) WHAT!

"
5090,good but kinda cringe sometimes
5091,"good game
"
5092,Now I understand why this game is regarded as literally one of the best games ever made.
5093,"Just finished the game, definitely would recommend to play for others and it is one of the classics. The only downsides were that the controls were a bit janky, the speed along with the collision physics of the player sometimes was weird when going over platforming obstacles, but I guess it's because I have played many more newer games and wasn't familiar with the older game movement, I would just recommend to save the game multiple times thorughout the platforming puzzles if you want to make it easier. All in all, great game, gonna go play the dlc and move on to Half Life 2."
5094,"this game is really good,but i havent recived my beer yet...WHERES MY BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER"
5095,A GREAT THROWBACK.

5098,"I was curious about the franchise for a while, so I decided to play the first game, honestly, this is a really good game. Ima finish this and try the next games"
5099,"is good
"
5100,"Here's the thing: if you're interested in the Half-Life series, this isn't the place you HAVE to start. Honestly, starting with the next installment, Half-Life 2, it does a decent job basically creating an entirely different storyline. If you're a big fan of getting ALL of the in-jokes and references, then yes, plot-wise you could start here for sure.

It's fairly short, about a ten hour romp. It's the oldest game I've every actually played and finished, and I have to admit I think they were still in the midst of figuring out how to scale difficulty back in 1998 (you can save anywhere so it's not a big deal, but there were plenty of times I'd be reloading a save like a hundred darn times).

Overall it's a very fun shooter with lots of atmosphere and action and comedy and everything you can ask for. You can see how this short little escape from a strange scientific facility became the starting point for one of the biggest names in gaming.

HELLO GORDON haahhahahahahahah funy GORDON haehehehehe"
5101,my childhood game ;)
5102,It starts with
5103,it maybe an old game but its fun
5104,the best fps ever made

5106,It's a monumental classic and needs to be respected.
5107,"good game lol
sadly bad textures but idc its good still
"
5108,"If you don't have this game in your library, you are not a true gamer"
5109,Buying Half-Life means that you are a cultured person. SO go ahead...Buy it...
5110,the gameplay has aged well. unfortunately the graphics have aged as well as the food that's been banished to the back of your fridge

5122,good game but black ops people are scary

5128,"this game is sick, when's full life coming out?"
5129,Epok game for epok gamers
5130,"Great game! It's a great fps that defined the new way of storytelling. Has a lot of cool guns and enemies and plot and generally there's just a lot of great stuff. However it's also an old game. Graphics aren't THAT bad but still, they're from 1998. You can also find some bugs here and there, for example I got stuck in the vent corner a lot of times. And of course, the Xen dimension. Damn it's bad. Jumping, jumping, jumping and then you die because you couldn't reach the next platform when long-jumping. Xen has a potential to look good - just look at Black Mesa screens - and in Half-Life it doesn't. Don't get me wrong, Half-Life still is awesome - until you go to Xen. The final boss is good. I enjoyed it. However I still have this feeling that Black Mesa did everything just better even though I haven't play it yet while writing this review so I'm just depending on reviews and screens I've seen in the internet. I will play Black Mesa and then I will update if in my opinion it's worth to play Half-Life or skip it and go straight to Black Mesa. For now, still depending only on the internet reviews and screens from Black Mesa, I'd say that you can skip Half-Life and play Black Mesa instead unless you are big fan of Half-Life series, 'cause for example you played HL2 and episodes at first- then I think you should know the original."
5131,This is what happens when you bring some weird crystals to work
5132,"Who knew running 30 minutes late could have these consequences?

This game taught me to never be late at my job. 10/10"
5133,--INSERT SCIENTIST VOICE LINE HERE--
5134,Everything about this game is great.
5135,Source games are special.
5136,Very cool
5137,"I was drawn to Half-Life by its place in the history of video games, and its reputation as one of the greatest games of all time. Though it was certainly important for its time, I would not strongly recommend it for anyone looking for an extremely engaging experience, especially if they are more interested in story than (undoubtably good) gameplay. The atmosphere and plot are exciting at the beginning, but the game progressed at a very slow pace, and lost its wonderful creepiness after a while. By the final scenes, I was expecting to be rewarded for many long hours I had put into Freeman's battle, but I never found the epic climax I was hoping for. I must admit that due to some 'technical issues' I was not able to reach the very end of the game, so I will be charitable and say I probably missed something. In the final analysis, I think this game is a bit overrated, though I am sure there will be many who disagree with me."
5138,"This is a great game. I have seen some people leaving negative reviews because ""the game is to hard!"" and  ""The graphics are HORRIBLE!"" and to that i have to say: get a grip, the games from 1998, of course the graphics aren't the best, and if its to hard for you, git gud."
5139,"Half Life has pretty amazing graphics for a 1998 game, its really fun. trust me buy it."

5147,"half life is a great game lot of fun but I'm a little sad with the game crashing a couple times and couple bugs
bugs here and there but still enjoying it quite a bit highly recommend to play it. 8/10 for me"
5148,overrated. still good for its time.
5149,"About that beer I owed you.

5152,good game it scratch me brain real good
5153,It all started with this game.
5154,"A classic in PC gaming. Fun game, well written dialogue and pretty good voice acting for it's time. And it has a really good story to it. I do recommend Half-Life."
5155,I LOVE THIS GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME
5156,A must play game for any PC gamer not much more I can add that many people haven't already
5157,game good
5158,epic
5159,kind of old and boring but good
5160,I realized that I discovered this fun too late.
5161,legendary status well deserved.
5162,"if Doom is the grandpa of the FPS genre, Half-Life is the Father. Half-Life bridges the gap between old school shooters like Doom and Wolfenstein with modern shooters like Halo and that other one that refuses to die. 

For it's considerable age Half-Life has aged tremendously well, it's fun, frantic and engaging, the game definitely dips in quality by the final act, starting at Xen, which even Valve acknowledges, personally I'd recommend just throwing away your dignity and putting godmode on so you can blaze through it and get to the ending, it's not the most respectable way, but it's better than putting up with the atrocious design of Xen. Everywhere else however is amazing, the game has its moments of difficulty that reaches a little too high in my opinion, Surface Tension and On A Rail jump to my mind, but generally the game is very fair, unforgiving absolutely, but fair. 

Gordon Freeman is a mute nerd with a shotgun, but I like him more than somebody like Doomguy because Gordon is a nerd, he's no soldier, he's just a man trying his best to survive with what little he has so he can go home and watch Gundam Wing probably. The game has you slowly become the super soldier, and personally I find that a helluva lot more engaging than starting the game a badass. 

Half-Life is fantastic, it's aged fantastically and the majority of the game is fun, don't forget to pay your respects to the daddy of the fps genre... no wait now that I say it like that it doesn't sound very good at all does it?"
5163,Masterpiece.
5164,"this game put me through hell and god I hate it

Anyway its a pretty good game would have mental breakdown over again"
5165,bullsquid
5166,"orange man good 
black mesa bad"
5167,yes
5168,Fun
5169," I did not play it when it came out so I decided to give it a try. I understand why it had all that hype. 
Cons:
Graphics are not great but good for when it came out and still playable today.  
Mechanics are not smooth at all. Jumping is a mess. 
Monsters have a bad AI and I would have liked the monsters to be a bit more interesting in what they do. 


Pros:
  The pacing is great.  You are not bored at any time in the game. 
   Good gun variety. 
   Monsters are diverse and the end boss fight is good. 
   Does not have a story per say but rather a very interesting setting.  
   Maps are interesting and different in terms of settings and mechanics.  
   No hand holding, the game assumes you are not a complete idiot and does not feel like it has to spell everything out to you, something that I hate about modern games. 

 Overall it looks like the developers thought of a lot of ways to keep the game engaging while working with the engine limitation. You can tell that the developers have put a lot of thought and work in to the game/ map design. 
   Now you have games that have little substance but impressive graphics.

5181,"I just finished the game and wow, was that something. It is no wonder why this game is held in such high regard. This has to be one of, if not THE best games I've ever played.

PROS:
-Great Story
-Great Atmosphere
-Good Soundtrack
-Decent Length
-Fun Gameplay
-Lower Price than it's worth

CONS:
-90s Graphics (I don't even want to put that there as it's the best they could do at the time and doesn't affect the games quality at all. I just had to put something in the con section)"
5182,"Half-Life is one of those games which I think everyone should play through at least once. It laid a lot of groundwork for future games to build upon. The gameplay still holds up to this day and the atmosphere is great as well. You can obviously see the age, but in my opinion that only makes it better.

It has this peculiar Valve charm that can't be replicated."
5183,"navigating trough this game is like navigating trough my ass and if you fall 5cm your legs shatter and your muscles collapse, fuck you"

5186,pretty good. i dont really get the story but the gunplay was quite fun.
5187,"Barney, put the coffee on
'Cause I'm late for work again
Another day at the office
Wonder what kinda perks I get
I am an MIT alumni, ever heard of it?
Sure you did - I got a PhD, but now I'm earnin' it
Buildin' up my resume at Black Mesa
Employee of the Month, they should have a plaque with my name up
I'll hang up my lab jacket, grab a new hazard suit
Just in case a resonance cascade should happen soon
Who ever thought a book-smart geek could go so hard?
Even acquired a minor degree - in crowbars
No joke, Gordon got more balls than a gonarch
Headcrabs wanna grab my dome 'cause I'm so smart
I'm not one for talkin', but I got an arsenal
Forget my doctorate when a gun makes any problem solvable
I am anomalous like a subatomic quantum particle
The odds of starting an apocalypse went from none to probable
I'm pickin' up steam and runnin' amok
Cleanin' out the marines who think that they'll cover this up
I'll paint the walls with their brains, call that a Black Mesa layoff
When you enter this facility, you know who's laid law
Don't call me crazy, I got plenty of Xen
I'll annihilate any Nihilanth who's letting 'em in
If I clock any overtime, I ain't doin' it for free, man
At least give me some praise, okay? Gee, man!
What makes your life worth livin'?
Who's makin' your decisions?
Strung up by puppet strings
But no one else can see them
When this dimension crashes
Wake up and smell the ashes
Trapped in a half-life
With a dream to be a free man
I need another coffee, have I been sleepin' on the job?
Doesn't matter this time, I arrived right on the dot
Dr. Breen, what have you done to City 17?
Call up a janitor, 'cause we got another mess to clean
It only took the alien invasion all of seven hours
To enslave us and then make an overcompensating tower
Now I need a team of physicists to see this resistance through
'Cause so far, I've been solo - Is Alyx single too?
This D0g's bite is bigger than his bark, I've
Upgraded from Mark IV to Mark V
Charge up, now we'll divide and conquer the Combine
Buckle up, buggers, because you're in for a long ride
Comes another unstoppable force, the source of which is Gordon
I govern gravity, I'll send you soarin' into orbit
Back at Black Mesa, I slaughtered a Vortigaunt herd
But now I work with 'em - Sorry, this is awkward
No bars will hold us, Nova Prospekt
My crowbar is blood-soaked, you got wrecked
Made it through Ravenholm, somehow I kept my head
What's the story with Father Grigori? Left for dead
Theoretically speaking, I'm a benevolent being
But in relativity, intent has no meaning
Hands up when you see the lambda, doesn't matter what your race is
I'm Freeman, G-Man, I'll never stay in stasis
What makes your life worth livin'?
Who's makin' your decisions?
Strung up by puppet strings
But no one else can see them
When this dimension crashes
Wake up and smell the ashes
Trapped in a half-life
With a dream to be a free man
I won't let any dimensional freak overwork me
Time to spill his cryptic secrets now in verse three...

5191,Good Game but painful at some points to find what to do.
5192,Everything about this game besides combat holds up quite well. Hard mode just seems too hard for me though.
5193,"goofy game

I think that now that I've played both Black Mesa and this game that I can honestly say that Black Mesa is a better experience."

5208,"Really fun game, i love the story and the environments (being in underground science corridors and outside in desert ruins). The combat is alot of fun, especially when you run into soldiers and aliens at the same time, oh boy. The movement at first is kinda weird to get used to, I often feel like my feet are sliding on butter, The music in this game is also really wicked and adds atmosphere to the world. My only complaint are the rare but still seen glitches, like i've been stuck in doors or elevators before, and thats sometimes killed me, either from an enemey or taking damage in the object. Otherwise this game is pretty dope."
5209,I love this game so far
5210,"Textbook definition of a masterpiece.
For being a little bit on the older side, it has fantastic features, cool mechanics, unique and balanced enemies, a nice game world, medium controls and is overall a good singleplayer fps"
5211,herf lerf
5212,"Great story with lots of in-game lore
Satisfying gunplay with a large arsenal of unique weapons
Enemies are more than just bullet sponges
Environments are interesting and tightly designed
Music, when it kicks in, is great and ambient sounds don't get tiring even after an entire playthrough

The only problem I have is that the collision is buggy sometimes

There is no excuse not to play this game, it's dirt-cheap during Steam sales and can run on a potato from the last 10 years"
5213,Very good
5214,I completed this game and all expansions on medium difficulty and I think this is a boring game with bad story. The only thing that was somewhat enjoyable is the movement system but everything else sucks. Most overrated game of all time.
5215,MY GOD! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

5239,"This game has been considered a classic time and time again, so let me tell you whether the game is worth it. It was a somewhat interesting game and I have yet to complete it to show my true approval, but I believe this game is worth it. Fun game to play, not the best, but definitely something to enjoy in-between the real games out there."
5240,i am on the rail
5241,"A good ol' classic.
I've usually stuck to Portal and such, but I've recently started playing the Half Life series to see if they're just as good as I've been told.
And let me tell you: They're absolutely correct.
This game has aged perfectly to me. Sure, the graphics are super 90's 3D, but I love it anyways.
Although stuck in a single facility, the diverse locations that make up Black Mesa make this thing just as expansive as it's sequel.
11/10.

5247,fuck yes
5248,it is fun.
5249,"Here you will see why I love Half-Life, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.

I love Half-Life I love the story behind Gordon Freeman and the G Man appearing in certain places at certain times throughout the singleplayer campaign levels.

I love the take on aliens having headcrabs that attach themselves to humans and take control of their bodies nerve system to make them move and be ""zombies"" it is a refreshing take on zombies, without actually being zombies in what we have come to know as zombies since George A. Romero's zombie takes in movies from the 1960's.

Now I remember back in 2005 when I first played Half-Life it had DirectX 8 support and now with VALVe pushing Linux support and removing DirectX 8 from the Gold Source engine video games adding OpenGL support to the Gold Source engine video games I keep getting OpenGL errors every now and then and some freezing issues, which I do not remember ever happening with DirectX 8.

Here is a screenshot of one of the few OpenGL errors I experience here and there. Followed by freezing of the video games that use OpenGL, before crashing.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/887417416764768257/926930307003850792/OpenGL_errors_on_video_games_that_use_OpenGL_on_Windows.png

There is also some water texture seams that seem to be see through in the Residue Processing campaign level.

VALVe please add DirectX 8 support or at least a more up to date version of DirectX 9 support which supports 64-bit, which is DirectX 9.0C I believe?

Otherwise I cannot give Half-Life a positive review due to these technical issues, which I cannot seem to fix even if I reinstall Windows or Half-Life.

Also VALVe please release Half-Life, with Half-Life: Source, and Half-Life: Deathmatch Source for sale on gog.com. You have said with the Source 2 engine that video game developers developing video games on the Source 2 engine can release the video games that they develop for sale outside of Steam, without needing Steam as long as the video games are also released for sale on Steam."

5255,"Half-Life is honestly a really good game. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have proper controller support, though that seems to be changing soon for the Steam Deck. Just make sure that you turn off the HD graphics, they look strange to say the least."

5270,its cool i guess
5271,cool
5272,"I am writing this the moment I finished the game. I bought it on Christmas, and I finished it a week later after work. It was not a tedious game at all. I am genuinely surprised that 7 hours of gameplay felt like it was much longer. I suppose this is because of the fact that it was a whole new experience for me, and I would assume that the another playthrough will feel quick.

I am in awe. I am beyond impressed with Half-Life. For a game that released in 1999, for a game that is older than me, for a game that was quite literally the greatest revolution in FPS games since Doom and Quake, I am absolutely amazed by the experience.

I will Half-Life to anyone who enjoys first person shooters. This game was a blast. And it's cheap. 

Get it. Play it. Love it."
5273,Great game
5274,cool
5275,this game is bad trash dumb

5291,half life
5292,Hahahaha
5293,gud gaem
5294,its dated but still fun and makes you think instead of relying on fps skill. I really enjoy the music
5295,Great game. I enjoyed it a lot.
5296,"I don't know if it's just the fact that I'm not used to shooters, the fact that it's 25 years old, or what, but I found the game rather boring after over an hour of gameplay. Got a refund quickly."
5297,"this game, and the universe surrounding it is one of my favorite of all time! despite now being an older game, its still one of the best! graphics are decent considering, and mechanics and gameplay work so well. before this, i wasnt a huge fan of FPS, because the ones i had tried didnt make sense to me. storyline for the first game is a bit simplistic, but has enough there to get you into the world, and everyhting makes sense in the world. it can be challenging at times, but nothing you cant eventually get...if at first you dont succeed, try try again!

i HIGHLY reccomend this game for everyone! (unless you dont like even slightly violent games) 
from good fights, occasional scares/creepy scenes, sci-fi and action, and plotline and characters...its got it all and its all good. 10/10"
5298,very gud.
5299,"Pros: Killing headcrabs

Cons: Headcrabs

5309,My favorite video game franchise ever.
5310,Great game. Despite its age its still an absolute masterpiece of a shooter. the puzzles actually require thinking. 10/10
5311,"It's very good when you first play it, absolutely mesmerizing the things that they could do when the game came out. The combat is fun, as long as you have ammo which is an issue I ran into when they take your weapons. The final chapter before Xen is pain as the teleporter puzzle is a guessing game, with a bit of memory. Xen is... ugh, I haven't even beaten it. The boss fight with the big poison headcrab looking thing broke for me and he wouldn't come down into the final area, had to load a save. Also, it ate all of my ammo so the next few parts will be fun (I have not beaten the game) other than that the game deserves all the praise it gets. 8/10 no more Xen."
5312,Run. Think. Shoot. Live.
5313,I should have not waited decades do play this game. It really deserves all the love it gets.
5314,this game came out in 1998 and its gameplay is still amazing. how
5315,yes
5316,half life > black mesa
5317,its a classic
5318,This game is giga-jank. Super fun though.
5319,"Didn't really live up to the hype that I had for it,
considering people put it up there with the greats
which is probably buffed b/c of when it came out
But whatever, it is fun and I guess that's all that really matters
7.5/10 Would recommend"
5320,"I would write a funny review but, Gordon doesn't need to hear any of this, he's a highly trained professional."
5321,"One of those games I wish there was an inbetween rating for :/
This game is rather dated. It's one of the those rare games that it's attempt at what we know as the modern fps format was legendary at the time, but has caused it to be left in the dust as time moves on. If it were even older I feel like it wouldn't feel this way (goldeneye/doom) but sadly it does.
That being said I played it without accessing the console whatsoever, so i didn't noclip to get out of spots where i'd get stuck in the wall or if there was a bug or anything. Played it totally vanilla. And If that's how you choose to play it then my rating should be Not Recommended instead. That playstyle truly reveals how much wrong there is in this game. I got glitches or stuck in the wall damn near a hundred times by the end of the game. Extremely frustrating. It was overall an enjoyable experience when it functioned however. And I think the overall world and story was worth playing, pretty neat. But I won't be playing it again, at least not in this format. I am excited to move on to the second game as it will be my first time seriously playing that game all the way through.

tldr; Great game for the time, but it's dated of course. Lots of bugs... Don't repeat my mistake and just use the console if you end up getting stuck or run into a game halting bug."
5322,I didn't get this game for free
5323,its fine

5339,"A fine retro game that runs well on modern hardware. If you can get it on sale, DO IT! 
It does show it's age in both the best and most frustrating ways--Revolutionary for PC gaming and FPS genre. If you can get used to the old school clunkyness and difficulty then you will have a blast!"

5347,"Play as Gordon Freeman, a family man in 2032 working to support his family as he fights through the newly mutated covid 19 abingus variant"
5348,"is good
"
5349,excellent game the a revolutionary fps that helped them go from doom clones to there own distinct thing. Although the friendly npc's AI is starting to show their age. The enemy AI is still as sharp as newer AI developments. The gun play is clean if you get creative and try to use all of the weapons and think out actions the way a theoretical physicist would can make the game really fun and enjoyable. I think the only downside is the graphics are hard to get past for some people. Try this game again and don't play it like doom. As the tag line on the box said. RUN. THINK. SHOOT. LIVE.
5350,"yeah, it's ok."
5351,"Great game, holds up even today for the most part. However, many people probably won't think so. There's a lot of jank in terms of level design and the shooting  is kinda unforgiven. Give it a try!"
5352,"What I love about it:
- Story
- The NPCs
- How the gameplay is also part the story
- Creative enemy design and how they function through the game
- The dialog from NPCs

What I don't like:
- The collision glitches that will get you stuck in ""Surface Tension""when it comes to going through tight spaces
- How the walking mechanics can get slippery in non slippery grounds

Would I recommend this game, yes, I still would despite the small flaws it may have. If anything don't let the things I don't like in the game overshadow your interest. It's just small flaws I found when playing it. it's also not that bad for the price of the game.

 Overall, this game is a 9.5/10 for me. Go ahead and purchase a copy for yourself if you have some spare money like $10 or over and if you are interested in it."
5353,"Undoubtley, one of the best games I've ever played. The source of everything! Almost 20 years have passed, and I still play it like the very first time. Long live Gordon Freeman!"
5354,Feed my coiiiiins mr Freemaaaaaaaaaaaaan
5355,"To quote Gordon Freeman: """""

5385,ye
5386,It's pretty cool. It aged pretty well.
5387,"Strange how this game is often recommended as one of the greatest games of all time, I didn't like it very much at all. I missed it on the first go around back in '98, and thought I'd give it another shot during the pandemic. Ironically I don't actually mind the graphics, it was a simpler time, but the game-play just isn't that engaging. You don't walk across the land, rather you ""skate,"" often overshooting your intended platform to your death. You don't climb off a ladder, but hurl yourself in the opposite direction usually to your death. You don't fire precision shots to kill the enemies (who are the military and space aliens) but spray about a hundred bullets from a pistol (which makes an insufferable noise) or assault rifle, or wizz-bang alien weapons; while they all can kill you in around five hits. The plot is pretty boring as well. Maybe that guy in the blue suit you see at the start of EVERY scene has something to do with the invasion? Crack job detective. 

Again, I'm not quite sure why this game is so popular. If you're looking for games with a bit more substance which came out in '98, check out Grim Fandango, Baldur's Gate, Spyro the Dragon, Thief all on windows xp, (haha). But if you just can't get enough Half-Life, check out ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch: Spellbound."" It's basically the same game as Half Life, but expanded to included a science fiction fantasy element that's as powerful as it is riveting."
5388,"Half life 1 is truly a masterpiece for it's time. Even when the Ai can be a bit goofy and a bit messy, The game truly fasincates me with details, even if this game is 20 years old you can still discover new and amazing facts with the series and the games as a whole (HL2, BS, OF, etc)


But for this game in particular, this game is special when it comes to details, for a game in 1998 theirs literally bugs that move around and little fishes that attack Gordon in a few areas. Another thing worth to note is how the game transforms slowly overtime as the Disaster goes on, Military losing hope, Scientists and Security slowly getting less frequent to see at the final few chapters. It shows how high scale Black Mesa's incident was and how horrifying it really was, especially in the DLC's with blue shift and Opposing force. Both have amazing storytelling without markers on a screen telling you where to go. 

The levels in the game (I sorta call them chapters just like HL2 does) Have amazing design, You may get stuck for a bit in one level if you're not aware of the map layout (especially on your first 1-10 playthroughs you may forget the layout or what to do entirely) without checking a tutorial. Can be annoying but its manageable if you try.

The Soundtrack is amazing, Questionable Ethics is by far the best song. The buildup, The action, The finale shows how much care and effort valve put in their game. Half life 1's Beta was entirely scrapped and made an entirely new game. And it really shows in the release.

The guns and weapons have some unique designs, each one feels different when you hold it. The Magnum Revolver deals heavy blows to enemies, especially more bigger and dangerous enemies, The crossbow is like a sniper and can pick enemies from far away. Each weapon has a different variety to it that makes them fun and rewarding to pick enemies off with.


the headcrabs are fucking annoying


10/10. Buy when it's on sale, It is 100% worth experiencing"

5399,Gonna complete Half-Life 2 and then I'll be classified as a true gamer as I've completed Half-Life: Alyx and Half-Life
5400,"A hard game with puzzles and it's called a game,so have fun and if bored,I invite you this game"
5401,"Still an iconic game, and cheaper than it was on pirate CD when it first came out!"
5402,"I often feel this game was only good cause it came out at a time the OG doom was the only good game out. Fuck that time, this game reeks, while my, ""friend"", might love this title, I do think its boring af"
5403,good funny game
5404,FUCK YEAHHHHHHHHHHH HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHA KILL THEM ALL AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHH
5405,The original Half-Life is just a masterpiece. It's difficult but it's just a great game that I don't think can be matched anymore.
5406,"I was reluctant at first, after the first ten minutes I was a hooked, after the first hour I was a fan, after I finished it however I was stunned. I genuinely think this might be the Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront and Rambo I, II & III all rapped into one but as a game. I got proceeded to get everything remotely connected to the Half-Life name. The original Half-Life is still magic though. At this point I not only recommend this game to everyone, It's a right of passage to manhood. Play it, on hard, the play it again, then download Sven Co-op and play it with friends, then get brutal HL, then get Black Mesa."
5407,"Gordon doesn't need to hear all of this, he is a higly trained proffesional"

5414,"I wanted to like this game so much.  But I honestly find myself struggling to play much more than a few hours.  It does have great puzzles, but I find myself wanting to play games like Doom or Goldeneye 64 over this.  I want to love this game so much.  I love games from this era, but I cannot bring myself to playing much more.  For 2021, its rough to play.  But the game has my respect for what it was able to do back then. And while it is not for me, I can see many people enjoying it to this day.  For this reason, I am giving it a positive recommendation."

5421,"Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Or rather, in the hazard suit. I took the liberty of relieving you of your weapons; most of them were government property. As for the suit, I think you‚Äôve earned it. The borderworld, Xen, is in our control for the time being, thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there. I am impressed.	
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, Mr. Freeman. I have recommended your services to my employers, and they have authorized me to offer you a job. They agree with me that you have limitless potential.	
You‚Äôve proved yourself a decisive man, so I don‚Äôt expect you‚Äôll have any trouble deciding what to do. If you‚Äôre interested, just step into the portal and I will take that as a yes.	
Otherwise...well...I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning. Rather an anticlimax, after what you‚Äôve just survived.

5426,Half life is a great classic that has a nice story line and great gameplay. It's certainly an older game but one that still sits well among it's similar competition.  I remember playing this when it original came out for the Playstation 2 and still enjoy replaying it today.

5430,Myself took away life from all of thy black mesa scientists in thy facility because it was very fun to kill human beings in thy game because of by means of they flew across thy room. Gordon freeman is sexy with his beard as well as his beard contributes a lot to thy story line. Myself love this beautiful masterpiece of a game. They can even create testicles into a evil monster within thy game. This game is art on it's own. Thy scientists art idiots while also having colossal brain time. This game is gabe newell's thicc ass. 10/10 ign
5431,"the game is great,  but since it's 22 years old, and Valves first game, expect some things to be a little confusing. I liked almost every thing about this game, but one thing i didn't like was chapter 7 ""On A Rail"". This chapter goes on for way too long, mostly because of the trams speed. Its fastest speed still feels too slow."
5432,One of the best games I've ever played
5433,"half life 1 is probably one of the best single player games ever, the gameplay is so good that u dont even think or even see the old grapichs its just grate tho it is a bit long if u play at hard defulcty like i did i finished it at 12 houres for easy mode it should take about 3 hours from what i saw n youtube the map design is simple enogh that u dont need a youtube vidio guiding u wich is vary cool in my oppinion i only nedded it to do it about 3 times in the black mesa area and 4 times at the zen area but zen is a maze it makes no sence but else half life i will give a 10/10 BUY IT! NOW"
5434,"The name of this title reminded me of the name we gave to this kid called Mike. Mike suffers from diabetes, he would be force fed foods that would raise his blood sugar levels to the point of a chronic stroke. The final time I saw him was when he was on his death bed, half of his face looked like a moldy, sausage roll from Greggs. Mike begged me to end his pathetic life before his 8 year old sister who suffers from leukemia and had a shiny, bald head. I thought to myself that the girl kinda looks like a head-crab from half-life.

5436,"only play this game if you are a boomer who played quake 30 years ago.  gunplay is pretty bad, movement is too slippery, there is way too much platforming, fighting the aliens and the latex black chick spies who run at mach speed is beyond irritating.  enough cheap deaths to make dark souls jealous.   modern games have plenty of problems for sure but so do these ancient geezer shooters.  $2 is a fair price if you know what you're getting into but do not pay any more than that."

5444,"they said it was 12 hours they said it'd be fun they said i wouldn't be mentally damaging 
"
5445,"I truly do not know as to why to this day people lose themselves over this game,  back in 1998 im sure it was a fun game however playing it in the present it is downright  horrible. The controls are awful and unresponsive, it feels like you are on ice. The level design is awful too, it doesnt feel fun or interesting at all. It is very repetitive. It is a hard game only because of its clunky controls and poorly created and thought out levels. This game is the definition of overrated in every sense of the word. This game is not worth $10 dollars by any means."
5446,"Considering how old the game is, it's incredible."
5447,"I really enjoyed Half-Life. I was really excited to finally play this game and it did not disappoint for the most part. The one thing I really loved about the game is that it's very much one big seamless experience. Loading between different areas is done in a mostly non-intrusive way (at least as much as technology at that time could allow), and all of the ""cutscenes"" and dialogue are integrated into the gameplay. This, coupled with the eerie music and ambience allows you to really get immersed in the world, like you really are Gordon Freeman going on this journey. The combat feels good and the problem solving to get through the different areas and challenges is really satisfying when you finally get it right. There were some parts of the game where it was a little confusing on what to do, and its easy to occasionally get lost, but for a game made in '98 it holds up surprisingly well."

5468,a true classic
5469,is good
5470,Yes! I'm not with the science team!
5471,"I'm constantly getting lost, and it's not a game where it's fun to get lost. not enough cues, I don't know where I'm supposed to go, or what to do to unlock the right way to go. and the platforming doesn't feel good, as the character is so slippery. ladders are just bad, and too many things go beep beep beep all the time and it's so annoying. tried this because I love Portal/2, and I get this came first but dang, Valve has come a long way. I'm gonna try HL2 and see if I can appreciate that one better. I'm sure this was good for it's time, but it really doesn't feel good to play to me."
5472,good game
5473,The game is good be cause it ballences out the puzzles shooting and story and it isnt just cutscenes its a story that is fun and imersive and i wish game were still made like this is one of my favorite games of all time would recomend 1000000000%

5519,An amazing old school fps that still lives up today with the great controls and amazing story. The only lackluster thing with this game would be the graphics but it is a 20 year game. 9.5/10
5520,"Half life was the second fps game i ever played and i loved it then and i love it now but still find lots of problems here and there.Half life when it came out was revoltionary and stuff so first combat. foes or better than the reskins half life 2 had they work well my faverite being the bullsquid but it has problems the human enemys feel a bit overused and the aliens were in low supply of cool ones i think how valve could have fixed it was by adding 4 more aliens 2 in black mesa and 2 in xen. wepeons.2 great one thing half life did that other games dont really do anymore is alt fires that are not wepeon upgrades like the double barrel blast on the shotgun and the tau cannon over charge the guns are great just the pistol gets outclassed once you get the smg with a grande launcher the only 2 wepeons that are kind of pointless are the gluongun or that packs from gost busters and the trip mine the gluon gun is kind of pointless compared to the tau cannon (and by tau i dont mean those things from 40k all i know is that they have to be killed and fast) and i only used the trip mines once or twice. story.3 its not bad it not deep but its told in a type of narative that games should use more unbroken first person persective but aside from that the story is fun not super deep and well its a start for fps. movement.4 the movement is fine some people say your to fast yeah and in halo you carry to many wepeons the movement is good if you can master it (sort of) the levels are great but xen is just a nightmare god awful low gravity with still killer fall damage and the platforming THE PLATFORMING this is the worst part of half life and the hd models unless your playing blueshift do not use them but i dont want to end this on a bad note so YOU CAN BLOW UP DOCTER MAGNASINS casarole and he will not forgive you for 20 years YAY.
"
5521,k
5522,"A 40/60 split of good/bad respectively, I'd say. When it it's good it's good but more often than not it wasn't, just tedious and frustrating instead.

Pros:
- Surprisingly immersive and interactive world considering the year it was released.
- Rewards caution and sharp senses, the tools and hints you need to succeed are there if you take the time to examine the situation... Usually.
- It's got charm, I cannot deny.

Cons:
- Gordon controls like a drunk with brain damage made of flubber caught in an oil slick at all times. Makes already frustrating first-person platforming so much worse. Even just trying to move with any sort of precision can be all but impossible sometimes.
- Rife with artificially difficult trial-and-error sections and/or portions which call for quick, precise movements that the control your given only technically allows for, if ya know what I mean.
- One of the worst final bosses I've ever had the displeasure of having to slog against.

Honestly the DLC's were better (even Blue Shift.) Better level design with more reasonable challenges."
5523,"It's a fun game, and for it's relatively cheap price this game is a must play for anybody who likes first person shooters. One thing to note is this game is rather hard compared to modern games, and if you're new to the game you're going to die. and die. and die."

5571,Best FPS Game 1998
5572,the game is fun
5573,"Except for the last part of the game, Half Life is something more than a masterpiece. It's almost in a status of itself, basicly reimagining what a game can be and how far both gameplay-wise and in terms of story telling the game medium can be pushed. That's what I would say if I got the original Half Life in 1998.
Today the game still magicaly holds up and it's no wonder that it does, because many other modern FPS games were or still are in some way inspired by Half Life or use the same rules as Half Life does.
I'm glad that I've played this game, the only thing I regret is that I didn't do it sooner."
5574,"good, very very good"
5575,very cool
5576,yee
5577,"Old, but GoldSrc.

No, seriously you should play this old masterpiece. It is fun even by today standards and while the graphics can be considered aged, it's still a charming game with a great atmosphere and world and a great experience even in 2021."
5578,"I thought it would be like other sci fi shooter. I really thought it would be like Halo. It turns out it's somewhere between Dead Space and Halo. Holy shit!! I was not prepared for the horror and screamed at the 144p monster at midnight.
10/10 would recommend."

5594,"Timeless classic, a game that left a tremendous impact on the industry. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about Half-Life. I will say though, that if you are a newcomer to this game, prepare for hell. Later sections of the game can be brutally challenging if you aren't accustomed to Half-Life's quirks. Oh, and Xen is a miserable time but thematically it's very cool so I give it a pass."
5595,"good gaem but confusing on the chapter ""BLAST PIT"""
5596,I have not played this game for 49.6 hours what the fuck valve
5597,Hi
5598,Half Life is great. Play it.
5599,classic
5600,very very good i like it so much
5601,half life
5602,"After beating the game twice I can say for certain that, despite it's quirks, the original Half-Life is still an amazing game."
5603,"A classic. Dated maybe, but still a blast. Fack zen though"
5604,"I have to admit, I dissed this game when I first played it. For context, I played this game long after it came out, and I was only 14 when I first played it. I thought it was just overhyped late 90's shlock that only people in their 30's played and lusted for out of only nostalgia. After playing it multiple times recently, I couldn't have been more wrong; this absolutely belongs with the greats of DOOM and Quake. The shooting feels satisfying, if a little bit clunky. The story, while sparsely explained, is still ever present throughout the entire game through its environment, rather than exposition dumps (though they're still here, but not frequently). The atmosphere, for a late 90's shooter, is really good, if all be a bit primitive compared to its successors. Regardless, its something everyone should play atleast once, along with its remake, Black Mesa."
5605,"it be good tho
"
5606,its good
5607,Funny Aliens
5608,"Game is really fun at times, however there is a lot of bs parts in the game that drag down the experience. Some parts are easy, some are way too hard and oftentimes I had to use a walkthrough to navigate myself. Combat is fun, but difficulty and some obscure puzzles bring this game down."
5609,play game!!
5610,Very cool. Nice story and gameplay.
5611,good game it¬¥s fun
5612,"Meu jogo favorito! O jogo √© um RPG que conta a hist√≥ria de Gordon Freeman, um f√≠sico te√≥rico que trabalha em um laborat√≥rio secreto chamado Black Mesa (tipo uma √Årea 51 da vida). Um dia, em um dos testes que ele foi fazer, explodiu por causa de uma invas√£o alien√≠gena no local, e agora o seu objetivo √© fugir de Black Mesa e eliminar os inimigos.
Os gr√°ficos s√£o nost√°lgicos, a trilha sonora √© muito boa, a jogabilidade √© perfeita (o Gordon Freeman anda r√°pido, mas voc√™ se acostuma com o tempo), enfim, tudo √© muito bom. Half-Life ganhou mais de 50 pr√™mios e foi um jogo que revolucionou a ind√∫stria dos FPS."

5636,"If you're all for classics and getting that sense of nostalgia, go for it! If you're like me who likes more fast paced things with variation, I would not recommend Half-Life 1, and would go for 2 or various episodes. 

There are many ups and downs of Half-Life 1 including but no limited to


Classic
Engagements are always fun
Good story
Challenging
Most chapters are relatively fun

Very very very very long
Areas between engagements can be very boring 
Some chapters are hard to get through
VERY linear game
The entirety of the Xen part

But the biggest elephant in the room for the game...

A GIANT BLOATED NUT SACK BOSS FIGHT LIKE SERIOUSLY WTF

If you want a classic experience, buy Half-Life 1 or Half-Life: Source (Please don't buy HL:S for anything other than mounting it to GMOD, it is very buggy, earlier versions less so)

If you want an experience more like Half-Life 2, buy the remake of HL1; Black Mesa.

5637,pretty cool little game if you ask me
5638,48 minutes in already at blash pit gonna update this review when i play for 1:49hours

Still a fantastic game.

7/10 won't play again."

5656,Hello Gordon!
5657,"Absolutley worth the money it was costing. Very fun. Don't play your first run in hard, it's very hard."
5658,"Very good
"
5659,"This game is no masterpiece nor perfect, it is a clunky game. You'll fight enemies that you'll load a whole clip into for them just shoot you once and then YOU die. Also headcrabs are so beefy and health items are so far part you will be barely scrapping by with 3 hp. This game also has on on a rail which might be the most annoying thing I have ever played. But when your blazing through enemies with your shotgun or killing soldiers with grenades that's Half Life at its best BTW SAVE OFTEN THE AUTOSAVE IS HORRIBLE SAVE EVERY TIME YOU SOLVE PUZZLE OR CLEAR A ROOM OF ENEMIES!!"
5660,Loved revisiting this game! Stands the test of time.
5661,"This game was a chore to finish, at the time it must have been fun but I didn't like it that much.;"
5662,Why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties?
5663,a classic.
5664,"I've replayed this game more times than I can count and have enjoyed more and more each time. There are certainly aspects that make it less-than-perfect, but for its age, I'm amazed it holds up as well as it does. ""Black Mesa"" is a soulful remake that does an amazing job re-contextualizing the story for modern players, but I would still highly recommend everyone who's a fan of the fps genre play this at least once."

5674,This game will live forever. Version before Steam was better. And this stupid pack with ugly updated models. I always delete it.
5675,It's fucking Half-Life
5676,yes
5677,this is some gourmet shit right here
5678,ye
5679,Classic one of its day.
5680,worth every cent. gud game
5681,I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning.
5682,cool i guess
5683,"i cant close it :(

edit: im starting to accept half life being part of my daily life

edit: barney is a good man, even though i hear his same diologue options over and over again i still feel like we have a close friendship

edit: half life closed. i am nothing. no more barney :((("
5684,"It's easy to see why this game is so well-remembered when you get a chance to play it. Fun times, tripmines, and dead dudes galore."
5685,"This is a really good game for it's age :)
Half-Life in general has a good story with a good gameplay flow and puzzles to solve that fits the vibe Half-Life has."
5686,GREAT GAME. I GOT CRUSH ON ALYX :3
5687,do you know who ate all the donuts
5688,First time playing this series. The story and gameplay aged really well but the instances where you have to platform or be in a rail car were horrendous imo
5689,I‚Äôll be honest i have no clue how i have 65 hours on half life but i do
5690,pogg game
5691,YES ME ME CHANGE THE MODELS SPITS
5692,yes
5693,"Ever since purchasing Game of the Year Edition, I fell in love with this title.
If you haven't seen this, I don't care how old it is, just play it.
THE classic. 1998 was a great year. :D"
5694,"remove ""on a rail"" and this game is perfect"
5695,good
5696,"The game may be quite bloody but it has a good story! The player must kill enemies, solve puzzles, and explore the Black Mesa research facilities for an escape. The game is very hard though, (which is why people like it) and it has very challenging prediciments. But if you like Sci-Fi, Action, and Adventure, then this is the game for you."
5697,V√©io mai bom
5698,I got hired at black mesa hoping to get a quick buck. Then I saw a headcrab...
5699,the best FPS ever
5700,"Horribly overrated, just like every other valve game, broken hit boxes, shit weapons, and at times insultingly difficult, go buy black mesa the fan remake"
5701,"A blow to nostalgia.
This game is much better than i renembered, of course some mechanics are totally rudimentary but considerating that is a 1998 game still being a wonderful piece of art.
Thanks a lot Valve."
5702,still a good game after 20 years
5703,good
5704,"Fire the rocket engine!
Destroy the damned thing before it grows any larger!

STAHP!"
5705,"YES YES I FINALLY DID'T IT AFTER DYEING AT THIS DAM GAME SOO MUCHI GONNA GIVE IT A ABSOLUTE SHIT OF WHAT IT IS

funny scientist go scream 
and i love this game
i put it hard mode cuase  i am a hardcock gamer
funny secene in the game hella good
"
5706,this goes hard
5707,game good can cheat tho
5708,the best half life game.
5709,"Was this game made by EA or Ubisoft? Unskippable cutscenes, bad dialogue, and bland gameplay"
5710,Simply a masterpiece and far ahead of it's time.
5711,"amazing game....
still waiting for Half Life 3
"
5712,Hafl lfife
5713,"remember to quick save before blowing yourself or the npcs up
"
5714,This game has been on my backlog for about 5 years. It's been 23 years since this game's release and I enjoyd every second of it!
5715,<3
5716,This happened to my buddy Eric once
5717,Hunt Down The Freeman better
5718,THE ALIENS ARE COMING WEVE BEEN COMPROMISED wait nevermind this game is actually good
5719,"retro, fun, challenging, and i will never ever eat crab again"
5720,I am heavy weapons guy
5721,I didnt know abortions were this dangerous
5722,A classic fps. That is all.
5723,The game that started it all. Very good game
5724,half-life 3?
5725,If you enjoyed Half Life you should try Sven Co-op with some friends
5726,"This game was the beginning of something great. Something revolutionary. I love this game with a passion. Play this game, and ALL of it's sequels.


But do NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, play Hunt Down the Freeman. That game is by far the worst Half-Life fangame. DON'T PLAY IT."
5727,I love it
5728,Damn when i hadn't played this game my life was whole but now its in half
5729,‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å
5730,old game with lots of content every time i thought the game was going to end it was never over and i'm still not even finished with the game
5731,"Valve started from this game that came out of nowhere. For late 1990's video games, nobody had seen a frighteningly realistic world and believable setting. You weren't shooting aliens and the military for no reason, half-life had purpose for your actions. Valve made a game with only one cutscene at almost the entirety of the game is within your control, you can do whatever you want. Half-Life will remain a classic and holds up well today."
5732,Unforseen consquences
5733,"not a fan, but good game"
5734,good shit
5735,it took me too long to beat imo
5736,I can see how this game shaped a generation of fps.
5737,Where is the full life? I dont want half life anymore?
5738,this game has the guy from half life in it
5739,a masterpiece
5740,"While this game may be ~22 years old, it is pure enjoyment even today.  Personally, I enjoy the late-90's/early-00's era of graphics as it still left a lot to the imagination.  Now and days everything is so polished and detailed that it's a lot to take in, and I personally find it mentally taxing and overwhelming to play many modern games.  However Half-life is very enjoyable in 2021, and a basic linear game, without *too* much repetition of textures.  The AI can be a little dumb and non-responsive at times, but that's common with games of this era - I find it a nice nostalgic reminder of how far gaming (and computing in general) has come, if nothing else.  Highly recommend to anyone!"
5741,"gud
"
5742,Beautiful graphics for a 1998 game. There are a lot of weapons
5743,Half-life what a amazing game the story the environment and life. Is so detailed for a old game and old engine it's still got some soft Locking here and there but all and all amazing game overall I highly recommend anyone play this game for the story and game and recommend play Sven co ops cuz that is more fun playing half life 1 with friends my rating is a 11/10 amazing game for it's age and it's still hold up today

5763,good morning gordon
5764,"It started it all. With the release of this game began the saga of a game company we now know for its award-winning titles and franchises.

Half-Life's great. With today's standards, probably not the best, since it was a 1998 game and the textures and sounds are... well... 1998..., but it did revolutionize the FPS genre at the time. Nonetheless, fantastic story, mechanics, gameplay, voice acting, etc.
Can get difficult at times but maybe that's just me; I'm not a [i]huge[/i] fan of the FPS genre. I got this game, as well as HL2 and the Episodes, [i]partly[/i] because I loved the Portals.
This occasional difficulty spike meant that I had to save like, every few seconds to ensure some progress. It sadly did detract from what was otherwise a fun and enjoyable experience. Fortunately, this was not present in HL2 (but I haven't played that on the hardest difficulty, so I don't know if that would be [i]as difficult[/i] or more).
If you're good at FPS games then you will likely not face the same problems as me. But if not, then here's a warning: it's hard.

So do I recommend it? Yes if you're really into first person shooters, and/or would like to get into the Half-Life-Portal universe story, and/or are feeling the '90s nostalgia. While you're at it, be sure to get HL2, as well."
5765,"Incredibly good game, total classic. Not much else to say really, just a very solid experience."
5766,Hello Freeman
5767, Best FPS ever made
5768,fun game
5769,I have a lot of fun with friends
5770,"Half Life is a video game involving a scientist named Gordon Freeman who is tasked with placing an alien crystal into an anti-mass-spectrometer. Surely nothing can go wrong.
There is a lot of action, puzzles, and many different weapons that you can obtain to take on your enemies as you venture deeper into Black Mesa.
However, you may run into issues such as getting stuck in certain areas, but you can save the game at any time. And if you don't save, the game still has an autosave feature.
But overall, Half Life is a great game that I would recommend to you."
5771,surface tension
5772,shartt
5773,this game is fair but unforgiving even on easy if you want to get good at fps's play this
5774,this game is one of the best games i played
5775,haha gun go bam bam bam
5776,I love Gaben
5777,very cool

5781,the graphics kinda low rez
5782,thank god for the 1 sec respawn time
5783,"Si te gustan los shooters, de hecho has tenido que jugar Half Life."
5784,An absolutely immaculate game. Can be difficult at times especially near the end but overall one of the best games I have ever played.
5785,this game plays like a game released on november 8th 1998
5786,Who is Barney? Where can I meet him?
5787,cheese
5788,couldnt play the game for more than a minute
5789,great game i just beat it

5791,Do I even need to explain myself for this one?
5792,–õ—é–±–ª—é —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–µ –∏–≥—Ä—ã)
5793,good
5794,"I was one of the few people who never got to play classics such as Half Life, Fallout or DOOM until recently, and I honestly never thought much about them. I knew that Half Life was critically acclaimed and formed the backbone for not only Half Life 2 (considered by many to be the greatest game released by Valve), but also its successors, and the wide scope of the company, allowing it to release anything from consoles, to VR headsets (and VR games, as we found out).

Without spoiling too much, you play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist who studied for a PhD in Theoretical Physics at the MIT. (In other words, super-duper smart guy). He works in a top-secret research facility that works on teleportation gear, and ways to connect to other hypothetical dimensions. These experiments worked, but - as it turns out - worked too well, and creatures from a different dimension come seeping through the facility. Your goal is not only to seal this rift, but to ultimately survive.

The game employs the use of puzzles, which for the most part are extremely straightforward. While there are lots of visual hints available, such as outright signs, you will most likely not need any. Use your intuition, in 9 out of 10 cases, it will be right. The shooting is pretty good, all things considered, though the AI can get annoying even on Normal difficulty. Somehow I still managed to get across though.
The graphics are poor by today's standards; they are very low-poly, but that does not stop the game from setting an atmosphere. If anything, I appreciate the color palletes used, and on today's computers, the game changes levels instantly. It's also a nice change of pace from modern games; whereas modern games can draw you in with their visuals, this game draws you in by making you imagine its potential - and boy it is huge. You needn't look further than Half Life: Alyx.

Overall, really enjoyed it. Can recommend. 8/10"
5795,PLAY IT OR PERISH
5796,tom cruise is the aliens and the army and the black ops in this... kinda wild.
5797,benrey
5798,"we spent good years growing up with this game, thanks Valve, you gave us the best memories with this game <3"
5799,One of the best sci-fi games i've played. Although if older platforms aren't your thing you might not like it...

5827,"This was the first proper single player shooter I ever played as I did not grow up playing them. I played it for the first time a few years and ago and it was my gateway to loving linear, single player fps games. I found the environments and the simple story incredibly immersive. The combat, especially on hard, requires you to plan ahead for each encounter. The entire arsenal you have access to is useful. The soundtrack is minimal but memorable when it appears. The enemy AI is actually really fun to go up against as you learn their quirks. 
I feel this 20 year old game holds up extremely well. The graphics are dated, but they have a charm and simplicity to them that keeps them a bit fresh. Honestly, I think you are missing out if you haven't played this. 
"
5828,"[h1]Dust Up[/h1]

[u]Half-Life[/u] is a game that created a world and encapsulated story within it, unlike anything else at the time. It still holds up today - remarkably well, along with it's successor. This game is a mountain in creative endeavour and a journey of timeless proportion. Game play elements largely range around FPS combat, of which there are numerous weapons and consequent strategies to employ. It makes for enjoyable variation and persistent novelty combined with the changing level environments and enemy encounters. Speaking of changing environments, the game takes place at a research facility called Black Mesa and your ventures will take place here. The atmosphere that both the visuals, ambience, and music evokes help to enhance the experience and memorability. Perhaps it's also important that the game flows without any cut-scenes with the only gaps being load times between areas. That is probably one of the most notable praises and for good reason, it succinctly keeps the immersive qualities of the game within a consistent state and thus allows the player to stay in a flow with the game and the elements that make it so great to begin with. Overall, the experience can be described as brilliantly potent and immersive.

The music also adds a lot to the overall atmosphere. For the most part, the game remains on ambience and an assortment of sound effects to fill the noise but sometimes the soundtrack kicks in and it's incredibly potent. Ranging from dark ambient soundscapes that envelope the world, as well as harder industrial and techno tracks for the more pumped up moments of combat. The whole OST fits the environment - hazardous and isolating atmosphere of Black Mesa."
5829,"You know when boomer gamers always say ""Games were much harder back in my day""?
This lives up to that statement and bumps it up an additional 10.

Its f hard and I loved every second of it."

5842,"Great atmosphere and pacing with heals/ammo, controls and movement can be a bit of a pain in the ass."
5843,"dont make the resolution any higher, you cant play the game and you cant change it back. ever."
5844,"very fun. definitely deserves the hype, even as a 23-year old game.
edit: ok, this game is not perfect. though the level design is great, and the combat hasn't aged a day, it IS a goldsource game. at one point near the beginning there was a vent I had to break and crawl through; note that you have to stand on vents AND crouch to break them. I tried breaking it, didn't work, guess there's another way. I was on a wild goose chase for that alternate enterance for fifteen f*** minutes trying to find it. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but nonlinear games as a whole need to be playtested pretty damn well to make sure everything is layed out clearly. that's not to say this game has awful level design, everything is well-done with the resources given to valve and for a game that was made in an age where pc games consisted of ""point, click on bad guy, press w key to progress."" if you don't mind clipping into and getting stuck on textures, having to manually save so you don't loose 15 minutes of progress, and an ugly 3rd act, there is GOLD here. (hence gold source)

tl:dr old game feels old but not that old considering how old it is. 10/10"

5854,"I purchased this game as a part of the Valve complete pack back in 2014. I have completed the game in the past on other hardware, but my lastest build can not run this game properly. Many instance errors occurring from a desync in load times and render times lead to ai bugging out constantly, ques not happening, and makes this game all around incomplete. It feels like playing a shitty half like mod, but it's the actual game. The source remake is not any better, and I soft locked on that remaster before opting to play the original because I thought I could at least complete my run. I was wrong. Bummed!"
5855,"This game is awesome, good graphics at least for the time, good story, and not repetitive game play.

But having HD models, and really bright gamma on by default? Why? Some people perfer it that why sre, but not everyone.

The HD models just look out of place in a game whose world is lower poly, and some of the ""HD"" changes seem to downgrade the model farther!

Bright gamma in a dark, and kinda scary game just makes no sense.

The game is great, but the default setting kinda suck.


There should also be an option to enable fast weapon switch, like in Half-Life 2.



To play the game how it tends to look best
1. turn off HD models because they just look off, and the weapon changes are dumb. (Unless you like them I won't judge)
2. Turn down the gamma a little bit, it looks too bright and saturated for a dark and kinda scary game 
(unless you like it that way)

3. press ` and type GL_texturemode GL_Nearest to disable texture filtering (unless you like that)

Good game, bad default settings, lucky your settings in one game, goes to all of the other original Half-Life expansions, and Team Fortress, so you won't have to set them every time!

Now as a grown man coming back to this game and completing it having gathered plenty experience from different other newer Valve games i must say that this game was today as enjoyable as it was back then after getting accustomed to the old type of gunplay again (which was fairly easy) and the plot of this game was able to pull in my attention and keep me entertained for hours.

5973,"Half Life is (in my opinion) one of the top 5 most important FPS ever. If Wolfenstein and Doom started the genre, Quake started to use real 3d and Call of Duty is the peak of multiplayer FPS, Half Life is the first FPS to create a deep lore and story. For a 1998 game, Valve made it solid enough to be enjoyable for years and decades.

Story is really good developed and well designed, enough to create one of the most beautiful lores in the videogame industry. Basically you play as Gordon Freeman, a scientist who, because an incident, has to escape from Black Mesa facility while fighting aliens to stop the invasion. 

Gameplay is really well made even for a game made 24 years ago. The HUD looks clean, with the weapon selection well chosen and good mechanics: refilling the HEV suit's shield, using a lantern (this was one of the things I didn't liked, but it's forgivable since it's one of the FPS pioneers and neither Wolfenstein/Doom, Quake or Duke Nukem had tried to include it), and the puzzles might be hard sometimes, but it's the fun of the game, I guess.

Graphics are not horrible. It might look really outdated even using the HD models, but I don't blame Valve. GoldSource was the peak of game engines in the 90's, but nowadays it might look clunky.

Story is really good (SPOILER ALERT). Gordon Freeman starts his job in Black Mesa facility trying to make a spectrometer, but it goes wrong and aliens invade the facility. Later, the US Army arrives and the scientists have hope that the soldiers will control the invasion, but the true reason the marines are there is to kill everyone in Black Mesa. Finally, Gordon finds a way to stop the aliens using a portal to Xen. Discretly, a suspicious man is watching Gordon around Black Mesa.

The game itself it's long for 8 to 10 hours long, although sometimes it can be much difficult because puzzles or moments when you have to think too much every action. 

If you love FPS, play Half Life. If you love videogames, play Half Life. If you want to play a good story, play Half Life. Definitely this game is a must-play if you are a gamer."

I bought the Valve Collection recently and playing this game again, its quite fun. There are quite a few differences but I want to state why this game feels so good to play.

The engine and the weapons play with each other really well. Just smacking head crabs with a crowbar feels fluid in some sort of way and running around shooting things is just plain fun.

I've not really been a big fan of N64 era graphics and the first steps into 3D but the game has some weird charm to it that I can look through. When characters talk though you can tell the game is dated.

The story is ehh.. alright. Its exciting and more action packed than most games but it's completely lacking compared to the other games in the series. In my opinion.

Overall, get it. Its still a fun game and there's so much replayability that you can see why its one of Valve's most prominent game series'. This title will probably be a 7/10, a good start for the series."

I did only the half of the training course because I didn't know how to rocket jump, keep in mind I didn't know English at that time
So I decided to play the single-player, I didn't know what that lady was saying, or who was I, or what I was supposed to do, I was just enjoying the view
Fast forward to the test chamber after I was running around like a maniac, I spent 10 or 20 minutes jumping around not knowing I had to climb up the ladder
After I pressed the button, I spent another 5 minutes wandering around until I pushed the cart
When the reactor started exploding, I went from being happy to being so scared that when I saw the Vortigaunts, I almost peed myself, I turned off my PC and went running to the bathroom

6000,"Absolutely brilliant.
I felt the need to write this review almost immediately after completing Half-Life (which was a very enjoyable 2 days, which is about the same amount of time as has passed in the game itself, funnily enough), and I would like to say that in spite of being an over 20 year-old game, Half-Life holds up well and is worth playing, and I'm very pleasantly surprised  and impressed with it.

While the clearly dated graphics, interface as well as the somewhat bare feel of Half-Life's setting may be offputting and do show the age of the game, I believe it also gives it a distinct charm. I have a list of points on which I'd like to remark upon:

GAMEPLAY
Having already played several Source games, and having no experience with non-Source FPS games, I was excited to see how Half-Life really worked... which is rather good, actually (with some notable exceptions)! I very much like how your character moves noticeably faster than in the Source games, and it definitely makes the game more fast-paced. This, I believe, is similar to older games such as those from the Doom or Quake series, which came out somewhere around the same time (and the games are obviously related, and it's nice to get a feel for how games of that era played). Generally speaking, Half-Life is also very pleasant to control.

The shooting worked mostly well, although sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not you're hitting an enemy. The Hivehand weapon was especially confusing to use. I was also surprised to see the physics (such as the gibs from smashed boxes), which I wasn't even aware was possible back in 1998.

A significant problem was getting stuck on objects, and an even greater problem was the completely broken nature of pulling objects, done by pressing the USE key and moving backwards. This always sent the object careening away by what amounts to several metres to the left or right with teriffic speed, and I suspect that it's a bug.

SOUND
The sound design, apart from the mostly very poor quality, adds to the gritty yet incidentally humorous and exaggerated atmosphere along with the flawless soundtrack, a great portion of which you will recognise from Half-Life 2. During my very first time playing I found myself walking continuously back and forth on the metal grates of the training course, then stopping and absorbing it along with the look of the map, as it turned to total silence... strangely amazing feeling.

Hearing complete and utter silence only interrupted by footsteps I also found quite fascinating, for some reason. This atmosphere of outdatedness and simplicity, even desolation, is something I can appreciate. With regards to the soundtrack, I especially enjoyed hearing ""Drums and Riffs"" during the rocket scene (I'm of course being vague to avoid spoiling it completely, but hey, this game is literally decades old), which had a particularly defiant and bold feel to it, so to say.

One genuine complaint one could make is the lack of consistency with the general sound quality, as well as the overuse of ""stingers"", the socalled short, suspenseful pieces of music meant to highlight the dark nature of a certain scene, also featured in Half-Life 2 (I believe I heard the same stinger at least 3 times). I also noticed that the music keeps going after you die or load a save file, which was quite awkward.

SETTING
By far one of Half-Life's biggest strengths is its setting and atmosphere. With tons of intriguing and wildly different maps, Half-Life is full of variety. The Black Mesa Research Facility, with its incomprehensible size, gives off a feeling of openness, and not once did the world feel boxy, claustrophobic or awkward. It felt very natural, with virtually no invisible walls to speak of. I enjoy the setting being in a barren canyon-type environment, conveying the sense that you're somewhere important to be held secret. Getting to explore it further and journeying down the deadly cliffs was also fantastic. I think it's a great setting for a secret lab, and a game in general because of the lack of anything important aside from ourselves and the characters and action immediately before us.
It does hurt the setting that the quality of the skyboxes is so extremely low.

The main setting also contrasts very well with the chaotic and macabre Xen. Overall, I think the environments and the game itself is very memorable and unique in terms of design.
The setting in the final scene is also a great callback to the beginning, in several ways, and its bizarre nature adds up to a great ending.

STORY
I appreciate the kind of story that poses questions and unsolved mysteries, and especially stories that don't need a backstory or long-winded introductory cutscene, but instead throws you right into it. Again, the datedness and simplicity of Half-Life works in favour of the game here. It's a very subtle way of introducting the player to the world of the game, and it's a recurring theme with a lot of Valve's games, especially the first Portal game, where it's done masterfully. In Half-Life, you get to piece the story together yourself without any metanarrative interruptions. It makes you feel like you're really there, in a way. Simplicity is the key here. Half-Life shows and basically never tells, which is what makes the universe of the game so captivating.

Half-Life can tell a story with a lot of mystique using very little, and the best example of this is the G-Man and his supposed associates. I would say that his puppetmaster-esque role and the power dynamic it poses is maybe the most interesting thing about the Half-Life universe. It also makes us ask even more questions about who your character, Gordon Freeman, actually is, considering his interactions with the G-Man.

OVERALL
As someone who originally played Half-Life 2 about 8 years ago, I'm glad to have played Half-Life 1. I look forward to play the extra levels from Opposing Force and Blue Shift next, and I'm very happy to have gotten all of these on sale! Half-Life is very much worth experiencing in spite of its age and I completely understand why it has had such an impact. It's been a pleasure to experience such a big part of video game/software history and I strongly recommend it."

This game still has alot of fun. This was the first game that got me into the half life series, if you don't count half life alyx. The story is fucking amazing.

I did have a couple issues while playing through it though. The game crashed to desktop many times, as well as my character getting stuck into the environment.  I even had an issue where a boss encounter near the end of the game didn't work properly; i actually had to consult a walkthrough on how to bypass it because it was bugged."

I highly recommend getting this game; It is fast paced, good story-line, many weapons to choose from in a certain situation instead always having to use the same weapon most of the time and the NPCs have good path finding and gameplay."
6031,"Pretty fun game, I've always wanted to play the halflife series and I am not disapointed. The game can get a little annoying but for the most part I have loved this game."

6044,"Purchased this and HF2 + Alyx so i could play through all of them in order.

honest review:
i personally enjoyed this game a lot and its story, i see why people enjoy this series so much and want a third sequel. though if im being honest it is an alright game, not saying its terrible! but idk my taste is a bit different dont get me wrong i love valve games tbh and all of their classic titles. again it was a fun game to play through and i highly recommend it if, you enjoy platform games or interesting stories. 
9/10 

time to play half life 2 wooo"
6053,"great game until the only 2 bosses. One gets bugged often and you can't kill it sometimes. so you have to blow open the floor with explosives, nades etc to get to the next level. The other boss is just annoying and bad. Besides that, great game."
6054,"First half was very good, then feels dragged out towards the end.
Ending levels honestly are terrible.

6061,"This is a legendary game, it was a before and after in shooter and it showed that you can tell a story in a shooter that is something more than ""kill everything that moves"" and it gets even better, without half life valve would not have emerged, And there would be no steam with all the changes in gaming that would have. This was the first shooter I played, crossfire was the first multiplayer game that I played on the internet in a game, I played with a friend the crossfire map, and the first weapon I took was the tau cannon, 16 years have passed from that day and the The hype I felt when I played it for the first time is something I will never forget."

6071,A real Classic!
6072,It's been a while since I've played a Half-life game and coming back to the series now that I have a PC has been incredible. These are must play games in my opinion. Half-life is like the Ocarina of Time of FPS. Still amazing after all these years. Excited to try out Black Mesa.
6073,"Good, I recommend playing in 4:3 for that authentic 1998 experience"
6074,"plot i amazing, gameplay is middling, end with GMan is great"
6075,"Even 23 years later, this game still holds up as a fantastic sci-fi FPS. Though the story is a little purposefully vague, the enviornments are rich and thick with atmosphere; the gameplay fun, fulfilling and filled with excitement around every turn, and its legacy is a testament to Valve's skill as a game development team."

this game is amazing and really good even after all these years!
however there is a glitch that i dont think is caused by my hardware. 
the glitch starts after a death where it show that theres a fatal error and you have to reset the game. now heres where it gets annoying. once you boot up the game, the last 5-10 save files get corrupted and you can no longer play in them. this is very annoying. once you fix this bug i will give a possitive review.
best wishes

edit: NEVER MIND NOW ALL OF MY SAVE FILES ARE CORRUPTED THANKS VALVE VALVE IS THE BEST GAME COMPANY IN THE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORLD AND I AM HAPPY :)"

6083,yeah i guess
6084,The game is great!
6085,"You probably alredy know this game, or at least heard of it. Even 22 years after release it's still a unique experience. This game is amazing, and has if you have problems with the ""outdated"" graphics, go play Black Mesa. Two of the only problems I have with this game are the bugs and lack of checkpoint, but other then those and some more this game is truly a work of art. If you're not sure if you'll enjoy the game, just try it at a friend's house, I'm pretty sure one of your friends has this game."

6099,"This game is really impressive for a game made in 1998, the story is really awesome, and i genuinely had a lot of fun playing it, i didn't understand some parts of the story but i got that covered by playing the other games."
6100,"I can see why this is still being played, it's very action focused, but with plenty of story"
6101,Half life is a old classic that fundamentally changed the world of FPS games. I decided to see if it has been improved over the year. Indeed some of the very nasty bugs that caused games to crash or stopped your progress have been taken care of. In the very early versions that was a huge problem. Also the textures have been updated so it's more consistent. I did found some glitches that are probably related to the original game engine. Mostly they are graphical bugs but there are also some where you can glitch out and take no damage from enemies or even big bosses. How exactly to achieve this I shall leave for everyone else to discover. Over all it is fun to play and relive the memories.
6102,Beautiful
6103,Nice game. :)
6104,swag
6105,"This is a fantastic game. Even though it's 20+ years old, it was named Game of the Year for a reason. With its immersive storytelling and engaging gameplay, it will take you on an adventure that will have you keep playing it for years to come. Also, the game keeps getting more interesting with new user-created mods coming out very often for it. Overall, this is one  of the best games ever made of all time."

6138,yes
6139,"Half Life. What is there to say about such an influential game? This game - although not as important as Doom was for FPS games (in my opinion) - changed how we see and play the games of today.

As we all know by now, thanks to the opening sequence alone games today have a story to tell you with the environment around them and with cut scenes... But I don‚Äôt believe anything has been done as well as Half Life and its opening sequence. These days we have unskippable cut scenes giving you a complete dumb of information, at times being too much to handle for someone who just started the game but Half Life lets you discover the story for yourself, the opening shows you a LOT of what‚Äôs happening in Black Mesa but without completely overloading is with everything going on - it is really a teaser for what‚Äôs to come. Again, nothing like this (as far as I remember) has been done after Half Life - sure they changed the format of games, but as I said, they dump info instead of letting you the player figure it all out.

The game is a little rough around the edges, this is a game of its time still, although the story and the environment is fun to play around with the AI can be a bit messy. Although the AI can be smart and look for alternative methods to take you down, they‚Äôre still very predictable and at times can break - for example, the G-Man later on in the game glitched out for me and wouldn‚Äôt move even when I was right next to him, it did break my immersion but these moments are far and few in-between.

The character interaction must be a highlight these days, again I may be remembering wrong but there aren‚Äôt many or any games where you can interact with almost every character. Even after the shit hits the fan, the leftover scientists and guards react to the current situation and talk to each other - a limited number of dialogue can be heard but again, that‚Äôs a lot more than what we get for today‚Äôs games.

And the ending, oh my god the ending, although not as impressive to look at now, the introduction and explanation of why there was a blue-suited man following you around Black Mesa is amazing and a great way to end this weird adventure."
6140,better than sex
6141,I fricked up the screen after the hazard course but the hazard course is cool
6142,Hello Gordon
6143,"One of the best single player game ever made, way ahead of its time."

6147,The Orange Master Chief is really cool
6148,game good finished it now :) (dont buy the source version its trash) but this game is preaty good still recomend
6149,"This games graphics are dated, sure, but its still really fun to play!

Edit:
While I did enjoy the game, near the end I just wanted to finish the game so I can play Half Life 2, the Xen levels are not that great. And there is this weird bug where I close the game on steam or just shutting the window, it says I'm still playing it, thus the 50+ hours of playtime. It's a good game, get when you feel like it."
6150,"Lovely game which makes me kinda nostalgic.
"
6151,"i beat it in about 11 hours, the final boss was pretty easy after you know what to do. But this game was pretty fun and has a good story so i can recommend it."
6152,Well-worthy of being a classic
6153,ye
6154,"I remember playing Half Life back in the day, so it was nice revisiting the game. I like that the community offers alternatives to play it as close to the original as possible as well as with the updates the game now offers.

All in all I recommend it highly."

6168,If you didn't play this game you missed out on one of the best fps games in history of gaming!
6169,"Now I'm gonna review this game again 'cause previous one just said ""Very nice"". I think each Half-Life game deserve more serious review.

 So, my first playing this game was after completing Half-Life 2 parts( I mean HL2 and two episodes). My friend recommended me to play and I tried. I really appreciated it. Apparently, I desired to play first game. I ran looking for this game on the Internet. I found it and downloaded. It took me two days to complete the game. 

I enormously liked it. Let's check out pluses and minuses. 
I wanna start with the last ones. Because for now this game has only one minus. It's graphics. Everything else is good sides of the game. I mean, the plot, the entities, the fight system and etc. 

In conclusion I am just gonna say this. If you like the Half-Life 2 franchise, you'll like Half-Life 1 franchise. Actually, it works backwards."
6170,Got halfway through before realising that Half-Life Restored exists

I still remember the snapshots and situations in the game and I will not forget them no matter how much I live

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"

6222,I love the hl series and this is one of my favourite games. The story is mysterious and confusing but that's just how hl is and I think that adds to the experience
6223,CLASSIC!!!
6224,FREEMAN YOU FOOL
6225,23 years later and this game still kicks like a mule!  If you're an old head like me looking for a nostalgia trip or a generation Z kid looking to study the masters then this is a great deal for you!

6227,"Amazing game.  I would recommend this as a great game for both beginners and experts of not only FPS games, but video games as a whole."
6228,"half-life's gameplay comes pretty naturally to me as i play a decent amount of counter-strike, so it was really easy to get into it. this game is also clean as hell for 1998 and has a lot more to offer than i had anticipated. would be my 1998 game of the year if not for... you know... ocarina's a pretty good game too..."
6229,good for a 90s game.
6230,I don't remember it being this frickin' hard! Played on normal to refresh my golden memories of this game. Was tense AF half of the time. Had to actually turn on cheats at some places in XEN. Nihilanth took me forever!

Once you get used to the graphics, everything is amazing. 
The level design is fantastic. Enemy AI is decent. The sound effect might be dated but quite memorable. The occasional music is pretty good too.

By the way, the atmosphere is very like STALKER series. Now it makes sense why there is a Gordon Freeman reference in STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl"

6293,this game is fun but pretty difficult
6294,Love this series so far
6295,it's fucking half life
6296,"if you love portal, youll love this too"
6297,"Catch Me Later, I'll Buy You a Beer!"
6298,"Gordon Freeman, I presume?"
6299,Just a piece of gaming history. Play and enjoy it!
6300,Yes
6301,I'm not a big fan but it's still fun with the janky mechanics and all of fun stuff
6302,it still works!
6303,JUST PLAY IT THE QUALITIES SHOW THEMSELVES INSTANTLY
6304,The best game

6307,11
6308,great c o c k 10/10
6309,this looks like a brill game hope nothing bad happens
6310,"What can I say about this Icon that hasn't already been said, and by more eloquent people than I. 

It remains a master piece of gameplay, mechanics, and story telling."
6311,I like the part when Gordon says:
6312,"*crowbar clank* *crowbar clank* *crowbar clank* ""STAWHP"" ""Why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties?"""
6313,nice
6314,"Oldie, but a goodie."
6315,made on a kids magnet drawing board but still good
6316,"I have to say, this game is old but it still stands to this day.
Half-Life was an adventure of it's own, I cannot believe how some people think this game is bad. The story rich game has different paths to execute. You can either complete the game not killing any good NPCs or either you can kill everyone you see. This will reward you in different ways.
The sound design is amazing, going to different areas gives a new soundtrack. The soundtrack fits with all the areas and the soundtrack is still one of the best.

The newer release of Half-Life source is okay but not as good as this release. Half-Life will always stand as the best Half-Life game.

Buy this game if you haven't already, you will not regret anything about it."
6317,i dunno its some good shit

6351,"A lot to do and relatively entertaining. The puzzles are great and the action feels just right. The only problem is that the management between health, armor, and ammo can become very tedious. So much so, that I had to quick save and load every 5 seconds when I took the slightest bit of damage just so I could feel confident through the next area. It also did not help that Vortigaunts spawn behind you as you are clearing the playing field in front of you and instantly hit you with their unavoidable hit-scan electric attack which removes a good bit of armor and drains your health. Other than that, it was pretty fun for 13 hours worth of content. Playing this game requires a lot of knowledge about video games in general. If you do not know much about the language of video games, it will force you to learn through trial and error. It teaches you a lot of valuable skills that can be transferred over to a lot of other games."

You have to think outside the box, while using a variety of different weapons, and maneuver through different chapters against increasingly difficult enemies.

6400,"It's an interesting mix of survival-horror and FPS, at least in the first half when you're simply trying to escape Black Mesa. It holds up pretty decently here in 2021 given its vintage. Valve practically gives this game away for free these days with it being so cheap even when not on sale for $2 or whatever. Still worth checking out, but it might not be for everyone as, while I feel like it's not too hard to slip back into not everyone is ready for a game from 1998."

2. The game is fun to play as you battle your way through the Black Mesa Facility solving puzzles and killing Aliens and Military personnel.

3. A ton of thought and care was put into this game making it one of if not the greatest FPS of all time.

4. It was created by Valve so even more care was put in it."

6453,is very good but old game would reccomend also to play A mod you gotta drag the mod folder into the game file to play and restart steam the game should appear under half life

6461,"amazing game, not the best graphics but def worth it"
6462,"Very challenging. Not like today's games where you can complete in a day. This game makes you think and, frankly, scares the hell out of you. The Half life franchise and Duke Nukem 3D are probably the best games produced. Game inventors would do well to learn from these games.

"
6463,Mostly everyone has played this game before. I love playing this on Steam since I no longer have a computer that can play the original CD anymore
6464,"Literally one of the greatest shooters of all time. Good Job, Valve. The chapters and weapons just are so intuitive and amazing, even for 1998 standards. Hell, even to this day."

6470,half life is the best shooter game ever made no other shooter has ever topped hl1 and it came out in 1998 impresive! this is my favorite game of all time i wish they would make another shooter like hl1 again!
6471,"This game has aged poorly, Firstly the control is floaty and freeman bounces off objects way too frequently too ever have any precise movement especially on narrow ledges. Secondly the ladders are garbage there's no real way to tell if you have actually grabbed the ladder until you move which then 2 things will happen you die from falling or take a retarded amount of damage falling or you actually climb the ladder. Third is the weapon roster which 99% are useless once you have the magnum (damage) and MP5/M4 (workhorse) other than those the weapons get out classed by these 2 or are just gimmick weapons that will only get you killed. Lastly the game has really nice set pieces but that's really all it has Half-Life now today has no substance the enemies are sponges the game has terrible pacing and the roster of enemies is VERY small, Once you hit Surface Tension you've pretty much seen all the game has to offer, because after that is the sections leading up to what EVERY half-life fan says is the worst part of the game ""ZEN"". I know that half-life pioneered set pieces and storytelling in games, but there are other games that have done the same AND kept the game pacing and story engaging. Pick it up if its on sale but I don't see why this is STILL heralded as TOP PC gaming."
6472,<3
6473,"I've always wanted to be an unhinged, unspeaking, geonocidal psycopath with no regard for the consequences of my own actions, leaving a path of complete destruction in my wake.

This game let me do that."
6474,dated but still  fun unless it's the rail section and xen. fuck the rail section and xen.
6475,yeah its pretty good
6476,great graphics
6477,"I wasn't born when Half-Life came out. I didn't experience the hype surrounding this game or how it changed the industry but two weeks ago I decided that it was time for me to play this legendary masterpiece.
And... yes I can DEFINITELY see why this was such a big deal. And for the first five hours of my playthrough I really had a lot of fun. So yeah, I think that this game deserves the hype and yes it is one of the most important game ever made. It's weird because I love this game. I love what this game has done to the gaming industry. But at the same time I think that the mechanics have aged very well. The story is still really good(I googled it:)) but the mechanics aren't. I was expecting that. I mean if the mechanics of an over 20 year old game would still hold up today there would be something seriously wrong with the modern standards for games. Because of this I don't blame this game for not holding up. In a lot of ways it's still great. The weapon and enemy variety is still great but the gunplay and the movement, oh god the movement, have aged very poorly. It's sad because these two are the things the ruin the whole experience. Everything else is still fine. Even the graphics are not too bad.
So in conclusion: I don't think that you should buy Half-Life in 2021. I've heard that the remake Black Mesa ist very good, so go play that game while still appreciating what this game has done for games."

6509,"Going back to a 1998 game can be challenging. There‚Äôs no eye candy in Half-Life, but it has something most modern titles lack. Valve‚Äôs original hit has passion and original intent.
Half-Life is a first-person shooter that thinks outside the box. It mixes science fiction components with spine chiller and endurance awfulness for an entrancing tale about a puppet believing in his own freedom. 

You play as an experimental scientist, Gordon Freeman. The situation is the puzzling, underground Black Mesa research center. Furthermore, the story is about you, getting away from the office, when crap hits the fan. 
Under New Mexico's desert, Black Mesa is overseeing research with problematic morals. You're not a huge piece of it, however; you're simply a traveler. 
The game begins with Gordon Freeman awakening on a train cart. The truck traversed the lab while foreboding music swirls all around. Voices from the speakers invite you to the exploration offices, which you get to see for around five minutes. 
This fantastic arrangement then, at that point, inclines when Gordon Freeman takes part in a risky trial. An ""mishap"" opens up an entry to a different universe, permitting outsiders to slither into Black Mesa. 
You, as Gordon Freeman, must escape to the surface.
The brilliance of Half-Life is its ongoing interaction, and I can't discuss the interactivity without further growing the story. Both go in hand with each other. 
The game occurs during 18 episode, each bringing new interactivity mechanics, riddles, weapons, and difficulties. 
There will never be a dull for a second or a monotonous fragment. The interactivity continues developing and hopping between elements of horror, science fiction, and all out action. 
The game's visuals, albeit obsolete, were progressive when. It runs on the GoldSRC engine. Two or three years after its introduction, it developed into Source, which runs every one of Valve's games until 2013's DOTA. That incorporates several Counter Strikes games, the Left 4 Dead establishment, Portal 2, Team Fortress, Team Fortress 2, and so forth

There is no need for reviews for this game, you will always find someone talking about half life. Moreover counter strike games are just developed mods for this game, such is its greatness."

There were some things that bugged me, like I didn't know where to go or what to do a lot of the time, but I cannot tell if that was just me being dumb or the game being cryptic. But this is my first FPS, so I dunno. However, this game is declared a masterpiece and an icon of gaming, so if you're in to FPS's, then go for it and have fun. There's this gun you get called the Hivehand which doesn't run out of ammo. I say use that as often as you can to save ammo for very tough situations."

6575,"6/10 - controls and combat were bummy, but the alien and level designs were pretty cool. It was also a revolutionary game for its time."
6576,Literally one of the greatest games ever made and only $1 on sale
6577,"Half-Life, Valve's d√©but title that took the gaming industry by storm. STILL WORTH PLAYING IN 2021"
6578,"One of the best games ever, I like source more, (with fix mods of course)"
6579,I don't understand why people like this game. It's literally a rip-off of Hunt Down the Freeman
6580,Kids these days don't know and will never know  - but this game raised the (crow)bar forever.
6581,aora me bale
6582,yes
6583,"A great game. There are a few moments which I think could have been done a lot better, such as the ending level, the first couple of levels, and a few other bits here and there, but overall it is a great game. Definitely worth the money. Play it now if you haven't already. Great story, mostly great weapons, simple but fun gameplay and a highly immersive presentation (no cutscenes), and a great story as well."
6584,"You have to let this person do it. Valve Software is a startup, a relatively unknown company with no trail and no real business to make such a powerful game. But it's powerful and the best single player shooter I've ever played. For some people -- especially those who haven't played the game -- it's hard to pinpoint exactly what everyone's talking about. There's nothing special about the engine - it's a heavily modified version of Quake by Id Software. Its genre, first-person shooters, almost got beaten to death. Its design couldn't be simpler: grab a gun, run, shoot, jump; there's no tedious cutscenes or dislocated RPG elements here. The weapons aren't spectacular either, just your usual assortment of realistic modern guns and some alien gadgets with some new twists. The creatures are fairly standard in a way, and many of the levels have been done before. Personally, no particular element of Half-Life stands out more than others, and nothing makes or breaks the game."
6585,awsome sauce!
6586,"I've played through almost all of the official Half-Life games from start to finish (working on HL:A at the moment) and this one is probably the hardest out of all of them. That isn't a bad thing either. The main thing that makes this game so good is how it inspired so many modern day FPS games to be what they are now. The story telling, the interactivity, the level design. It all just blends together really well. Definitely give this game a try but I have to give you a warning and it's that some things in this game didn't age too well such as the graphics and some of the gameplay (but that should be expected when you're about to play a 24 year old game)"
6587,bro its half life so what do you think?
6588,you're not a warcriminal if there's no more military to judge you.
6589,"Hello, Gordon! Look Gordon: ropes - we can use these to jump pits!"

6595,da classic
6596,"i once knew a guy that had half life in his name, but after that day i never saw him again and i wonder if anyone will see him ever again and over the years we started to ponder to if he ever existed at all. if he was ever a real person, telling us about the stories of half life and its complicated lore, we all will remember his legacy and his loyality to the half life series of games and at the end i will recommend this game to my friends and also my future family and everyone i see on the street to spread and legend of halflifethegame."
6597,It's ok
6598,"haha silent protag goes shooty-shooty with pew-pew guns

For serious though, this's a classic game that's held up fairly well considering it was released back in the 90s, and is still spoken of as being one of the best shooters. This was Valve's first step into the gaming world, and it was big success. Ez recommend."
6599,its ok
6600,gud
6601,Pure Classic. If you haven't got to know this game. It is high time you familiarised yourself with this icon of videogaming.
6602,"My childhood game, I remember it taking steam to download this game for an hour or two.  Still a classic to my eyes.  If you like the old classic games where a lot of weapons in inventory is not straying away from ""realism"" then this game is for you"
6603,"Half life was a growing up game that was played by a lot and brings back a lot of memories, fun game and a must play"
6604,"While I am recommending HL, I didn't play it until after playing HL2 and some HL2 mods.  Had I played HL before HL2, I probably wouldn't have tried HL2.  HL is glitchy...  the basic settings cause you to bounce up when climbing ladders, move too far when jumping from place to place, get stuck in walls, snag and get stuck on stairway banisters.  It gets very frustrating.  When it plays smoothly, it's fun but difficult even in easy mode.  I kept getting stuck in levels and not able to find my way out, until I finally decided to find a walk-thru to follow and put myself in god mode so I didn't die all the time.  HL2 is far superior in graphics and story.  Even Black Mesa is far superior...  however, if you really want a challenge, go for it, but if you have never played any of the HL games, do not let it stop you from progressing to the other games in the series.  Do yourself a favor though, have a walk-thru ready because you will no doubt find yourself running in circles and getting frustrated."
6605,crow bar sim. thats really fun
6606,half life fun
6607,It's half life
6608,This game is a classic! If you don't know then you need to play it and discover the history of a real groundbreaking FPS. The graphics might not hold up by today's standards but the gameplay and storyline definately do.
6609,very good would play again
6610,its good and then it bites your nutsack in the last chapter

6622,Yes!
6623,"This game haunts me. Playing it I was like ""yeah this is okay"" (although I did feel bad shooting every security guard for their ammo), but the more time passes, the better this game gets. Maybe but it on sale though. 10/10"
6624,The storyline is very good yes and i would rate it a certified hood classic
6625,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtFys_syS18
6626,Fun game
6627,"This is the game that manages to create an immersive and intriguing world without cutscenes or extensive dialogue. The game with a variety of gameplay throughout each chapter, ensuring that it feels fresh the whole game. The game that started it all. I see why it is so beloved now."
6628,"Funny 1998 game, can bhop 1000 miles per hour, crowbar is best melee. 10/10 game"

6641,"It's like 3 games of luck in a trenchcoat posing as a game of skill. Its logo should appear in the dictionary next to the word ""overrated.""

Edit: Now that I've beaten the game I'd like to clarify: it still sucks. Mechanically, Quake handled both shooting and platforming better about 2 years before this came out. In terms of puzzles, it tends to rely on patience and trial and error more than actual wit and creativity. I even enjoyed Dark Souls 2 and this game still had too many cheap deaths for me. I wholeheartedly resent that this put Valve on the map."
6642,"The original HL is much less buggy than the Source version, and imo looks better anyway."

6661,"This game really has not aged well at all, and i'm the kind of guy that loves old retro games like halo or portal 1 and 2. I get it was impressive at the time of release, but i struggled to get through the game by today's standards. It also did not help that it is not uncommon to see glitches that you will have to reset a save for. I personally had around 5-7 glitches i had to soft reset the game for during the 12 hrs i played. People site half of this games charm is the storytelling and it's not so hit on the head approach to it but i think again, portal did a 10 times better job at this.  I,m looking forward to go into the second game as that seems to have aged much better but, i would like the wipe my hands clean of this broken mess of a classic. P.S.When i finished the game and after the credits rolled it did not boot me to a menu or kick me out of the game like portal does. Is this a part of the game? i honestly can not tell if its another glitch or part of the game and i'm not going back to play the final level just to find out."
6662,one of my favorite games of all time :D

6668,pro
6669,"This game is great because of the ultimate freedom it gives you. E.g. you can attack your allies if you don't like them. You can finish the whole game in half an hour, or you can take many hours. Etc."
6670,fordon greeman
6671,i dont get anything what is going on
6672,"Awesome game, def one of my favorites"
6673,"I don't know how people like this game, forced myself to play through the first couple of chapters, had to constantly consult walkthroughs as the maps are extremely confusing and don't show you where to go at all. Combat is bad, even though you're apparently supposed to not rush through everything with a shotgun (like you mostly do in Half Life 2 and it's episodes) I found that even trying to do this I would still end up as injured as I did ""calculating"" how to defeat enemies. Half life 2 and it's episodes are great, but Half life 1 isn't."
6674,holy fuck this game is hard

6683,"So, I was playing like a scientist, and it was all cool, then shit got reeeaaaaal funky and I got a gun."
6684,"100%

Seriously are you even ***ing reading this? Lol life sucks exactly because they didn't make more games following this design principle."
6685,best shooting game ever
6686,yes
6687,"No doubt people have not heard of this game, and the remake is just as good.  Impressive for a game that was released so long ago."
6688,"Can't say anything against the singleplayer, it's still one of the best SP shooter campaigns around. Multiplayer really sucks though. You're going to find out that the dumbest weapons are the most powerful, so be ready to encounter idiots who are camping with crossbow from some sh*thole and you won't even know where they're doing it from, because that thing instagibs without any trace (and also can be scripted to simplify aiming and pressing two buttons into one keypress), or gauss r*tards who will be shooting literally every possible corner and wall because that way the wallgauss damage radius increases a multiple times. Gets even worse when they bind literally every weapon to exist in game to keys and then spam these in absolutely idiotic patterns like shotgun - RPG - MP nade within few ms.
Percentage of people using weapons that actually require some kind of skills like prediction, trajectory calculation, or just really good aim (examples include handgrenades, hivehand (secondary attack), satchels (no spam + blocking + camping), snarks (no brainless spam as well), RPG without laser) is close to zero. It's EXTREMELY unlikely that you'll ever find someone who really uses their thinking abilities while playing this game because nobody ever bothers when they can go ""haha gauss go for 20 frags per minute"". Except that's no fun, but 90% of HLDM's community is so dumb they couldn't even care
So, shortly: if you're looking for healthy strategic competition that doesn't consist of flat gauss - crossbow - shotgun pattern while all the most sweet features are rarely ever exploited, you won't find it here. Move along."
6689,is nice
6690,Very fun game can run on any computer.
6691,good old times
6692,"I can appreciate this game as a mark in history, a game that changed the FPS genre forever, and as a speedrun. I CANNOT, however, appreciate it fully nowadays. It's extremely dated in more ways than one, and the gameplay itself really hasn't stood the test of time. If you're looking to play an old classic, then pick it up and give it a try. Chances are, you'll be frustrated out of your mind by the time you're almost done.
If you want the Half-Life experience without pulling your hair out over the million different ways that you can get stuck/softlocked without the save-->load feature, I recommend trying Black Mesa. It's a fan remake of the original game that's a thousand times better than the original, all-around a better experience than playing Half-Life."
6693,"Definitely play on easy for maximum enjoyment. Can be unrewarding at times. Still, fun!"
6694,"the story and gameplay is god tier, and if you get bored of playing the campaign, you can always have lots of fun on deathmatch"

1. The Story. While playing the game I fell in love with the story, the characters, and the lore in general. The story is probably the most important part of this game. The mysteries, lore, characters, and story really make this game stand out from others.

2. The Combat. What else can I say, the combat in this game is very smooth and satisfying, The guns in this game feel loud and powerful to shoot, and give the player a sense of power while in combat.

3. Level Design. While it can be bad sometimes, for the most part the level design in this game is excellent. You can tell the developers put a lot of time into setting the mood for every area in the level. Which transitions to my next point:

4. The Atmosphere. This game's atmosphere is great. The developers definitely put in a lot of time perfecting the lighting and environment for every area in this game. 

Now there are a couple things wrong with this game, it's not perfect by ANY means.

1. Level Design. I know I just praised this game's level design but sometimes it really sucks. Like in chapters such as 'On a Rail' and especially the last 4 chapters, 'Xen', 'Gonarch's Lair', 'Interloper', and 'Nihilanth' being definitely the WORST part of the game.

2.Graphics. I know this game was made in 1998 but the graphics don't hold up well. If you wan't better graphics, check out 'Black Mesa' on Steam. Other than that, the game comes with HD models from one of the games two expansion packs, ""Half-Life: Blue Shift"". Apart from the HD models looking ugly, they just don't fit the game's style well. There is one way to remove them, which is by going into your game files and deleting the ""valvehd"" folder.

Half-Life is a great game, and just because there are some things wrong with it doesn't mean you should not buy this. Like I said, this is a must play and one of my favorite games ever. 
I give Half-Life a solid 9.5/10.

6728,"Although the story is amazing, Easy mode is not what I expected. I thought ""easy"" meant ""not hard"", but apparently that's not the case. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it's certainly not what I expected. But, if it wasn't hard, it'd be kind of boring. Great game!"
6729,"Half Life still is as effective as it was back then. Game is still an immersive and geniusly crafted masterpiece and beats even most of the modern linear, story driven fps games. 

Xen though sucks donkey ass."
6730,What about a Full Life hmm?
6731,POGGERS
6732,"Do you have a PC? Do you have any interest in gaming? Then you should probably play Half-Life. Half-Life is one of those games that you kind of have to play before you die:) It may not be the timeless masterpiece people make it out to be, but what you do get is a really lengthy game with a strong focus on singleplayer. And when you've finished the original game there's literally hundreds of mods to explore. Enjoy! #bm_sts"
6733,I already finished this game so yeah moving on to OF and BS
6734,"""You do not need to read all this. You are a highly trained player. We have assured Valve that nothing will go wrong."""
6735,its a all time classic 10/10
6736,Good Game not for gaming pansies tho. This was from the days when games were actually hard even on Easy.
6737,"I forgot just how good of a game this is. Even though Black Mesa exists, it's nice to return to the original. This was one of my first dives into the PC gaming world, so I have a lot of nostalgia with this game."
6738,Incredible

6742,"This game is fantastic and still holds up to day. It gives me Zelda OOT vibes with the amount of care that was put into this. This is why Half Life, to this day, is still called one of the greatest games ever made"
6743,its good

6748,"Play it, but it's not THAT good. The story leading into HL2 ends up really confusing, the gunplay can be unforgiving, even on lower difficulties (I played on Normal.) There's some mods out there that add bunnyhopping back in, which is cool."
6749,"classical game,but for me this game is unplayable, I will feel Dizzy in 15min and die for unknow reason, maybe will play that unofficial remaster version after finish half life 2"

6791,"A classic sci-fi shooter. The gameplay is good, the graphics were good for their time and the story was interesting. I wasn't into the game as a kid since we all played Counter Strike and other games. I didn't even know that when you instal CS you get this as well. Always thought it was just a mod for multiplayer. When I found out that I was wrong I gave this game a shot. It was good but I wasn't amazed by it.

6805,"[h1] Half-Life: An FPS Classic [/h1]
[b]Introduction to Half-Life[/b]
Half-Life is about a scientist named Gordon Freeman who has to survive aliens and military soldiers after an experiment goes horribly wrong, transporting various types of aliens to several facilities that Gordon will visit during the course of the game. This is the general, simplified plot of Half-Life.
The story for this game isn't told in traditional cutscenes, instead being presented through NPC dialogue and part of the gameplay as well. The story in general is interesting and stays solid throughout the campaign.

[b]Half-Life's Gameplay and Features[/b]
The gameplay is definitely the best part of this game though. The gun animations are solid, each weapon feels right, and they are mostly balanced. Though I have to say, the magnum and crossbow are some of the more OP weapons. Each type of enemy AI is easy to learn and can be taken out with almost any weapon Gordon has on him, but certain enemies later in the game can get a little annoying to deal with at times. 
Gordon can also encounter scientists and security guards, both of which can follow him around as allies, but they aren't of much help, so most of the journey is done solo. Scientists aren't really good for much else than opening up a locked door or two. Security guards have the same ability as scientists and they can attack enemies for you, but they only have a pistol. Gordon's allies aren't very durable either, so don't expect them to last long in a fight.

Aside from the gunfights, this game also has platforms to cross and puzzles to solve (Platforming in an FPS of all games, sounds crazy doesn't it?) You don't see that in FPS games nowadays. Most of the platforming sections this game throws at you aren't all that bad and can be jumped easily, though there are some parts that will require some more precise movements. Puzzles are also fairly easy to solve, but there was a couple that stumped me for a good while. While they were unexpected, the platforming and puzzle sections in this game give Half-Life a unique sense of identity, making it more unique than other games in the genre.

[b]The length of the original Half-Life[/b]
One playthrough of Half-Life's singleplayer campaign will take an average of 12 hours to complete. It's shorter than most games out there, but honestly, I thought the campaign had a decent length. Not too short to leave me unsatisfied, but also not too long to feel dragged out. 
There are mods for this game that can extend the playtime for those who want more out of a game over 2 decades old. Regardless of Half-Life's age, you can't go wrong with that enticing $10.00 price tag.

[b]Rating: A Half-Life worth experiencing.[/b]
To sum up, Half-Life is an innovative FPS with platforming and puzzle sections included. The story is compelling, and the gameplay is without a doubt, the best part of what this game has to offer. 
This game is a must buy for anyone with a Steam account. If you don't already have it, I strongly recommend you do get it in order to experience a classic that builds a fascinating world which is expanded upon in the sequel and Half-Life expansions: Opposing Force and Blue Shift.
I'd rate Half-Life at an 8/10. While the game has aged after 2 decades of its release, its aged like a fine wine."

6809,very nice shot things
6810,"Would I recommend Half-Life? Does a bear shit on the pope? The answer to both of these questions is: You bet your big ass. I was a wee boy when this and Rob Halford came out. Heck, I don't think I'd heard of it until first playing it in 2006. I loved it then and still do, having just beaten it, and this game too, in 2021 as of typing this. You play as Morgan Freeman, a silent scientist dude entering a research facility, where shit quickly hits the fan and aliens invade the place. You know how it is.

Armed at first with the iconic crowbar, you must escape, along the way fighting these aliens, and marines also jumping in to hunt you down. It reminds me of Rambo, in that you're a one-man army blasting your way through all these blokes with their machine guns and grenades and helicopters and whatnot. There's a nice selection of standard weapons for you to pick up. The explosives are my favourite. They blow things to bits. And then there's a few alien weapons.

Where it really shines is with it's immersive feel, using a seamless narrative viewed entirely by the player's point of view, and scripted events, all of which were revolutionary for the time and have inspired countless games that have also used these features. Here's looking at you, Call of Duty. Exploring teeny areas like vents and tunnels and solving puzzles is pretty satisfying too. Although the infamous Headcrabs (crawling vaginas with teeth and claws) tend to hide round corners in those dinky places and jump at you. They're bitches. And quite scary at times. Especially when they're latched onto a now-zombified scientist, coming after your ass.

Graphics and special effects have of course come on leaps and bounds in the last 23 years, but these were bum good for back then, and not too distractingly bad to look at now. At least not for me. I'm not down with the kids and their 4Ks and their 60fps thingymajiggies. There aren't many character models in it though, and you'll see the same Chris-Whitty-and-Albert-Einstein looking-ass scientists throughout.

The last section, where you exit the facility and teleport to the alien world of Xen (spoiler alert) is probably the weakest and disjointed part, with awkward death defying platforming (I died A LOT. Thank G-man for autosave) and a boss called Gonarch, who is a giant crab thing with a massive ballsack and shoots cum at you. Anyway, I haven't played the finally-finished fan remake Black Mesa yet, but if it goes on sale you can bet your Big Billy Bass (that's Louisiana slang for Ass, probably) I will get it.

6971,"Half-Life. Such a amazing masterpiece by Valve. In today's state of gaming with new consoles, hardware, etc. Half-Life one is still, still! Not outdated, it may seem like it, but for right now, it's an amazing game I recommend you playing! For the graphics, they're still decent for today, even though Half-Life 2 is a entire upgrade for graphics. As the story of Half-Life. You're playing as a typical male figure ""Gordon Freeman."" Trying to survive and escape his way out of Black Mesa. The story may-be short, boring, or not even worth your time! But! The gameplay is the main reason why I still play Half-Life one. Like always, always remember..

Run.               Think.           Shoot.                Live."
6972,"Quite honestly, this was one of the most enjoyable experiences that I've had with a video game. I'm new to gaming, and being stubborn and an overachiever at times, I decided that beginning this game on hard difficulty was the way to go. That was a regrettable decision. Nevertheless, the game was still immensely fun. 

The story itself is not particularly deep, but the seemingly deliberate ambiguity of the plot left me thinking. With regards to the gameplay, I have no major complaints; in fact, the only objections I might have are sticking in place while turning valves in-game (which is rather sad for the ""Valve"" game development company) and having trouble climbing ladders, but otherwise I never had a bug. The graphics are not top-of-the-line, of course, but that said, the environment still feels real and immersive; the lighting in this game is particularly good. All in all, I'd happily recommend this game to whoever wants to start gaming with the classics: it's fun, fast, and still pulls its weight after twenty three years. Good job, Valve! I look forward to trying your sequel."
6973,Great game! deserves its classic status. both expansion packs are fun too!
6974,"Despite being clunky, having soo many loading screens, and having rather dated graphics, this game is still a blast to play through! Being a relative noob to PC, I just finished my first playthrough of Half-Life. I usually play on medium difficulty but even so this classic proved challenging especially in Xen. The aforementioned problems with the game don't take away too much from the game other than being frustrating on occasion, but usually rather add a little charm to let you know that this is a pretty old game. I thought that the story was enjoyable and did a great job of environmental and spoken storytelling. The weapon and enemy variation ensured that there was never a dull moment. The puzzles were generally fun and the overall gameplay had enough variation throughout the different levels that kept things fresh. The soundtrack provided a brilliant atmosphere when trying to make the air uneasy or make the action intense. In conclusion, I think that the fact that most components of this game still stand the test of time is reason enough to give it a playthrough for its low price."
6975,"I fucking love this game, I can go to it countless times and still find something new not to mention the different expansions and deathmatch. It's a fun test of skill and brains in some cases, you really are forced to adapt and stratergise with the weapons you have. Very fun and rewarding experience"

6996,This game has a great story.
6997,"Half-Life is an amazing title in many ways. Not only has it been influential to gaming as a whole but it made developers and players rethink how stories in that kind of media could be told. Half-Life plays into gaming's biggest strength, being interactive. Everything experienced in the game is first hand, it doesn't make you feel like your playing as someone, it makes you feel like you are that someone. Gordon Freeman is silent allowing for the player to think on their own and discover the story for themselves as it pieces together. It makes this game immersive in a way that even in present day, I hadn't experienced before. Every bit and piece of the story is seen and experienced by you first hand, no third person dialogue, or even cutscenes. This game tells a compelling story of a scientist who's experiment has gone terribly wrong and is now just trying to escape Black Mesa Research Facility with his life. The story is full of mysteriousness and twists and it's something that any gamer must play at least once in their life. The gunplay is extremely fun and holds up still today even when compared to modern day shooters. It amazes me how I became so attached to a silent protagonist but yet I did,  and after I finished the game I was ready to start it all over again. Half-Life spawned many games like Counter Strike and for that I am very thankful, as Counter Strike is one of my favorite games. The multiplayer in this game as well is so much fun, especially with some friends. It is replayable and addicting and I would definitely recommend it. The only real fault in this game for me is the final stage on the alien homeworld Xen. This stage felt rushed and lacked content. I really wish they had put just a little more effort into Xen, as that would just be the cherry on top. Other than that however, Half-Life in my opinion is one of the greatest gaming masterpieces of all time. I give it a 9.5/10"

And the way you are forced to play very cautiously is just amazing - after all Gordon is not a soldier, he's a scientist with PhD in Physics, you can't go guns blazing to the enemies. You have to run, you have to hide, you have to sneak and if you try to play as if you're the strong guy, you lose. I really appreciated that aspect of the game."

7029,I've heard great things about this game but it just isn't fun. Getting through it is a chore. The weapons don't feel very good. The enemies behave unpredictably and don't react to getting shot. The worst part is when the game kills you for stepping on the wrong spot and makes you fall.

7037,I play multiplayer deathmatch and its fun. And it runs great on my laptop.
7038,"Still a good game after all these years. Single player is better than multi; story and gameplay still holds up. 
Multi is a biy dated."

7044,"The game that made the genre!

Half-Life came out in 1998, and yet its still one of the most entertaining and original games around, with new mods coming out every day.

There's just something so un-quantifiably nostalgic and beautiful about the dingy corridors of Office Complex. 

I would credit this game for my appreciation of all things Wabi-sabi, being able to explore abandoned buildings and find beauty in the schadenfreude of urban decay.

I also credit this game to getting me into the mod scene, hammer editor taught me the basics of level design.

All said, Half-Life is a large part of the person I am now, and has stained the glasses I use to view the games industry.

I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone who has a computer and a few bucks to spare.

                                                          -L.C.S"
7045,It is THE game... What else can I say!?
7046,"very good game, shaped my entire childhood with CS1.6.
Thank you very much. the developers of the game are awesome."
7047,"My only issue with black mesa or hl1 is the five-minute long introduction.
I restart this game way too much."
7048,meh
7049,"played it for free back in 2020 when all half life games were free before HL: A's release, pretty fun."
7050,Yes
7051,graphics are shit. 15/10
7052,"Good game, can't wait to play the second and third"
7053,Classic Game too Play..!!..
7054,"Great shooter game, worth playing at any age. Despite the graphics, it holds up decently well and the shooting mechanics are SUPER FUN if you dont have a problem with going fast, Taking this game slow is a surefire way to die.

pros
Fast paced combat
Easy to navigate level
fun and new enemies & levels to explore
Secrets and lore

Cons
Slidy movement
THE CART SECTION

7055,"Its a classic game, the gameplay still holds up decently well."
7056,oh yeah play it baby
7057,dewrf
7058,Awesome game with nice storyline tho I never really played it before so I kinda shit myself when I was playing throught it and I don't think I can continue tbh but yeah very nice game
7059,"One of the absolute FPS-classics. I both played it ""normal"" as well as practiced to do a speedrun. The story is legendary, the graphics fine. Obviously the game mechanics are no longer ""up-to-date"" but that is totally fine for me."
7060,"Apparently Gman will see me uphead, Not if i get there first!"
7061,pretty good
7062,POGGERS
7063,If you don't already own this game you're making a mistake. If it's on sale buy it. If it's not on sale buy it. Just buy it. You won't regret it.
7064,half life made shooters evolve classic nostalgic i mean its half life theres not much more to say
7065,"A classic from 1998 that revolutionized first-person shooters. Play through the main game, filled with action and puzzle-solving. Bored of that? Play Multiplayer, fast-paced Quake-style deathmatch, thinking fast is the key to survival. Bored of that? Well, Half-Life is very moddable, letting you see other maps and entire games people have created. Bored of that? Half-Life's source code and modding tools are Public, so you're welcome to make your own modifications. Bored of that? Well... I can't really help you then. Still, you should get the point, you can do a lot with this game, so it's worth the small fee to play it."
7066,Ashe
7067,Crowbar power!
7068,"A classic. The graphics and controls have aged a bit, but this game holds up remarkably well. Still a captivating game."
7069,Still holds up after so long.
7070,WOAAAAAAWWWWWW VERY NICEEEEEEEEEEE
7071,good level design
7072,Ive Mostly Played Half Life 2 on The First Xbox And Half LIfe 1 Does Not Dissapoint And Half Life 2

7085,"Really fun game from the current progress I am at, only problem is how I can be continiously killed because of either having low HP and ammo which makes me struggle when having to revert back to older save files just to get past the level."
7086,"Fun game, difficult sometimes.
Game was a fun experience but some parts get very difficult. Many times you survive a fight and are left at low health just for the next part killing you on loop because you don't have enough health to proceed. On one part a sniper cannot die so you need to take the damage and move on, but if you don't have the health to do it you have to load a much older save.  Despite that I never felt like it was the game's fault that I was struggling.
In summary, game is bullshit, but not unfair."
7087,.
7088,"I'm known by my primary Steam account here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoeJama/. I own this game in my alternate account, the one I'm using to write this review.

I played this game back in...late 2019? Well, that doesn't really matter -- what matters is that I wish I had made a review about my UNDYING LOVE for this game sooner. I remember hearing about how good this game was until I thought, ""Okay, I gotta play this game...like, NOW."" I can truly say that I don't regret spending even a cent on this game one bit. Though the graphics are a little outdated, the game mechanics are very good and the story/plot is VERY intriguing. Everything about this game, from the different worldly settings and unique characters to the broad story line, is awesome and very well-made. I truly admire how Valve's employees really wanted to kick off their growing company by making such an immersive game. Thank you for helping me see the ""great beyond"" in its true reality, Valve! Great work on this game! :)"

7091,"Deserving of the praise it gets. While some things in the game haven‚Äôt aged well, it is still worth playing. I easily recommend this game to any FPS fan."
7092,Yes I play Half Life how could u tell?
7093,game
7094,Top
7095,Half life is rated M for Masterpiece
7096,"gorman freeshman in the fresh
"
7097,i like to play this game in under 50 minutes.
7098,"Very immersive game with a great story which was Valve's first game and first hit game. It's so good that I think it still holds up today even though the graphics would suggest otherwise.

Along with Quake, it is regarded as one of the most influential FPS games because of the amount of mods that the game inspired as well as the way Half-Life immerses the player with small amounts of dialogue, it's great story and the lack of cut scenes.

The Steam version of Half-Life also includes a high quality graphics pack which changes the view model and weapons which is a neat addition for anybody who wants it.

I highly recommend playing Half-Life at least once."
7099,Its a Great game
7100,i just love the game with expanded arsenal weapons
7101,"The game holds up really well for being so old. Fun gameplay, level design, and a very interesting story."
7102,"I can understand why people consider this game to be one of the best FPS off all time. I want more FPS or shooters like this. I don't what it is called but I call it a Tactical Puzzle Horror Shooter. Love it. To anyone who sees this review, please recommend me some FPS or shooter that play like this."
7103,"It alright, totally isnt influential
"
7104,GGG
7105,"Awesome and accessible to this day. This game when it came out showed what could be done for story telling in a first person shooter. The fact that it's still playable to the average person today shows it was really well designed. Play this, then Black Mesa to play it with an updated engine and Graphics."
7106,good
7107,:) gun go shoot shoot
7108,Finally a game i can run at 60 FPS. 10/10
7109,"This game is a legend of 1990s as it was marked as a revolution of FPS game at the time. More details were noticeably added to polygon graphic along with more actions performable by characters, including mouth movement while talking. Enemy soldier AI had also become revolutionarily smarter as they were able to take cover when underfired and to dodge grenade when tossed.

Many parts of the game may be dulled as this game is all about survival, pathfinding and fighting monsters. Occasional combats against enemy military soldiers do add more challenge and excitement to the game.

Even though new players are advised to play the remake version, Black Mesa: Definitive Edition, alternatively for better experience on the same storyline, this original version has already been remembered by old timers as one of legends."
7110,its half life.
7111,remember to play half life
7112,"One of the best fps ever made, Its just unbelievable to think that 5 years after the original doom game was this."
7113,Classic
7114,"A true classic. Graphics haven't aged well, but the game play is still pure and true."
7115,"Its half life and its even now passes the trial of time in 2021.
Gameplay solid.
Rare save bug check.
Story telling ok.
Graphics still look ok.
"
7116,funny b hop
7117,my mommy says not to say bad words ok thanks
7118,Still a fantastic game after 23 years. It says I have about 140 hours because the game for some reason the game wont stop running but I don't really mind. This is definitely a game everybody should play.
7119,Really good game if your using a potato laptop
7120,freeman's bloody goated on the sticks
7121,really fun
7122,"Half-Life is great. While most of my hours are on the box set, I can safely say that the port to Steam has not affected it in any way. If you want a true Half-Life experience, then this is it. I personally prefer it to the HL2 series, as it focuses more on story and puzzles than simply showing off the latest physics. With a great military vs Aliens vs Scientist plot and so many unique levels, it has plenty of replayability without becoming boring or repetitive. Even something like the difficulty option changes how the AI acts. It's a good example of a game that can be hard without feeling unfair or infuriating. If you want to get into story based single-player games, this is probably it."
7123,"run, think, shoot, live.

good game, aged well and is quite fun
"
7124,make sure to play halaf-life
7125,"Half Life was one of the first quality shooters that I enjoyed. Not only were the graphics great, for it's time, but the story was fantastic. This is one game that I will never forget. I still enjoy playing this game 30 years after first release!"
7126,"it's truly a gaming y'all need to play if you we're too younger to play it as a kid. screw good graphics, screw decent audio, y'all youngsters need to play it"
7127,One of my favorite games ever made.  Still incredibly fun 20+ years later.
7128,"My 2nd favourite game of all time, surpassed only by HL2."
7129,VERY good game
7130,An amazing game. There isn't anything that I can say that hasn't been said so many times already

7147,nep nep
7148,"game play is honestly kinda boring. Only a few fun guns that you get hardly any ammo for. AI is fun to fight most of the time, with a few exceptions. The last half of the game sucks, at least to me. Play it if you want to experience an important part of gaming history, but not much to write home about honestly."
7149,good
7150,Greatest game of all time.
7151,The game that started it all.

7154,When people say classic they mean it.
7155,poggers must play
7156,"Love it, classic game and definitely worth it."
7157,masterpeice
7158,Still worth a play (although it has been mostly superseded by Black Mesa); only drawback that I've noticed compared to HL: Source is that guards and scientists seem to stop following you more often in this release (only truly noticeable in Office Complex).
7159,"I've literally completed HL2, Ep1, Ep2, Lost Coast, Opposing Force, Half-Life Alyx... but not this one."
7160,"this game is actually impossible for me to beat because i suck at it but its good so you should buy.

edit: i beat it it was cool and good"
7161,awesome game
7162,Best game on steam
7163,Classic
7164,I think Half Life is a pretty cool guy. Eh fights aleins and doesnt afraid of anything.
7165,"Really good game. I never really played a lot of story FPS titles but this was a pretty sweet experience. I look forward to playing more titles from this series in the future, especially seeing how (I imagine rightfully) beloved it is. The gameplay is quick-paced and keeps you on your toes a lot of the time (hallways collapsing, enemies spawning right in front of you to try and shoot you down) and incorporates another thing I really like in video games: parkour (and also didn't make it hell ;w;). If you like fighting human soldiers, aliens AND zombies, guess what? This game has all of those out to get you. Not only that, but the friendly NPCs make the levels feel a lot less lonely, and help you out when you're in a pinch. In terms of sound design, most if not all sound clips in this game convey something clearly -- explosions sound like explosions, a scientist screaming means there must be some kind of level hazard or enemy ahead, etc. Visual design is also, while mutually outdated, pretty damn good for a game that came out only a year after Sonic R. The people look like people, and the aliens look like aliens. Soldiers look like soldiers, and aren't easily confused with Black Mesa's guards.

7183,"I may be 23 years late on this one, but my god is this game incredible. One of the only games to combine cognitive thinking with good shooting mechanics and a stupendous story which continues on into continuations of the series. Every possible element of this game exceeds all expectations for something pre-2000s It's not required that you play this before Half-Life 2, and I'm not sure how far I would go to recommend doing so. In all likelihood you have spoiled yourself to the general story of Half-Life, but that does not stop any of the games from being incredibly fun, especially for their price tag."

7189,"TL;DR - Overall, I like this game. I really, really, really hate most of it, but I do recommend it. I think absolutely EVERYONE should play this game at some point in their ""gaming career.""

I want to start by saying that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that after 10 hours of slogging my way through this game, although I DO recommend it, I can't say I enjoyed myself.

Most of my issues with the game stem from the fact that it feels like Gordon is TRYING to get himself killed. What's that? You fell 10 feet? That's 15 health, down the drain. Did you step in a puddle of radioactive goop that you couldn't avoid, no matter how hard you tried? Sorry, that's 10 health that you've just lost. There are far too many instances where it feels like you're forced to take damage, and it only makes the experience more frustrating as a result. There's slippery terrain, radioactive puddles, lightning shooting out of the walls, pipes spewing hot gas at you, and giant green claw-things that are a nightmare to get around. For how strange and slippery Gordon's movement is, there sure are a LOT of instances of movement being needed to progress. Jumping segments, walking across tight pathways that are way too easy to fall off of, trying to jump across a gap but falling into it instead, falling into water and other dangerous liquids, etc.

Controls aside, I didn't enjoy the combat that much either. Shooting the enemies, namely the soldiers, feels actually pretty great, but they'll almost always gun you down before you can even fire off ten bullets, unless you're willing to sacrifice a third of your health while you shoot them. The headcrabs are hard to hit, the snipers and sheltered turret-soldiers CANNOT be killed unless you have explosives, the tanks vary from imposing to laughable, the minefield segments make me want to break my hand, and overall there are just so many instances of having to save preemptively, before proceeding to die 20 times before taking out every enemy and saving again not even a minute later.

However, although I did not enjoy most of this game, I do think it is great for what Valve had at the time. The most fun I had with the game was listening to the goofy voice acting and watching the unique animations for particular points in the game. I have heard about Half Life for so, so long now, and I can say that I am glad to have played it, not only to see what the hype was about, but also to add it to my library of ""gaming knowledge.""

But despite knowing most every chapter well enough and heard the story thousands of times It is one of my favorite games and one I occasionally revisit even though I had effectively spoiled every aspect of half life, every surprise and drama I enjoyed it because it put me in the shoes of Gordon so well I even found myself thinking as him what life would be like after knowing full well the consciences that unfolded after the fact. Half life is special and earned every bit of acclaim it got and I believe is still worth playing to this day, just remember: you are Gordon Freeman."

7312,"I finally played this game after knowing about it for years, and I am so glad I did. I haven't finished it yet, but I can already tell that this game absolutely slaps. I really regret not playing this sooner. I played Alyx before this, and aside from the graphics, this game completely holds up against modern titles such as Alyx, and it is most definitely better than many other modern AAA titles like The Last of Us 2 and Cyberpunk. Even with the mind-blowing graphics in those games, I would consider this game to be more fun both story-wise and gameplay wise. And the fact that it's not even half a gigabyte is a major bonus. 10/10 would recommend."
7313,One four eyed nerd takes down the majority of the military by himself and then kills space god.
7314,"Yeah, everyone already has this game. Pretty much everyone loves this game. And it's popular for a reason. it's just generally quite fun. there's no particularly unmemorable parts, the shooting is responsive and punchy and the movement is fast and easy to to learn. In the event you somehow don't own this I'd recommend picking it up if, for no other reason, than to experience FPS history."
7315,"Half-Life is really impressive for it's time. The story was pretty shallow but enjoyable. I found myself getting stuck constantly and having to search up walk throughs because I was over thinking everything. You just kind of need to turn your brain off and play. Experienced minimal bugs, and was much longer than I expected for such an old game! Graphics are of course dated, but completely fine. I recommend anyone who is interested to play this classic."
7316,very epic game
7317,"Its half life
"
7318,"Not great. Is it sometimes fun, kinda. It has aged so badly in my opinion. I tried to play it on normal mode and I got my ass handed to me, but it wasn't a ""Oh I need to try better"" kinda way, it was a ""What the hell am I doing wrong?"". It got to the point where I just, didn't want to play anymore. I've tried so many times to play it, but I just can't. I played half life 2 and loved it so much, so it sucks that I can't enjoy this as much."

7324,"So many modern video game tropes and gameplay features can be attributed to this absolutely fantastic and influential title which is more than worthy of its title as the greatest first person shooter of all time. So much of the video game industry was possible because of the breakthrough innovations made by this game. For god's sake, this game practically invented storytelling in a video game! Its fascinating how a 23 year old game has managed to hold up and is definitely leagues above almost all the shooters that succeeded it (Unless you're counting Half-Life 2 and Bioshock) An absolute recommend. You should probably save your money by just buying this game instead of those buggy and un-innovative, so-called AAA titles coming out in this age and use your remaining money to buy the rest of the games in the series. Give us a Half-Life 3 already, Valve! (I know Alyx came out last year, but still)"

It does have some tricky parts in it, but there are many, many walkthroughs of it. If you are the kind of person that cares about the graphics alot, this might not be for you, but keep in mind: this was made in 1998."
7362,"Old, but its so cool. I finished the game twice. There is a lot to explore and a lot of puzzles. For a 98s game, it's amazing. 100% recommend it."
7363,add sex

7365,"Definitely a product of its time, [i]Half-Life[/i] still manages to provide a fun, albeit flawed, experience that's worth your while. Despite some unreliable controls, repetitive sections and boring third act (seriously, it's bad), the intriguing world-building and engaging weapons elevate the gameplay. If nothing else, give it a try to discover how one of gaming's most beloved franchises started out.

7370,"Half-Life is a classic. Smooth controls, fun gameplay, and well balanced challenge. Also, hitting dead bodies to make them explode is 10/10."
7371,I love shooting giant space babies
7372,yes
7373,played for the first time a little while ago and was having such a good time. It was running on my shitbox pretty well and i love being able to run around and look for easter eggs and secret passages
7374,Awesome!
7375,"What is there to say, a true classic, a must buy for fans of the retro fps genre."
7376,This game has so many bugs! It is literally unplayable
7377,"10/10

Masterpiece of its era which is still a blast to play. The gunplay is great, the enemy AI still holds up pretty fine and the uninterrupted story-telling is just the cherry on top of the cake. Personally, I have no complaints with Half-Life except the chapters ""Residue Processing"" and ""Interloper"". I recommend the expansion packs, Half-Life Blue Shift and Half-Life Opposing Force to be played after this and before playing its sequel Half-Life 2."
7378,e
7379,Do I have explain anything about this masterpiece? We all know it's a masterpiece. Has been since those Sierra 1998 days and now. 10/10.
7380,Just paying tribute to one of the GOAT

7410,IT IS GOOD

7412,IT SUCKS
7413,"Played this game for the first time during the lead up to Half Life: Alyx. I really enjoyed it. The atmosphere and audio are very immersive, and I really enjoyed the fast paced action and brain scratching puzzles. Some sections better than others, but when this game is firing on all cylinders, it's a really good time."

7422,"Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Or rather, in the hazard suit. I took the liberty of relieving you of your weapons; most of them were government property. As for the suit, I think you‚Äôve earned it. The borderworld, Xen, is in our control for the time being, thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there. I am impressed. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, Mr. Freeman. I have recommended your services to my employers, and they have authorized me to offer you a job. They agree with me that you have limitless potential. You‚Äôve proved yourself a decisive man, so I don‚Äôt expect you‚Äôll have any trouble deciding what to do. If you‚Äôre interested, just step into the portal and I will take that as a yes. Otherwise...well...I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning. Rather an anticlimax, after what you‚Äôve just survived. Time to choose."

7428,Gordon Freeman
7429,"VERY POG, EVEN IN 2021
"
7430,"I would say I am largely a Half-Life novice as I never played any of the games close to when they came out and I have spent the better part of COVID trying out some of these games to a lot of surprise and joy while questioning how it took me so long to play it.

Half-Life felt like a culmination of a lot of my favorite Valve games with puzzles like Portal, combat like Counter Strike, and just a lot of fun, quirky, weird dialogue, story, and easter eggs that added to my overall experience with the game. I totally understand why Half-Life is so revered and I am glad I was able to experience it without knowing much about it beforehand. If you are on the fence, you definitely won't regret playing this game and it is actually really cool to see the groundwork for where so many Valve properties started."
7431,"Play it. it's awesome and while you at it, play Black Mesa too"
7432,It's half life. Timeless and always fun to play!
7433,"It's really a classic game, but it's dated nowadays.
If you wanna try it, have patience, persistence and remember, google is your ""friend""."
7434,"its a great game
"
7435,"1/2

7436,yo
7437,"Aside from one bug that forced me to skip a section, the game ran flawlessly and made for an excellent experience. I recommend playing on the 'hard' difficulty so you truly feel like a four-eyed scientist facing off against the world's greatest military superpower with only a crowbar."
7438,its ok
7439,"Gordon is a highly trained professional,he doesn't need to consult a review to know that his game is good."
7440,awesome game - a new milestone of game technology - valve <3
7441,Good Game 7.5/10
7442,"Gordon Freeman in the flesh, or rather in the HEM suit"

7448,Its alright
7449,"OK , IM EDITING THIS REVIEW, ITS GREAT.
I LEARNED TO LOVE HALF LIFE.
ITS LIKE TAXI DRIVER, FIRST WALKTHROUGH MIGHT NOT BE GREAT, BUT IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME YOU PLAY IT!!!!!!

im not the sharpest tool on the shed so BigMacDavis helped A LOT,  go check his youtube channel out:
https://www.youtube.com/c/BigMacDavis

game was fun.
gud game"
7450,honestly the game holds up over 20 years later
7451,its fun
7452,"23 Years later,  and it's still a master piece  sure it has some flaws here and there but this is worth the 7.19 dollars out of your wallet as it's a full blown game for a great price the animation and sound effects are great and that's about it  really, still though amazing game after 23 years



10/10"
7453,easiest game I've ever played
7454,"Good game, very difficult because of the old school mechanics but you'll get use to it."
7455,"I like the game.  Gameplay is nice and smooth, but movement is slidey.  So when I'm suddenly under fire, I'll run to hide behind a crate or something, but then I'll slide past it and have to adjust and usually get hit.  sort of annoying.  Another thing: I really, really wish there were more healing items where you could just heal on the spot.  That would be nice.  Other then those 2 things, really like the game.  At the beginning when all the zombie aliens started popping up, I was really jumpy lol.  Like, I'll just be walking around and then I'll hear the creepy skittery noises that the Head Crabs make and I'll be really on edge.  I'll turn a corner and they jump out and you and I'd shoot 5 rounds of my shotgun and miss every shot because I jumped xD.  The game started to settle down with the jump scares when the military showed up tho.  Also, thank the lord that this game has built in save slots because some of the areas can get hard (playing on medium).  Graphics are good?  I think?  Were these good graphics for 1998?  They look good on my new PC tho.  The ending is... kinda weird.  Cuz it's like, ""go into the portal Freemen and fight some aliens!""  And I'm like, ""why do I have to go into the portal?""  ""No time just go!""  ""ok then"".  They don't really explain stuff, y'know?  Also looking forward to seeing more of the guy at the very end, he was interesting.  Overall, good game 8/10.  Looking forward to so called god tier game that's Half-Life 2."
7456,classic
7457,"Although i am glad i played this game, it was ass. I have zero clue how this can be considered one of the greatest games of all time. it was good but very below average. 1. The physics were horrible, one slight press of D and you will go flying to the right to a point of uncontrollability. The map design was sheer and utter Tom-Foolery. This game requires the most outlandish and unthinkable shit. either you drop into a room with nothing but a glock and have to fight 60 vortagons or you have to do something with no queue to figure out. Now to be fair there were some great moments, the first 4 hours are incredible and really makes you feel scared and defenceless in this new alien world but the quality goes down very quickly. Sheer and utter assular garbage"
7458,A classic shooter I enjoyed so much. A masterpiece for his time like doom. The AI is surprisingly impressive but the physics quite slippery (either way I didn't mind as I get used to it). It's worth trying.
7459,it has a crowbar in it
7460,"you don't need drugs with this, this is a drug"
7461,"This must be one of the first games that i can actually remember other than the Pinball game on windows or minesweeper. And i still love to play it today. Infact, im obsessed with the entire universe.  

Play this game and your life will change."
7462,"Masterpiece of a game, for something made in 1998 I didn‚Äôt expect it to be such a great game, but sometimes our eyes can deceive us. Usually i‚Äôm all about graphics but with HL thats a different story. My friends don‚Äôt like the game because apparently it‚Äôs ‚Äòboring‚Äô‚Ä¶ I think not. Anyway, great game and I don‚Äôt see it going anywhere anytime soon so if you want go and check it out :)"
7463,Nothing needs to be said. Its a classic.
7464,"poggers,
the game that started it all. Half-life revolutionised video games and has (apart from the graphics) not felt a day dated since the day that it was released. The story is engaging and a good starting point for the revolutionary game that is half life 2."
7465,mit graduate causes alien invasion. its good
7466,"a masterpiece of a game, being way better than titles in 2021 with advanced ai, superb soundtrack and sound design, timeless graphics and an actual atmosphere"
7467,og
7468,fun game
7469,"(For context, this was my first playthrough of the game, and also one of the first games I've ever played using keyboard and mouse).

Half Life was released in 1999(?) and it definitely shows. The graphics are quite archaic, but remain serviceable nonetheless. The gameplay was the most interesting part for me personally, because it was far more strategic than what I'm used to. While this game is still viewed as one of the defining titles of the FPS genre, I think Its affect on the industry has lessened over time. Not many games uphold this tactical type of gameplay, which does suck, but helps prolong the seldom seen uniqueness of it. I struggled with this game and its many quirks a multitude of times over my entire playthrough because not only does it utilize such a rare form of gameplay (as I mentioned before), I also have not gotten used to keyboard and mouse controls. So this game slowly became a learning experience for me, and that is quite endearing. I'm absolutely more in touch with this control scheme than I was beforehand, and I will always have this game to thank for that.

Honestly, the story is told rather cryptically and any plot elements are either vague, or non-existent. exposition is also rather sparse, which I did appreciate . . . for the most part. I went into this game knowing nothing except Gordon Freeman, G-man, Headcrab, and weird baby I didn't have any context for. I left knowing pretty much the same stuff as before, along with a few smaller details such as Xen, and Black Mesa. I do hope the sequel has a better knack for storytelling than this one (from what I've heard, it does), because this just didn't do it for me.

The design and atmosphere was VERY well done. I was blindsided  by the sudden alien race quickly consuming everything, and I had not anticipated how horror focused some of the chapters are. the earlier chapters were more centered on the grotesque question of ""What is happening?"", with the latter half forming into disturbing wonder at the answer. but it manages to uphold the sci-fi horror tone the whole way through, and I was a big fan of it.

Overall, the game has without a doubt been hampered by the sands of time and the marching forward of its industry, but it still is very much worth playing, and I for one am glad I chose to do so."

7492,"What game, if not this, deserves attention?"
7493,"The game started out really slow for me and it was just hard to get into it since its pretty old and the mechanics just didn't feel right or felt too fast at times. The story was a little hard to grasp for me but it was still plenty of fun traveling through the worlds and following the story. Could be a lot better in today's times but I'm glad that there is a remaster for this game. Also, I really like the arsenal of weapons and the ability to use the developer console which allows you to have your own experience. Recommended if you don't mind old mechanics."
7494,"why did i play this for 47 hours and im only on chapter 7??
because this is the worlds best game"
7495,The game was made in 1998 and i still found an almost full server in the multiplayer mode.
7496,Yes I would recommend! Although the graphics are dated it has a very good story and fun gameplay mechanics. The graphics are good for the time it was made. 10/10 would recommend
7497,"great game, better than Source, better than Black Mesa."
7498,its half life.
7499,"Never got to experience this game when it came out as i was to young and put off playing it for years, going back and playing it in 2021 i can see why Half life was such a big deal.The controls are good tho platforming is a little janky, level design is also pretty good especially considering when it was made with decent progression throughout the game with new weapons along the way. 


The game has aspects that definitely make it feel dated.Anyone who plays more modern games may be at a bit of a loss during some levels though slow pacing and unclear objectives at times the last section of the game is by far the fastest and i found it a little difficult to figure out where to go next a little difficult at times.

Definitely worth a play if you want to play the Original Tho id recommend Black Mesa more going on as its age is starting to show.

7542,hell there morgan
7543,"6.1 hrs on record. Don't trust that, its clearly wrong haha.

Half-life is what started it for me. Yeah, sure, I could say Doom is what started PC gaming for me (and of course you can't forget Quake, Wolfenstein, Redneck rampage, etc) but Half-Life is what locked me firmly in place.

I still think of the times back then when I used to wake up at 6am on a Saturday to play some Half-Life and Starcraft and watch Pokemon. That feeling is something that I can't replicate today. Perhaps its nostalgia but that carefree feeling of being a kid and enjoying such an insane game is one of my fondest memories of growing up.

Not only was the single player insane to my ten year old mind back then but the countless mods that spawned because of this game and the fun times I had.. Some that immediately come to mind:

Pirates, Vikings and Knights
Vampire Slayer
Battlegrounds
The Specialists
Brainbread

The list is long and goes on and on. Yeah yeah, don't worry. I didn't forget about CS. That's reserved for it's own review. I still have floppy disks filled with updates, skin packs and bots that I downloaded from csnation. Any of you remember counter-crap? RzE? Rizzuh? Lungfish? The infamous [myg0t] cheating clan that'd you'd occasionally run into? :P

I recently cycled through some of the older games like Deathmatch Classic, Team Fortress and Day of Defeat. I was pleasantly surprised to see people still playing them. It just goes to show you that Half-Life and any of its mods will continue to stand the test of time.

Lord Gaben, I am who I am today because of you. I wish you good health and a long life. Thank you!"
7544,"Probably some of the worst movement controls I've ever encountered. This makes the platform sections (WHY?) a chore to get through. If Gordon moved a tenth slower, I would be more inclined to play it, but I'm not sure I want to play it anymore."
7545,idk
7546,It's a classic and it can get very puzzling sometimes.
7547,"Absolute pinnacle of FPS adventure titles. And somehow, the sequels only added to it."

7553,"This game is to say the least okay. Not too bad but not the best. In terms of graphics it‚Äôs fine for 1998 but in terms of gameplay it gets fun and challenging in some parts but in more parts than I‚Äôd like it‚Äôs boring and slow. In terms of story, it‚Äôs extremely fast paced and hard to follow. But I don‚Äôt want to discourage new people from getting into the Half Life series this game, despite its flaws it‚Äôs an okay start to a good series, I really do recommend playing the other games and this one too if your thinking about getting into this series."
7554,"The game that started it all..... 

(the Half-Life series)"
7555,"This was the start of a great franchise - I remember getting stuck in ""Office Complex."" Returning years later, I completed the game in 2-3 days. This is most certainly a titan in gaming history, and should be played again and again and again."

7557,Yes half life is a good game any 90s kid could agree with me that half life was  realiy good it was ahead its time.
7558,"many people hop off straight to half life 2 and ignore this beauty, the Al may be bad but it can result in some pretty funny moments, the game is only about 12 hours long and it's definitely worth the price.

boss baby is in this game. the new movie coming near your cinemas"
7559,"Half Life is an incredible game that is only less popular because of its well-acclaimed sequel, Half-Life 2. Especially considering its age, the fights and the NPC's AIs are incredible, and although the graphics are outdated, it doesn't look like it was made as a small game developer studio's first project in the 1990s.

Real love, care and detail have been put into this game and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. Although there were some frustrating parts, the battle with the Nihilanth was one of the best experiences I have ever had when it comes to gaming.

Buy Half-Life. G-Man will leave you no other choice."
7560,its swag
7561,Game good
7562,10/10 Father of FPS genre and CSGO.
7563,"Playing With mods is Cool, And The Original Is Also Cool Reminding me of Old Times"
7564,"This is not a ""shoot first, think later"" game, you need to approach every situation like how Gordon Freeman (a theoretical physicist) would. If you follow that, it's a very good game.

The last few chapters suck, but everything else in the game is full of different situations with different kinds of enemies that all require first looking at what's around you & using the tools and tactics at your disposal to solve each predicament, and I found almost all of it to be fun & enjoyable (even On A Rail)

Weird take, but I actually really like the graphics in this game. I've always found janky low-poly graphics to be strangely charming and endearing. Obviously, objectively not that great by modern standards but come on. Who even wants hyperrealism anyways? Instead we have goofy looking scientists that make funny noises.

It is for that reason that I highly reccomend DISABLING the HD models in the settings if you buy this game, since they don't really help matters that much (Plus I'm not a fan of what they did to the weapons)

If you haven't played it or tried it before and gave it up, seriously give it another chance. It's very fun if you know how to play it properly."

I'm sure the rest of the science team will gladly help you."
7581,"revolutionary for when it came out, but bruh the controls are so slippery and annoying, especially cause of how many bits require pinpoint precision in your movement. So many times I died simply because I slid off the platform I was on, and it is very annoying. 
Also maybe I'm just a dumbass but very often I didn't know what I was meant to be doing."

7590,Fun Game. I assume you know what you're getting into before playing this.

7592,"Its a classic for a reason!
The Story follows Gordon Freeman, a scientist from the Black Mesa Facility who becomes a part of a science experiment that goes wrong and must try and survive the Aliens that have invaded Earth. The characters in this game are used to move the story along while having their own unique, funny moments. The inclusion and mystery of G-man was very well placed has has immediately become my favourite character in the game. As for the story, its simplistic but effective and the game never breaks away from it throughout its play time. As mentioned before, the mystery of G man and that whole scene that it takes place in gives Half-life more intrigue and leaves players with a greater impression. 
The setting of the Black Mesa Facility and Xen are really well thought out and fully detailed, making the player want to explore everything in front of them, however sometimes i did find myself lost at some points when trying to move to the next area. 
Graphically, even though it may have been the the best for its time, its retro style really gives it a classic feel and is just satisfying to look at. While there is an option for there to be HD textures and reworks of some skins, i would have it in its original state for anyone wanting to get the full experience. 
Sound and Audio are a mixed bag as there will be weird moments for the soundtrack to kick in and kinda takes away from the experience, however the audio choices for the guns, aliens and voice acting in general work really well here, adding that immersion for players to sink themselves into. 
In terms of gameplay, this is some solid, satisfying FPS action that loads can enjoy. You will be mainly be fighting off the aliens which i must say the variety of them is so vast, its impressive for a game like this. There are also human enemies that can pose their own challenge and is a great selection for the player to combat against. The weapon variety as well is amazing ranging from pistols to machine guns to the Tau Cannon which is really fun to use and gives players that freedom to overcome the obstacles that they face. There is also the H.E.V suit that can be charged up to give Gordon more armour against enemy attacks or protecting him from toxic waste which was a nice inclusion. The only problem i really faced was moving into a different area could cause Freeman to clip into the wall and makes the player unable to move, meaning that they would have to restart their game, however due to this being as old as it is, this issue can be put to the side. 
Overall, Half-Life is an amazing experience and fully deserves the cult following that it gained and i would recommend this to anyone who really wants to play a fun first person shooter!"

7635,"Half-Life... Where do I start with this game?

Half-Life 1 was the first game in the series I got my hands on, and my favorite. Guess I'll start off with the obvious.

1. The Approach: Half-Life was unique to FPS games like DooM, Quake, and the Build Engine trilogy at the time. It took time at the start of its campaign to build the characters and the feel of Black Mesa. 
Taking two chapters (Black Mesa Inbound and Anomalous Materials.) To focus on character development, and getting the player into the world that Valve had set up for them. Like watching scientists in the distance run around, getting their work done in the iconic train ride.

2. The Gameplay: Valve wanted the player to feel like they were trapped in a scenario they couldn't control. Like they were just some guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hence why the first Headcrab you encounter is so early you don't even have the Crowbar yet.
Ahh, the Crowbar, the only melee weapon you get throughout Gordon's entire adventure through Black Mesa. This was to enhance that feeling of 'Shit's hit the fan, time to get outta here.'
Moreover, the player's health caps at 100, no higher, no lower. Again, you're not a super-soldier, just a scientist trying to survive.
And most notably at the time. Fall Damage and Reloading. Quake went full 3D. Half-Life went full realism. Reloading was such a novelty at the time, I can think of one other game that had reloading for all of its guns. Marathon.
Fall damage was also a rare thing. The Build Engine had it, but it was negligible. In Half Life, a full 3D game unlike the Build Trilogy, had fall damage make its presence known. Take Blast Pit for example. The map's mostly vertical, and you can't jump from the top floor to the bottom without tanking some large damage. Or right after that chapter in Power Up. There's a pipe before meeting the Gargantuan that can't be lived through on low health, unless the player lands on the table with the medkits.

3. The Story: You should know it by now. You are Gordon Freeman, a Theoretical Physicist working for Black Mesa. A top secret research facility in the middle of the desert in New Mexico.
One fateful day, after being late for work, Gordon begins the usual experiment using an Anti-Mass Spectrometer and a crystal specimen from Xen, the border world. But things go wrong, causing a Resonance Cascade, ripping open a portal to Xen, allowing alien creatures to spill through.
Gordon survives the Cascade itself and fights his way through the facility. Going toe to toe with both the Xen forces, and the HECU, a highly trained group of soldiers sent to kill everyone to cover up Black Mesa's existence.
Gordon finally reaches the Lambda labs, and is sent to Xen by the surviving members of the Science Team there, and slays the Nihlanth, the being holding the portal between Xen and Earth open.
Afterwards, he has an encounter with the G-Man. Whom he had been seeing since his train ride to work when this whole mess started.
Being sent to a recreation of said train. The G-Man offers Gordon a job under his employers. Gordon accepts and is sent into stasis until the events of the second game.
This approach at story through the eyes of someone in the middle of the event was something the gaming idustry had never seen before. Usually it was reading the game's manual, or through on-screen text that lore was presented.
But Valve changed that, and made the game that would shape the way FPS games were done to this very day.

That was a wall of text, but long story short, Buy Half-Life if you haven't already. It's a great game, Immersive and fun, a great experience overall. It has its negatives, (what game doesn't?) But those negatives are outweighed by the positives. Now, ""Have a safe, and productive day.""

7677,A classic must buy
7678,HALF-
7679,when is full life
7680,"playing this game made me go from half life to no life

very good"
7681,the casserole incident
7682,"Couldnt get into it. Game is purly for nostalgia reasons at this point. Not my cup of tea, its too dated for me."
7683,at least this game has no random crits
7684,"Here, let's make an actual review for this thing instead of just saying ""it's good"".

Half-Life is a short, yet extremely sweet game I could, no, I have played over and over again and still have fun. 
The combat in this game is extremely fun - weapons all feel good and there's some pretty unique ones. Firing the mp5 in this game is better than an orgasm (well, at least if you're not using the HD pack.). There's not really any peashooters in this game, and a few weapons have fun alt-fires that increase combat strategy. I suppose the amount of weapons could be overwhelming late-game, but that doesn't apply to many of people.

Movement is always fast paced and feels good to this day, but this isn't just a run&gun. If you don't think out where you're going, you can get screwed quick - unlike what was seen in previous games, for the most part.

The map design in Half-Life is very intuitive. Many chapters feel very intertwined almost like a zelda dungeon, and the setpieces for battles are for the most part, great. Specifically the chapter ""Surface Tension"" (slight spoilers, sorry), has many different unique battles and setpieces where you can make use of your pretty good sized arsenal at that point in the game.
Not all maps are perfect though, you might've heard of the chapter ""On a Rail"" being annoying. Which is true for most people, atleast the first time around. Once you understand it well, you won't be caught up in the confusing navigation and are able to enjoy each of the pretty damn fun fights. 

Music in Half-Life is incorporated into the gameplay extremely well, always keeping the horror sci-fi atmosphere, while always giving hope and peace at times as well. Some pieces in this are also extremely unique, specifically ""Hazardous Environments"", which of course went on to become the Valve theme. 

Half-Life set the standard of actually including a story in FPS games - but the game never spends too much time focused on that, prioritizing gameplay. And there's only a single cutscene in the middle of the game where you actually lose control of Gordon Freeman, and it's like 20 seconds long. It's awesome.
The graphics in this game look pretty damn good - for a 1998 game. I don't know if I'm really weird or something, but I still think the game on the proper settings looks nice. If you don't play old games because you can't stand old graphics, I can only tell you you're missing out [strike]and shallow[/strike]
For the best graphical experience possible in Half-Life 1, turn off HD models, use your native resolution (which should be 1920x1080p if you're normal), and set the fov to around 90-115 in the developer console using the ""default_fov"" command. (adjust to your preference, but going higher than 115 will result in screwing up viewmodels).
To give the game it's intended look in terms of lighting, type these into the dev console :
Brightness 0.5
Gamma 1.8

PvP in Half-Life can be fun every once in awhile, but It's very unbalanced and outshined by it's mods and the still very much alive sequels of these mods : Counter Strike, TF2, etc.

The replay value of Half-Life is pretty insane. My motivations for replaying are going faster, and dying the least (though there's a few parts that bug out and make that last one a pain). It remains fun pretty much every replay, and it's not like I'm some replay junkie. I need to wait months before playing the same Zelda game again.

A warning though, the final section of Half-Life and it's final boss are underwhelming and nothing special, though what comes after always is nice. 
The ending was rushed and very unpolished - but it can never change how amazing the rest of the game is. While it's arguable whether it's bad or not, as some parts can be interesting and fun, it was never a part I seemed to get to playing during my daily replays this summer. I won't ""spoil"" it I guess, but for reasons it's very easy to just associate the ending with something else and void it out of your picture of the game. But that's a minus for Half-Life, you shouldn't have to do that with a **perfect** game.

And finally, if you don't know if you should buy Half-Life over Black Mesa, or already have Black Mesa and are unsure if you want to play Half-Life, you most definitely should. Aside from being the original experience, many aspects of Half-Life are considered better than in Black Mesa by quite a few people, including myself. Specifically the HECU, which are a key component of Half-Life were made way less fun to fight in Black Mesa. 
But that's also just my opinion - I would recommend checking out this video if you want to hear more about it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eZASMjHxuA&t=657s

Anyways, I hope this helps <3"
7685,"Ah, Freeman!
Hello, Gordon!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
"
7686,Greatest Pc Game ever Made !
7687,"This is an all-time classic game, that changed the industry of entertainment. Should you try it? Yes, please try it."
7688,The game was hard i had to use a few tutorials but other than that it was solid game
7689,Buy it now
7690,"It's a video game, I think"
7691,"there is no reason to not buy this. I mean seriously, its literally amazing, if you dont like the source versions bugs (I dont have half life source I just know this), then this is a better choice, its honestly really well made, if you want an insane remake buy black mesa, double the price but worth it (again dont own this, I just see people saying that its a good remake) so uh yeah just buy it"
7692,its a great game
7693,cant find the suit in the first level
7694,"Nearly a decade and a half ago, I overheard my cousin talking something about shooting terrorists on a video game. That is the exact moment I got hooked on Half-Life because computers were already fascinating to me, let alone playing adrenaline inducing games (for the time at least half life was adrenaline inducing lol) I had a very hard time imagining how much entertaining it would be to engage in shootouts with terrorists in virtual world. That was the Half-Life demo, I think, where you constantly kill terrorists until you see G-Man watching you from on top of a scaffolding. Anyway, we were playing as if there was no other thing to do in this world. Recently, I got into it again and finished the storyline for the first time. It was entertaining and enlightening at the same time, because when you were playing the demo, you wouldn't know what the hell is going on; the game is just another hack/slash for you, not any different than DOOM. The story is, how can I say, legendary. A straight ten. At least from my perspective because I love the abandoned laboratory concept a lot. Being as objective as possible, you may see a lot of flaws but there are things that should be taken into consideration before becoming way too judgemental about it. First things first; the game is fucking 23 years old. This simple fact is enough to start praising this game. Anyway, my point is that when it's half-life; you don't take its age into consideration. It's like GTAV where the game is older than most industry-leading games nowadays but it doesn't stop it from being better than them in most of the aspects. To compare Cyberpunk 2077 and GTAV would suffice to support my take. Long story short, depending on when you play it, it's a life changing experience or a duty to play. Duty, because this is undoubtedly a classic. You should definitely play it if you haven't already. What are you waiting for?"
7695,Fantastic game with great weapon selection and the crossfire map is just fantastic fun. I played during my post graduate in college and we all played in the Astrophysics team .
7696,very original game and i still havent gone out with that scientist for a beer
7697,It's half-life what do you expect
7698,"Half-Life 1 is ancient, being the bedrock of countless design conventions that we take for granted today. Despite this, it's exceptionally fun to play, ESPECIALLY after playing a few more modern takes on the FPS/adventure hybrid that this series pioneered. The game never takes control away from you, most of its expository scenes can be skipped (as in, walked right past) for repeat playthroughs, and because this is still a shooter from the 90s and isn't concerned with presentation nearly as much as its successors, most of the development resources went into creating a game that feels really good to play, once you get the hang of it.  You move really fast, the guns (especially the MP5/M16) have a satisfying kick, and the AI is noticeably more intelligent than I'm used to. There are a few bangers in the music department, the voice work is effortlessly charming, and the quality of the game's pacing is legendary - it's hard to put down, and perfects the balance of action and quiet moments with satisfying platforming segments and the like. It's easy to run on practically any machine, it loads incredibly fast, and did I mention that it feels REALLY GOOD to play?

I should also add that I have no nostalgia factor going into this - I was playing console games throughout my childhood, long before I discovered the Half-Life series.. which is a true testament to the game's strengths, considering how visibly dated it looks. I love this game, and I think that it's better than Half-Life 2 in almost every department.

If you haven't tried it yet... well then, get to it!"
7699,"No, I'm with the science team!"
7700,"i've played this for most of my life, its pretty dang good"
7701,Best game for combination of first person shooter and critical thinking/ problem solving.
7702,"This game is really really good. The combat is just exquisite and the atmosphere is top notch. I really did not expect that much out of this, but it is definitely one of the best shooters I have ever played. Personally I think the combat and pacing here is much better than Half-Life 2."
7703,"best game ive played
"
7704,"One of the greatest shooters ever made, the gunplay is so fluid yet methodical, I don‚Äôt mean to sound pretentious but it‚Äôs a thinking man‚Äôs shooter. You have to plan out your reaction to each encounter (sometimes on the fly) and figure out what strategies work and which ones don‚Äôt making it a really rewarding experience. The graphics are outdated for sure, but with a level of creativity to it which alleviates the major gripes of it. If you still don‚Äôt like it go play black mesa it‚Äôs just as good. 10/10"
7705,Its the best game   i have played and also this is the game that made me into playing vavle game's
7706,100/10
7707,"9/10 it made me wanna die

Edit 2: jsut beat game, nihalinth was a tedious boss fight but other than that, an absolustely great game for its time"
7711,"lol based game, plenty of ayy lmaos to blast"
7712,God Father of all that is good and mighty with narrative driven campaigns in video games.
7713,"[h1]Revolutionising the landscape doesn't suddenly make this game a masterpiece[/h1]

[b]Masterpiece:[/b] a work of outstanding artistry, skill, or workmanship.

Half-Life is not a masterpiece. It's not a bad game, however it is not particularly good either. Nostalgists won't hesitate to tell you that this game is what shaped the modern FPS landscape, as if that suddenly means we should ignore the shortcomings just because it did something different.

I started off this franchise by playing HL2, and I really want to try Black Mesa, but I decided I would have to play the original first for the full experience, and oh boy what a mistake. I have heard that Black Mesa is very faithful to the original, so apart from graphics I have a feeling it is going to annoy me just as much.

Let's talk about what this game did well:
[list]
[*]As a Half-Life game the world is engaging and it is easy to follow the story.
[*]Wide variety of weapons
[*]That's it... Nothing else really wowed me.
[/list]

Let's talk about what missed the mark:
[list]
[*]Infrequent auto saves. Maybe I am just so used to HL2, Halo, CoD, etc. but the auto saves seemed to set me back up to 10 mins of progress, which was beyond frustrating. One small mistake (jump, 1 hit kill enemy, or even put in a situation where my health is just too low for me to survive) is all it took and yet it would send you back so far to the point where it made seemingly simple things tedious.
[*]Trip mines are stupid it's easier to just headshot a soldier with a revolver than to try and strategically place these. Soldiers also seem to see through walls as they will be very aggressive if you suddenly don't have a gun in your hands, so they will charge you and you will lose health trying to switch back.
[*] Getting lost or really stupid paths. No this isn't a complaint about ""On the rail"" (albeit I do have complaints about that chapter). I have played HL2, and had no issue finding my way there, but I found myself getting lost over and over, I don't know if it is the dated graphics making the lack of detail cause everything to look similar or if the devs just didn't make it clearer where you were supposed to go. I frequently found myself consulting a YT walkthrough to find out where I am supposed to go.
[*]""On the rail"" is an experience, but controlling that machine with the same controls you use to move was awful. I frequently ran into traps because I kept moving when i tried to slow down or I accidentally released control of the mechanism causing me to just walk off. The chapter is actually very linear, and yet I found that jumping off the machine and just walking made it redundant and 10x easier, so not sure why it existed in the first place, because jumping off and walking skips entire sections.
[*]The game doesn't even tell you the controls anywhere. I had to find out how to long jump using Google. Thankfully as I had played HL2 most of the other controls were easy to figure out, but someone new to the game would likely be very annoyed and frustrated to have to consult options every few seconds. Also why doesn't the weapon selection menu go away if you choose not to change weapon? You have to press M1 to make it go away, so this meant I might cycle through, change my mind and unlike HL2 it would stay there making me waste time switching back to the weapon I was using.
[*]The shotgun sucks even at point blank. I guess this is to balance the ridiculous amount of reserve ammo you get, but I found myself using the revolver and crossbow for 90% of the game (once acquired) because I could just kill everything in 1-2 hits (normal difficulty). Whenever I used the shotgun it just didn't pack a punch even at point blank, and even with the alt-fire. HL2 handled this gun much better.
[*]The Assassins are so unbalanced. You will kill them, but your HP will be so low by the end of it, that you will just die as soon as you hit the next section. It's so annoying to simultaneously handle an enemy that dodges so efficiently while also being very aggressive.
[/list]

Neutral Points:
[list]
[*]Graphics are okay, nothing that will blow your mind
[*]Enemy design is tolerable given the era. You have your basic monsters, zombies, soldiers and 1 hit hazards, I can imagine that because of how focused Valve were on world building that these enemies would be considered ""meh"" in that time period.
[/list]

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
You got this in ""The Valve Complete Pack"" just like I did. Put this in your ""hidden"" list and forget it exists, just not worth the effort. Read a short synopsis if you care to know the details of what happened that badly.

Edit:
I forgot to mention my absolute top pet peeve, doors in this game require you to WALK INTO THEM, yes unlike any normal game you don't press the ""use"" key you just walk into them. This is such a small detail and yet it drastically affects so much.

Edit 2:
Thanks for free Steam points! If your solution to getting triggered by my review, instead of taking criticism like an adult, is to reward me then I ain't conplaining!"
7714,yes
7715,E
7716,Definitely a 90s masterpiece! It is a great game

7721," Probably there's nothing I can say that you don't know about. Game's fun and I recommend you to play it if you somehow haven't. (I played the game much earlier of course but I just finished it.) Some parts bored me a little bit but overally I can see myself in future revisiting this game and playing Black Mesa of course.

7731,"I've taken far longer to beat the game than I should have (Hell I'm 67 hours in and haven't even beaten Lambda Core yet), but what I can say is that this game in amazing in so many ways. It makes me think like just about no other game besides Portal 2, and scares the absolute sh*t outta me so often that headcrabs haunt my nightmares. The polygonal visuals are surprisingly fun to look at 23 years after its release, and the gameplay is phenomenal. this game is so simple that it could run on a Chromebook, I know from experience, but it's so complicated that nearly 70 hours in I'm only 7/9 through this game the internet says take 12 hours to complete. But maybe I'm just stupid, I dunno. Anyway, buy this game."
7732,I like it.
7733,epic good epic good
7734,"Decay constant, proportionality between the size of a population of radioactive atoms and the rate at which the population decreases because of radioactive decay. Suppose N is the size of a population of radioactive atoms at a given time t, and dN is the amount by which the population decreases in time dt; then the rate of change is given by the equation dN/dt = ‚àíŒªN, where Œª is the decay constant. Integration of this equation yields N = N0e‚àíŒªt, where N0 is the size of an initial population of radioactive atoms at time t = 0. This shows that the population decays exponentially at a rate that depends on the decay constant. The time required for half of the original population of radioactive atoms to decay is called the half-life. The relationship between the half-life, T1/2, and the decay constant is given by T1/2 = 0.693/Œª."

7743,"top 10 fps game of all time. its old bbut like its good and ye

7744,"I'm 22. About to be 23 in a few months. Here's my story.

When I was 14, I got struck down with depression. This led to me missing a lot of school in highschool and ultimately finishing 9th grade with a single credit.

I spent the rest of my teens trying to play catch up, finally receiving my high school diploma by age 19.

But when things seemed to be going well at 19, I was attacked and nearly raped. By the same relative who molested me my entire childhood. I became suicidal and was diagnosed with PTSD a year later.

At age 20, my mom died from cancer. She was a single parent and raised me all on her own since my deadbeat father left when I was 1.

I was now suffering from daily flashbacks due to my disorder.
Grieving the loss of the only parent I ever had.
And sobbing regularly thanks to the horrific things my father said to me while my mom lay dying in her hospital bed.

At 21, I dropped out of university.
I spent the rest of that year taking odd jobs at factories to pay my bills.

When I turned 22, I thought for sure it was my time to shine and begin living my life...

And then COVID happened.

I turn 23 on Dec 11.

I know I didn't waste my early 20s since I was suffering from so much traumatic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in the span of a few years that others experience over a lifetime, some never at all.

But as I begin my 23rd year. I feel lost.
My PTSD has been in remission for over a year. And I've healed from the loss of my mother... but I'm struggling to shake the feeling that I lost so much time, and will always play catch up with others in the same life arena.

I don't really know why I wrote all this down, but I guess if there's any other lonely soul out there who happens to see my comment, I just want you to know that you got this.

We didn't choose our life circumstances.
We didn't ask for our lives to go off plan.

But we are alive
We're healthy
We've been blessed with another day

If you're the same age as me, our lives are only just beginning.
If you're older, you too can realize your dreams, escape the rigid safety found in your daily routine, and live the life you thought could never be possible.

If you still got a pulse, God still has a purpose.

If you're still hurting, talk to someone about it.

If you feel bored, get lost in a good book.

If you feel lost or confused, reconnect with that inner child and find time to spend doing the things you loved so much as a little one.

I hope to revisit this review in a few years, perhaps before my 20s are up so I can update how my life has gone since then. Til then...

Take care internet stranger. You got this. :)"

7777,Great game
7778,"Half-Life. Is there ANYTHING else I must say? This game is a prime example of what Valve does. The story takes the ""Aliens appear, do something about that"" cliche and runs with it. The gameplay and puzzles are amazing. The soundtrack, OH, my goodness. Difficulty is something this game serves for breakfast, and, while yes, the graphics haven't aged the best, Half-Life is still something you have to appreciate for how it changed FPS games so much."

7780,eu odeio esse jogo
7781,"Though it's age can definitely cause difficulties, this is the strong start to one of the greatest franchises in gaming ever."
7782,"This game is a classic. The only thing more classic than this game is Mario Bros and Halo. The graphics do not hold up, but the story and game play does. After you beat this game you cannot help but play every other game in the Half Life series. When you beat all of the games you will be yelling for more like everyone else on Steam."

The atmosphere, the story, the scripted scenes (no cutscenes!), the puzzles, and the level design were all incredible and truly stand the test of time.

These days, [i]Half-Life[/i] will most often be obtained through purchasing a bundle, so it may not be the game that people purchase to play. But regardless of how you acquire this game, it is absolutely a must-play!"

most of its machanics have aged fine in some regards apart from crouch Jumping and the long jump module and Xen.

yes you should as Half-life and its Remake Black-Mesa are extrodinary Games.

7845,"Gameplay is good even today, 23 years later.
Is OG Half Life still a masterpiece? Arguably, yes; But it only gets much better from here.
It's hard to imagine a game like this from 1998.
The first to introduce 3D physics, albeit rudimentary; groundbreaking at the time & majorly expanded upon with a quickness.
Superb story.
This game both made and changed history for first person shooters.  it changed the formula.

7881,"As some one who didn't play halflife as a kid or teen, this is just kinda mediocre at best. Jank to high hell and overhyped.  For ""The shooter that revolutionized the genere."" Its more bullshit platforming and luke warm puzzles then it is shooting. The shooting isn't even that great."
7882,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Half-life series. The story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most key plot points will go over a typical player‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Dr.Breen‚Äôs philosophical outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the story, to realise that they‚Äôre not just emotional- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Half-Life truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the charm in Alyx who is a very import character as she interacts with you and look for a way to save her father. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Gabe Newell‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Lambda tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kids."

I went down and turned power generator on, came back upstairs and the gate is still closed.  Can't do anything.  So screw this game now I guess.  Don't buy it or other classic half life games, they're all bugged."

7905,"No nostalgia at all, this game came out two months before I was born and I played and completed it for the first time this year, after playing Half-Life 2 and it's episodes many years ago and again recently and recently beating MOST of Black Mesa. This is better than Black Mesa, imo. It may even be better than HL2 unless you include all of the content as one game, then it's a competition. Xen sucks but everything else is pretty fucking fun. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes shooters because I'm pretty sure this is where they got GOOD."
7906,"Half-Life is a Amazing Classic. The one thing i hate about the steam release is the B-hop cap their is ways around solving it like using One Of the Bunnymods By YaLTeR or using GoldSrc Package That Comes-Pre Bundled with Bunnymod-XT. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]

The Gameplay Is Great Except from some levels like the Infamous ""On A Rail"" which is the most boring section normally i would just B-Hop Through it The Guns Are Amazing The Best is The Tau Cannon Being The Best to mess about with and probably the powerful

[b]My Opinion[/b]

10/10 Buy It Even If It Isnt On Sale Just Buy It.
One of the games i have played with for hours on end without getting bored

7915,"One of the best games of all time.  I have been playing since 2000, and was completely blown away by the gameplay and story.  Amazing, after 20 years, people still play Half-Life online.  If you haven't played Half-Life, you won't be disappointed with a play-through.  Possibly the best PC game ever made."

7920,"Cock and ball torture Doctor Freeman, is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks. but those will not be a struggle for a subject such as you."
7921,the story forces you to use different guns by only giving you one type of ammo for a while which is good and all the guns are good
7922,"This game its still amazing! The AI has such amazing tiny details that make modern games AI look dumb. The HECU is an amazing example. They flank, rush, bait the player. The combat is surprisingly still good. The music is good too. The music in ""unforeseen consequences"" sets the mood just right. The sick guitar music in ""surface tension"" Make the fights much more sick!
The game does have some flaws. The Friendly AI has horrible path finding. The locations (especially in surface tension) can feel empty and like it would never be a real building. Xen is the worst bit, its platforming is terrible. The issue of places seeming unlivable is worse here/
If old school games are your cup of tea, buy Half Life! It may be a little rough in some spots, but its still awesome!"

It has amazing combat. The AI is good, the weapons are nice to shoot and you're rewarded for playing smart.
Even thought the graphics are outdated, it has a unique feeling/atmosphere to it."
7929,"Good game, total classic, bhopping is super easy in half life 1"
7930,It is a classic game a fps kill headcrabs and other things.
7931,"I‚Äôm here to help the people who just played Black Mesa decide if they want to try the original: you do. They‚Äôre both amazing and having played Black Mesa will make you appreciate everything Half Life does on its own, and in some ways Half Life even still surpasses it‚Äôs remake. I truly believe Half Life is a once in a lifetime game that anybody who likes shooters should experience. Potentially the best game ever made but you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that, just dive in."
7932,Except that this game is a god damn puzzle

Overall 8/10 pretty neat game."

I'm glad it works via Steam on my Linux machine(s) - it's one of the first things I install.  The intro is still great, and I like the game play and story line.  Newer games have a lot of new cool features, but this game is still very playable over 2 decades later."

7970,My casserole
7971,"Surprisingly, this game IS as good as they say.

Good controls, well-balanced difficulty, stylish 90s sci-fi setting, very well-designed levels with some puzzles spread across them.

Only downside was a bug I had which prevented me from finishing the level ""Power Up"" normally: Despite doing everything correctly (checked with multiple walkthroughs), the last switch didn't trigger. I had to use a shortcut, i.e. use tripmines as an substitute ladder to get over a wall. This also made the next level slightly harder. You'll see what I mean when you get there."
7972,pretty neat game its old so you'll probably have some trouble with controls and saving but other then that it was a neat expernce. The only down is that in the final part of the game it can get quite boring and you may need to save alot so you dont get set back to far. Over all great game
7973,game sucks
7974,"This game despite the low graphics in comparison to newer games is still a great game. The way it tells the story is a very interesting but good way to do it. And the way it scales the enemies and introduces new things is great, it takes things step by step. If this game is ever on sale or is just cheap id recommend buying it if you like games that have a good story, puzzles , and just overall engaging because this game really does those well."

8002,"A good game overall. The attention to detail in npc activity such as them reacting to the smell of dead bodies and bullsquids eating the bodies of headcrabs is impressive to this day. The game can be a bit tedious and confusing at times. You need use your brain while playing half life. Don't rely heavily on one weapon as the weapons are designed to have a certain purpose. Put yourself in the shoes of Gordon Freeman and think like a theoretical physicist. If you dislike the older graphics and want a more modern experience, I would suggest Black Mesa but this game deserves the light of day nonetheless."

8012,"[h1] Released in 1998, Half-Life was and still is one of the most revolutionary FPS games. [/h1]

[b] It put VALVe on the right path and look where we are now. Around 8 games from the same franchise. [/b]

The graphics still hold up pretty good and the gameplay is straight up awesome. 
Follow the story of [u] Gordon Freeman[/u], a scientist working at the Black Mesa Research Facility. One day, an experiment goes horribly wrong, aliens coming to visit Black Mesa, so pick up that trusty crowbar and get to work.

The arsenal is lovable and memorable, you'll see when you play the game.

8026,"This is 2021... I have played this game before on ps2, but the experience here in PC is the best, back then when released I dont have any doubt that this game was mind blowing, great mechanics, excellent artwork and design and a mysterious ambience that keeps the player on track for sounds, movement and many other details, marvelous FPS, 100% must, looking forward for blue shift, opposing force and Black Mesa before HL2... see you around over those ;D"

Like i wrote even thought it's a old game, Half-Life still a game that feels not so old. Because it's the basic of all today's and will be the basic of future games for sure. I hope this review will just push a bit in the decision of playing this game. Also check the dlc (Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Blue Shift) and of course the sequel. Ow and if you didn't see spoilers about the game, don't watch them.

8086,"Not even worth $0.99, nor was it worth the 5 minutes it took to download, i would rather get sued by epic games for cheating in fortnite and then proceed to lose the case in court than play another second of this almost-excuse of a game, if you could even call it that. I have a GTX 1080 TI, an I7-8700k, 32GB of ram, and i consistently get frame rates so slow, I could produce them faster with a Model 95 Polaroid Instant camera, But the Image quality of that camera actually happens to be better than the image quality in this game. This should've never made it past Steam Greenlight and I encourage this game's developers to completely remove any evidence that it ever existed at all because it's solid proof that they've commited a serious offense to some degree.

Thx to this game a lot of shooter games were created, this is one of the most classic games ever, i think the reason the game came popular it was from the history, Half-Life have such a epic history making the game still famous after 23 years, i highly recommend it if you like shooter and adventure games like this one, what i didn't like it from Half-Life was the jumpscares, always when i'm relaxed a hidden headcrab jumps to my face, damn those were really bad moments, anyway... go play the game, only cost 1.89‚Ç¨ when it's in offer...i think i don't remember so much, but it cost less than 2‚Ç¨."
8105,A must-play for anyone that considers themselves a gamer
8106,"COOL GAME

"
8107,Still holds up
8108,"Graphics have aged poorly, this concludes the negative aspects of the game.

Seriously though, it's fucking half life. Gun's sound awesome, aiming is awesome, levels are awesome, enemy design is awesome, story is awesome, NPCs are awesome, movement is awesome, and on sale, this game is less than 2 dollars. I promise your PC can run it, and I promise, from the moment you start playing, you will not stop until you beat it."
8109,"EPIC! Better than most new games on the market. Even the visuals are better. I mean, yeah. They are in 1998 quality. But that doesn't matter. Still looks better than most new games. Definitely worth it
And the cheat menu is pretty fun. Just flying around the lab, zapping anything in my way with the gluon gun"

8128,"I got Half Life: Alyx, so to attempt to properly appreciate the game, I'm playing though all the Half Life games. I will say, the combat and movement can be infuriating. Their idea of more difficulty is throwing as many of the most obnoxious enemies as they can at you, and then also made them bullet sponges. I guess I was playing combat wrong though, I'll give it another play through.

That said, this game REALLY shines for its puzzles! This game is a classic shooter that actually delighted me with the creativity of its puzzles, the attention to detail you need, and the freedom to solve the puzzles in alternative ways. On occasion, I was able to pass a challenge in a way that I don't think the developers intended, but wasn't breaking the game. 

Neat story concept, lays some good ground work for a timeless series. I enjoyed this game 8/10"

8150,"When I played through this game, it was something different. The game, for one, makes no clear communication what your next objective is within the game. For me, this was frustrating, but I would imagine others would enjoy the challenge. I ended up using a PDF walkthrough of Half-Life's story in order to beat the game, but now that I think of it, that only lowered my enjoyment of the game in the long run."
8151,"good shooting, good story but sometimes u get stuck and don't know what to do but overall very addicting game"
8152,I love crowbar and benry
8153,I beat the game :)
8154,Second time I have owed this game and it still doesn't disappoint!
8155,"Good game but one of the worst last bosses I have ever played in any game. Nothing to do with when it was made; [spoiler] I avoided everything for two to three hours and eventually had to look for help. Turns out you had to get hit by the boss to progress. This is despite the fact you still get a hit marker sound beforehand, so you still think you're doing damage before needing to get hit. Absolutely no sense zero brain cell design [/spoiler]"

8167,"A masterpiece of epic proportions, the ""Saving Private Ryan"" of first-person shooters. It isn't everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre, but Half-Life has done just that."
8168,"very good, also very hard"

8174,Has always been a great game from the day it was release until now.
8175,"headcrab

8176,Pure classic FPS
8177,"One of the most iconic games of all time, and for good reason. Even to this day this game proves to be very fun and an overall enjoyable experience. Mechanics and concepts are well explained and many taught through situations instead of directly telling the player about them. There are some bugs (not as many as HL: Source, thank god), but this is to be expected running a 1998 game on modern machines. Graphics are very dated but this is only really noticeable at certain points and the controversial HD models for the weapons, items, and NPCs can be turned on at any point if you so desire (some prefer the HD models while others prefer the original ones, so my best recommendation is to try switching between the original and HD models to see which ones you like better). Overall, Half Life is one of the best games of all time and continues to be a fun experience for series veterans and new players alike."
8178,"This game is good, and it's cheap in steam sales, so if you have any spare money after you buy a game in steam sales, so you should pick this up too"
8179,"my save got deleted but its still good i guess
"
8180,gaming
8181,goodt
8182,"Half-Life is without a doubt one of the most influential FPS games of all time. Even after being around for over 2 decades now, it's still worth checking out. The pacing for the most part was pretty good, the story is simple enough to understand, and the weapons are fun to experiment with and try out. Speaking of the weapons, they all handle very well for the situations they're designed for, and feel satisfying to use. Considering the game typically goes on sale for very cheap during some of Steam's bigger sales (Usually with the rest of the franchise), there's really no reason to not give Half-Life a try!
On a side note, I've beaten the game 3 times now. It's a good game to come back to every once in a while."
8183,i'm a dumb fucking rock because the first ever puzzle had me stumped for 5 hours
8184,"i love this game, its great, but also i havent played it for to long and i cant close it please help"
8185,"Raw gameplay. Epic scifi. Back when you really loved the games you played. A griping story full of style and sunstance. Play it, love it."
8186,I am the Gman
8187,"Half Life is a good game.
 It is certainly imperfect, but it's more than decent. Sure, the visuals have aged like milk, and some puzzles were too confusing to my tiny brain, but it was good.
If you're looking at this thinking ""should i buy this?"" I'd say so. Personally, i got it for a sale (about 2 bucks i think), so even if i stopped playing, it wouldn't have been much of a loss.
Also, the Xen levels aren't as bad as people say. Sure, they aren't great, but they're not bad.

QUALITIES: 
- Although the graphics haven't aged well, the sets and maps are pretty decent. 
- It's a good length, although I like my games short.
- Some parts are a great adrenaline rush.
- The weapon loadout is varied and- honestly- really odd (in a good way)
- The scripted sequences and its way of storytelling was insane for its time, and it still holds up pretty well.
- Surface Tension is a great level, although it's a little long for my liking.
- The voice acting is ever so slightly stale, and it's amazing.
- Good morning Gordon

THE BAD PARTS:
- Some puzzles straight up don't tell you what to do, so you may need a walkthrough, especially for On a Rail and onwards.
- On a Rail is the worst level. It's tedious and long. Feels like watching paint dry.
- Speaking of- the first 6 or 8 hours i put into this game ended up being of no use when the save file for that level corrupted. Worst experience I have had in gaming.
- The boss fight at the end was complete ASS. Look up a walkthrough for this one. 
- A lot of parts are very tedious.
- (this one is for the arena shooter players) DO NOT GO IN GUNS BLAZING. THINK ABOUT WHAT TO DO BEFORE YOU DO IT AND SAVE YOUR GAME A LOT.

The pros JUST outweigh the cons. Go play it, you *probably* will not regret it. Then get the second one, cause that one's supposed to be a lot better. 
RATING: 7.4/10
COMPLETED IN: 13-15 hours."
8188,its better then any of the halo games
8189,old school
8190,"There waiting for you gordon...

8191,Half-Life is a childhood game of mine. It is still entertaining even as an adult. Highly recommended for anyone who calls himself an FPS fan.

8193,It's fantastic
8194,Classic
8195,"good
yep
"
8196,this game made my rectum prolapse more than once
8197,The game is fun with a compelling story but the the platforming was atrocious and made me want to break something but other than that the game is good (note: the puzzles are somewhat real life thinking but a boss fight is a boss fight)
8198,"GREAT GAME,the controls are a bit off and audio tends to glitch a lot,however everyone should play it"
8199,"If you're a fan of FPS games, Half-life is a milestone which marked a fundamental shift in the industry, a shift in what everyone thought an FPS could or should be. Despite its age, the game still drips with atmosphere, and provides fun and interesting challenges around every corner. If you haven't given it a try, you're doing yourself a disservice.

8213,The game is very old? Can still play it for the first time ever and actually enjoy it even after so much time? Yes? Then this game right here is a god damn legend because such old games very often become too boring to try rn.

8217,"Half Life was amazing when it first came out and if you want to play it for nostalgia, curiosity or historic context, go for it. But it has aged quite badly. Play Black Mesa, the remake using the HL2 engine, instead before playing HL2 and Alyx."

8224,yes :>
8225,"I cannot reccomend this game enough. It has a deep lore connected to a lot of other valve games, rich gameplay, great visuals for its time. Sure it's old and buggy, but I feel like that's the charm of it."

8230,"Its Half-Life, no justification or introduction needed"
8231,dont shoot dr. coomer
8232,Love this.
8233,"I want to like this game. I adore Half-Life 2 and its episodes, I adore Half-Life Alyx... yet this game is simply not fun. Backtracking is frequent and torturous, chapters cannot be picked and you cannot change difficulty midway through the game, so when the difficulty ramps up it's easy to get softlocked dying in one area. The bugs are extremely common; floating headcrabs, getting stuck on geometry after loading into a level, AI simply stopping altogether... and the placement of the loading zones is ridiculous. They'll often be put in the most awkward areas near enemies, which leads to easily the most immersion breaking thing in this game; enemies despawning after loading zones are encountered. Not to mention there's a loading zone every minute, whereas in Half-Life 2 there's a loading zone every 15-30 minutes, and in Alyx there's one every 1-2 hours."
8234,amazing classic but very very loud
8235,"Although this game is very dated, its still a must play. There's something about the gold source engine that is both terrible yet great. The game is an absolute classic."

8241,"Not as great thought it be, but still fun"
8242,classic. great campaign
8243,"I beat the game on the hardest difficulty. Made cock and ball torture seem humane in comparison. If you are going to play, play on bitch boy easy mode, otherwise don't bother. The game may have been revolutionary at the time of making, but has aged poorly (at least, in my opinion). The level design is sometimes smart, sometimes completely convoluted, and sometimes just a torture chamber where you need to abuse the dumb A.I. to progress. I'm not playing this game again on easy so I can suck its cock; I didn't have fun, can't recommend."
8244,"the beginning of something amazing is right here in this blocky, first step that valve took. while the graphics are telling of its age, its still extremely fun to play. theres so many different areas and different weapons that are super fun to play around with. the tutorial area makes it easy to figure out how to play, and the ending is such a cliffhanger, you'll have to play the other games just to feel like you've tied up loose ends. but... you never really do with this series. which is the best part. this is a good first step into the half-life series."

That said, however, I love everything up to zen and have played the game up to the zen chapters five or six times now. Every penny I spent on this game was worth it for the fantastic movement and combat that most of the game features. Also install bunnymod xt for a lot of fun."

8297,"After 2 LONG weeks, I finally beat the game. Thankyou Valve ‚ô•"
8298,"[h1]Half-Life is a wonderful fps game with a rich story that does not rely on cutscenes but has the story unravel as the player progresses.[/h1]

[b]If I had one criticism for the game, that would be most of what you're doing in Half-Life is simply walking around, looking for a button to press or looking for a passage you haven't noticed before to go through. And it's not really exciting or fun most of the time.

No doubt about it, the game is immersive and tense, but it tends to depend the user experience a bit too much on the atmosphere and not enough on what the player has to do. I can't say the game goes stale because every new objective feels different, but when you get down to it, you are looking for a button, going back and pressing one final button to complete an objective every time. This would lead to me getting bored from playing the game quickly, and most of my sessions at most lasted 30 minutes.

The game is most enjoyable for me when I'm battling it out with enemies, especially the military, but I need to time my shots and take cover often, since my health goes down easily.

Half-Life: Immersive - Yes
Fun - Not always[/b]"
8299,fun
8300,its pretty epic and you get a crowbar
8301,"Let me summarize this game for you:
You get to play as a scientist named Groudon Fireman who took LSD before his first day of being an anomalous scientist who studies lazor beams and magic astrology stones.

Shit hits the fan, you are the cause of a TGI friday's incident that made the entire facility you work at a complete dogshit place to work at... but at least it's still better than activision.

So you go around and be a pussy slayer by killing small hamburger crabs and sub woofers till a scientist tells you to shoot a rocket to SPACE! you do so and the whole facility starts to go into lockdown mode with the horny 39 year old skinny milfs that are shooting green goo at you and their 20 something year old military boyfriends start popping up out of nowhere.

OH! i forgot the military shows up like... 30 minutes before the milfs come or something...

Anyhow, you go through killing TGI fridays milf moms and military boyfriends as well as the military until you come up to a Alumni Labs where a nuclear reactor is about to pop off on the new among us track, so as the last LSD induldged scientist on the base, you have to stop the horny amongass fans from blowing the place up like beyounce blowing up her ovaries with black dudes. 

Later after you execute order 69 on those twerps, you have to go into the lair of the nefarious Crocker Benkins who has control of the fairy odd parents as well as all the TGI moms that he has abducted over the past years from running away from the IRS. 

in doing so and destroying the karen factory, you face off against the deformed blobious crocker and give timmy back his costco and windex fairies and get wished off to meet the CEO of Ram Ranch himself: Ramson Rancho in the flesh, or i should say in the fur suit because he sends you off in a glowing cum portal ball to Rainfurrest 2077 to start out in the hit sequal:
 Half Living Squared..."

There's no direction in this game, the combat is boring, so many mechanics are broken and don't work, looks like an n64 game which has not aged well, it can become SO DAMN HARD FOR NO REASON, ammo is limited, health is more limited, JUST SKIP THIS ONE AND PLAY HALF-LIFE 2"

8358,the game doesn't let you change difficulty mid play through. i selected hard and ended up cheating near the end. good thing this game doesn't have achievements
8359,Nothing attracts me to a game faster than great reviews about a game's story and writing but this game makes me so motion-sick!  I cannot recommend keeping a bucket beside your computer and playing through the nausea to get to the story.  A shame.  I will try Black Mesa which I understand is an upgraded version of the same story.
8360,"People often call Half Life a ""timeless classic"" and they are right, Half Life holds up incredibly well to the point that I actually like it more the Half Life 2 (which I played first). The problem with Half Life 2 being that while it is a brilliant game it focuses more on story so the gameplay ended up being simplified too much?

But I am so glad that I went back and gave Half Life a chance as it has easily become one of my favourite FPS games ever made and I didn`t regret my time here.

If you love story-driven FPS Games this is a must play as this game single handed changed the FPS genre forever with is narrative, story-telling & gameplay."

8365,"This game is one of the most IMPORTANT video games of all time! For it's legacy alone! It's graphics haven't aged to great, but for the time, it was a BIG deal! It's game play still holds up really well! So yes, the game surely does live up to the hype!"
8366,I quite enjoyed the first Half-Life however there are a few quirks if you're used to playing games like Call Of Duty or Doom you shouldn't go into a room guns blazing you should observe your surroundings see what might be the best way to take out an enemy or to just avoid it to save ammo (i should also say i have not played half-life 2 yet)
8367,hhhhhh
8368,"After finishing this game that released like 23 years ago, I can understand why it is seen as a timeless fps! I loved playing this game and how it made me think to attack (even if it did get hard in many areas). Anyone who has the money, play this game! I recommend it!"

8381,it's pretty good
8382,"Been a console player all my life so I decided to learn mouse and keyboard FPS games with a classic. Enjoyed the variation of levels, enemy types and weapons. You can really see why it was revolutionary back in the day. Would recommend, the giant monster baby at the end was annoying so minus points for that, I guess."
8383,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"
8384,Not a bad game. Its a linear fps shooter. Its story telling is very good. Would recommend. 8.9/10
8385,this ain't half-bad.
8386,"Fantastic, revolutionary game. Graphics are dated, but amazing for 1998"
8387,"despite it being made in 1998, this game is a terrific prequel and start of the half life series. go play it"
8388,This and the original DOOM changed FPS forever. Half Life is a masterpiece. It aged pretty well for a game that old not gonna lie

8403,"good game

Edit: Better game"
8404,Valve does not update the maps in the game currently. Players can push buttons through walls.

8419,```````````````````````
8420,"haven't beaten the game but the most fun i think i've ever had with a half life game is bhoping past the security guards and scientists as they talk.

also since it's very old many mechanics are a little janky at times"
8421,awesome game
8422,"[h1] Good but dated [/h1]
Still a good game, if you can deal with slippery controls and older graphics. There were a few frustrating moments, but nothing major. I mean, it's Half-life, you already know if you'll like it or not."
8423,"With Half Life happens the same thing as with Dark Souls, or Undertale, you get a feeling impossible to get with any other game.

Half Life is very hard, very complex, and tells its story in a very ""peculiar"" way, and yet, it's going to be one of the only games in my reviews that I consider a MUST beat for ANYONE.

Half life is one of the most important games in history, and still in 2022, it's better than many of the shit that is sold today in this industry...

What can I say ? Weapons-10, Map-10, Movement-10, level design-10... Does this game do anything wrong ? Actually, it does.

Why are there glitches and bugs that make you unable to progress in certain parts of the story? I mean ones which you need to speak to Scientists and they get bugged, but whatever, you reload checkpoint and that's that, or buy the Black Mesa or Source edition, which(I hope) don't have this bugs.

Except for that, outstanding. Its just the map, the sound effects, even the voices of the characters... I can't say anything bad, just play it, beat it, and don't regret it."
8424,"No need to explain why it's good. Everyone already has.
It took me 14 hours to get hooked, but once I did I didn't stop.
Game is good.
Story is, idk man It's so hard to explain.
Something went wrong.. or right??"

8429,It's a pretty good game üëç. that is if you don't play on hard mode.
8430,its a very enjoyable gaem
8431,"Holds up remarkably well for a 1998 shooter, and the plot while simple is ripe with intriguing world-building, mystery, and ambiguity that has defined the Half Life series. Even if Xen and the final boss are disappointing climaxes for a otherwise excellent game I would recommend HL1 to anyone who loves first person shooters."
8432,probably the best game ive ever played
8433,"DAAAARG!
NOOOO!
STHAP!"
8434,This game really makes you feel like a nuclear physicist with a bizarre talent for weapons handling and combat tactics. 10/10

Even over 20 years after it was released, the original Half-Life is still a must have for any steam library.

8497,Best game ever made go play it already!
8498,"Do i really need to explain???
"
8499,"a classic for sure but ..... the graphics hasn't age well ... i would say if you want to experience half life today and you have no nostalgia with the original one.... go for Black Mesa instead
better graphics and visuals makes the game 10x more enjoyable."
8500,"It can be frustrating at times, but it's a must play for shooter or Valve fans. Even if you aren't a shooter fan, it's still a staple of gaming with great gameplay mechanics."
8501,Absolute classic. One of the few shooters where you actually have to think instead of just blowing everything to bits.
8502,"Very detailed game levels, unusual weapons, just got to love the crowbar!"
8503,the secririty guard keeps dieing when he comes to get me off the tram
8504,ye
8505,My life was halved after the first play through now I am dead.
8506,this game is great
8507,classic 10/10
8508,One of the best games I've ever played
8509,"Half-life is honestly one of the best games and if you haven't tried it out, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!"
8510,this game is still badass!!! i remember when it came out and i thought it was the coolest game ever. even 23 years later this game is still fun 2 play
8511,i love all the dogs here !!!
8512,"I loved playing this game through, though I did get confused on some parts but a quick look at a guide fixed that pretty quickly. I would highly recommend buying and playing this game, the maps are pretty well made and of the weapons are pretty fun to use"
8513,Classic and a must play me mucho like.
8514,this is pro game like HL2 i reccomend
8515,Great game makes you feel every little detail in the game. 10/10
8516,do you know who ate all the donuts?
8517,good game
8518,if you are cultured in the slightest you already own this.
8519,"You have to understand this first: I do not play shooters. My combat skills are laughable at best and freakishly abysmal at worst. My ability to platform correctly is not much better. 

I played this on Easy mode and, as one can expect, it was exceedingly difficult for me. But this game's ability to make me feel things is unmatched. Even with the 1998 graphics, I really felt like I was Gordan Freeman, living through the events of the game, experiencing his fear, horror, frustration, and exasperation. 

My creative writing teacher, in my freshman year of high school, had one rule (besides ""shut up and do your homework"") and that rule was ""Show, don't tell."" Unlike many other games I've played, this game excels at executing that principle. There are no minimaps or destination markers. There are no questlogs or tutorials. There is only you and Black Mesa (and any friends looking over your shoulder saying ""Oh no, don't do that!"") Everything you do you must figure out yourself, and I love that. It makes the game feel more real than any graphics software can.

I should have hated this game, and there were times that I did. But I've sort of fallen in love with it as well, because it can tell a story beautifully. If you haven't played it by now, I highly recommend checking out this classic PC gaming gem for yourself."
8520,buy it or i will shoot you
8521,"wheres the sequel, quarter life?"
8522,i get to beat guards to death for more ammo
8523,Loved it
8524,i really like classic games most of them i wasn't even there to play it but i really like retro games so i give this game nine out of ten good job valve.
8525,I'm Good.
8526,Ok cool but when does full life come out
8527,"Wow this game is great. Except Xen and the On a Rail Chapter. Fuck those. But regardless, this game is great."
8528,"I wish I could still own it AFTER the Half-Life Sale before Half-Life: ALYX, But overall a great game, I would Recommend."
8529,"beautiful game, best story game ever played in my entire life. A Valve's classic"
8530,"After playing through Doom I and II, I decided to pick up Half-Life. I enjoyed a lot of the games story and how it all played out. I have a good portion of problems with the game but most of them just boil down to GoldSrc ageing poorly. There's a mod called Half-Life: Restored that basically restores cut content from the base game.

A couple things I have problems with is the AI, combat, and level design. The enemy AI is amazing. I love how well done the soldiers are. The Spec Ops can go suck my nuts though, those guys are annoying to kill. The team AI is the problem I have. They annoy the shit outta me. For example, lets say one of the guards are getting attacked, they just stand there and shoot at it. They don't even take cover just stand there right in the line of fire! Idiots! The combat gets really annoying at times. Freeman reloads way to slowly, like, sure Freeman, take your sweet time reloading that shotgun while you're being pelted with machine gun rounds! Taking cover doesn't always work and after mid game, just move around more. The level design gets really annoying late game. You get the long jump way too late in game. Xen is really linear and promotes no exploration at all. The last problem I have with the game is how vague the story is. I still don't understand what the hell a Resonance Cascade is. And whats up with G-Man? I know he's some inter-galactic being that can travel space and time and he's always watching the player (even in Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay), but he never really does anything except adjust his tie and talk to you at the end of the game. 

Over all, I give Half-Life a 7.2 out of 10. It's a really good game and I recommend you check it out. I had a lot of fun playing Half-Life and I hope you do too!"
8531,one of the best valve games

8545,"Half life brought many things to the table in 1998 but there are many issues that shine through. The graphics are dated but that is okay, what is not okay is how many enemies blend into the background resulting in you missing constantly, it doesn't help that the crosshair is difficult to see at times. There were also moments were I shot a headcrab that was directly under my shotguns crosshair and I apparently missed. 

Outside of combat there was a lot of moments where I got lost and unsure of what to do. I also had moments where I would get stuck in place and had to load a quick save. 

At this moment I am at the final boss fight but I probably won't finish it. I'll probably view the ending online and move on to Half life 2. 

Again half life was amazing at the time but today I cant say I recommend it if you are looking for a fun time. However if you are interested in seeing a piece of gaming history then this is a great experience!"
8546,good game just don't pick anything higher then easy for your difficulty.

8558,10/10
8559,"Half-life is a solid FPS. The gameplay progresses at a decent rate, and is fairly well balanced, but that is about all you can say for the game. The cons are that the pacing is erratic, the aesthetics (at least for the first three quarters of the game) are bland and sterile, the story (as praised as it is) is shallow, irrelevant.

But all games have their ups and downs. if you like it non-stop action you might give a chance."

8565,"Half-Life is one of my favorite games (and series) of all time. What makes it unique compared to other shooters of the time and even today, is that the combat scenarios are basically little puzzles. You can't just go in guns blazing like most 90s shooters. Each situation requires some planning and use of different weapons, not just your standard smg and shotgun. The way the narrative is told is great as well, instead on cutscenes it's told seamlessly and the camera never leaves the players perspective. The story still holds up as one of the most intriguing and mysterious games stories in history. This is a must play for anyone who has ever touched a PC game."

‚Ä£ Final notes: The very first and original Half-Life is a monument in video gaming. Everyone who has ever played this game will probably praise it. And I do agree that this game is legendary and has to be played at least once, however I think some of the gameplay things you have to do have aged poorly. For example movement and platforming can be frustrating and some level layouts can be tricky to maneuver. But the story telling is great and honestly everything that happens in this game is memorable. Combat encounters still seem enjoyable and the graphics even though clearly horrible still have that nostalgic charm. Overall I had good and bad moments with this game, but I still think the good massively outshines the bad.
"
8574,"As much as this game is a piece of history for the shooter genre as a whole it is extremely dated and doesn't feel great to play in my opinion. I'm going to first go into what I liked about the game and then break down what I didn't. As a side note I played and beat it on the hardest difficulty so some of what I say may not apply for lower difficulties.

-Starting strong, I really enjoyed how; for most of the challenges the game throws at you, there are multiple ways of dealing with them, whether they are intended or not. The freedom to choose how to deal with the situation allows you to be creative in your approach, which allows for a more enjoyable time all around. And if you're good at manipulating the game's physics engine it just opens more ways to play. 
-I also love how since the game is old and not very refined, a lot of unexpected things can happen involving entities. In my play-through I saw quite a few headcrabs clip a box I was pushing while lunging and just get catapulted, and it was amazing whenever they did.
-And lastly I enjoyed how I was allowed to murder all the scientists I wanted without worrying about the game really stopping me (most of the time). I had my friend watching me play since he loves the game and his reaction every-time I drew my crowbar when a scientist was talking was great.

I really struggled thinking of what I liked about the game but I wanted to at least include something so it didn't seem like I was just hating the game. I really came into it wanting to know why it was so well regarded. Now let's get on to the negatives.

-Most of the guns in the game are just bad, having either pitiful damage or horrible fire rate (Sometimes both) or ungodly spread. Reload speed is also a big problem I had, I believe it takes like 4-6 secondes to reload the crossbow and the shotgun reloads a single slug per second I think. It might be more like .7 but that's still pretty bad.
-Most enemy has their on bullshit that tends to just be annoying. Human enemies love spamming grenades, Vortigaunts like to hide in dark places and fire their hard hitting blasts at you that does 35-ish damage while you're trying too deal with another enemy and they'll just sometimes spawn in right behind you, the grunts have a homing weapon that fires slow so the tracking is really good and they always come is groups, bullsquids will just spit at you from across the map, and so on.
-As soon as you are spotted by the enemy they all know where you are and the human enemies have hit-scan weapons almost guaranteeing you'll take damage.
-The story is told through random npcs that you may just run by without realizing they were talking in the first place.
-Dialogue is delivered super flat paired with bad audio.
 -The bosses are barely bosses. Until you get to Xen they are literally just, lead boss from area A to area B and hit button. That's if you even decide to fight them because you can just run past most of the time.
-The movement is really floaty which is why you can abuse it so much, but for a casual player who isn't abusing it, it's just annoying and sometimes you'll just walk right off the ledge.
-For half the game you're inside a boring foundation that get's old real quick.
-And finally, the range on explosions are deceptively big, pair that with the human enemies spamming grenades it becomes a bad time.

I'm not saying don't ever play this game, I'm just saying I think people get to hung up on the nostalgia and claim it's better than it is. I'd have to give it like a 4.5/10 as an actual game."
8575,Masterpiece ahead of it's time
8576,hal fife
8577,"This game is great, I have no clue how some people just can't enjoy it (look at negative reviews section). It may be an old game and the graphics might be bad or the physics is annoying, but it is waaaaay more fun than Half-Life2 in my opinion, here you are trying to escape the lab, in Half-Life2 you are just going back and forth doing random stuff (well not really but it feels like that). Now if you really are bored of half life because of ""It lacking gameplay (or anything really)"" then just use mods, my favourite mod is brutal half life, makes the game waaaay more fun than it already was. So that's my review, Half-Life is great!"
8578,"Although i hate the current state of Valve; they totally revolutionised gaming more than once in the past so i really kind of still like them.
About the game, it is still playable today and is a great example of how gaming is not just made up of great graphics and sound samples. The humor in this game is top notch and most of what some people call bugs/glitches are left in the game just to make it more fun. Overall, 10/10 thanks for this masterpiece valve."

8591,"Gordon with ponytail fight my cousin Alan so life not become half and he can be second game.
(Translation: It's a good game)"
8592,"I often have a hard time picking favorites, but I'd be kidding myself if I didn't think Half-Life is my favorite game ever. I played it for the first time in 2007 - well past the point when it was new to the world - but that didn't stop me from being absolutely blown away. The intense action, unique aesthetics, measured storytelling and killer soundtrack all made for a package that resonated so strongly that it helped solidify not only my preferences in games, but even media in general.

Even upon replaying (which I now do pretty much every year) the ambiance is still as gripping as ever, and the gameplay remains fun thanks to an expansive arsenal of weapons, plus a varied roster of alien and human enemies to fight; both of which, as an aside, I always felt were slimmed down just a bit too much in the sequels. Some parts are undeniably jank by modern standards, but nothing is so bad as long as you're patient, or even the least bit accustomed to older games."

8610,"If you like shooters and/or good sci-fi, this is one of those games you should play before you die.  Not just for the memes but because it's great and worth playing.  It's also dirt cheap these days especially when it goes on sale (I think then it's under $1) and it has years worth of mods to play made by talented people.  You can even take your hand yourself at modding and create your own content.  How else do you think Counter-Strike got started?  Great game, great price, years of additional free bonus content, there's a reason why people still want Half-Life 3."

Of course its not going to look very good considering it was made in 1998, but if you don't like the look, them play the game ""Black Mesa"", its the same as this game, but the visuals are A LOT better.

8654,"While enjoyable enough for a single run, wouldn't rly recommend it in 2021, unless you really want to find out with your own hands how the story starts. It's jumping movement is terrible and it requires you to platform quite a bit. All the audio is bitcrushed, the audio balancing is non existent, the shooting is alright, the physics engine is a disaster.
 
While it's the granddaddy of a ton  fps games, I'd personally say skip it and play Half life 2, where they figured out how to make a masterpiece that's enjoyable even 16 years later. 

I had fun with it and it's blue shift and opposing force variants, but it's not gonna blow your mind and it's frustrating at times (and not for good reasons)."

8712,"I mean its half life. 

Need I say more?"
8713,amazing
8714,very good classic game but hard
8715,"Review update:
I finished the game (normal mode, I don't think I could handle hard psychologically), and it has to be the worst good game I've ever played.

So many cool ideas and moments overwhelmed by real bad design choices and glitches. Half of my time I was having fun killing enemies, solving puzzles and following the intriguing story told by the environment, the other half I was fighting with my character getting stuck everywhere (Gordon's a fatty apparently) and countless glitches. I guess they made for occasional funny moments but most of the time they were frustrating. At some point I wasn't even able to continue the game because no matter what I did I would get stuck into a pipe (in surface tension) in between loading zones. 

I might recommend at least checking out half life, it's cool in terms of ideas, but I'd never recommend playing this version on steam, especially if you do not like unpolished games. There are updated versions like Half Life Source and the fan remake, Black Mesa. I never touched those, this is my first approach to the series, but they came several years later and are supposed to improve a few things.

I'm honestly excited to dive in HL2 now, as I'm told it has improved so much and is far more polished, which is truly the one thing this game lacks.

Some pros and cons I found

PROS:
-Innovative for the time
-Plenty of good ideas in terms of level design and storytelling
-Fast paced action 
-Many secret areas reward exploration with lots of pickups and new weapons.
-Mostly fair despite some big bs moments (like enemies spawning inside of you)
-Good variety despite the limited assets
-Oddly enough there were more details and interaction options in here than most modern games

CONS:
-Movement is mheh, platforming is super slippery and not fun.
-Audio is not good, you can't hear voices most of the times and the reverb fx is really messed up.
-Some parts or entire levels are pretty bad, especially the final part which everyone seems to agree on
-Too many glitches and inconsistencies, I spent so much time re-doing parts due to glitches, at some point I had to save every few steps to avoid wasting more time.
-A tad too many blind guesses.
-Final boss is a long lame battle, had way more fun with the first ""tentacles"" boss in the burner room.

8717,"Very fun game, it's a shame it didn't end sooner. It's a classic game that should be played by anyone who likes fps. Seriously, it was so worth it that I bought this old game at a sale. It is a game that has aged very well and is still very fun to play nowsday. As a CS parent it shouldn't be hard to please anyone who likes FPS."

8737,"100% Worth purchasing during the steam summer sale, i got all the half life games for like 7 bucks. And for the game itself, really good so far and i cant wait to start half life 2."
8738,good game
8739,"good game that had great potentional. although it is amazingly designed with a strategy, an element of horror, and the gameplay itself, you can quite often find yourself stuck, not knowing where to go next, or sometimes even softlocked; although getting softlocked is uncommon, it will probably happen 1 or 2 times during your playthrough.

the story however is a bit confusing and i still dont get what exactly happened in some of the scenes. the ending is also very ominous.

a major point of critisism is that sometimes the background noise is too loud to hear any of the dialogue.

if those nitty-gritty things where to be removed, i'd give it a 9/10. but because of the annoyances this game has sometimes, im gonna give it a 7,5/10.

Great experience, definitely recommend: although, be ready to be frustrated sometimes.

8754,"This game is filled with fast-paced movement and fighting, with non-stop obstacles and challenges throughout the entire game. I love the movement-based combat, the weapons, and the story is so well told in real-time that it draws you in with nearly every action you take. The scientists also make me chuckle thanks to the memes.

I played this game blind on Twitch, and there was never a dull moment during this whole experience. I will always recommend this game.

(To simplify this review, funni orange man go boing boing with bald scientist and there's a lot of aliens and military who go bang bang shooty pow)."

8758,Interloper is the best chapter in the game :)

8760,a classic 8/10
8761,"The gameplay is great, ducking behind cover, waiting for cues and thinking how you would in real life is amazing. The maps on the other hand can be pretty good, but cryptic or just infuriating (I don't want to talk about how many times I had to look up a guide) and the game is just non-sensical, there's a fan that looks like it would chop you up (like every other fan up to that point) that blows you into the air as well as a smaller fan that does the same, despite being smaller than every other fan in the game (most others chop you up)"
8762,"Absolute classic! Coming from someone who has never played a single Half-Life game, I can see why this series really took off. My only gripe is the platforming aspects; other than that, the game is fantastic!"
8763,A classic hit still relevant almost 25 years after its original release.
8764,awesome
8765,"Remember playing this when i was younger, just played through it again and its in my top 10 games, i highly recommend anyone who owns a steam account to play this its an amazing game that honestly can compete with SOME new AAA titles even with its outdated graphics"

8772,"Pros:
+++ There are very few games that I've enjoyed as much as this one. The first Half-Life is truly a masterpiece.

Cons:
---- I didn't get to see Gordon's fat juicy ass. To be honest my day was ruined."
8773,this game is as fun as beating the shit out of a Vortigaunt with a crowbar.
8774,goated
8775,"Half-Life is a great game, I can tell you that for sure. This game was just what I needed for my small game collection, already had FPS, already had racing games, already had puzzle games, already had MMORPGs, so I thought I'd add a game with a heavy emphasis on story, and Half-Life ended up being that game.

This was far from what I expected, I expected some boring FPS like any other (specially since this game was old) but I ended up experiencing something that could have released today and I wouldn't even notice.

I recommend you try this game out, it's awesome.

[Now I'm gonna start playing the sequel, hope it's as good if not even better]"

8782,"Phenomenal story and gameplay. One of my top 3 series of all time. I do wish there were subtitles and a tutorials for a couple things, but overall it still holds up over 20 yrs later!"
8783,"Had to buy this version when I wanted to replay it again because apparently the Source version got destroyed by platform updates like 8 years ago and Valve never fixed it. It's still a solid game, though."

8794,"A compelling and curious story. Absolutely would play again. There are some very, very minor bugs where I would get stuck in a wall and have to reload my last quicksave but most of the time that was of my own dumb doings."
8795,"The embodiment of ""run. think. shoot. live""... atleast in the beginning.

I played and finished the game on hard mode over the course of a week, and overall I'd say I enjoyed the game a lot, But man, it really starts dragging during the last few chapters of the game.
Also know that I intentionally avoided all media about the series as a whole outside of a few ads made for the games and the unintentional occasional nugget of info; so my slate is as clean as possible for such an old and well-perceived series.

So... at the start of the game, I was immediately engrossed from the first ""cutscene"". I put quotes around that since it's really more ""showing off"" while simultaneously giving you an idea of where you are and how advanced the technology is, as well as you can move during it (which I didn't know until accidentally hitting a movement key). I like it. But afterwards, it did take a long time to start get through story stuff and get to the action. The first weapon you get, the crowbar, felt very powerful. It swings fast and I used it to kill a guard early before he could shoot me back, which I then I got a gun for. But when past that, the crowbar took way too long to do any meaningful damage, or they are headcrabs... and the crowbar does not work well on headcrabs.

But most of the other weapons feel pretty good. I don't like how the crossbow feels so stiff to use, but it's super powerful and silent, so I forgive it. You move pretty fast in this game too, which I first thought would be counter-productive to the game's seemingly slow pace. But after a short while, I grew to appreciate it. I also like the puzzle-combat style of the game (is that even a style? idk I kinda made that up just now). You can use a variety of weapons and strategies for almost every situation, some better than others of course. It reminds me of Metal Gear a lot, and I really like Metal Gear.

I was having a lot of fun going through the game, using minimal saves and only dying a few times (except that really hard invisible agent fight. That had a lot of dying before I sat back and outsmarted them). And I then I got to the rocket. I honestly felt like that was the end of the game for a while. It felt like I accomplished the main goal (stop the aliens from teleporting in) and you got to the surface. I though the game was broken when the credits didn't show up, and I didn't find an obvious way to progress. So, with a lot of hesitation, looked it up. You had to backtrack a bit to continue. Fine, ok. Not too big of an issue and it doesn't happen a lot in the game before nor since.

But after the rocket, the game started to drag. Right afterwards is a water section, which I hate (esp because I get motion sick super easily). And this was also the start of some bullshit enemy teleporting. You are on a narrow walkway that is slippery, causing hard to control sliding. The pool of water below has a tanky, very hard to deal with, pretty fast (also scary) alien fish thing that eats your legs in less than 3 chomps. You have to jump across the gap while sliding on the puddle. You start running across the water, ready to jump, then an alien spawns behind you, zaps you, and since i was at low health, dies. That was pretty frustrating, but no huge deal. But this kept happening. Not very often, but enough and at the most annoying moments, causing it to be frustrating.

And not too long after that chapter, the game introduces these bulky armored aliens that have a ""bee"" gun. They shoot homing bees that hurt pretty badly considering they shoot out of the bee gun pretty quickly. These destroy the ""run, think, shoot, live"" slogan to ""run, see bee, shoot, die, reload save, use boring strat, live"". You can't tell when these guys show up, so when you walk into a room to assess the situation and plan an attack / escape and one of these guys notices a slight disturbance in the force, they turn around and shoot you with 8 homing bees which usually cripple you down to 30 or lower health. You can counter them effectively when you get your own bee gun, but you need a lot of bees to kill one, they come out slower, and their homing capabilities are severely neutered. You have to shoot them within what feels like a couple of feet of them for them to home onto. This leads to a lot of long sessions of hiding behind a wall, poking the armored alien with bees, hoping he doesn't walk too much (which either lets him see and shoot you, or makes your bee-poking angle not viable), and sitting there for upwards of 20 seconds to finally play the game normally again. They only start showing up more and more, killing the strategy element of the game for me. Atleast the bee gun has unlimited ammo, which is nice since you run low on ammo occasionally (and melee isn't much of an option).

I feel like the bee gun and the shitty ""teleports behind you"" enemies really start getting annoying when you reach the reactor... which doesn't help since the reactor is more ""go here and press button"" than most other puzzles, especially since the puzzling was replaced with combat. And the combat usually has 2 or 3 bee guys, and I hate bee guys since they kill the game's pace and encourages a dumb cheese strat.

But the levels were what kept me playing. They either have great puzzles (my favorites being On a Rail and the Invisible ninja fights) or have breathtaking atmosphere (the Xen planet and the areas during Surface Tension for instance). Even the reactor level looked nice and felt like it made sense, on top of a really good teleport sections.

There are a fair share of annoying bugs though (mouse settings resetting and constantly getting stuck on those flying enemies and inside pipes mainly), but being an old game, I can forgive it for a few bugs here and there. I think It's worth playing game due to it's legacy on it's own; but if you want to play this game purely for it's own merits, I'd still think it'll be a fun ride. If I wanted to be stubborn, I'd stay stop after you launch the rocket. But you will be missing out on some of the best levels if you stop at what I think would've been a great stopping point. Plus maybe the bee guys are not nearly as much of an issue on easier difficulties.

6/10, really great game, and I'm looking forward to the famously incredible sequel. If it weren't for bee guys, it's be more of a 8/10; yes, I hate them that much. They kill pacing, are a pain to deal with more than 1 of at a time (which is almost always the case), and probably single handedly the reason for 75% of my saves and deaths."
8796,A legendary game that defined the development of the genre. Thank you for it!
8797,"The hecu marines spam grenades a lot and its not very fun to fight against. I had to abuse quicksaves a lot. Also the game doesn't tell you where to go and you'll spend some time looking for a way to progress, and it's not very forgiving if you mess up. Personally, i wouldn't recommend it."
8798,"One of the most polished and memorable games of the 20th century. A must-buy, even for those who don't really care for shooter games that much."
8799,i dont have to say enything just BUY IT.... valve make half life 3....pls
8800,"very good game, a masterpiece for fps games and even with really effort on any level, 10/10"
8801,half life
8802,"Half-Life is an amazing game for like the first 80% but then the last 20% is bad at best and horrendous at worst. Like for a game 1998 it has aged gracefully if you ask me, almost everything holds up really well except the sound quality is not all that great a lot of the times but for the rest i really did enjoy myself a lot.
If you want to know what my pros and cons are for most of the game then keep on reading buddy.

For my pros:
+ The entire game is a grand adventure that keeps on getting better (till you hit Xen) wich is really fun to kinda start small and you notice how big of a problem it is actually becoming.
+ Graphics still look kinda decent honestly (I was running it on OpenGL).
+ It's very atmospheric, I found myself getting sucked up into the world and not knowing how much time has actually passed.
+ All levels look and feel different wich is kinda incredible for such an old game that is 10 hours long.
+ The sewer/factory level was really fun honestly. Also the level where you have to ride a little train cart was made me feel like a little kid on a theme park ride.
+ All weapons also feel and sound unique from one another. Maybe my only complaint with the weapons might be the shotgun wich feels kinda weird to use since it has a smaller effective range than i'm used to but it after a while i got used to it and it also more than makes up for it with that earshattering noise.
+ The story is told through visual storytelling, there are no moments (except maybe 2 or 3 times) where the plot and what is happening or what you should do is told through dialogue. 

One neutral point that i have is that the combat is really basic but the sounds of the guns make it feel impactfull.

Now to the cons:
- Sound quality is not all that good, mostly the voices sound like they were recorded with some crappy mic.
- Gordon feels clunky to control in the platforming sections.
- When i quit the game it doesn't close properly and keeps running in the background, either i had to end it in  task manager or when it didn't show up i had to end steam.
- There's a real lack of music to be honest, it could also be that it was glitched on my end and that certain tracks wouldn't play because of it.
- I got stuck on terrain more than a few times so i had to reload a previous save.
- Sometimes the enemies are placed just around a corner with a shotgun wich you can have no idea that he's there.
- While we are talking about shotguns, the enemies with shotguns can shoot it way faster than you ever could wich is kinda bullshit.
- As last, this is probably something everyone already knows and that is that the final levels in Xen are just horrendous to play through, there's nothing fun about it whats however. Even made me enable noclip at certain parts because i got so done with platforming certain parts.

Summary:
Overall this is a great game and i would recommend everyone to play through it at least once on the hardest difficulty because then you have to manage ammo sometimes. I think it's priced pretty good but for the most people i'd recommend to wait for a sale. So an amazing game with a few bullsh*t parts but that's okay because the rest is f*cking superb.

8824,Flashlight is broken 10/10
8825,"duh
"
8826,"played a little bit, its good i guess."
8827,sounds like a lotta... (HOOPLA!) sounds like a lotta.. (HOOPLA!) sounds like a... (HOOPLA. HOOPLAAAA!) *brick noise* Sounds like a lotta hoopla for a game made in 1998 right? Haha WRONG
8828,"The game is so good, I continue to play it even when I close the game"
8829,"I haven't played this game in weeks, and I can't get myself to. So now I'm writing a review, and I'm just going to honestly try to figure out [i]why[/i] I don't want to play it.

I just [i]could[/i] not enjoy this game, and [i]trust me[/i] I tried. A lot of the elements are surprising, nostalgic, recognizeable if you're familiar with the ""Half-Life Expanded Universe"", but there were so many times where I just scratched my head and thought ""Man, this would really not hold up in today's game industry"". Call me an entitled Gen-Z gamer who can't appreciate 'true art', but I did not have fun with this one, and I couldn't even finish it because of how tedious the fucking Gonarch is. I'll take the fact that I'm shit at this game and that I need more handholding to my ego, and go back to Team Fortress like the impatient endorphin-addicted pleb I am.

If you like playing this game, a sincere 'good for you'! I'm honestly happy you could have fun with something I don't see the value in. But if you're looking to get this game because you want the ""full Valve experience"" like I did, don't keep your expectations high. I don't think this game either A. is as 'timeless' as the community makes it out to be, nor B. holds a candle to newer games. 
If you're gonna do it for the lore, there are countless videos on YouTube going into more detail in a shorter time than playing through the full 25 hours-or-so of Half-Life games. If you're doing it for the gameplay, sure, why the fuck not, it's like half a cent - but  don't let yourself be disappointed if it's not for you, and go play Factorio or Titanfall 2 instead"
8830,haha crowbar go bang
8831,"amazing game that paved the way for so many of its kind that came after it
"
8832,Classic Game that everyone should have played!
8833,"very fun, surprisingly modern for a 1998 game."
8834,"very good game
"
8835,"Never played half life before but hot damn this game surprised me, game was made it 98 and is still worth playing today. So if you haven't played half life before pick it up and see where most modern games got it's influences from."
8836,"A friend got me this for free... Ok maaaybe i dont have friends or got it for free


:("
8837,A very fun and nostalgic game.
8838,"Mates, if you are tired of some BS that most first person shooters throw in nowadays (such as Russian invasion, terrorism, etc) you probably want to give this title a try. Once you tried it, I can guarantee you can't go back. This is First Person Shooter's gold standard of creativity."
8839,Amazing like every other valve game
8840,"short but great, sucks I beat it in 8 hours :(

8841,"my least favorite part was the whole game.
pretty good tho."

8846,"half life is a masterpiece on my second playthrough. i did not think this at first. hint: do not play half life:source for your first playthrough. 

"
8847,One of the best shooters I have ever played. The game is fantastic and is still great to this day. The pacing is great and the guns feel balanced
8848,Ok i guess
8849,Great.
8850,fun
8851,"Played this game, wich is history of this industry, in 2021, and can appreciate how big it had to be back in 1998, with large scale maps, very well scripted scenes and a good environmental story telling. Its an absolute must for everyone that wants to learn videogame history."
8852,very moddable
8853,Only thing I regret is not purchasing this masterpiece earlier.

8863,gordon
8864,"Live it Awesome game

"
8865,"There is not much to say about Half Life, its simply a masterpiece and an absolute must-play.
Ofcourse the Graphics are a bit outdated but the awesome story and well constructed Game-Design make up for that."
8866,great game but fuck the lambda core
8867,"I like it when the scientists say STAHP
"
8868,wow that was really cool
8869,Now one of my favorite FPS of all time! Plus it runs on my potato laptop.
8870,really fun and challenging
8871,Its a good game. vortigonts look way different in hl1 vs hl2
8872,half life not the stinky poopoo game quality B)
8873,"very much good game
graphics kinda old but the game from like a long time ago
would recommend"
8874,bunela karton gibi mq
8875,"although it most definitely shows its age a lot, this is a very fun and engaging game and it's very clear to see why it was such a turning point for the industry"
8876,"I have learned something while playing Half-Life, I don't like First Person Shooters. As much as I like Metroid Prime and shooters like Resident Evil 4, there is just something about Half-Life's platforming and shooting that doesn't resonate with me nearly as well. 

The story is interesting for a bit, but just kinda ends up going from horror themed adventure to action adventure that, while realistic, didn't really pull me in. I will agree that I probably just suck at this game, but there is a number of difficulty spikes throughout and a lot of the puzzles can feel very obtuse and make you wonder if you're going the right way. More often than not I was either getting killed a lot for the rapid gunfire from enemies or from platforming around trying to figure out where to go to next, sometimes both. A lot of the soundtrack just tended to blend into sound effects, and I had to actually look up to make sure the game indeed had a soundtrack, and while it is there, I'd argue it's not very remember-able. Add all this together with a very annoying final boss fight and outdated graphics really makes me wonder how anyone saw this game as a classic. I'll agree that a lot of the charm is lost through time, but largely I feel very apathetic with my time with Half-Life.

8877,Pow pow Gordon freeman kil pathetic alien
8878,it's half life come on need I say more
8879,This is easily one of the best games ever made.
8880,"Epic
"
8881,cool
8882,Defined a generation of video games and still holds up pretty well.
8883,"At first, i didn't like this game. But i decided to give it another chance and what the hell was i thinking last year? THIS IS A GREAT GAME. Not as perfect as Half Life 2 but still a great game regardless of its flaws!"
8884,"one of the most important and pivotal games of all time. wolfenstein is the great gandaddy of pc shooters, doom is the grandfather, quake is the father, and half life is the son. really good game even for today. i think i like it more than hl2, feels more boomer shootery, which i, of course, am a fan of. i also love all the crusty sound effects"
8885,good game
8886,"is game

8888,its a good game i like playing it
8889,Good fun.
8890,no more
8891,good game
8892,Full-Life
8893,"An absolute classic and a landmark in videogame history, even if old it still holds up well. With the exception of Xen and a few underwhelming levels it's a legendary experience that in my opinion still outclasses HL2 mainly in the story and level design departments."
8894,"I like the chaos and the fact that they put you think. You aren't given any proper instructions, you just do something and kill everything with crowbar of course.  Only downside is the doors. I hate doors in this game."
8895,Absolutely worth it. One of Valve's best work and you wonder why everyone wants 3rd Game.
8896,"amazing story,best combat,etc
"
8897,ass
8898,I'd be surprised if anyone played this anymore.
8899,"Look, this is a piece of gaming history. It's over 22 years old, of course it aged. But it aged rather well, mostly. Only some parts of it are kind of ass, like ladders, platforming and Xen.

Do play it. It's a grandparent of modern shooters."
8900,great fucking game
8901,Perfecto!!
8902,good classic
8903,"Its a good game but its really hard. The story is good, the controls are fine. its just it has a lot of puzzles and things that are really hard to complete. i Havent completed yet idk if i wil though CAUSE ITS FREAKING HARD..."
8904,no
8905,It is great. Must play!
8906,one of the greatest games ever play gamers
8907,"If you didn't like how this game was, try Black Mesa and FOR GOD SAKE don't play Half-Life Source. Just look it up on the internet and find all the reasons why. Trust me."
8908,"Very fun game and quite easy to understand what was going on.
However sometimes the way you are ""supposed"" to go is not very clear."
8909,Thank You
8910,"Pros:
-Good price
-Fun combat
-Multiple levels of difficulty, and aim assist for less experienced players
-Good story

Cons:
-Can be unclear where to go to progress"
8911,"i mean, it's half life. What do you want me to say?"
8912,VEry gud and fun  game
8913,"Half-Life is a game where you run and gun everything.
That's what i would've said IF Half Life was that.
You play as Gordon Freeman, Gordon is a physicist. So in this game it makes sense to think like one. Each enemy encounter requires some sort of strategy, whether it's hiding from alien attacks or lobbing grenades at army marines to distract them, strategic combat is all key, running in and simple shooting will most likely kill you.
The map of this game as well seems huge.
Exploring an underground facility is fun and challenging. I found each area to be fair (except for that train area) and I always knew where to go. Each act usually had one or two puzzles, these ranging from using a 
Thruster to clear a path, or simply turning on a flooded generator. each puzzle isn't too hard and challenging, it also put the game to a slow pace and it may also involve combat, keeping you on our toes to expect anything.
The AI in this game is also impressive for 1998.
Marine AI is amazing as they too use strategies, such as using grenades to smoke you out of your hiding place, most of them carry a standard automatic rifle, which is both balanced in short and long range, meaning that you'll never have an unfair disadvantage.
So to fully summarise my review I would have to give Half-Life a 9/10, one point taken away for the graphics and the occasional glitch."
8914,"That's the best game I've ever played!
I remember the time when I used to play it on my old PC, and now to have the chance to play it again it's amazing!!!
Definitely recommend the game to all of you!"
8915,"Old school hardcore FPS, set the standard for FPS today and even 3rd person shooter."
8916,Pretty difficult game but I still do recommend it to anyone that buys it. AS for the suit you guys earned it.
8917,"Good game that holds up against the test of time and shows that graphics aren't everything, I see why this game is rated so highly after playing it for myself. The story kept me interested and the game play kept me engaged and challenged.

I also really liked how for the most part the game doesn't baby you in what to do."
8918,"Doom may have been the genesis to 3D gaming, but Half-Life took it to another level and really was the catalyst to modern 3D gaming with high resolution we play today.  I still love playing this game.  I hope Valve one day decides to create a follow-up beyond the VR Alyx."
8919,one of the most fun game iv have ever played
8920,An amazing fps that really defined the genre. the puzzles and platforming can show their age at times but the shooting is phenomenal.
8921,Valve games are legendary and the people behind it are too.
8922,Old but still gold.
8923,"I was interested in the story to this game before I play Half-Life 2 for the first time. 
Although I played the game for the first time nearly 23 years after it was released, I still had a lot of fun and would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the Half-Life story."
8924,Some kind of poorly made levels and kind of bad checkpoint system. Otherwise a very good game but a bit too hard for me in my opinion. I would recommend 8/10
8925,What half of a life? a PENIS! hahahahahha
8926,"Just finished it for the first time!
It's such a very exeptional experience and honor to play this old classic game that I only got to know of because how everyone praised it. That praise gave me the ensurance that I could play every part with commitment, without worrying about wasting my time. That and replaying a few parts is why I spent 32 hours on my first run. And it really was anything but disappointing!
It has set the bar for me to what a great game has to feel like. 

I absolutely love it and can't wait to play all spin-offs and sequels!"
8927,"I am very late to try half life and i thought it wouldn't hold up well due to its age. But oh boy was i wrong, this is the most fun I have ever had in an fps game. I even think the graphics are amazing still."
8928,the assassins made me piss my pants
8929,„Ö§
8930,good lmao

Positives:
+ good graphics for a 1998 game
+ good sound/music atmosphere
+ nice gunplay
+ some cool levels
+ good length
+ the few places that are outside
+ good AI for its time
+ the puzzles

Negatives:
- some of the levels are not good enough
- a few parts feels a bit repetitive
- too much ""railtime""
- some things a long the way should have been explained better

Total Score: 7.5/10"

8942,"honest review
this game is pretty good and there's a lot of weapons to use that promote different play styles. as the game progresses the scenery changes multiple times and its always memorable. the maps all feel like they're real. there's a few things wrong with this game like the voice acting, its comically bad and if you don't like old games then this doesnt really hold up"
8943,"I understand the hype now...

Crossbow is OP."
8944,STAHP!
8945,"One of the best games Valve has ever made. I still remember hearing all the fuss about Half Life 1 when i was a small small child and now that i'm able to play it, holy hell this is great. The story is straight forward and soon enough, you get to piece the puzzles together, helping you find out the truth of everything and i gotta say, the game was really well made. Half life 1 definitely aged well and it will always be known as one of the greatest video game classics. Aside from the campaign, i gotta say, the multiplayer is amazing, the weapons are great and works just like in the campaign, the maps are spectacular since the maps aren't that confusing and you can really go around exploring while the others shatter brains. Over all i recommend half life 1. 9/10, graphics aren't that great but game play, A.I. and story is pretty decent and enjoyable."
8946,"fuck you, this game used to cost 0.99, now it's allways 1.63 euro."

8951,didn't cut my life in half
8952,"Timeless classic. A true titan of the industry. One that forever changed gaming as a whole. Sure, the graphics, sound and AI are dated, but the writing, set pieces, pacing and the way each level flows seamlessly into the next still hold up 22 years later. Half-Life has 18 chapters and by the end of it, you will remember each one just by reading the chapter name because something memorable happens in each one."
8953,"The End song alone sells it for me, totally worth the effort"

8962,"half life is a great game, if you haven't got it, get it, seriously, its worth it."
8963,"I haven't really played for 41 hours because the game kept running after i close the window but i have just finished it. It's a great game, there isn't really a reason not to play it, it's a known masterpiece. I played it on hard difficulty and i really recommend you to play it on normal, lots of fights are straight unfair without exploits or endless trial and error on hard difficulty."
8964,Worth the price worth the time! This game is still worth it! From Fun gameplay to a well told story! The only downsides are some bugs and outdated graphics but Its a fun experience.
8965,get this and half life 2 RIGHT NOW!

Buy this game and try it."
8981,"This game holds up beautifully all these years later. It truly masters the ""show don't tell"" rule and it's a blast to play gameplay wise. Even though the game is old, the Source engine visuals are strangely cute. It's heavily stylized for a game that you'd expect to look bad given its age.
If you haven't played Half-Life, what the hell bro? Do it."
8982,can't wait for next entry
8983,Hmmm
8984,Good
8985,"When this game first came out it was such a cultural shock for the gaming industry and shaped a mould for the modern first person shooter genre......

As a genius once said, ""Story in a game is like story in a p*rn movie, it's expected to be there, but it's not important."". He may have been right, but before quake the first person shooter wasn't a genre but mere DOOM clones following the same format, but when quake came out this solidified the first person shooter as a gaming genre here to stay.

Before  Half-Life FPS games had a narrative but it was just there as it was ""...expected to be there..."", Half-Life was one of the first FPS game to take its narrative seriously and do it in a way that makes it a great game to play even to this day, I don't know if it was the first FPS to take it's narrative seriously, but it was the first one to do it well enough to create a huge movement towards story based FPS games and slowly distance itself form the balls to the wall, bad-assery that was DOOM. 

Without spoiling the narrative of this game here's a small summary of the story...

You are MIT graduate Gordan Freemn working in the Black Mesa facility, you're late for work and after a failed experiment a link between two worlds is created causing mass panic. You must do everything it takes.

This game does a great job of making you feel weak, one man against an unstoppable force of aliens.

Half-Life isn't afraid of questioning the morality of Gordan Freeman, it's never said to you directly but if you think of it, if you weren't late for work none of this may have happened, you also indirectly kill thousands of innocent people and you can kill friendly NPCs including guards and scientists without any repercussions on the story or progression.

A quick note is that this game is very unforgiving and doesn't allow you to mow through aliens like the DOOM slayer, your just a a MIT graduate against a whole army of aliens. The game also drags towards the end and i was just hoping for it to end by the time i got to around chapter 15 out of 18 and the last part of the game is easily the weakest part of the game from chapter 15 onward.

This game still rocks and you should pick it up the ending doesn't ruin the game at all but it is something you should be wary of, this game is timeless, Not visually."

9005,half life? how about you get a sex life?
9006,"People say that Half-Life is a masterpiece and I'd have to agree. Most things in Half-Life have aged very gracefully compared to others of its era. Combat still feels smooth and satisfying, Puzzles are fun to complete and it still looks good even in 2021. In most areas Half-Life is better than a lot of games released today. There were only a few parts that made me frustrated and even xen is better than people give it credit for. Overall I would say this masterpiece of game design deserves nothing less than a 10/10 in my book."

9023, Although some people may say that the game isn't as good as HL2 due to the low quality textures. I disagree. I believe that both games are very good. They are both action packed. And the original Half-Life actually has a lot of unique enemies.

The sounds designs and the visuals, although a bit outdated, still hold up even 23 years later. And probably the most impressive aspect, the AI. The AI is ahead of its time  The little things are given immense care. All-in-all, one of my favorites games ever."
9032,I love half life.its one one of my favorite fps games of all times.to the shooting to the story.half life enspired other games to make story games and that is why love it.And the sequal made this game's story so much by expanding it.

9049,"uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, is good"
9050,"Great controls, puzzles, and gameplay for a game from 1998. Only problem is that the game drags on too long. I thought I was nearing the end at one point, so when I found out that I was only halfway through, I stopped playing immediately. Until you get bored of it, though, the game is decently fun, which is why I'd still recommend it."
9051,yes

9053,have you heard the story about candice?
9054,Good game
9055,Do you know who ate all the donuts?
9056,"Just because something was good at the time doesn't mean it is still good today. We used to wander around as nomads and collects seeds and fruit from trees that we found. Many died. Today we have grocery stores where you can purchase whatever kind of food you'd like.

We used to tame wild horses to aid us in our travels. But horses need feeding and space to live. Today we have the automobile, which you can purchase and fill with gasoline. This will take you to similar places as the horse, only faster.

We used to defend ourselves with sharpened sticks and rocks. Today we have guns which we use for defence and war. Those same guns that I'm now considering using on myself after playing this video game.

I recommend this game neither to those who don't want to star in an episode on TLC's 'my 600 pounds life', nor to those who want to retain their basic ability to count. This is, by far, the worst financial decision I've ever made."

9065,"HALF LIFE
So, basically... i bought the Valve Complete pack during the summer discount 2021, cuz I always wanted to go deep into the Half Life series... thinking it as ""old"" or ""obsolete"", i started playing the first chapter without any desire, but then... oh, boy!
This game just got me! It's still amazing, even if it's a bit old! I will explain now why I LOVED and I ABSOLUTELY ADVICE it!

STORYLINE:
Now, without making any spoiler, I believe the story is the main reason why I decided to keep going with the game. The plot catch you, you just start the adventure don't knowing what is going on, and you keep going realizing than nothing you expect actually happen: you think the facilities are over, but then you go in a completely different area, when you think enemies are over, you fight them again...
It's not a boring or foregone story: You'll see... you start thinking about getting out of the lab and you end... well... in a very enigmatic way...

CHARACTER:
I think Gordon Freeman actually got a place in my heart, even if he never says a word. He just know what to do, in the right moment and in the exact point.

TECNICAL OVERVIEW:
There are no cutscenes. You'll see everything in-game, throught Gordon's eyes, without true cutscenes.
Still, you'll be able to see very memorable moments, like the game's intro, when you are in the train and the woman on the microphone speaks to you...
Also, there are no actual levels, but more like chapters that separate the story: interesting choice, cuz it actually seems like you are in the Black Mesa facility, and not only playing a game...
Sadly, graphic it's not so modern: textures are pixelated, and sometimes some weird bugs and glitches can occur, like when you make a jump, and, instead to land, you just freeze in the place and you must kill yourself in order to get free.

GAMEPLAY:
The old graphic is, though, perfectly compensated by the gameplay: there is a lot of stuff you can break, secret areas, you can infiltrate actually breaking with the crowbar into the vents, and a lot more!
Also, I.A. is very smart: guards have a precise aim, enemies are difficult to face... even cockroaches have a smarter AI than Cyberpunk 2077!

PERSONAL RATING:
It's a really good game. If you, like me, are playing the Half Life series for the first time, I believe it's the right choice to start with the original Half Life.
Trust me: you won't regret it! 
Still a solid and modern game, even if it comes from 1997!"
9066,ngl this is pertty good
9067,"this game is amazing and is so much fun i love all of valvs games but the old ones are great

9073,"Half-life is a classic, one of the greatest FPS games of all time, and i can see why it is.
The story, The plot is very intresting but overall the game is fun like very very fun.
So it's a good game, if you haven't bought this (for some weird reason) than buy it!"
9074,gud.
9075,A game that was way ahead of it's time. Even 23 years later the story hold up aswell as the game play.
9076,after 13.5 hrs I finally beat this beautiful game
9077,surface tension
9078,The game is like no other that I have played before. The game is from like 1998 and I get like 30 fps but that is the how it would be play back then. so It is enjoyable and  would advise you to play it
9079,"i didnt like the boss baby battle at the end of the game, wasted 42.7 hours of my life"
9080,bruh why headcrabs keep jumpscare meeeeeee
9081,"the graphics are nostalgic even though i wasn't alive when this was released
"
9082,"Terrific, yet fun. If you're gonna play this game I suggest don't use any guides, try to figure everything out by yourself it's really satisfying and rewarding at the same time to figure everything out on your own."

9113,good
9114,epic game
9115,This game is a must have you desire to play the classics. The weapons are tweaked to near perfection and the maps are perfect ( until you get to zen and interloper) and the enemies have predictable attacks which means dying is almost always YOUR fault and not the games (unless you die to elevators or get stuck on geometry). This game has aged like cheese but is still fun to play.

Valve deserves their amazing feedback for this game."
9126,Good old game.
9127,i was the one who ate all the doughnuts
9128,"Half Life is one of the best gaming experience, the game stands strong even today and the intricate design of each level is really an experience. It is not a typical run and gun game, this game pushes you to be in the mind of the protagonist Gordon Freeman and forces you to think out of the box for each problem that you come across. Even though I am full of praise for the game , the later stages of the game pushes you beyond your limit and can lead to frustrations and disappointments. The experience is rewarding and story telling is very subtle. The beauty of half life is that you can interpret the story in your own way as you clear each chapter of the story. Step into the shoes of Gordon Freeman and the beautiful story of half life."

9156,very nice for a game that was made in 1998. Loved it!
9157,"This game changed my gaming Life !! 
Started my love for FPS games"
9158,"Alright. I've seen the memes. It was like $3.  Had to give it a go.
This review is happening in 2021. 

Pros:
-I ran into zero game breaking glitches.  Or... no real glitches at all.
-I went in blind and only used a guide when I couldn't figure out what to do.  Which... was more than I would have liked.  Like not interacting with something (generator switch) cause it looks like a light bulb... and you assume when you do something, the light will come on.  But it doesn't, you are supposed to interact with it.
-The difficulty was there.  I didn't find the overall combat to be too tough but the platforming and environment are a real challenge.
-Last boss was a bit tough.  I kept try to do stuff instead of just pumping him full of ammo.
-I had such found memories of my N64 days come rush in.
-The few times the soundtrack came on... it was absolutely bumpin'


Cons:
-Tough to look at man.  Just throwing it out there.  It is a product of its day and it looks that way.
^ in defense, I like that the graphics are unchanged to preserve the original, its just tough to look at in 2021.
-Certain weapons seemed completely useless.  I used the auto rifle for ~80% of all enemies.  Then revolver for anything at distance covered another 10% of enemies.
-Lots of platforming.  A lot.
-Xen environment at the end has different gravity values and its extremely annoying to adjust to.

Game was basically free.  Time investment was worth it.
-Final"

9197,"A guy in a IRC chat told me about this game that released a week ago called ""Half-Life"". They were talking about how radical the graphics and stuff were so I convinced my parents to buy the game by telling them it's a science-based puzzle game.

Anyways, I popped the disc into the drive and installed the game and next thing I knew I was in a tram at the Black Mesa Research Facility riding the tram

The game was lagging at some points too but all in all it was definitely worth the 50 bucks to buy the thing, highly recommend it

9198,Good yet dated game

9200,First time playing this and it's only 23 years later. Still quite a fun time I had exploring and trying to figure out what was happening. Highly recommend picking up if you're looking for a quickish game. Graphics might be dated but with this game I didn't really mind it.

9220,"A great classic, after beating Black Mesa i knew i had to play the original at some point. Playing it makes you realize how revolutionary it must have been at the time of its release. Combat and storytelling is truly amazing.

Overall, i'd say that the original is more fun and intuitive compared to Black Mesa but Xen is actual hell and the final boss fight might be the worst boss fight i've ever did. Nontheless it's a very fun game i recommend playing."

Last time we left Gordon Freeman, the unlikely scientist-hero from the first Half-Life, he was traveling. Yes, just traveling. The mystery was where he was traveling to and why all of the incidents at Black Mesa had happened (not to mention why the game was rife with so many horrific jumping puzzles towards the end). Half-Life 2 begins with Gordon arriving via train with the G-Man teasing his mind with sickly whispers of warning. The last stop of the arriving train is City 17, a bastion of the alien Combine forces, yet another mystery themselves.

For the rest of the story, you'll have to play the game yourself. I'm absolutely dedicated to getting through this review with your chance at an untarnished gaming experience intact. That means no spoilers. Suffice to say, there are lots of twists to curl your brain along the way, some a bit more predictable than others, but all welcome and interesting.

While the writing and plot points will act as fly paper to your attention, the real winner here is the way the story is presented. Through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, you'll experience roughly 17-20 hours of consciousness which tests your senses and captures your mind. The simplicity and style with which this story is presented are perhaps the most graceful maneuvers of the many that Valve has carried out. From the moment you take your first steps off of that train and into the station at City 17, you'll begin to be tutored in the ways of this bizarre eastern European city. Public service announcements, private conversations, and the actions of characters around you, whether part of the Combine or simply waylaid citizens, create a stifling and threatening feeling that City 17 has become some sort of elaborate prison preaching the chance for freedom and opportunity without choice or desire.

While I was ultimately left a little bit frustrated by the open-endedness, the journey to get to the end of the story was assuredly interesting and opened up the doors to many more possibilities. It's easy to start speculating about this or that, just don't let it drive you nuts. The deeper you get, the darker and more intriguing it becomes until you get to the end... which you'll have to see for yourself.

9233,legendary game. play it if you haven't
9234,This game is very good but I sometimes get lost while playing like being stuck in vents or stuck in a room. I don not recommend this game if you get lost easily but I recommend it if you like unique combat systems
9235,"The game is really good. MUST PLAY GAME

edit: 
Pure silence, it was strange. So I then decided to forcefully close the game using task manager. Restarted the game and it began playing normally in the train sequence just like how I remembered.

After playing a few hours, I went to sleep... woke up the next day and went to work where I talked with my friend / co worker about Half life. He talked about a half life 2 beta which was really strange and creepy, containing these weird and eerie sounds. I was interested and downloaded the beta when I got home, I opened it up and saw the menu, seeing how still and static it was with no sound. I hit the training room and entered a facility with kleiner. Eventually playing that level I started hearing these weird sounds and saw Gman apparitions with a weird moving wall.........

Assuming that the game wanted me to progress in that direction, I pressed onwards, forcing Gordon Freeman to pass by shifting walls of metal, their dull hues contrasting the bright red error signs surrounding them. I heard the background noises fade out, until it was just Gordon‚Äôs steps against the concrete floor.

Suddenly, the HUD disappeared from my screen, leaving nothing but a long concrete corridor and the sounds of footsteps, slowly getting louder. Entranced by the endless corridor ahead, I pressed onwards. I could hear my crappy PC fan whirring unusually fast. I took my finger off the W key just to turn on the desk fan I kept nearby to cool it off. When I looked back, Gordon was still moving towards a door. I tried to press pause, but nothing happened. Gordon just kept going forwards into the door. It slid open, revealing a pure black room with sonic.exe within. I heard gordon's crying reverberating through my empty bedroom."

It's an early fps game and i'd be lying if i said I didn't get lost like a lot. This problem of not noticing the one small thing in the corner of the room is one that never goes away. I am looking forward to playing Black Mesa and seeing what newer FPS conventions will do for this game. Gordon Freeman hottest face of 1998

9270,halflife
9271,"Great game, mustplay!"
9272,"It was a great game in the 90's, shame valve doesn't know how to make multiplayer games which thankfully this isn't, that aren't heavily cheated at. Maybe valve needs to drag itself out of the 90's and realise this shit show is of their own doing."
9273,"AMAZING GAME it has everything 
science fiction
shooting
story
small and good game
no need gaming pc

and  yes i got this game in a VALVE pack i bought for 10,64‚Ç¨ on the summer sale"
9274,"Good game if none of your friends are online. If you have not yet played the half life games, play this game now."
9275,"Good game, some minor spooks but that's alright, my stomach speaks otherwise tho, game is 9/10, stomach 0/10"
9276,fuck this game bruh
9277,I didn't find anything about Gordon being a Free Man
9278,"simply a masterpiece, even in 2021, 22 years after it's first ever release and its still amazing!
this isn't a just a game..
its art!
and don't we all love it!"
9279,"Gordon doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional"
9280,"e

9281,"I'll recommend this mostly if you like retro FPS or you want to see for yourself an important piece of video game history. In my opinion the right way to play this game is using the half-baked software renderer in a low resolution, the whole game gets a much tighter feel and ambience.

Unlike many of the older FPS games, the way half-life tries to be fun is not in the killing itself, but in its elaborate set pieces, which makes this game share more with Duke Nukem 3D than the Quake it inherited its engine. The most shocking thing to be found here is the ammount of levels that served as inspiration - or have been outright stolen - by the games that followed it.

It's a very cartoon nerdy game, the story is told by characters in game without cutscenes and without subtitles, which was rather new at the time. But even today that isn't too common, for good reason, because you might miss or mishear certain bit. The level design is a lot more fun once you've played it a first time, because there are parts that appear to intently be opaque as all hell.

The enemies don't get more interesting than the human soldiers where Valve did put a lot of effort into the AI. Either aliens, machines or human enemies they all feel rather bullet spongy, and the shotgun just doesn't pack enough damage or a clear enough spread to be a good weapon. Seriously, this game can take a lot of the blame for the death and disappearance of shotguns in FPS for a long time. Oh, and beware, this game ends with an old school really poorly aged floating and horrid boss battle."

9308,remember that the reason why everything in this game happened is because some guy with a weird orange suit pushed a crystal into a laser

9339,Esta chidisimo
9340,gud game for 1998. everytime I see those face sucking crabs I babyrage
9341,"i mean what can i say about this game that hasn't already been said its just good. the only really negative things i can say about this game is that xen sucks. idk i never really liked the platforming there xen just ended up feeling like a hassle. however the rest of the game is very fun, i really liked the first 4 opening chapters and we got hostiles, the part where the HECU's true intentions were revealed was amazing. so in conclusion i recommend half life 1 absolute masterpiece, beside xen fuck xen."
9342,yes.
9343,Bruh this game is scary
9344,I've played Half-Life for 8 hours and I got the game today. I haven't finished it but its definetly a play in the afternoon game. Looking forward to playing HL2. I am glad the HLC is $7

9348,"pretty cool game, testicle crab is a bitch tho"
9349,gud
9350,What else I can say about this game which wasn't said before? Everything has been said by others. There is nothing more I can add to this masterpiece
9351,its not fun but i have to play it to understand half life 2 story
9352,this game is so fun but the monsters are scary so ya but i love this game thanks valve
9353,Totally recommend playing if you want a lengthy first person shooter game :)
9354,"Half-life. Probably one of the only games that's over 20 years old and still is a enjoyable experience. For it's time, it has a fucking great story. It doesn't just drop you in and tell you to shoot things for no reason, there's a entire 2 chapters before you even get your first weapon. I actually have a reason to keep some npcs alive as some will help kill some things, whether it's actually fighting or just serving as a distraction. Graphics aren't too great, but that's to be expected, this game came out in 1998. Honestly, it's better than a lot of recent first-person shooters. Overall, fucking great game and I'd recommend to anyone."

Pros
- Requires you to use more brain than brawn 
- Has variety in its weapons
- Has great writing
- The immersion is unbroken even 20 years later
- Lets you kill npcs and take their ammo, or team up with them to get further
Cons
- The game kinda gets frustrating and boring toward the end
- The graphics haven't aged well
- Npcs sometimes get in the way
The cons aren't huge deals as graphics don't really matter, and the boring parts are only a small part of the game. The npcs are also not a big problem because they eventually move if you run into them.
9.7/10"
9394,This is one of the greatest games I've ever played and I will remember it for a very long time. Despite it's age it still holds up well and is a blast to play. Valve pls give us HL3
9395,"Prequel to one of the greatest games of all time. Got this for Christmas in 1998 and was one of the greatest gifts I wasn't asking for or expecting ever.  My Dad knew his shit.  Thanks Dad.  Now if Valve could just make the sequel to the greatest game of all time, that would be great."

9433,Its not bad :)
9434,good
9435,"OK, Half Life is from 1998, so it's pretty old - I'll try to keep that in mind when writing this review.

It's not brilliant, I'll be honest. The sound design is the same loop and when other sounds are playing, it becomes a horrible cacophony of noise. If you like tinnitus - this is perfect for you. 

The graphics are old, yet very good even today. They really do set the mood of the whole game. The enemy design is also brilliant, every enemy is very different from the other and so you always have to learn how to counter every new enemy. 

In combat, things fall apart. You are always the weaker enemy, which is partly the point, and bullets are scarce so really count if you don't want to take loads of damage. Combat is, however, the dominant feature, and you have to fight endless enemies that you have already met. It becomes almost a chore towards the end of the game, and it spoiled the experience for me. 

Half Life is a long game. It took me about 15 hours to beat the game on my first playthrough (on normal difficulty). At times there were long parts (one up to 2 hours) that felt like fillers and that didn't need to be there. There were puzzles that gave you no help to solve so you're stuck trying to solve the puzzle until you randomly get to the answer. 

It's not the best game ever, it's old and I got really motion sick at times. The thing that made this game enjoyable for me is the moments that aren't bad. If you stick with the game, there's so much it does right and these moments really make the game enjoyable and massively outweigh the negatives in Half Life.

Overall, I'd probably give this game a 5/10 - not the best, but not by far the worst I've ever played either."
9436,good game
9437,It brings me back :)
9438,"This classic shooter is probably the best 1900s game ever. As you fight enemies you have to use your brain. You have to use tripmines, grenades and corners to take cover and think before you shoot. 10/10 Absolute masterpiece"

9457,"its ok

it has a few outdated things about it such as the graphics and I ran into numerous glitches such as getting stuck 3-4 times, moving platform not moving and things like that

the movement wasn't great especially since a lot of the game is platforming because you are so floaty/slippery
and the sound was basically crap compared to today's games with some areas basically having the echo setting at 100%
and compared to today's games don't tend to have rendering issues like where the helicopter would leave render range then come back in again

I know this game was made 2 decades ago and I recognize the groundwork it laid in many gameplay foundations is really important but I'm simply stating that some people will play this game nowadays and comparatively to other well made fps games made from nowadays its not that great it's just ok"

9476,"What's good:
- Fun and variable gameplay.
- Pretty interesting plot.
- Gordon is handsome, smart and cool.
- Puzzles are simple yet interesting.
- Game can switch between fast paced rushdown and slow stealth depending on situation and player's mood (I did both).
- Gordon is once again very cool.
- AI can make you think fast to survive in fights, otherwise rest in rip.
- I personally like the graphics, the game doesn't really feel old due to it.
- Xen looks exciting and quite unusual.

Bad:
- Screw some open levels of Xen (the one where you have to ride an alien aircraft).
- Where to go in the Xen factory?
- Controls feel a bit weird so platforming sometimes becomes a struggle.
- Minor bugs are present and won't be fixed ;_;

Cannot decide:
- Enemies sometimes teleport right behind you.
- These 3 scientists are everywhere........
- XEN GRAVITY WOOO!!

Verdict:
If you never played the game, play or I will throw you to Gonarch's lair.
If you played it, you're a super cool person, let's wait for a new game together."

Granted it's not the first First-Person Shooter the world has seen, that title goes to Maze 3D or Wolfenstein 3D, but this game perfected the genre and gave birth to modern FPS games we come to know today. Granted the game hasn't aged well graphically but it's still fun to play, even on today's standards. Would definitely recommend, just make sure to disable the HD models when playing this in order to have an authentic experience."
9512,"Firstly, this game is epic in its story and concept. Always was, always will be. Secondly, Back in its day it was also a ground breaker, in story, player interaction and actual game play. Respect. I'll play it again every 5-7 years for the rest of my life."
9513,you  know why
9514,Surface tension gud chapter
9515,"This is the best game I have ever played, bar none. I tried it out at my buddy's house back a few months ago and was immediately hooked. Just got a PC a week ago and you can be damn well sure this was one of the first things I bought.

I love everything about Half Life, up to and including On A Rail (even if it took me 3 hours to beat that part). The enemy variety is astounding for how old this is, and the AI is still impressive even today. Some aspects of Half Life certainly haven't aged well, although most of it boils down to simple graphical infidelity which is easily overlooked. Even still some of the weirder textures still had a unique charm to em. 

If you haven't played Half Life yet, please do yourself a favor and get it. Don't do your first playthrough on hard like i did, though. Hard mode is absolute hell sometimes."
9516,i busted at least 3 1/2 times playing this game its that good
9517,"[h1]Rating[/h1]
8/10

[h1]Intro[/h1]
It's the one, well, the one that revolutionized storytelling in FPS games anyway. But despite telling a more in-depth story compared to previous FPS games of the time, it still keeps the player in control the vast majority of the time. Therefore, I can still call it a boomer shooter.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
+ Good soundtrack.
+ Good replay value.
+ Great enemy variety.
+ There's plenty of areas to explore for supplies.
+ Great weapon variety. Some weapons are more experimental than others.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Xen has the worst level design in the game.
- Enemies are bullet sponges on Hard difficulty.

9520,"Half Live is the game that people will still be talking about long into the future. It's so beloved, that a group of developers created Black Mesa for free in their spare time. The story is second to none and fans of the franchise is still waiting for HL3. The episodes and Alyx does not quite scratch that itch."
9521,this game looks great
9522,"Iv'e been best in my country by far. Had liitle opposition since teenager. Now im playing again and loving it.
Have met numerous good, exceptionally good players all around the world."
9523,"literally every fps other than wolfenstien and doom is just half life with added features its amazing to see how this game from 1998 has inspired so many developers, modders and creators to kick start the fps genre of gaming"
9524,"A First Person shooter classic. Set in the Black Mesa Research Complex, the game provides a very exciting setting for a shooting game. The level / environment design is the game's strongest suit since most of the levels have a high degree of internal believability and feature a lot of interconnectivity. The game also makes use of very varied combat environments filled with combat setpieces and puzzles so you're rarely stuck doing just one thing. The audiovisual design still feels like it holds up with great action soundtrack used at exciting setpieces, weapons and the industrial machinery sounding what one would expect. My main criticism of the game was that some enemies feel VERY bullet-spongy meaning that even if you surprise them you're going to take a lot of damage which is fair enough. The conclusion of the game was in my opinion far weakest part of the game in terms of combat, aesthetics and especially the final combat encounter didn't function very well. Still, very enjoyable game and a worthwhile experience."
9525,"Half-Life is one of the most timeless 90's PC games, at least gameplay-wise.
The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a 27 year old therotical physicist who works at a mysterious scientific research facility called ""Black Mesa"", located deep within New Mexico's rocky underground areas. The game starts with a monorail ride that gives the player a look at the ambience. The soundtrack that plays during said ride gives chills up the spine and feeling of dread to any first-timer. After finishing the sequence, the player arrives at Sector C, where they have to start rushing toward the testing chamber, not before getting a Mark IV HEV Suit to put on as a security measure.

I won't spoil much of the rest, and I don't want to make the review a 20 page long explanation of the lore, so I'll get to the technical and gameplay side of the game. First off, you may have noticed the visuals are a bit rough. This is usually something most players can get over quickly, as with any other old-school 3D first-person shooter. 

However, if you really think the graphics are affecting your experience, but you're still eager to play it, you may also try Half-Life: Source, an official Valve port of the game to Half-Life 2's signature engine, Source, or you could also play Black Mesa, a full-on remake of the original game on a brand-new engine that not only massively improves its outdated visuals, but also has some gameplay changes and expansion of certain chapters and maps. 

Anyway, getting back on topic, Half Life seriously made the entire gaming industry rethink the purpose and possibilities of a story-driven FPS title. After all, shooters back then were thought to be short, fun and chaotic experiences, like Wolfenstein and DOOM. Half Life however, while still keeping gunplay a priority, gave space for a story and plot. Story-driven games did exist, but they were usually RPGs that required really long dialogs and walls of text to explain the lore, and included primitive (or none) gunplay, like the first Fallout for example. Half Life however, needed no more than a few hundred voicelines and implicit story telling to deliver a plot, which is quite the achievement event to this day, where first-person shooters still struggle to deliver stories in a meaningful and interesting way.

In short, great game, and the first shooter I ever played that got me hooked on its lore. 10/10 would beat zombies to death with a crowbar again"
9526,"Half-Life is an FPS with survival-horror elements that was released in 1998. It revolutionized the world of not just FPS's but gaming as a whole. It was an immersive experience like no other and has set a lot of trends in how games tell their stories that are still commonly used today but just because a game revolutionized gaming doesn't mean it hold up today. However, Half-Life doesn't just hold up but remains one of the best games of all time and is my tied favorite game of all time. 

Half-Life has a somewhat cliche story however the story manages to stay interesting due to the way the story is told. You never leave Gordon Freeman's perspective throughout the entire game and you remain in control for the majority of the experience with only 1 exception I can think of. Set-pieces are commonly used to great effect and help tell the story in a natural way.

Where Half-Life shines is in it's fast-paced but methodical game-play. There are 2 main types of enemy. There are aliens which appear in a select few chapters throughout the game. They are pretty interesting as there are a lot of variants and they are all unique. They provide a nice survival-horror theme earlier in the game but ultimately leave a little to be desired. The second variant of enemy are the soldiers. Soldiers are my favorite aspect of this game. A lot of people complain that their weapons are hit-scan and that it can feel unfair while others complain that firefights can turn into you and the enemy just unloading your rounds into each other. I disagree with both of these critiques and believe that this was intentional by the developers to create more strategical game-play. Soldiers can not shoot and run at the same time so a lot of the game revolves around you trying to outsmart the enemy. Remember, you're a theoretical physicist not a doom-guy. Each weapon has a unique purpose and there are a lot of weapons in the game. Throwing grenades make enemies run away giving you a chance to unload into their back-side. You can shoot explosive barrels and move wooden boxed to make cover. Little tactics like these add up into a strategical, fast-paced, run and gun experience. 

10 euro is not a lot of money and I have played this game 4 times (currently on my 5th play-through) and have sunk 50 hours into this masterpiece so far so you can probably imagine that I highly recommend you pick up this game. But before that I suggest you watch a video titled ""Why Half-life 1 is so unforgiving"" made by 'Leadhead' on Youtube. They do a fantastic job of outlining how Half-Life 1 should be played for the best experience. All I have left to say is I hope you have as much fun as I have and will for hours on end."
9527,"I've got so many great memories with this game. I think I'm gonna be playing this for a long time to come. Crossfire feels like home.
Hope Valve updates their VAC to stop aimbot users from ruining an otherwise timeless DM multiplayer."

9529,"I know I'm late to this, but i just realized I never left a review for this game. First of all, it's impossible to play... the difficulty spikes and when you get stuck in an auto save with only 3 health it becomes nearly impossible, but HOLY CRAP! this game was released in 1998, and I've played a ton of games in that era, they don't even come close, for all its flaws this game set the groundwork for what first person shooters are and even what they should be.
You definitely need to play this and even its counterparts just for the history lesson in game development, though you might want to turn on god mode..."

Half-Life isn't a bad game by any means  and is still a great game to this day however in my opinion it hasn't aged that well with it's slippery physics, enemy placement, damage dealt vs damage received, bland soundtrack, etc. I will say that if you want to check out some gaming history this is a great game to play but if you just want to have great time while playing the first chapter of Gordon Freeman's adventure then I would heavily advise choosing Black Mesa."

I've never heard about this game until last month and I decided to give it a try. It wasn‚Äôt bad actually. The textures could have higher resolution though.

Okay, I‚Äôm kidding.

Last time I played the game was in the early 2000s and never completed it. I got lost and frustrated too many times and eventually got stuck and never got back to it. 
I had a bit better luck this time around and I was able to finally tick it off my bucket list (Some call it the pile of shame).

The physics and the controls have not aged as well as everything else but it is still playable in 2021. As for the rest, well‚Ä¶ yeah this is a great game that took a lot of risks and revolutionized the FPS genre. Try it if you get the chance."

Instead of being dropped into the first level and seeing action within the first minute you had buildup, like the beginning of a movie. There was all these crazy set pieces and a level progression that attempted to be seamless. And after all these years it's still really cool. If you haven't played this yet give it a shot.

9595,"Played through it twice, both times on hard difficulty. The first time, I played it for free, and I was thinking, ehh, a bunch of other games I play were sort of based on this game, so why not? I purchased it in a bundle for my second playthrough.

It has a nice jump-scare factor, it's a game of many hazards, and the storyline is really fun to follow. This is by no means a light play, not some casual shoot-em-up game. Every step you take, and every corner you peek around, could be your death (if you're not careful). It didn't take me long to start saving the game constantly. On rare occasion it's just downright unfair with the surprises, but a load game will always fix that and you know what to expect at that point.

This game is not for everyone, but if the above sounds appealing, and you like a nice fun FPS challenge, then this is for you. It also has lots of variety: many different guns, different aliens, different approaches you'll have to take to win each battle, different environments and controls in each environment, and so on. This helps to keep the game interesting. It's all very well scripted, in both senses.

I also recommend Half Life: C.A.G.E.D., which is a free (once you own HL) prison escape game that's much like Half Life (without aliens) and is pretty fun."

9618,"This is definitely a good game overall, especially if you're a big fan of classics, but it's definitely nothing cutting-edge gameplay wise(which makes sense, considering how old it is. I don't blame the wonkiness, its a little charming sometimes when you're not clipping into the floor when loading a new area). If you're in for the story and don't mind either 1) replaying the dumbest areas over and over because of unlucky enemy placement, or 2) going the easy route and cheating into the next area somehow, this is a really great game. The story is phenomenal, the world building is very very fun to find out about and play through, and the game is just fast-paced enough to keep things interesting without dunking you head-first into things. For a classic, this game is really fun- and while there were levels I loathed to play through (anything with the military, honestly) it was still a really nice thing to get to sit down and play. It remains one of my feel-good games that I sit down and replay whenever things get stressful and I need something easy and familiar, and the other content packs you can buy with it are also really fun. Blue shift is one of my favorites. 

TL;DR: Overall, good game. Old gameplay makes it a bit wonky at times and the later chapters can be frustrating, but it's still very fun and extremely worth it. I'd rank it about a 4.5/10 for gameplay, 9/10 for story."

"
9632,"Half Life is a really legendary game, a cool plot, beautiful graphics (considering that the game is more than twenty years old) and much more. I like single player, or a story game, I also like to play on death match servers, because it's fun and epic, bunnyhop is better than cs. It can also be noted that the game has puzzles that are still unsolved (I'm talking about Gman). Also, if you want better graphics, then by no means buy Half Life Source, this shit that slows down, the best choice will be Black Mesa, in short Half Life Cyberpunk ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞).

9636,is a good game
9637,"	Half-Life is certainly a great game and playing through it over twenty years after it‚Äôs initial release only strengthens that for me. That being said it is far from perfect. It‚Äôs story; characters; world building and presentation are ground breaking and still worthy of praise. It was a pioneer in not having any cut scenes and keeping you in Gordon Freeman‚Äôs shoes. It also managed a great feat in that it Valve chose to communicate the story through side characters you encounter and through announcements. Having Freeman be a mute could have been a terrible choice but they pulled it off. The presentation  of the game was fantastic. In that I mean things like the intro train ride setting up the facility and little things such as Gordon‚Äôs locker giving him some backstory. The characters of Barney; G-Man;  and the scientists all cemented their place in gaming history. There was a good selection of weapons that had many good and memorable choices. The difficulty curve of the game felt a bit off though with some sections feeling extremely easy and others feeling almost sadistic. The enemies were varied and all had little differences that made them unique as well as have slightly different strategies for. The graphics were good for the time. I wouldn‚Äôt say they were the best of 1998 but certainly top 5. The reload sounds and animations of the guns were varied and gave them extra character. I will now get to something that brought the game down for me from possible all time great to just great: the physics. Half-Life has by far some of the worst physics I have ever seen and to top it off it is compounded by having brutal levels of fall damage. The worst part of the physics for me was interacting with ladders. Going up or down would be an exercise in patience as it was all to easy for the game to think I wanted Gordon to leap off of it. Other times I would climb up the ladder and it may shoot me up in the air a bit having me lose half of my life in fall damage when I hit the ground. The fall damage and poor physics made some of the platforming very frustrating as well. Some of the issue was timing the jumps while others were seeming to slide a bit after landing. I had these issues years ago when I first played the game and they‚Äôre still there now. There are health kits scattered about as well as medical stations scattered as well. You can‚Äôt carry any med kits with you though.

	I played Half-Life on Linux. It never crashed on me. The game ran great which given the age wasn‚Äôt a surprise. There was an option for V-Sync but not any graphics options. The game seemed to be locked to 101 FPS regardless of if V-Sync was turned on. I will say that voices felt a bit muffled or with an echo at times. I also had one time where I went through a platform and got stuck making me have to reload my previous save. There were also textures that appeared black and others that would flicker. I could manually save whenever I wanted and there seemed to be no limit on number of saves. You can also just let the game auto save if you want to. You can‚Äôt change the difficulty after starting the game.

I beat it on hard years ago and knew that with it‚Äôs difficulty curve spikes I didn‚Äôt want to do that again. I got the game for free years ago from a friend, and also got it through the Orange Box I bought for $49.99 CAD. It is easily worth it‚Äôs current price of $11.49 CAD.

9651,its good play it
9652,"One of the greatest games in gaming history. Sure its some 20 years old but no matter what generation you are from this will always be the game to come back to. I've played Half-Life on many different platforms and had the entire franchise on a different account that is now lost forever so coming back and playing Half-Life is no new news for me but as part of review, highly recommended and do so, download the expansion games. Opposing forces was by far the best expansion, well done. Blue shift is ok, kinda short but still worth it. There is a lot of bugs such as getting stuck on a pathway after the loading screen, scientist don't follow commands or get lost following you, floating solder's, random firing after a load, getting stuck after flipping a switch, small stuff that's really not a big deal but can drive some crazy. Valve has really stepped up there game in these past years fixing issues, bugs, appearance, graphics and just making there games better. Correct me if i am wrong, 2018 they gone forth into creating a remaster of the original HL. ""MIND BLOWING"" With high hopes I will always be and look forward to Half-Life 3. (HL2 for another reveiw)"

Great introduction to many Classic video game characters such as Gordon Freeman and The G-Man"

9657,"do not play this game on hard. it doesn't make it that hard but it turns every enemy a bullet sponge and invalidates 80% of your weapons. 
fun game and I don't mind the bad graphics but it's gameplay feels pretty outdated but the movement is pretty fun. you have probably already heard what makes this game so amazing so I am just going to skip that part of the review"
9658,it's fine
9659,Honestly I enjoyed the story but the game pissed me off countless amount of times.
9660,gameing
9661,i had all the games for free and they dicide to take them off my steam libary
9662,"Without a doubt one of the most influential games ever made.  While the graphics don't really hold up compared to big triple A games released today, the story telling and gameplay is timeless, and it is still one of my favorite games ever made next to the original Bioshock and the last of us.  If you have not played Half Life then please pick up a crowbar and get to work!"
9663,"This game deserves all the praise it gets. The fluid action and very quick loading times all add up to a magnificent game. There is only one thing I kinda disliked about the game, and that was the chapter on the rail. It is way too long and there a few cool things about it but the rest is just kinda boring. But after that I don't see anything wrong with this game. Fantastic! You're the best Valve!"
9664,crowbar
9665,"A timeless classic. Despite its dated graphics, this masterpiece defined storytelling in FPS games. Without it, FPS games would just be a collection of mazes filled with keycards and enemies. And that's not all. With modding capability, series such as Team Fortress and Counter-Strike wouldn't even exist."

9671,Kinda outdated and unforgiving but its still half-life
9672,Well...what can you say? It as a classic that is well worth checking out for anyone that is interested in gaming history/archaeology. For me it is going back in time and revisit my youth....
9673,half life? more like quarter life
9674,It's a really good game. It truly deserved Game Of The Year in 1998.
9675,good
9676,Is nice.
9677,Is a good game
9678,Yes
9679,"THE MOST FRUSTRATINGLY DIFFICULT GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED

I don't understand why it's one of the most iconic/well-known FPS games of all time because I hated every minute of it. Puzzles that are too challenging for the average person to master. Constantly dying or falling off. I don't find it fun at all.

Of course, this is just my experience and opinion."
9680,pee
9681,s'good

You cant go wrong with either game as both are spectacular."
9689,Yeah its pretty good

the game has an amazing story,
great gameplay,
fun mechanics,
and a well made environment.
If you haven't already played this game, you need to do so!"

9696,"A timeless classic, still fun to replay after all these years.
Highly Recommended."
9697,"It's half-life. Old and respectable masterpiece that still gets you feeling that little thrill every time you overcome a puzzle. I saved every police cop/scientist I could and even though it took many many saves and loads, it was worth it."
9698,A 10/10 classic

9712,"This game is simply a master piece, had a lot of fun playing..."
9713,guy shoot crab
9714,"A timeless classic. Only issue/main problem in general is the endgame at the [spoiler]alien stages[/spoiler] as well as the ""trial and error"" in some puzzles that are meant to kill you first and then have you learn a way around."
9715,shoot gun at alien haha
9716,I'm with the science team
9717,"I can understand how Half-Life was a good game when it came out, but having played it through for the first time, I find it to be a bit too aged and full of janky design decisions, therefore I'm not going to recommend it."
9718,"If you've looked online and seen mention of the Half Life franchise, it's most likely going to be about Half Life 2 of the infamously non-existent Half Life 3. However, the original is the best one in my opinion. The gameplay is fun and interesting, the platforming can be a bit odd, but it doesn't ruin the experience by any means. The graphics are dated now, but the graphics are quite charming in their own way. This game is 100% worth buying and playing through."
9719,insane
9720,made minimal progress every three seconds then saved
9721,yes
9722,"Very good game, ahead of its time"
9723,buy it
9724,It's a game (old)
9725,"Half-Life is honestly one of the best games that I have ever played. On top of that, for a game that was originally released a month before I was born, the graphics still hold up really well. The game play is fun, the enemies are interesting, and the combat is pretty on point. I highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played it yet."

9736,Best game ever

9738,"Where the last few chapters of the game feel lacking, the rest of the game dazzles beyond comparison. This is the essential FPS experience. It forces you to think, and question how deeply the developers thought into each encounter when designing it, right down to the sight lines. It's really good, kick your ass kind of good."

"
9743,It's alright
9744,good but hard and alotta jumpscares
9745,"It's Half-Life. Do I have to say anything more? Just play it.
If you're complaining about the graphics or the age, then I don't recommend you play all games that have any remote cultural value, because Half-Life is a unique phenomenon which gave birth to modern gaming, and funnily enough, the very platform I am writing this review on.

And that concludes this review for a game that is 23 years old.

P L A Y   I T"
9746,good
9747,The game is incredible. It has absolutely aged greatly. The graphics are fine for me. The level design is amazing. In my time i only had to search for a walkthrough only three times. (I am scum I know). This game is great and is worth the ten bucks.
9748,Its pretty good
9749,sweet game. give it a go
9750,"This game has a great story and servers are still active. I prefer to play deathmatch so it might not be for everyone
"
9751,"Never had a PC, let alone a gaming PC, before now and the hype around these games lives up to everything! If you are looking for something a little bit more ""modern"" then look into Half life Black Mesa as it is a community re-build of this classic. However if you are looking to play the original in all its glory then look no further! A fantastic entry into a fantastic franchise."
9752,"I've never really played this game, but since I have the second one and the vr, I need all of them to feel complete."
9753,hitler made on a rail
9754,Runs great on my Core 2 Duo
9755,"I could not win because whenever I play the game, I cause a resonance cascade and kill the scientists."
9756,"Cant go wrong with this classic.

Fear of the unknown if you're new.

Its a mix of dread and horror of figuring whats going on, good power behind weapons, exploring a facility under attack.

total worth to buy the whole thing with HL1, blue shift, and Op expansions.

worth buying, even if you get bored, guess what? You can install mods on this shit! I swear it's just so cool on how long this has aged, and the fact it's still played a lot is cool. But I mean, what do you expect? It's ****ing half life!"
9763,"Scared the shit out of me.


10/10 would recommend"
9764,this game older than me
9765,This is an amazing game that changed a lot in shooters after this point. You had to actually put  some thought into what you did more going full doom mode. From the story to gamplay and the following expansions it was a cool game for its time. I haven't tried to boot this up in while but im sure there are fixes to get it working on a modern windows 10 system . Besides expansions there are a decent number of mods to ensure replayabilty.  i also think everyoone should give this game a try before picking up Black Mesa so you can see the differences. Its 10 on a normal day and for classic I think its a awesome price . A definite recommend from me.
9766,"Couldn't do school, just wanted to go home and play this game.

9774,cool game
9775,Good game
9776,classic
9777,A great game to experience if you played it when it came out. Hate to break it to you but if you replay it now or its your first time with half-life I don't think you are going to have a good time. Unless you are a die hard fan maybe?. I thought I would have a nice nostalgia trip here but no.
9778,"I personally really enjoyed this game!
Rating: 8/10
Pros:
- Has a very enjoyable story
- Gets you excited to play the next game
- Graphics are good for the age of the game

Cons:
- There are some glitches (Can easily be bypassed)
- No ADS
- Not many obvious objectives"
9779,still holds up
9780,"one of the best fps i played to date, not only a run and gun but using strategies to win. and the world is very well made but with very dated graphics if you mind that. i don't personally."

9790,"Half life 1 is a masterpiece in storytelling and game play. The way that you never have to loose control of your character unless it is INTEGRAL to the story is what I like most, so i'm never out of the action. The physics system is also a great feature, being one of the most important parts of progress in the game."

9797,"[h1] An experiment that cost humanity everything[/h1]
[b]Half-Life[/b] is one of the best games ever made by man. A game with a huge universe, which is much deeper than it might seem at first glance. This is not just a shooter. And this is not just a story about one late-come scientist wearing distinctive glasses. The Black Mesa incident is just a prelude to what humanity will have to face in a matter of days. And Gordon's journey through the entire complex is just one of many destinies that are being decided right here and now. And Freeman is clearly not the kind of person who gives up in the erupting nightmare, where your next step can be the last. And the story of Gordon Freeman is an example that there are no impassable obstacles, no matter how insurmountable they seemed. A simple scientist with a crowbar in his hands and wearing an H.E.V 4th model protective suit with a basic military expertise. What this particular person could achieve by the end of this longest day of his life? But he achieved a lot. He survived in this seething hell from unseen before aliens and exactly the same people but in a soldier's uniform, who came here with one goal - to clear the complex. Literally. Including him. Against the background of Gordon's survival, we see the fate of other people - not only the same scientists, security officers, but also the soldiers, the very ones who came to ""cleanse"" us. Half-Life is, first of all, the tragic story of the fate of many hundreds of people who became the first, but far from the last victims of this criminal experiment, whose result was known for a long time to that very man in a business suit and administrator Breen. In 48 hours the history of the complex will come to an end. Towards the end, which will be the beginning of an even greater nightmare that will befall the entire planet and its population. Most of the Black Mesa personnel will die, as will many of those who were sent to clean it up. But those who survive will devote the rest of their lives to trying to turn things around. After all, from the waste of Portal Storms, a force will come, which will open a new chapter in the history of the Earth. The darkest and bloodiest."

This game was a giant step in story driven interactive games that remain strong first person shooters, he focus on quality first person shooters really begun from this game. The beginning captures a perfect way to make a plot reveal slowly and immersive, and adding a cinematic approach. Truly a totally intensive way for an 8 year old to experience a game for the first time. The multiplayer is still strong too"
9812,yes
9813,"This game is an absolute classic. The graphics have not held up that well over the years, but all the same it's still lightyears ahead of it's contemporaries. The visual style is gritty, dirty and lived in, and the whole game has this unique industrial feel. The gameplay, the puzzles, the pace and style of the game are all masterwork quality. If you've never had the pleasure, or are just coming back for some nostalgia, Half-Life is one of the indispensable must-haves of any retro pc gaming collection. This game is an important piece of pc gaming history, and is still fun to play through decades later"

I know I'm not allowed to dislike this game so I won't bother explaining and since I've completed it after hating most of it I feel that I didn't miss the point. Basically only play this if you have a time machine and can go back to 1998 where game design was an experimental mess. It's only value now is that it inspired other games to be better. HL2 is good though."

9825,classic
9826,Late for work and all hell breaks loose
9827,Half-Life is one of the best FPS games created.
9828,its a good game
9829,"Half-Life is definitely a game-changing FPS, inspired by the classics but also genre-breaking. The levels are linear but it follows a coherent story, there's puzzles to solve outside of the shooting - sometimes optional to get some ammos and/or health but usually they are actually needed to continue onto the next area or level!

So gameplay-wise it's your standard FPS. You have a full set of various weapons - everything from a regular 9mm to an RPG. There's also some experimental weapons you get later on. The enemies are... I'd say kinda hard. Health is generated by either health packs or health stations, so no re-gen here. Ammo are in certain areas scarce and there's several enemy types that are bullet sponges, especially later on in the game.

Has it aged well? I don't know, it's playable but at the same time it's quite rough around the edges. Perhaps Black Mesa is the better version these days?

It's overall good tho and I had a fun time with it, although I do have to admit that in certain areas... I had to ""turn off"" my health. It was a bit too hard for my taste otherwise and I had no real interest in re-playing certain areas over and over."
9830,"YES

9831,good
9832,"It's half life, it's the beginning of everything"
9833,"Better than Black Mesa ever will be. Better sound design and soundtrack especially.
Also, one thing all reviewers leave out is that this game has very good deathmatch multiplayer. Everyone talks about how Quake had the best deathmatch. No. Quake deathmatch is boring. This game has a lot of fun weapons, especially the expolosives. I have more fun with the rocket launcher, smg grenades, and satchel charges from this game alone than I do with the entire arsenal of many other games. Obviously the tau-cannon and tau jumping is cool too. That gun is probably why Counter-Strike allowed you to shoot through certain objects since you can use the tau-cannon to shoot through certain walls. But yeah, good game. Ignore Half-Life Source unless you plan to use the assets for gmod. Definitely ignore the travesty that is Black Mesa."
9834,"Wisely done, Mr. Freeman! I will see you up ahead"
9835,"Cara, eu cresci jogando em consoles, quando finalmente tive meu PC com capacidade de rodar jogos acabei deixando Half-Life de lado por muito tempo, pois j√° estava muito acostumado com os gr√°ficos mais avan√ßados, por mais que eles n√£o fossem um problema pra mim no ps1, sem contar o amor que sinto pela gera√ß√£o n64, snes e etc. 
Mesmo tendo jogado muito CS 1.6, jogar Half-Life pra mim n√£o tinha emo√ß√£o, pelos gr√°ficos e jogabilidade. Se n√£o me engano comecei esse jogo mais de 10 vezes, mas nunca continuei... E eis que agora continuei, e me apaixonei completamente. Uma hist√≥ria que t√° ali, e se desenrola simples diretamente por meio da a√ß√£o. Tenho me divertido demais, nesses tempos de pandemia n√£o tenho zerado jogos, por mais que tenha tempo pra mim depois do trabalho, mas esse est√° indo com muita facilidade e emo√ß√£o. 
Obrigado, e perd√£o por n√£o ter valorizado essa obra por tanto tempo."
9836,"Truly a classic gem; typical Quake-esque graphics and engine (but with modifications), not so difficult in terms of modernity, a typical, confusing, and long plot, classic and nostalgic soundtracks. Half-Life was one of the first games I played when I was still a 5-year-old, it's one of my childhood games, over the past couple of years, I've grown into having a ""boring-but-still-having-fun"" aspect for it, as it is aesthetic and nostalgic after all. Overall, it's fun, but I'd rather speedrun it for fun. 10/10"
9837,Even though Half-Life came out 23 years ago the game still holds up great today. If your not sure whether to get Half-Life or Half-Life Source just get regular Half-Life. Half-Life Source is filled with bugs and graphical errors that ruin the experience. Regular Half-Life is a joy to play with fast paced combat and a fantastic story that really pushes the feeling that your against all odds one man versus the world feeling. Now there waiting for you... In the test chambers.
9838,"This game doesn't really hold up that well.  The environments are pretty drab, the gunplay is average and the platforming sections are frustrating.  Half-life 2 is the better game."

9843,"This game is good, HOWEVER it has aged quite a bit. I would suggest to buy black mesa if you have a good pc, but if you can't, buy this. It is worth it."
9844,shit game
9845,"Amazing graphics for it's time! It set the story for an amazing series, it's got amazing gameplay and it's hard, but doable, and the story is clever and yet simple to understand!"
9846,maybe.....
9847,"The Half-Life game series is arguably the most influential in the PC gaming industry. It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as ‚Äúman on his way to work‚Äù. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments.

When you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as ‚ÄúDo you know who ate all the doughnuts?‚Äù And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures.

You work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.

When you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong. You unintentionally create a portal to another planet prompting the native species to invade earth.

Fighting your way through the facility, you learn that the military has been ordered to cover up everything. They do this by eliminating everyone associated with the failed experiment. When the military fails, the CIA special forces are there to do the same thing. They are even ordered to eliminate the leftover military forces who originally failed. All while this is happening, the player is mysteriously stalked by a man known as The G-Man. A tall pale man in a blue suit carrying a black leather briefcase. Nothing is really known about him and how he relates to the main game, but it's speculated that he plays a major role.

I rate Half-Life 10/10. It is an absolute perfect RPG with an engaging story. Although at the time it took them 6 years to release Half-Life 2, I was not born yet so it did not affect me! I got to play the half life series back to back and I enjoyed every bit of it! I‚Äôve bonded with many friends over the Half-Life series and even the games based off of Half-Life such as the Counter-Strike series, HL Deathmatch, Ricochet, Day Of Defeat and Gary‚Äôs Mod. All great games that originally started with Half-Life, a game about a man who had a bad day at work."
9848,Its a great game
9849,come on you already know its good
9850,–±—Ö–æ–ø
9851,mr freeman
9852,nice.
9853,2019 - 10/10
9854,THESE FUCKING HEADCRABS MAN STAHP!!!!!!!!!11!!!1!!!!!!!
9855,YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS NO QUESTION
9856,"What can you say? Without Half-Life, there will be no Steam.
Without Steam, there will no place for you to buy and play your favorite video games.
And without your favorite video games, you'll have a depressed life ahead of you.

So play this game. It's great."
9857,the graphics could be better
9858,Fun game
9859,defined gaming on a rail sucks
9860,this game is damn good but holy s**t its hard.
9861,This game is very fun. The puzzles and gunplay are unique and F.U.N.!
9862,poggies
9863,amazing
9864,freman
9865,gives me the chills sometimes... good game tho!
9866,"the graphics are not that good, but the combat is awesome, music is good, and overall its a really good game."
9867,much hard but yes
9868,very video game
9869,Crowbar man kills aliens. 10/10.
9870,"Funny game, its old so has a lot of problems and if you want to buy it wait for it to go on sale. 10$ was way to much for this game"
9871,made a video series on this and stopped because i was very confused at the cooler part.
9872,masterpiece
9873,"Big shoutout to the game designers for this one, they really did good here. My favorite part is easily the shitty part where you have to fucking run through land mines in a corridor and there is a fucking sniper nest above you while you do it and there is also barbed wire and the sniper won't fucking die from the 12 grenades I threw at him so I have to do a bullshit ass garbage MLG jump and noscope him with the crossbow to kill him and then progress, only to realize that I still don't know where to go because of this libtard generation and there Tik tok. Still never finished Xen babyüòéüòé"
9874,"Subject: Half-Life
Status: Access-Denied
Post-Mortem: Playing in Full-Life"
9875,"I think everyone should play this game at some point. I myself have never been much into fps, but half life gave me more of an appreciation for them. Sure, the graphics are dated, but who cares. The gameplay and story are so engaging you'll want to revisit this game a couple times. There are certainly thing that could be improved, however all in all it's an amazing game with a compelling story."
9876,old school
9877,THE DADDY OF ALL FPS GAMES. YES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
9878,classic valve game
9879,"I suck at fps shooters but I still had a blast playing this game. 
The A.I. and graphics show its age but everything else is perfect.
It's a must buy."
9880,"great single player game, nice multiplayer mode"
9881,funny old but good game
9882,very good
9883,haha gun go brrrrrr
9884,"fuckin shit your pants, remove the pants and throw them at the wall"
9885,"Good game but definately turn off the ""HD graphics"". The updated ones will make you think you have guns you don't (an MP5 is NOT an AK it turns out) and may make you miss items completely!"
9886,argggggh
9887,"The game is good but there are a few problems and alot of glitches and bugs, like getting stuck in random geometry (this happens alot), the game being very difficult (maybe im just bad) or the NPCs shooting through walls, but overall i would recommend it"
9888,nostalgic & classic
9889,Good Game 10/10
9890,"It's good game

Headcrab Killing Simulator 1998"
9891,"STAHP!

9892,valve
9893,GG
9894,great
9895,"Best game I have played. Even though it is nearly 23 years old, I absolutely love the gold source engine textures."
9896,"Good game, Xen can go **** itself though."
9897,fun
9898,"better than hl2, sue me"
9899,"This game shapes many games released today and is a monumental game from PC gaming history. Many consider this a timeless classic myself included and to be lucky enough to have friends that are interested in this too just makes this ten times better. One of the best fan bases ever I'd say and its Classic 1995-2002 game style makes this game perfect for many funny animations and memes. From the very attractive people who bought this from launch to the teenagers like me who play this today, I would recommend this game to anyone that likes games and has a PC. Part of the brillness to this game is that it can run on potato specs meaning nobody can have an excuse not to give this game a go. One of the best game to ever be released and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a low end yet fun single player game to play

8/10"
9900,just play it
9901,HALF LIFE NUFF SAID
9902,Just play it man.
9903,among us
9904,"HELP, I'M WITH THE SCIENCE TEAM"
9905,"it's not bad
really good
honestly deserved more than just 50 game of the year awards tbh"
9906,Very epic game it's worth the price and it's better than most new AAA games by big companies in my opinion i recommend it very much
9907,fun game
9908,fun
9909,i got like 30min into the campaign and all of a sudden im thinking to myself wait a minute this game is REALLY good as a bonus the multiplayer goes off to this day just be prepared to adapt or die when you getting wall gaussed over and over by some nerd who's mastered the ancient art of the tau cannon
9910,Solid indie game
9911,"fucking amazing
"
9912,great game lol
9913,"Half-Life has one of the best intro sequences I've seen in a video game, and every alien encounter is great both in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. But the moment human enemies are in the picture, every weapon feels like a nerf gun and the action slows to a crawl. Fighting a couple human soldiers somehow feels slower than sneaking around a giant alien tentacle with perfect hearing, despite the latter being *supposed* to be a slow paced sequence. It's a real shame because so much of this game aged really well, but I just can't recommend a first person shooter with such poor gunplay."
9914,...Did you eat all the donuts?
9915,"THERE IS NO ALYX VANCE(BROWN WOMAN)!!!
TOP TIER GAME GOOD JOB VALVE THANKS FOR NOT INCLUDING THE BAD SKIN COLOR!!!!
10/10 WHITE POWER"
9916,Main character needs a haircut but its fun killing the remaining scientists
9917,hoof luf
9918,this game is great. so why the negative review? because I want to like it. I really do. cause its a very fin game. or it would be if it hadn't aged so damn badly. play black mesa.
9919,<3
9920,It's Half-Life.
9921,banger
9922,It's half life. Why don't you have it.
9923,pretty good
9924,if you wanna beat this game you have to think....like a theoretical physicist named:Gordon Freeman.  10/10
9925,cant wait for full-life!
9926,its good
9927,"i like it, is still fun today"
9928,how does a game from 1998 have less bugs than one from 2004
9929,"Here is a review that doesn't say ""it's half life buy it"" I've played through the entire campaign (Not at the time of reviewing but if you see ~15 hours in total then I will have finished it) Point is it may have aged a bit and I was pretty skeptical at first, not every part is super exciting but overall I had fun with it, the pixelated textures low poly models and low quality sound files have such a nice charm to them and I feel as though I'm transported back in time. The puzzle design is such a treat and the entire game is pretty beautiful and it's a trip let me tell you. I will never get over the feeling seeing that vast expanse of yellow the first time I came up from underground. Despite the initially offputting quality it grows on your for sure and the game is as immserive as ever. With quicksave in hand no part of it has been too punishing and I've only had to look up a walkthrough 3 times. I think that this is a neccecary play even if it may feel a bit long at times. Would reccomend!"
9930,F-ING GREAT
9931,"Good game, with nostalgia atachet. Some things have aged bad, some still hold. If you like retro fps buy it on sales."
9932,"Whack aliens with a crowbar
11/10"
9933,"A good story
"
9934,good game
9935,yes

9941,This is truly one of the best games of all time.
9942,its ok
9943,"i hate this game. this game sucks. 
the movement is a mess, the jumping puzzles are often sadistic. 
it sucks.

8/10"
9944,Apsolute classic
9945,"By far and large better than the second one, excluding xen. Reccomend this if you looking for an oldschool fps. If you want to experience what in my eyes is a superior version go for Black Mesa."
9946,"Half Life is a wonderful experience. although yes the graphics have aged a lot in the past 22 years this game still holds up and is very fun. I got this game back in 2020 when you were able to play the game for free limited time. I spent my entire week playing that game and it was a blast. The level design was good, the amount of freedom you had in a small space was a lot of fun. and the story was well done and brought to the player very well. I would love to see a remake for this game using the source engine 2. like imagine! it would be very cool to see this classic with way better graphics and visuals. I recommend this game for anyone that wan'ts to play a single player FPS game."
9947,"It's Half Life











Nuf Said"
9948,"Its half life, why wouldn't you get it."

Best game ever made."

9953,Half life
9954,"This game has not aged well. This game was it when I was a child, but at this point, it is not worth the time spent playing on it no matter what discount you get it at.

The mechanics are dated and the visuals do not hold up. Try Black Mesa for a better and smoother experience. Don't force this on yourself."
9955,one of the most influential first-person shooters of all the time.
9956,"DIFFICULTY = DarkSouls
You'll cream your pants

9957,"For a 1998 game, it runs very smoothly. Easy to learn controls, very few bugs/glitches, and a fun story line."
9958,"10/10 MASTERPIECE. if you call yourself a ""gamer"" you NEED to play this before you die."
9959,"Summary: Bullshit but good. The design of some of the levels is absolutely awful, and there are plenty of softlocks too. But the game is still pretty fun, but as with all games, wait for a sale."
9960,"I finally played and beat this game instead of just playing mods or just messing around. ~23 years after first playing it, Team Fortress Classic, Counter Strike, Day of Defeat, etc. Half Life was pretty good - lots of nostalgia, cool soundtrack, fairly linear and sometimes tedious but still an experience I'm glad I took part in. It's about 12 hours of gameplay including getting lost and consulting walkthroughs."
9961,ebin
9962,gaben
9963,its a valve game there really fun plus i heard there making half life 4
9964,"A good game that shows its age in places and is clunky in a few more, but definitely worth a play."
9965,This is one of the best games I've ever played. Its story starts off so well and it brings back some nostalgia.
9966,"xyes
"
9967,when the life is cut in half but everyone is a polygonal figure idk i've only played this game for 2 hours
9968,This is the best FPS of All-Time
9969,"One of the best and most influential games of all time. A great combination of fast paced action gameplay, a slow burning narrative and an extremely immersive atmosphere. Everyone should play at least once."
9970,"A definite masterpiece and important point in history for the video game industry. If you haven't played it at this point, what is wrong with you?"
9971,very nice game!
9972,"The xen levels make me weep but the game is pretty good, with a lot of weapons for you to use, and aliens and soldiers to kill."
9973,this is a fucking hard game.
9974,"What can I say about this. It's a classic and pretty much kicked off story based gameplay in shooters. It runs well, it plays well, it can be modded and its all affordable. Works out of the box baby!~"
9975,"yes
"
9976,It won't let me close the game
9977,I think this game is the most vivid part of the first 10 years of my life
9978,Every player should at least try this game once in their life.
9979,can
9980,"you do ur life a disservice if you don't play this game. all my problems are solved after I played half life. my wife cam back to me, and my kid undeaded"

9985,"Now quick disclaimer, obviously this is an older game and its age is definitely showing. However, that doesn't mean there's a lack of fun to be had. The gun play was pretty fun. The maps also have this special charm to them. It takes you through a good handful of environments that all feel unique. The story line is pretty interesting as well,"

9987,gordons guns are about as useful as shooting them with a water gun
9988,"Honestly one of the best shooters ever. The gameplay is fun and engaging, the difficulty isn't too high yet not too easy either, and there's not too much focus on the story so that all the attention is put into the gameplay."
9989,where everything started. (game was played free before HL:alyx release)
9990,Great game
9991,"its a good game, definitely unforgiving, but worth the challenge.

my only complaint is that i literally got stuck inside a pipe IN A SAVE POINT so I had to either load an old save and lose progress or turn on noclip."
9992,I miss this game. I wish I still had the CD.
9993,yo best game of the centuary go buy it now if you havent ya kid
9994,"Don't play this on Hard difficulty
:)"
9995,very fun
9996,"What else can i really say other than ""It's Half-Life, bro, you won't regret it""?
But for real, it's a great game and deserves every award it got <3"
9997,"A game that does shows its age in a lot of parts. Graphics are not amazing, but they have their charm and I'm sure they were very cutting edge when this game released back in 1998. Movement can feel great and then feel not so great. It's a mixed bag. Some of the design in this game can also prove to be frustrating. I had to turn on god mode a few times due to not having enough health and some parts being near impossible to go through without taking damage. Plus that final level is a just a barrage of enemies which proves very difficult, even on easier difficulties. I'm sure some of this was due to me being bad, but there were a lot of parts were enemy design and placement felt cheap.

However, this game has a lot of things that have aged very well. The music is fantastic and is always used very appropriately. There are also so many really cool set pieces. Every area I went through was not only well designed (level wise) but was also super memorable. The puzzles were also very well done and I was able to figure them out without the game ever spelling it out for you. The story is also simplistic, but very interesting and always had me intrigued. Plus it helps that the character of The G-Man is not only very menacing but is like the only one in the game to have decent voice acting. Lastly, the gun play still feels so rewarding and fun to play with a lot of cool weapons at your hands. 

So, it's definitely NOT a perfect game. But if you give the game a shot, I'm sure you will find a lot to love here."
9998,Half-life the most popular game in 1998 or 1999 what can i say its fun and really good for new gamers also theres mods but what i dislike about this game is i dont like the bugs and also lack of new mods for this game
9999,Its Half-Life...

10003,"By todays standards, Half Life may not look like much but it was revolutionary for its time. The majority of the game is still fantastic to this day, but unfortunately the final few chapters are terrible and rely on slippery first person platforming and low gravity. At least that section of the game is fairly short though.
I still play this through at least once a year, and if you haven't got around to playing it yet, why haven't you?"

10020,"If you're a simple gamer and don't need the greatest graphics or the greatest possible mechanics this game is a great puzzle, acton, sci-fi, FPS game with an amazing story. on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd rate this game 10/10"
10021,fun
10022,"100% A classic game, pretty much any PC can run this - interesting AI mechanics and great atmosphere"
10023,it is so god it can run on very bad pcs and laptops
10024,"A nostalgic trip to the wonderful start that made Steam the behemoth it is today.

The physics are dated, but everything is full of charm, from the dialogue ""why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties?"", to the level design and atmosphere, to classic sound design, and to the pie you exploded in the breakroom.

It's just a great game through and through, and a revolutionary game for its time. 

I actually like it more than its sequel, Half-Life 2. 

9/10"
10025,"Laidlaw and kelly are the stars

10026,good game. Only problem with it is that it gives me motion sickness and makes my headhurt but thats not the games fault its my brain being poopoo. Half life is a game that was way ahead of its time and was one of those games I had to play before I died. Amazing experience
10027,"A classic pioneer of the FPS genre alongside DOOM and Halo.
Even while working you can play the game during free time but that's up to your discretion and responsibility to be on time.
Not that I could relate but it's easy to get the hang of on easy mode, I leave Hard mode to the hardcore players, at least without cheats.
A must have for any gamers in the world."

10037,"Classic absolutely worth playing. Crazy idea to take a shooter game and make it a big campaign with heavy story telling. You don't even get a weapon for idk ~20 minutes into the game. Nearly all of the levels are fantastically crafted and the story is also told by the environment. You can kind of see how it aged, but it is still extremely playable. If you want to get into HL Universe I still recommend playing Black Mesa and this one you can play before getting into HL2. Soundtrack is nice, you also get it for free to listen."

10078,"It is surprising how good such an old game is.  It is better than most current First Person Shooters and works more smoothly than them.  And it cost practically nothing  bought with everything to do with Half-Life and Half-Life 2, so great value for money.  

In addition the tutorial is better than in most games of any genre but most controls are common to FPS games in general:  a 5 star game"
10079,crowbar
10080,"hmmm
"
10081,so yes
10082,"I didn't play Half Life growing up.
I knew how big of a deal it was to many and as a FPS lover I knew I owed it to myself to play it.
And I did recently, and I was astonished on how much of a blueprint this game is to even the latest FPS games.

That's also a sad thing as we rarely* see such leaps anymore in our industry. Everyone is so contempt with the same formula given to them in a new skin with a bare bone story.

Tangent aside, I understand why Half Life is amazing. 
From the gun play, storytelling and atmosphere, I can now truly appreciate what Half Life did for first person shooters.

10085,No like it's actually so good

10088,"The game is very very fun except for a few segments.(mainly towards the end).the combat puzzles are fun to solve with your verity of weapons.The reason why i say combat puzzles is because there are not many usual puzzles.Sorry for the tangent,the story itself is fun to solve.This game also started one of the greatest game series of all time.I rate the game a nine out of 10"
10089,This is probably one of the best games I've played in my entire life.
10090,"I love this game, my childhood right here. My uncle game me the game after he finished it. Back then I didn't even make it through half a chapter. Now I'm at chapter 13 and and amazed how long this game is. The only down side is that there are no clear instruction on what to do: like the one where you turn on a fan and have to jump and fly to the ceiling. If it weren't for walk-through's on YouTube I would never had made it this far. I've been stuck for a week at a conveyor belt thing and it is frustrating but I want to push through. And then play a more recent version like Alyx."
10091,i dont know where to go. my feet are made of glass and a third of my life will vanish if i fall 5 feet. and if your not careful you can end up getting softlocked
10092,1
10093,"Just a plain YES. Go for it. If u don¬¥t find it appealing because of graphics. Play Black Mesa. Same Stuff only more beautiful.
I think no one needs to explain what it is about, u¬¥ll get into it quite fast and have fun. No need to grind, just some FPS and story and puzzles."
10094,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

the xen part sucks tho and I am not the only one who thinks that
the music is epic and diabolical adrenaline guitar makes me wanna start grooving
the grunts do the funi quotes and the story is epic
good game"
10097,"Half-Life is a very nice game. The graphics might not be the best but the story is awesome. The gameplay is very dense. It might come a little challenging at first but when you get used to it, there is a lot in this game. I would always prefer Half-Life 2 but still, this game is a masterpiece. I had finished this game 2 times before and still playing it. Someday playing it would be great for everyone."
10098,"Still worth playing in 2021! Surprisingly challenging AI that caught me off guard when I began playing. Finished the game on medium (regular?) difficulty and had a blast. Also, something kind of corny that I liked was the little small remarks the scientists have in the beginning. It could be me, but that, and the other small details make it feel like you are really showing up to work at the Black Mesa Research Facility."
10099,great old game worth playing over and over
10100,"Not exactly the most beautiful game ever, but I played this for the first time in 2021. If you're sensitive to the blood and gore there's a child lock, but I didn't use it on any of the GoldSrc games. It's a classic game that gave me a ton of fun while playing it."
10101,Why was I the only one of my friends who played this growing up?
10102,has some bullshit glitches that require cheating to get out of and a very unfun boss fight. Other than those problems the game was very good.
10103,i like shooting the scientists
10104,"I feel nostalgic, even though I hadn't been born yet when it was released
10/10, the harder, the more fun"
10105,"Gotta be honest, never heard of Half-Life until I became a PC gamer in 2012. Played Half-Life 2 about two years later after buying it to play Garry's Mod, which I loved. I knew enough of the story to get through the second game and loved it. One of the best games I've ever played. 

FINALLY got around to playing the majority of Half-Life 1 for the last couple of weeks. I've played the first 30 minutes on and off over the last 5 years. First 30 minutes is slow and boring IMO. But I pushed through. And dear god, I've been missing out. The game is not your standard FPS. You ""could"" go in guns blazing, but the game heavily encourages you to be at least a little smart about how you play. You get to a point where you actually enjoy reloading a save after scanning how many enemies are in a room, and blowing them up with trip mines and grenades. Then taking the rest out with your trusty shotgun. At one point I spent five minutes brain storming how to take out these soldiers in the generator room elevator in a creative way. I ended up setting a trip mine right in the middle of the elevator, pressed the button and laughed my ass off as they came down and exploded in a gory mess.

That's when I knew this game was special. The goldsrc engine isn't Source, I know. It's certainly not that impressive. But the creative gameplay mechanics makes up for it. You'll spend a lot of time in the first half playing the ""where the f*ck do I go"" game, but you'll get the hang of it. Don't feel bad for looking up Youtube walkthroughs though. IMO, if you spend too much time trying to figure out where to go, it gets boring and makes you want to quit. So I say go for it. 

TL;DR: This game is fucking awesome. Standard FPS players will take some time to get used to it. But it's worth it."
10106,"Replayed it after some time, and honestly it's still as good. It has some ""problems"" due to its age but it's super well made, although Xen is not as good as the Black Mesa facility in terms of design, I still enjoyed it. Some guns are weak, or rather some enemies are really resistant to some of these guns but if you swap wisely and have good aim, you can manage your ammo and not have problems. I'd like if we had ambient music more often but when a track comes, it feels special. It's fun to hear all the meme sounds nowadays xD"
10107,"A very good first-person-shooter, which had good graphics when it released and is atmospheric. It is still enjoyable as it of it's exciting environment."
10108,it is the best microvawe game i ever played
10109,Half-Life init.
10110,It is a good game
10111,I love playing as my favorite character John Half-Life in Half-Life
10112,"I just wanna do the thing that tells eople to play it, please steam release my family it is a good game"
10113,A fine piece of art
10114,"Quite a good game, I don't think it should cost $9.99 anymore, so just wait for a sale.

The boss battle isn't that good but the rest of the game and its combat is just pure pleasure.

Absolutely worth it, seriously."
10115,why are you looking for negative reviews! just go buy this game!
10116,"It's been over a decade since the last time I played this masterpiece of a game and it's just as I remembered it when first playing it. 

I can imagine it's pretty difficult for gamers nowadays to play (close to the original) Half-Life 1, considering that there's a source version as well as the superior Black Mesa version. That being said, there's something truly special about the vanilla version.

Having gone back after all these years, I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. The game still holds well even after all these years. It ran perfectly on my system, it easily supported 2k resolution and overall the game ran flawlessly, with only this weird echo in the game that's bothersome at first, but you get used to it eventually (never figured out how to turn it off).

Do I recommend this game? Yes, I really do, it's one of the games that enhanced story telling in games as well as improving the overall FPS genre. On that same breath, I understand that this game is pretty old now. If graphics is a bother to you, then perhaps consider playing the Black Mesa version. It's really worth getting into the game."
10117,"This game i perfection.
I find this game impressive since this is made in 1998.
I'll give it a thumbs up because valve deserves it."
10118,
10119,Played half life 2 in my childhood back in 2012 but i am finally playing this and it was worth it.
10120,this game is so good it's hard to put it in words
10121,"Man this was nostalgic, It's still fun from over a decade ago."
10122,"The game that shot Valve into headlines around the world, and cemented narrative based FPS games as a viable option.

I don't really need to speak praises about this game, as aside from animations and the obviously dated graphics, this game holds up exceedingly well gameplay wise.  Also, while Black Mesa (The community based remake of this game) does exist, it also has changes made that while they are mostly for the better, they still aren't very faithful to the original. You should really consider playing this before Black Mesa so you can appreciate it better, but if dated graphics kill it for you then the first half of Black Mesa stays mostly faithful.

I can't recommend it for $10 as it nearly always goes on sale for $1 or less every other major sale, but it's still an absolute yes you should buy it."
10123,do you like gordon freeman?.... then you will love this game. buy now for only 11.27 dolars each set sold seperatley
10124,its a bad game looks like shit

10127,funny scientist valve game
10128,allows you to become the best theoretical physicist in existence great game good puzzles and action
10129,"I was introduced to this '98 classic via shitposts with videos of cats with the sound effects of this game. Mentions of this game were also in reviews of other boomer-shooters from the era, but nothing was clicking with me. Quake looked cool, but It was missing something. A story. I really like cinema, and I always tell my friends, ""Half-Life is a game for people who want to watch a movie."" So the existence of a cinematic, action-platform fps is just really neat. I was also streaming the game on Discord with a few of my friends that didn't really care for the game, but they commented on how the game seemed to age with grace. Also the multiplayer is  a nice thing to add to it. 10/10. :)"

10137,AMAZING
10138,A true masterpiece that lives on even to this day.

10140,Wonder when they‚Äôre gonna make the sequel
10141,Next game should be called full life
10142,"Good Game, 8/10"
10143,It‚Äôs the reason why any of this exists. Play it already!
10144,good gfame
10145,"Half-Life is a pretty good game, sure the graphics are dated and Black Mesa is a modern remake of it, but you should still play this instead of the other versions (HL:S, Black Mesa)

Xen isnt as bad as people say it is, I got past it in like an hour

9/10: Barely any annoying bits, I dont get what people are on about when it comes to Xen.
Tip: Controllers (Floating guys with the big heads) can be killed in one magnum shot and 3 pistol shots."
10146,epic game from 1998
10147,filled cum jizz bum
10148,"This was the beginning of a game that touched our lives. As being a game from 1998, imagine if Half-Life had more fame, it could have changed the now-future. Absolutely amazing.

P.S.: Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar is an underrated track."
10149,A classic
10150,Why are you reading this review? It's Half-Life. Play it!
10151,"Best shooter 10/10 - Me at 12 years old.

10153,I mean what do you want me to say lol its fucking half life
10154,best game ever
10155,"Although it is VERY old at this point, it still amazed me on my first playthrough. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a fun challenge, some puzzles, and doesn't mind the outdated graphics."
10156,Straight out of 1998. A classic for the ages. Play it.
10157,A really good game from its time and valves started off half life 10/10
10158,"the servers are still active, i think that says it all for a 1998 game"
10159,addicting.
10160,"Very Slow at the beginning but gets super fun and requires at least 5 brain cells to get through, don't take my word I only put 8 hours in. This game could knowing it came out in 1998 run on a calculator. Would recommend!"
10161,"A classic must play. Come on, it's Half-Life. You can't not play it!"
10162,"nuclear mission jam is the greatest piece of music I have ever heard in a game.
period.

this game is incredible and an experience, I would have to rate it as the second greatest goldsrc title ever."
10163,est√° bueno pero zzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZ
10164,"Classic shooter. Great story, great shooting lots of fun."
10165,"good game

10177,"This is the best game I have ever played (after Minecraft). Voice acting, Storyline, Everything is great. Keeping in count that this is from 1998 I'd say that this is one of valve's best games."
10178,you know it's a classic.
10179,i fucking hate those flying things in the late game
10180,Truly a classic game! One that any gaming aficionado must play. This game really brings me back to a more simple time of first person shooters. Back when the game didn't depend on online play and integrated puzzles and skill in addition to all of the shooting. The length of the game is on par with a lot of modern games and has a simple yet captivating story line.
10181,"Half-Life is great
"
10182,In my opinion its a very good game and if you are a fan of fps games with good story and gameplay you might enjoy this too.
10183,"Unlike a more traditional shooter in which you go out guns blazing destroying everything, you really have to think your next move on this game or there will be long-lasting consequences until you can find a health and charging station. It took a while to get used to and at first I didnt really understand the game, but giving it a second chance was a good idea cause I had a much better time with it after I understood the mechanics and how it worked."

10206,"Still great fun after all these years.

Played it for decades, recently bought it on Steam. 

They're waiting for you, Gordon..."
10207,"One of the most notorious milestones in the gaming industry. Despite the fact that this game is around 23 years old as of today, and the graphics and physics are well outdated and janky, it's still a really fun and engaging experience from beginning till the end. Any person that likes first person shooters must play this game."
10208,"This game was atrocious, even for its time. It was difficult to even play due to it softlocking all the time. As for the gameplay, it's styled like a classic shoot-em-up, but the combat is so awful and paired with even worse movement, you end up basically having to save-scum after you kill *any* enemy at all. Enemy AI is terrible and you can softlock yourself by killing an enemy and having its corpse block doorways/passages. Health regeneration is inconsistent at best and doesn't scale with the difficulty of enemies or number of them. Would not recommend this at all"
10209,The game is extremely fun!! I reccomend to anybody who has a computer.
10210,duh
10211,This game holds up for being as old as me.  Half-life is an engaging shooter with great puzzles and a well paced story.  Totally worth picking up and playing in my humble opinion.  To answer my favorite security guard I do think there is a cold beer for us at the end of all this.  Hop to it they are waiting for you in the test chamber after all what could go wrong.
10212,iconic
10213,"playing for first time in 2021. Along with Ocarina of TIme, so far ahead of its time it's frightening. 
Play this game, then play the rest. Don't be a dummy."

10221,I want a Headcrab as a pet
10222,the graphics are a bit outdated
10223,"I get the whole idea of not holding the player's hand but there were many MANY times where I was confused on where to go and they ended up being a little tunnel that looks like it wasn't apart of the path the game was going. The only sense of urgency I got was from rushing to finish the game than the actual combat. The fights were just annoying, frustrating or just boring and I ended up running past most of them in the end. Game was well made just not that entertaining."
10224,"it good ""falls of parkor course and breaks legs"""
10225,"I would give it 9/10 just because Half Life 2 is better. Apart from that, game is just awesome, even in 2021. Black Mesa Research Facility is perfectly made place for game. The map is  really interesting and fun. If there would not be Half Life 2 this would be 10/10 and best game I'll ever played and will play."

10239,"Very nostalgic, brings me a lot of childhood memories."
10240,A Classic Masterpiece the tone and setting of each level of the game was carefully constructed and well executed would be in my  top 100 for sure
10241,"I don't really know if i can add to the discussion of this game, because anything that could be said about Half-Life right now, has been said. I won't say it's a flawless game - it's not. Models haven't aged the best, NPC AI isn't exactly, well, intelligent, and certain chapters of the game (On a Rail, the Xen chapters) feel like Valve punishing the player for becoming too relaxed while playing the game. But that doesn't mean that Half-Life is a bad game - far from it. Not only did Half-Life introduce world-building and environmental storytelling never seen before in the FPS genre, it introduced a more tactical approach to FPS combat, encouraging smart and quick thinking as opposed to the common ""Run into room and blow lead into every moving being"". While this may frustrate first time players that are more used to the fast-paced unstoppable game play of, say, Doom or Blood, Half-Life's punishing nature encourages the player to think tactically and logistically, and use all available tools to overcome the challenges they must face.

Overall, Half-Life is an absolute must-play for any FPS fan that provides some of the most engaging and difficult game play ever seen in a video game."

10250,i genuinely have no idea how i was attracted to this game so much back then there's nothing special here
10251,"This game is for rated T on the ESRB rating system. I recommend this game for the time off, or have nothing better to do with there time. In this case i'm one of those type. This game is graphic but in a fantasy type First person shooting type of graphics. the render of graphic content, has blood when shot at. also depending on the graphics card you might have will very, in graphic content. You can adjust these things, in settings in the game."

10254,"Pra uma pessoa que come√ßou a gostar de jogos focados em narrativa l√° por 2010, foi bem surpreendente ver como um jogo de 1998 tem uma hist√≥ria t√£o criativa como Half -Life. √â claro que, ao jog√°-lo em 2021, senti que HL1 envelheceu mal e que suas mec√¢nicas de gameplay est√£o bem obsoletas (talvez minha opini√£o nesse aspecto seja minorit√°ria), mas, mesmo que esse aspecto tenha me incomodado por diversos momentos, a hist√≥ria de Half-Life me fisgou o suficiente pra receber uma nota positiva. 6,5/10."
10255,FUN DEATHMATCH
10256,"Very nice game ....great story ...and very entertaining.
worth buying and playing!!
RECOMMENDED!!!"
10257,"It may be old but there's still fun to be had, It may be ugly but it's still creative and it may be outdated but it still plays rather well. Xen is pretty horrible but going back and playing through the game in 2021, Xen doesn't last very long so just use the revolver and crossbow and it's a breeze."
10258,"Where it all started. One of the founding fathers of modern gaming. It introduced being able to have a story in a first person shooter, Anybody that has played a game in the 90s has played it and a lot of people afterwards. An absolute classic. The gameplay is amazing with how interesting the combat can be and the story revolving around you which has been used in most single player valve games afterwards really makes you feel like Gordon Freeman. A normal guy at a lab where everything went wrong. You really feel like you're progressing to the surface throughout the game and even in the end which is pretty awful you just feel like you went from a man to a god. Of course this game is old and a little outdated. The puzzles can feel a bit tacky and weirdly put together but it's a very solid experience.
8/10"
10259,The music sounds great and the game is challenging. The only problem is that some parts are really stupid and either aren't obvious or are just unfair.

10281,Literally the least fun single player game I've played in years. I don't know why people praise it so highly. An absolute slog of boring platforming and the same enemies over and over inside drab environments. I've never played a single player game that I didn't finish but I really don't want to finish this lol.
10282,What a legendary game. 10/10
10283,this game is really fun and good it was one of the best games i ever played
10284,cool
10285,"I've tried to play this. Honestly, I've tried. I just can't get into it. It's not my kind of game. If you enjoy it, all the power to you! I just find the game more frustrating than fun. Is it possible this is because the game released in 1998 and I am looking at it from a modern viewpoint? Possible. But I just have yet to have fun playing this game in my multiple attempts to enjoy it. I just don't see the hype. Maybe with another 3.5 hours I'll get into it."
10286,This game is a gamer moment.
10287,"its a fun action packed story rich and amazing game although its not just full of guns shooting monsters no there's actually a lot of puzzle solving and is very fun but not too difficult and the combat is fair although their are a few problems its an old game an old game with lots of bugs but the graphics are fine but if you want a better looking game black mesa is a game I recommend but buy and play this first and then black mesa to one really appreciate black mesa and half life and to support valve for a truly amazing game and a side note that there's if you have an 11-16 year old and think that this game is too violent there's and option to turn off blood and gruesome deaths (would not recommend in half life 2 episode 2) effectively turning it into a T game overall I recommend both this game and black mesa.

10288,"its fun and confusing

Fun game"
10290,"nice cock, mister freeman"
10291,i felt a whole generation older playing this
10292,"Very good game. the graphics are outdated sure but the graphics highlights the best of this games amazing quality. the horror aspect is there because you don't know when a pesky headcrab is going to jump at you and scare the living shit out of you because everything is lit up the game, doesn't reli on dark areas to try to scare you unlike most horror games, because everything is lit up you don't suspect anything until it happens. The story is really good, gameplay is absolutly amazing. Not alot of games these days create gameplay and story as or even close to as good as this.



20/10 would recommend."
10293,"This is an amazing classic but it is so incredibly old that you would have a lot more fun playing the fan remake ""Black Mesa"". It has the same lore but upgrades the graphics and physics engine. (From goldsource to source). You can still play this for the nostalgia though! Half-Life 2 has had a much longer life probably because it's engine was so advanced for it's time it still holds up to this day."

This game is extremely difficult, but in the most stupid ways possible but it can be kinda fun when you get past all the stupid difficulty spikes and sometimes poor map design.

Then, as a teen he decided to play this game again and got the experience of his life, and much more.

10396,"[h1]HALF-LIFE... the game that started it all for VALVE Software and our voiceless hero, GORDON FREEMAN![/h1]

Ah the original game... played COUNTLESS times in my college life... a game that I used to play at least twice per year before we got flooded with so many games year after year. Honestly, I must have finished HL1 at least 20 times ever since 1998 (I still got the original box!!!) And now, I haven't played this vanilla version in TEN YEARS... so since I just finished BLACK MESA DEFINITIVE EDITION and HALF-LIFE ALYX, I was like... what the heck! Let's revisit the good old ones then get around HL2 while at it!

So what can be said about HL1? A masterpiece game. At launch, it was perfection. Now in 2021, it clearly show it's age. There's no doubt about that! Still, the game runs pretty damn well on modern system and even support ultrawide monitor 21:9 ratio without any issues. (Your aim cursor is pretty small though!).

Sounds, music, voice acting, level design (most of it), gameplay... everything is amazing of this game. 
No wonder I kept (re)playing it so many times!

The only gripes I got with this game... the ""crouch-jump, the ladders and the strange ""toilet sound"" when underwater, the XEN platforming is irritating even today! Crouch-jump works mostly okay but at times, doesn't register properly. Never liked that mechanic ever since 1999 to this day in 2021. As for the ladders, you can easily fall down from it and at times, you seem glued to 'em. As for the toilet sound, it's mostly funny when you do hear that but get's annoying the longer you're underwater. XEN levels are much shorter in HL compared to BMDE but has annoying platforming. And the jump-module is triggered by the awful crouch-jump...

For the newcomers or those who never played Half-Life (which is a total BLASPHEMY in my PC Gamer bible), it is quite worth to play this original version. HOWEVER, you could simply focus your attention to BLACK MESA DEFINITIVE EDITION, which is an outstanding recreation of HL1. Main differences between the two games: cut down content in the ""ON A RAIL"" chapter and maybe a few other portions in the beginning of BMDE. Although, XEN is much MUCH longer in BMDE. It looks and plays fabulously AMAZING too!


[h1]So what's HALF-LIFE?[/h1]
[b]You're Gordon Freeman... and... well, everyone knows his story! He's just 27 (even if he's born in 1973), MIT graduate and earned a PhD in theoretical physics. He was employed to Black Mesa Research Facility as a Level 3 Research Associate Scientist.. even played hide&seek in the vents with his good pal Barney Calhoun! Gordon's a genius. He worked at BMRF for a while until one bad day late for work, the infamous feared RESONANCE CASCADE scenario occurred. That is when he get's to fight for his own survival at first but eventually, becomes a legendary hero for the Human Resistance war against the COMBINE...[/b]

[h1]I'd suggest you go read his fandom wiki page, very informative![/h1]
[url=https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Gordon_Freeman] GORDON FREEMAN[/url]


[h1]PROS:[/h1]
[b]+EVERYTHING?
Honestly, the game may not have good visuals today but at launch back in 1998, they weren't amazing either. They were good for the time since it used that good old reliable Quake 2 engine. The A.I. was impressive back then too. Gameplay and especially the story is where the game shines the most in my opinion.[/b]

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
[b]-Crouch-jumping (just awful even today!).
-Ladder climb is quite edgy as you can fall easily.
-""Toilet-sound"" when underwater.
-XEN platforming is annoying![/b]


[h1]OVERALL:[/h1]
[b]AMAZING FPS game worthy to revisit (for FPS old timers!) and even to newcomers. If you played BLACK MESA, give this original game a shot. I found it much easier compared to BMDE.[/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]OF COURSE! This game got my personal badge of honor! One of the few game that I can safely stamp MASTERPIECE all over it. HALF-LIFE is in my TOP 5 best games EVER. You can say that after eleven years, yeah I was due to replay it![/b]



[i]And on to continue my revisit of the Half-Life franchise to the amazing Opposing Force & Blue Shift Expansions... then Half-Life 2 with its two Episodes!

A real shame I never got to play Half-Life: Decay but there is an ongoing project to resurrect it by the name of PEER REVIEW (mod).[/i]"

As of by this review I have completed Half life for the very first time and all I have to say is ,this game is really revolutionary during 1998 it has done a lot of things that most fps games at that time didn't,it did something unique during the 1990's by making the protagonist not feel as if it were a bad ass already but a bad ass in the end of their journey.The interactivity in this world is phenomenal,allowing you to interact with NPCS,buttons,levers,turrets and etc.,well for NPCS,they do not do so much but following you for requesting them for specific tasks that Gordon Freeman can't do,it makes Gordon more like if he's part of the world,but not him as the world.During the Gameplay you can experience that not all NPCS are against you,HECU's for example are hostile against Gordon Freeman,black mesa personnel,and various aliens,this gives them much more room for creativity when it comes to level design.The atmosphere in this game at the time of it's release was unique and revolutionary it made you feel so small,and making some structures if it were part of the facility making fallen or destroyed debris a path because of the resonance cascade,however this game is a masterpiece in game design,but there are some flaws,the graphics of the gold source engine are really dated,that's why turning on HD content is really recommended even if it doesn't follow it's proper view,now I don't focus mainly on graphics unless if it disrupts the gameplay,so that's why I'm giving it a low deduction,now however when you reach Xen in the later part of the game the level design and platforming is a bit uncomfortable,being that there is zero gravity that means you really can't maneuver that much in the air,that's why when there are these jump pads in Xen you better angle yourself on which platform you want to land on,and sometimes when it comes to moving platforms in Xen yeah it can get a bit tricky at times,half life at the time of this game I really lowered my expectations about the soundtrack,but boy was I wrong,there were some amazing music whether it would be atmospheric such as ""Vague Voices"",and ""Space Ocean"",to the loud,impactful and adrenaline filled music such as ""Nuclear Space Jam"",""Adrenaline Horror"",and ""Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar"" to even the fun and enjoyful kind of music such as ""Klaxon Beat"",and ""Credits Closing Theme"".This game all in all is a massive achievement in gaming,it's a masterpiece from it's story telling and it's atmosphere,so would I recommend you this game?

For the sake of nostalgia trip go ahead and buy this game

If you think that these issues will hinder your Gameplay a bit then I recommend a more faithful and much better remake then I highly recommend purchasing Black Mesa

10424,It was interesting.
10425,"I know this game is a classic, but god did I have a frustrating time playing it, wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't been the one buying it"
10426,"Half life is a masterpeice,I love it for it's corny NPCS, for its focus on interactivity and story and Guns that are just magnificent, (Tau cannon should've been in 2) Balanced Gameplay. Varying difficulty settings, a training room, Deathmatch, Fun to fight AI that'll make you really think. It's nowhere near half life 2's balance but its fun to learn, it's very much enjoyable, Then theres Xen. Xen is like you got a fancy new suit, and spaghetti sauce just fell on it. Xen is okay, it's not as good as the rest. But it ruins the pacing. Highly recommend this game. After you play the full series, you'll understand why we so desperately want a finale. The finale leaves you thirsting for more gun play, especially with your newest toy you got (The Gluon gun) So you can head out for deathmatch where all your shooting skills get put to the test against other players in servers with varying player counts. I wish good will to those who helped make this game. In conclusion, Half life is a really good experience, Half life 2 is on a whole nother level. The fast paced marine AI, THE SETPIECES, THE PERFECTLY TIMED MUSIC,GORDON FREEMAN, THE HEADCRABS, THE INTRIGUING PREMISE, THE G-MAN, THE CROWBAR. It's all iconic."
10427,"I got this game due to the great reputation it has. I didn't really know what it was really about but I'm glad I decided to get into this series. It has a bit of a puzzle aspect requiring you to go back and forth between different places in order to progress through the game. I was also caught off guard with a few jump scares, but it is a really good game. And it's a lot less scary when you replay it (or don't go into it blind like I did)"

10452,"Fantastic game! This is the first time I play Half-Life, my second Valve game, and WOW I had missed on something great! The very final levels (from chapter 15 onwards) are not as excellent as the other levels, but still the game is fantastic. It's also great that Valve keeps this running this smooth in current computers. That's something many other developers could learn to do. Overall this was a great experience!

10461,gordon freeman
10462,Very good game
10463,It lived up to its expectations. I understand now why it's regarded so highly
10464,An absolute classic in the shooter genre. Holds up extremely well despite being 23 years old.
10465,This was better than I thought it would be. I thought it was going to be over hyped. I didn't judge it for graphics or anything like that for not being modern. It was a good game on it's own. The story and game play were engaging enough and they mixed it up so it wasn't stale. It's been years since I played it last and the idea of booting it up again and taking it for a spin isn't offensive.
10466,story is great if you want to get into the half life story play this and the expansion packs
10467,very cool

10472,"Game is boring i dont understand why most of the reviews recommend this game? couldnt go further than 3 hrs . first of all movement is so fuc*ked up and audio is another story , and you cant talk to anybody u just walk and shoot some aliens and soldiers , 
and u spend all your time in a tunnel underground. 
and there is no guide for missions you can spend much time trying to figure something that could be done in a much less time if there is clarity in the game.

10476,anxiously waiting for the sequel.  hope it releases some day!!!!!!1!1!
10477,I put butter in a machine and accidentally caused an alien invasion. Also I fought the US military and the boss baby.
10478,"This is an extremely good game and an all time classic. However be warned, due to it being an old-school shooter, the difficulty is high even on normal difficulty. While I recommend it, if you aren't used to old school shooters or want to experience half life but a more modern take, get Black Mesa. If you want the original experience, play this. You won't regret it."
10479,yes
10480,this made me wonder who ate all the doughnuts
10481,"I can see how a lot of inspirations came from this game. It's very fun and sometimes for me very difficult, what a gem."
10482,"best shooter since doom, cant wait until the second"
10483,i wanted to play this game but i realized that i cant because i have no-life
10484,It's just a burning memory
10485,"what's wrong with you. you're looking at the negative reviews for Half-Life. you horrible, horrible person. BUY. THE. GAME."
10486,Simply The Best (Avoid The Source Version Tho)
10487,"yeah this is cool and started the wasd era


also try black mesa for improved graphics"
10488,"Still amazing even after all these years -- and trust me, I haven't played this in a looong time. Even still, I played it non-stop from start to finish without missing a beat. One of those legendary titles that you can never go wrong with."
10489,Fun game ngl. pretty slow for a while but it picks up
10490,This happened to my buddy Eric
10491,I love this game.
10492,"good game, hope they make a half life 2!"
10493,goode game.
10494,"Please, for your sake, get this game. It's beyond words how much I love Half Life."
10495,gud
10496,cool
10497,seems boring at a glance but you just get roped in one you figure out what to do. some spots where i got stuck and took a break but overall amazing
10498,staph
10499,"I remember hearing of the historical significance of half life and the infinite praise this game received by people that i watched online. In my mind, i regarded this game as almost legendary because it was a game that was really good, still available, yet available nowhere (i didn't have a pc back then) I got a pc and i got the game and played it. It was a unique experience. Honestly, I've seen lesser older games be ported onto every console generation, and it bothers me how this one isn't."
10500,didnt finish
10501,good
10502,"I love this game. The movement is a lot of fun, the soundtrack and environments are fantastic and I really could wander the early Black Mesa levels for hours, and I think it holds up pretty well."
10503,Do i really need to say anything? Its half life. Get it.
10504,its 1 hard game its it hell of good
10505,"OKAY, yeah this game is important and was revolutionary for the time. But you can't deny it has aged terribly. The combat is a chore, puzzles are boring and the platforming is... Half Life 1 platforming. The first few chapters are enjoyable and have a great atmosphere, but after a while it keeps getting more tedious. It's worth checking out for a history lesson in PC gaming and a good atmosphere but you should really lower your expectations for a game that's held in such high regard."
10506,half life pog
10507,Basically Valve's best game
10508,"For god's sake open the silo doors...

5/5"
10509,"An FPS classic though aged still a great ride if your a fan of the genre or enjoy  late 90's early 00's era games. get this version over source as that version is actually in a worse condtion from what I hear , game ran well on anything I put it on basically , with  only a couple bugs that caused me issuies such as getting stuck in objects a few times."
10510,hambgurb
10511,its fine i guess
10512,yummy
10513,cxhbsdfbdfxcv
10514,Next to the original Doom. Simply the best first person shooter ever made!
10515,"Great game
"
10516,"game stopped working and wont launch, what should I do?
Ive tried uninstalling and installing, but it still won't work."
10517,"""hey dad, how come mom named my sister roses?""
""she named her after the thing she loves most""
""thanks dad""
""no problem, Half-Life - Klaxon Beat - Extended Mix"""
10518,amazing.
10519,"LIfe is halved
"
10520,fun game
10521,"Decided to give this a try after seeing the praise it still receives. The graphics are definitely dated but I could see myself in awe at what they achieved in the 90's. Gameplay is fun although it can get repetitive sometimes but overall manages to keep your interest. 
Great game to play if you want to see how Fps's evolved over the years and this was one of the most acclaimed  games and rightfully so."
10522,The crowbar is the only good weapon
10523,Best game
10524,Half-Life IS God
10525,"Idc if it's ""revolutionary""

Poopoo wah wah the game was hard"
10526,nvm
10527,e
10528,probably good idk I didn't play it
10529,Hell yeah this game is really really good!
10530,GREAT GAME. I love this. 100/10 fun highly recommend
10531,"when i think of the word ""groovy"" this is the first thing that comes to mind"
10532,"WARNING: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. JUST WATCH A SUMMARY AND SKIP TO AN ACTUAL GOOD GAME LIKE ""HALF-LIFE 2"". THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF TIME WITH POOR PACING, UNAVOIDABLE HITS, AND MORE. I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS. THE GAME MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD IN THE YEAR 1998, BUT IT IS NOT 1998."
10533,is half life. half life is fun. guns.

10552,"Really not much to say on this game. It's a classic, and if you don't own it you should.

Gordon is an enjoyable character, and while he doesn't speak, you still grow a connection to him. This is expanded on in Half-Life 2. I also enjoyed the other characters that appear throughout the game, including the scientists, G-Man, etc.

The gameplay is fun, I thoroughly enjoyed the shooting and the game seriously posed a challenge at times. All the guns sound meaty and pack a real punch behind them. The platforming was a little frustrating at times, but never outright bad.

The only problem I really had with the game is that it doesn't hold your hand at all. Which can be good, but at the same time, it left me wandering around for good chunks of time with no clue on what to do. This resulted on me looking up guides a handful of times. Also, the final boss took me a minute to figure out."

10565,"I came to this game late, playing it for the first time ever last year. I really enjoyed it! 

In my opinion, this was better than Half Life 2 and all the other titles. It has elements of horror, which I love, and it doesn't become 'cutesie' like the later games in the series. 

Definitely recommend!"

10580,"This is a great game. My computer has so much stuff and games on it that it will lag almost all of the time. But this game has low graphics, so I don't need to worry about lag. The only problem is that the game says I am playing it when I am playing something else. I tried manual stopping, but it didn't work. I tried restarting steam, but it said that Half-Life needed to be stopped in order to sign out. I didn't want to restart my computer, so that option was was thrown into orbit via satellite rocket (pun from the rocket. Please laugh) I would like for the developer(s) to try to fix this problem. I don't know if it has happened to other players or just me, but please fix it for it is annoying. But thanks for the awesome game! :D Edit: I finally managed to stop the game, re-install it, and beat the final boss. This was a not awesome game, but a legendary game. There is no other game that could beat this game in my opinion. Best game ever."
10581,I still remember the first time I played this game bright as day; It's a masterpiece if you can forgive it's slightly aged graphics.

(I was gifted this game. Best gift i got)"
10594,"Very fun, to an 11 year old. I asked my dad, what valve game should i play? he said Half-Life, and apparently he had the 1998 CD of it, it wouldnt boot up on Windows 10 though, but we quickly discovered that if we enter the serial code into the add a game section then Activate a product on steam, then not only would we get Half-Life, we would also get the expansion packs and about 6 other games. Worth it! 10/10"

I think it has good graphic design considering when it was made
"
10607,"I will not be the first to praise this game, and most likely will not be the last. This alone speaks to the transcendence this game has achieved. Each part of this game has been intricately developed, way ahead of its time. Half-Life has reached a level of excellence rarely seen in its time and genre, and has led to a mass exodus of well developed games. I can, without a doubt, attribute the title of gem to this game."
10608,Sexy Headcrabs
10609,Its time to choose
10610,Yesh.
10611,Classic.
10612,"Half-Life is a science-fiction story about Gordon Freeman, who is a scientist working in a research facility, and is the stories' protagonist. One day, when Gordon arrives at the installation, an experiment is scheduled. Assisted by his colleagues, Gordon joins the experiment.

The world is seen from the protagonist's own viewpoint.
During play, the protagonist makes a continuous journey through contiguous environments, which drives the story onwards. The protagonist may be moved to travel in all directions, on foot, through liquids, or by vehicles. The protagonist may also wear and carry items, mostly firearms, protection, and tools.
The environments are interactive, and have hazards that must be overcome. The protagonist may fail, but progress is kept safe and allows continuation.

The protagonist may engage with various actors, who may interact with the environment and with each other, by making use of ingenious dialogue, or by talking to, or mentioning the protagonist. This interaction between these characters is immersive.
The protagonist controls direct, immediate, and precise, which is practical for aiming, navigating, and avoiding hazards.
Half-Life is inspiring, and can be played with others and modified. Install [i]Half-Life SDK[/i] from the [i]tools section[/i] in the [i]Steam library[/i], to gain access to the world-editor.

10621,"7,5/10"
10622,It's basically one of the games that revolutionized the fps video game genre. It's a game you should buy if you are to play some of the best fps games that marked the fps genre.
10623,Fuck that big claw monster part.
10624,"It's a little dated, but if you can get over the graphics and some gameplay elements, then you'll have a great time playing!"
10625,"I played Half-Life 2 and the episodes for as long as I had been actually playing videogames, when I got it on the Orange Box with the original intent of playing Portal 2. I loved how it encouraged thought and using the environment in new and interesting ways in order to get past the forces in your path. I loved the story despite the missing portion of the Black Mesa incident having never played the original game.

About three days ago I sold an item on the marketplace for about $10.00 and I decided that I would pick up this game which has been a gap in my experience with the series, and shooters as a whole. I did not, and never will, regret that decision.

Half-Life still holds up despite its date of release in 1998, but not in a graphical or bugwise sense. It brings to the table that wonderful thought-provoking gameplay that encompasses everything from strategic planning and resource management, to quick well-honed reflexes and snap decisions. The troubles you face while battling through Black Mesa rarely give way to brute force, but instead to cunning, rational reasoning, and even some of the most outrageous and ridiculous ""Hail Mary""s I have ever had the pleasure of conceiving.

If you can manage to get over occasional confusing level design and the [spoiler] frustrating, boring, and slow-paced Xen levels, [/spoiler] I'm sure anyone with the desire to spend 10-15 hours on this game (or more for replays) will have an excellent time.

For the best experience, play blindly, with no walkthroughs, on hard mode. It will get frustrating, sure, but remember there is always a solution. Finding these solutions is a source of immense satisfaction, fulfillment, and excitement. You will not regret the experience."
10626,On a Rail makes me want to smash my balls with a hammer
10627,"Half Life is one of the most known shooters of all time. Half life is a story game where Gordon Freeman works at Black mesa and fucks up and causes a Resonance Cascade. You cannot forget the world of half life, the enemies, the allies, the maps, and last but not least, the guns. You can run Half life on everything most likely, just ask your mom to buy you something that a homeless guy offered you for 300 bucks and you could probably run this game. While Half life is probably older than you and me, it still holds up as an amazing game and if you haven't played it, please check it out. The world building in this game is insane and has a great story if you pay close attention. The guns in this game are fantastic to use and there are 14 different weapons to use. The allies in enemies are unforgetable with the Scientists, the Security Guards, The Imposing force/MECU Soldiers, Creatures from Xen, and even the Black ops soldiers. The game can be hard and it's very unforgiving and you have to stay on your toes throughout the whole experience. The gunplay feels amazing and still holds up to this day. Though, all amazing games have flaws. The Xen part of this game is extremely long and boring and the graphics suck balls. The overall graphics of this game are shit but still good for its time. A few parts in this game like on a rail can seem extremely boring and tedious. And sometimes the game breaks and does random shit.

Overall I'd say this game is currently a 79/100 but for its time a def 95/100. If you cannot bear the graphics I recommend playing Black mesa."
10628,"One of the greatest and most influential FPS games of all time. When it first came out Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre. And still to this day, you can feel it's effects on many FPS games. Before Half-Life there was DOOM, Wolfenstein. These games were just about running and gunning. Half-Life changed that formula. You can see that in the opening section in the game. Half-Life slowed down the gameplay and added more elements. In Half-Life, you have to be tactical. You can't rush into every enemy otherwise you'll be dead before you know it. You have to use every tool in your arsenal to get out of tricky situations. Half-Life was a huge deal back then and now years later playing it feels really good. The soundtrack is good, weapons sounds are great and gunplay is amazing. Level design is superb. There are platforming sections, stealth sections, creepy sections, we have lots of variety. The story is well written, characters are memorable. Mysterious G-Man, security guard Barney, protagonist Gordon Freeman, everyone has a charm to them. Enemy design is great. Headcrabs, houndeyes, every alien has a distinct feature and distinct behaviour. This game was ahead of its time, and it shows. It really is a masterpiece and better than most of the FPS games come out nowadays. If you are a FPS game fan and haven't played it, you definitely should play it. Half-Life is and always will be every FPS lover's favourite game."

10651,"Half-Life is an old game with dated graphics, but the gameplay is still great. There are many varying locations to explore and many different weapons with unique mechanics to collect. The difficulty varies between different areas throughout the story. Some areas give you plenty of ammunition, and others don't. I got this game cheap from the Valve Complete Pack, and as a whole I would recommend it."
10652,"it wont fucking close
"
10653,"Outstanding game, except for Xen."
10654,It's good I guess
10655,"Half Life is a solid game and I wholeheartedly think this game is worth your time

But that aside, I'd just like to take a moment and appreciate the fact that this game is still accessible today. Think about it, a nearly 23 year old game can still be bought through official means, and still runs perfectly on modern hardware without workarounds. I can't overstate how much of a godsend this is, especially considering how other games from around that same time can't even be played nowadays without older operating systems or even older hardware in some cases. Hell, even games that came out way after Half-Life still sometimes have issues with modern hardware. Crysis can't even run on Windows 10 systems without workarounds, yet Half-Life just runs out of the box. Had this game not have been easily accessible, it wouldn't have as big of a legacy as it currently does 

So thank Valve for keeping your old games alive, If only more companies could do the same..."
10656,"a really good game despite it being very old, id recommend half life to anyone, but you need to know how to play the game right to actually have fun. if you play this game like DOOM (guns blazing) then you're gonna die a lot and be frustrated. you gotta put yourself in gordons shoes to actually have fun, play smart. an extremely useful video that i highly recommend watching (there might be spoilers) really helped be and i wish i found it before i played (there might be spoilers) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg5EQyw_7Hk). like what LeadHead said, ""Gordon isn't a soldier, he's a scientist."""
10657,"Ah another day at the job, this is good for those with brains."
10658,Blow up casserole :)
10659,haha he uhhh
10660,"This game is really, really fun, but you need to put yourself into the right mindset to play it. It's not an easy game by any means- especially if you treat it like a normal FPS. I found an amazing video explaining Half Life, and the mindset you should use to beat it. Link here (All credit goes to Leadhead) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg5EQyw_7Hk&t=108s     This video sums up most of my review, so I'll add a couple more things. You can skip past most aliens in the game (Ex. headcrabs) but in most situations you CANNOT skip past soliders or alien grunts. I realize I can't go much farther without heavily spoiling gameplay, so I'll just end it here. All in all, Half Life really is an amazing game and ten dollars, even now, is a steal."

Yeah ok, it's not HL2, but don't ever go around thinking that the first game is not worth playing, because it 100% is. If I had played this when it came out in 1998, I would have thought that it was the greatest game of all time. I'm still blown away by just how good it is. 9/10"

10680,Just beat the game about 2 mins ago and WOW this has got to be one of the best games ive played in a while
10681,Good game and probably nostalgic for a lot of people but like a lot of old games its kinda clunky. imo Black Mesa is a much more up-to-date and visually/mechanically interesting game.
10682,"This game is a masterpiece. I recommend for anyone. Whether it is for the fact that it is an old game and it is interesting, or because it is just an extremely fun way to kill time.
Only problem is that it does fall victim to the fact that it is an old game with old mechanics. However, that isn't something that could be helped and some may even see it as improving the experience
In short, I recommend this game fully for anyone. However, if you do truly care about a completely polished game in 2021, you might want to think about getting black mesa instead. However, give this game a go first. It's a bargain and it does hold up extremely well to this day."
10683,this game is awesome
10684,"Monumental game but I couldn't get past the dated design choices or really get into the groove of things. Found myself enjoying the game less and less as it went on and always wanting the combat to be over with. 

Would definitely implore any one to try it out though."
10685,"one of the greatest fps games of all time and one of my personal favorites, i prefer this one over half life 2. completely changed the genre with its worldbuilding and story, away from the high speed constant action of doom (which is fun in its own right) to a more artistic place"
10686,Bit of a  pain in the ass but good game overall

10706,"This game saved my life.

I am 32.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

YES! Game was released 1998 and it's still good today. The graphics are a little outdated but it was good for the time. It has nice gameplay and Cool weapons and nice map design.

Story is good. Intro is like this (DONT READ THIS PART IF YOU DON'T WANT THE INTRO TO BE SPOILED FOR YOU) [spoiler]You a scientest on a tram ariving on a science facilty in the desert to do a expirement. IT GOES WRONG AND ALIENS COME THROUGH AND RUIN EVERYTHING. ALSO YOU'RE CHACARTER IS REALLY AWESOME IN THIS GAME SO HE'S FIGHTS ALL THE ALIENS LIKE AWESOME[/spoiler] awesome story I like it.

If you don't like the old graphics there is a fanmade remake called black mesa which gives it nice beeter graphics ill link store page here:

10721,"To start off, you should be aware that 30% of the money you spent on this game goes to Valve. While it's a great game, it unfortunately doesn't let you build or crank 90's. I would personally NOT recommend it if you use Builder Pro controls. Also does NOT include the feature to add additional nudity, so I personally enjoyed it quite a lot less."
10722,"I only bought this game because I couldn't afford Black Mesa at the time,also my mother played this game 20 years ago and told me about it."
10723,what the fuck is half life and what is radioactivity
10724,AMAZING thanks valve for this game!
10725,:)
10726,Greatest game of all time.
10727,who wouldn't play half life?!?!?
10728,This is one of my 20 favourite games of all time only problem is giant swpider boss fight but still game has potential.
10729,goredine famine
10730,The game is aright

10732,I played it for the first time in 2021 and it's a great game
10733,very good
10734,"Half-life is a classic. You should play it for all the same reasons as the original doom, as this was just as revolutionary for the genre. Its just an amazing game to check out, whether you've never played or have played through hundreds of times, its always good to revisit this absolute classic."
10735,After like 20 years this game still somehow has at least 10 people in the multiplayer servers
10736,The first video game
10737,THE CLASSIC. It still rules.
10738,"Despite what some people say about the age of the graphics, the game play and the story are so amazing that most don't really notice the graphics."

10744,"Every one says this is a outdated gamed that changed the gaming landscape when it first came out. but I say this is a better game than most modern shooters, and will always be better. not only did it do it first it also did it best!"
10745,Its a lot of fun and has a good story
10746,Crowbar man hot. Military bad. Shoot
10747,"[spoiler final boss] 
its really fun and has intituive gameplay, but the map layout is sometimes confusing, the final boss was boring and annoying, but at the end, the rest of the game is fun. Not mentioning the mods."
10748,"Game is incredibly old, graphics are far out of date, and the sound quality hasn't aged well. Despite all this the game is fantastic and very fun. The weapon sandbox is diverse, the options for how to tackle a situation are limitless, and the story is still excellent."
10749,Pretty good game which does a good job in still being enjoyable even 20+ years later. It gets bad by the last three chapters but at least theyre short.
10750,its a clasic
10751,surprisingly good
10752,lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooo
10753,Haven't finished and probably won't anytime soon but buy it still for the lore and shooting eeeeee
10754,cmon it's half life no explanation needed
10755,"You know, at first i didn't like it, but after beating it for the first time i can say i really enjoyed it. Great gunplay, level design, sound design and atmosphere, but i really don't like the slippery movement or bullet sponge enemies. The slippery movement makes the platforming sections frustrating, and  a human soldier should not be able to take 3 shotgun shots to the face and survive. The graphics are also very outdated, but i can see how they were good for their time. Overall when it came out it was revolutionary, but now it's just ok. I reccommend the remake black mesa over this, but whenever half-life 1 is on sale i also reccommend buying the whole anthology, and see for yourself if you like it."
10756,Absolute legendary game.
10757,buggy but fun

10770,"At it's time as good as a computer game could get. A 2nd revolution in FPS. One of the best games ever made. Origin of Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat and Half-Life 2. What else is there to say?"
10771,"Pace of the game is way too slow, and checkpoints are sparse. If you decide to play this game, make lots of saves. Enemies are overpowered as all hell, and there are no hints for puzzles that you struggle with. Walkthroughs are 100% necessary. While the story of this game is great, it's just BORING being reset and having to do 20 min worth of work over again, which is a problem present throughout the whole game. I suggest you only buy this game if you plan on playing Half Life 2 and Alyx, otherwise stay away. I just didn't have much fun."
10772,"came in expecting a mess from the 90s and got a mess from the 90s but actually it was kind of fun. If you play this game, you will experience bugs and shit and an actual dogshit looking game (seriously the graphics are so fugly), but in terms of content, this game has more to offer than a lot of the bullshit they put out these days. similar in feel to bioshock, very atmospheric and cool, with actual thoughtful areas and encounters. def not as good as bioshock tho, play that instead if you havent already"

10788,mmmm bhop
10789,"I made the mistake of playing this after Half-Life 2, believing it would be a less stressful experience without the auto-imposed challenge of getting the correspondent Steam achievements. And yet, it showed me the difference between this and its sequel, and why in the end the second one sets itself as timeless beyond any present flaws.

I'm always keen on playing older games, and having only experienced this classic game recently, I can say I don't believe it to have aged all that well. Not because of any visual aspects, but because the combat encounters and puzzles aren't all that engaging or polished, even knowing them to be revolutionary at the time. 

Combat is of its time, of course, and because of that some of its flaws can easily be excused, given what it created. But the enemies require too much fire to be dealt with, contrary to your character, which can get killed relatively quickly. Thus, each encounter gets a bit frustrating, as you spend the time figuring out how to exploit the poorly aged mechanics and physics, and not exactly planning any combat strategy. 

The puzzle aspects of the game ‚Äîmeaning, levels where you have to navigate and/or activate something to progress‚Äî sometimes take too long to go through, due to the ""junky"" movement mechanics and sometimes confusing level design. In my playthrough, I've gone back and forth many times in several areas trying to figure out the solution to continue, not understanding the particulars of what I had to do, an aspect I think was much better handled in the sequel, without any hand-holding.

As such, I come back to my first paragraph. Maybe I shouldn't have played this after the sequel, even if I didn't hold it to the same standards, obviously. But I can see clearly now how, maybe not inventing as much as this first outing, the sequel still remains honestly timeless to this day, even in its mechanics.
Being this a binary system, I'll still recommend the game with these reservations. Definitely experience it for the universe it started creating and as an important piece of videogame history...

... and then, go play Half-Life 2 and subsequent episodes!"

10792,"As a game that plays a part in video game history, i'd say I liked half, minus the Xen chapter what with the uneeded platforming and the frustrating difficulty spike. Overall though, I really liked the game."

10794,Its a really fun game i still like it even in 2021
10795,A timeless cult classic!
10796,"Absolutely the best FPS game Valve has ever made. This should be a game to always remember, and it's definitely worth every penny. You have not lived until you play this game"
10797,It is very good game i can play it for hours and dont get bored
10798,"The game aged, but I assure you it's still a masterpiece"
10799,"classic game, epic"
10800,"The graphics are shit but the game was made in 1998 so no one to point fingers at (plus you could get a graphics mod or black mesa from cc if you really care abt it)

other than that though, the game is amazing story and combat wise however it doesn't have that much replay value without mods imo so keep that in mind

EDIT: About replayability, you can change that if you really want to via mods"
10801,"I began my Half-Life adventure in April 1999, bought the Game @ Costco for the outragious price of: $70.00 Cdn. after reading a Strong Recommendation/Endorsement from a Game Reviewer named: Shannon, she said & I quote: ""Buy It!"" I did & never regretted It. Most amazing Game I ever played, until: Half-Life 2.

10826,no
10827,The graphics are bad. It needs to be updated.
10828,Absolute masterpiece.
10829,Hats off to headcrabs.
10830,"Pros:
The ultimate PC videogame for hard core ultimate PC videogamers, this game is not only the ultimate challenge but this game will challenge you before you even launch it because you have to add ""-nofbo"" to your launch options or the game won't launch. Like a true 90's PC videogame you're not told this and just have to figure it out yourself like a real gamer.

Cons:
God damn Nihilanth is a shit boss fight lmao"

10835,"This truly is the best game ever. I wasn't even alive when this game came out, but today, 2021, I still find it enjoyable. The graphics may not be on tier with Cyberpunk 2077, but thats not what i care about. What I care about is gameplay. The gameplay is exquisite, its honestly probably the best bang for your buck steam offers. Buy it, now, go!"
10836,Great game but it feels old. Definently worth playing to get to Half-Life 2 though.
10837,"Half-Life is THE iconic sci-fi fueled adventure, the story of Gordan Freeman in this all time classic will surely be set in your mind for many years to come! Gameplay thst started a revolution starts here."
10838,A classic.
10839,"I love this game. I wanted to play it for a while and when I did, it was great! Although some things like 90's controls and....... interloper...... bring this down a little, it's still very much worth a play; or multiple ;)"

10844,lil janky mechanics but kinda fun
10845,"Do I even need to explain why? Unless you have never heard of this game, I think everyone knows just how amazing this game is."
10846,I am new to to old games like these.  I had a bit of a tough time even though i was on easy mode. I have put over 10  hours in to it and i still have not compleated the game. It does not tell you where to go so i kept repeating the same thing over and over agian  because i thought i was supposed to go there but i was supposed to go in the oppsite direction. I'm no a pc gamer but i have heard good things about this so i got it. I would suggest this to people who know what they're doing.

8/10"
10853,"scientist guy with gun
"
10854,It's just so good.
10855,"Half Life feels like a chore to play. It's an old game and it plays like an old game. The guns feel like throwing darts at a fridge. It's possible to softlock yourself if you save incorrectly. One of the outdoor sections has an obviously visible skybox. The sound effects are poorly mastered and some of them are obnoxiously louder than others for no reason. Half of the NPCs look identical, and deliver lines like they're in a high school play.

If your are playing your way through some old classics like I was, give this game a miss."
10856,"Does it hold up it in 2021? No.  Soft locks are constant, fall damage is brutal despite VERY floatey movement mechanics, and the game demands exploring which doesn't coincide well with constant soft locks for a first play through with no objective markers.  I'm sure this game was revolutionary in 98', but its not worth your time in 21' unless you're wearing rose colored glasses.  If you want to appreciate a brutally flawed old school classic, then buy it.  Just don't expect a game as polished as the original doom"

10890,"After playing Quake a lot, I knew I had to look at Half Life.

Truly unforgiving, but in a good way. This isn't some halo 2 legendary type of stupidity that would force you to rely on one strategy, but rather some severe difficulty that would force you to tinker for every encounters. Run, think, shoot and live is the motto and I wish other games had such difficulty curves.

The rest? I do not need to explain.

"
10891,good game
10892,:) g a m i n g
10893,10/10
10894,Classic game that any gamer of any age must play through at least once many fond memories playing this growing up
10895,"yeahg
"
10896,"While some may state that the game has shown its age and is no longer visually appealing and enjoyable, I genuinely felt a sense of euphoria while playing the game.  The pacing of combat, environments, and story come together in tandem with a sense of needing to use your brain at times. It's a groundbreaking game that all FPS fans should play at least once. The story may feel a little scarce, but it's the least of your concern. This game's highlight stems from the environments and the unique aspect of what Valve has created - the entire game perpetually propelling you forward as you enter unique environments and combat scenarios non-stop. It's incredible, and I can't get over how much I love that and other things about the game.

However, I noticed one issue in some combat instances where you are facing enemies at medium to low health with little to no suit charge. At times, completion of several combat scenarios may be impossible; even on easy mode, it was genuinely challenging at times should you be in low health from a previous altercation. While this may be my issue with being ""shit"" or ""bad,"" I beg to differ. I wouldn't recommend this on hard mode. The worst thing about Half-Life is the chapters set in Xen by far. The level design is a trainwreck, it's visually unappealing, and it contains some sloppy platforming and boring boss fights. The entire game is golden, save for Xen. Usually, when I finished Lambda Core, I'd power through to Interloper and eventually stop playing. However, as I said, the entire game is golden - save for Xen.

All in all, I recommend this game to anyone into First-Person Shooters or even those NOT into First-Person Shooters. It's a must-play and a unique experience that will not leave you disappointed.

9/10"
10897,"They're waiting for you Gordon, in the test chamber."
10898,Absolute classic
10899,better than sex
10900,"Great game, a classic, and WAAAYY better than Half-Life: Source"
10901,"yes
"
10902,"You obviously don't need to hear from me that this game is cult, so I'll stick to this: having played it through for the first time in 2021, I can clearly see why Half-Life has its place in the Hall of Fame of videogames. Extraordinary sci-fi atmosphere for that time, digital voices, intriguing scenario: the game is absolutely unique and I now have a backward perspective on many games that I've played, that clearly take inspiration from it."
10903,Good play clean game
10904,"My personal favorite game of all time. It holds up surprisingly well for being from 1998. The story and the combat compliment each other very well, and neither overstays their welcome, while you're in Black Mesa, that is. That being said, this game isn't for everyone. Being old, it has its share of jank, and the final four chapters of the game are universally agreed to be utter garbage. If you're into older shooters, definitely check this one out. If you're used to something more modern, consider looking at the fan-remake of this game: Black Mesa. Stay far away from Half Life Source unless you're looking for Gmod assets."
10905,"What can I say, the game is a classic. I doubt theres any need in seing if the game is good. Its a game that everyone can pick up and enjoy with great gameplay, story and level design"
10906,my face when AHHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHHHAAHAHHHHHHH :happyquil:
10907,glitches are fun
10908,"get black mesa instead, the original graphics look like poo poo"
10909,"Gameplay: It's similar to Quake 1 (the game uses a modded engine of Quake) and It's fun.

Story: It's pretty basic, but not bad at all.

Optimization: The game is pretty optimized for the mayority of 2000's devices, but if your PC doesn't support ''OpenGL'' then you'll need to play on ''software'' for the best performance.

Lenght: If it's your first playthrough the game can last up to 10-12 hours if you play it non-stop.

Graphics: Good for it's time, but it can make a kid vomit nowadays.

Gunplay: Pretty good, especially on multiplayer.

Multiplayer: It's good and balanced.

Difficulty:   Easy: child's play       Normal: balanced      Hard: somewhat challenging

Bugs: Never found a significant bug nor a game breaking one.

AI: Enemy AI is basic and can be very fun to fight with, but the friendly AI can get very stupid at some points of the game.

Soundtrack: It's awesome, especially if you like rock and old electronic music.

Modding community: There are awesome mods in the modding community.

One of the best old-school games out there.

9.5/10"

10918,It's the original Half-Life. You shouldn't need to look at reviews
10919,"It's easy to see why this was called ""The Best Game Ever"" in 1998. I never played it then, but I am going back and playing it now with much satisfaction. The story moves along without cutscenes (weird for modern games but it works well) and the puzzles and weapons keep you interested.

10924,A timeless classic. If you can look past the dated graphics (which personally I thought aged just fine) you get one of the most compelling and captivating stories in any video game i‚Äôve played.
10925,though old in graphics and game mechanics it is still thoroughly enjoyable and a must play

10927,revolutionary.

10934,I am a Half Life nerd! this just makes me have so much fun! I love source games and I love valve! I cant wait for Half Life 3!!!

10936,"Best summarized as a worse version of quake, with scripted cutscenes inserted to distract you and waste time. Has some decent mods at least, that and it being 2 dollars was the sole reason I bought it. Unless it's super cheap, I'd recommend playing another game."
10937,"Before I start (too late) I don't mind the HD models from Blue Shift but I like the old models more. I like this game it's remind me of Doom and GoldenEye 007 from Nintendo 64, I can see how this revolution gaming for FPS and story telling until Half Life 2 that only make it much better but still good game with good story, characters, good controls to me, and good level designs. I did found a glitch when two soldiers took Gordon/the player to outside for questioning but glitch me out into a dark room but just one glitch. I would give this five crowbars out of five."

simplistic bit long and great all along, the xen levels are not great almost at all but have some good moments. i loved every second of this game from the begining you should play it. Oh future Zebitus here, been speedrunning, its still good (hence the 200+ hours i have) and you should still play it cus its great and i will kill you if you dont, like cmon its only 9 dollars and is ussualy on sale."

11004,"It has been a while since the game release. It's 4 years younger than Doom II and only 2 years younger than Daggerfall, yet it's so ultimately more advanced, like two generations gap. 
I can't believe how this game is so playable even now. Levels design is impressive even as for todays standards.
Sometimes you can feel throughout the gameplay that some parts were put there by Valve just to flex on their innovative product - and that's okay!
I played Half Life for the first time now, after 23 years since it's been released, but I could still appreciate what a massive step forward in game development that was.
PS: One big negative - no subtitles"

11015,git gud m8
11016,Erm... I guess it's kind of friggin awesome and rulez
11017,"It's hard to recommend this game, but I think it's at least worth playing for it's story and to see the progression of the FPS genre, as well as the Half-Life franchise as a whole. 

If you take anything away from this, know that YOU SHOULD SAVE YOUR GAME WHEN YOU CAN. I was on easy mode (relatively experienced with singe-player, story-driven FPS) and I still was frustrated when I ended up having to redo an entire gauntlet again. Constantly saving manually may be a pain, but it'll likely pay off when the game resets you behind multiple challenges you've already overcame.

The first half of the game is simple, solid, and well-told. I want to make it clear that there is a reason I recommend this game. Learning what gun to use for a given challenge, seeing the aliens pitted against the military, and even the goofy spies are all really fun things that make the game stick out and will be pretty memorable overall.

As for the second half of Half-Life: it felt messy, even before the infamous Xen levels. Hard-to-kill soldiers camping behind turrets, tanks that are a long series of peek-and-shoot, and platforming that is less than ideal makes the game's second half disappointing as well as frustrating. As for the Xen levels: they do have a lot of visual and stylistic creativity, but they're certainly frustrating from a gameplay perspective. I really only felt the need to look up a guide once I reached the final boss. 

I feel like knowing what's bad about a game can mentally prepare you and allow you to overlook those issues, ultimately enjoying the game more. Some of the issues might be deal-breakers for you, but if not: I think there's still fun to be had in this decades-old game."
11018,Very epic the guns go boom. As for the suit I think you've earned it.
11019,"The BEST game ever, I played lot of times..."
11020,Pleb filter.
11021,Brilliant game. Definitely one of my all time favourites.
11022,I don't know how to get pass the pit chapter. I'm too dumb for this intellectual games
11023,"Not many games play like Half Life does, even after all its influence. It is one of the most immersive shooter games I've ever played, and the combat is dare I say a tad better than HL2's. Playing through the game a second time, I really grew to love the game more, particularly ""Surface Tension"". Fuck Interloper, though. People hate On a Rail but at least that chapter is fair and doesn't feel like endless horrible platforming and shooting without any ammo. Everything fun about the game goes out the window in this chapter, and the final boss is just boring. Overall though, highly reccommend, holds up really well. I should play Black Mesa at some point..."

11041,"What an amazing game. I haven't played any other Half-Life games, but I know that how much this game series is praised, so I decided to try it out. The game really is that awesome, especially after completing it. It doesn't necessarily have the best gun-play or anything, even for the time when it was released. But it has such varied gameplay and a rich story. I did get stuck though sometimes, there are quite a few puzzles in the game that utilize some magic logic and you have to do things that you have no idea you can do and it can be really frustrating sometimes and I did need to consult Big Mac Davis' walkthrough a bit too much. It got a little boring midway through in the chapter Surface Tension and I kinda stopped playing it for quite a while. But then I came back to it and finished it in a few days as it just kept me going. It is such a unique and great game, even though it is so old is still holds up and I'd recommend it to virtually anyone. Now how about Half-Life 3... ·µç·µÉ·µá·µâ‚Åø ·µñÀ°·µâ·µÉÀ¢·µâ"

11043,"[h1]HALF-LIFE[/h1]
[b]Originally a side project to [i]Prospero[/i] and used to be called [i]Quiver, Triphammer and Belly of The Beast[/i]. Valve eventually settled on [i]Half-Life[/i]

Set in the Black Mesa Research Facility in New Mexico USA, You assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a 27 year old Theoretical Physicist. One morning, Gordon is running late at 8:47 AM for his job in Sector C Anomalous Materials. An experiment goes wrong causing a Resonance Cascade leading aliens from a border-world called Xen to invade Earth and Black Mesa. Gordon must traverse the facility and avoid death from the HECU and Aliens to make it to Lambda Complex to stop the Invasion and save Earth in the immersive and heart-pounding action-adventure story that set the stage for a generation of first-person shooters.

I without any doubt 100% recommend Half-Life. I grew up playing Valve and Half-Life so I can say with full positivity it's my favorite game of all time. It introduced me to Valve and gaming and gave me something to bond with my dad over and something to fanboy/obsess over, it changed my life forever. 

Thank You Valve.

I'll see you up ahead.

11048,Awesome sauce game that is an absolute unit of a stepping stone in our glorious fps history. A must play to say the least.
11049,fun
11050,"I'd like to preface this with the context that I'm not some kid who wasn't even born when this came out, or someone who was exclusively playing console games, either; I was there in the thick of the First-Person Shooter craze from the first time I played Heretic at a friend's house.  I played a lot of the old ""2.5D"" Shooters back in their day, like the Dooms, Heretic, Hexen, Duke Nukem 3D, and Blood.  I'd even played at least one fully 3D Shooter by then, because I was [b]completely[/b] obsessed with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in 1997, before Half-Life even came out.  Not that it has any place in a recommendation for someone just looking to get into a game, but nostalgia isn't a factor here, either; while I had at least one friend back in the day who WOULD NOT SHUT-UP about Half-Life, I was never interested enough to play it back then, and didn't get around to it until this year: 2021.  This is supposed to be one of the most influential and revolutionary games in its genre, and I thought, ""Alright; I can put myself back in 1998.  I'm totally disinterested in that upcoming Dreamcast thing, that weird 'Pocket Monsters' thing I read about a while ago is really starting to pick up some steam, and I'd finally gotten deep into that Final Fantasy 7 thing I'd wanted to play since I'd found out that my beloved 1, 2, and 3 were actually 1, 4, and 6.  Not the best days of my life, but moderately interesting times for video games, at least.""

Well, boy, am I glad to be back; I don't miss this era of Shooters AT ALL.  Half-Life throws a lot of cardinal sins of the genre at you: weird ladder controls, lots of platforming sections, tiny ledges, ""gotcha"" moments such as the floor (looking like any other) falls out from underneath you, long underwater sections with limited oxygen, AN ENTIRE MINE CART [b]CHAPTER[/b], and when that all isn't enough, they start throwing clusters of these at you simultaneously while you're being harassed by an attack helicopter.  It's also from that early 3D era, where you're not sure if borking the momentum algorithm to get onto that weird ledge was a glitch win or the intended route.  Beyond even that, this game is extremely buggy; I'd sometimes be going through a pipe and when the next area loaded, I'd be in the pipe, but spawned slightly off the ground, so I couldn't move and had to reload an old save, and this happened quite a few times.  Thankfully, this is old enough that quicksave was still a thing, because you'll be needing it, not always through any fault of your own.  Equally thankfully, this is new enough that mouselook also existed; horrid as I found the level design to be, the actual controls were pretty good.  You can look around, run, swim, and even jump relatively smoothly; I would've liked a way to zoom in while shooting with more than just one weapon, and the ability to make [i]walk[/i] the default instead of being stuck on autorun the whole game, but that might speak to my being spoiled a bit by modern convenience.  The weapons could've used a little more balance, too - a lot of guns are so useful that I'm always hurting for ammo, or so useless that their main use is wasting ammo until you can reload something better - but that wasn't bad, either; the shooting part of this Shooter was just fine.

But Mooooooom, it's all about the story!  Well, admittedly, the plot doesn't mess around; you get RIGHT into it pretty early in the game.  I was pleasantly shocked at how quickly things escalated, and then... nothing.  There was one minor twist in the middle that was very believable and well-executed - a lot of newer writing throws them at you like crazy in an attempt to mask the fact that the underlying narrative isn't all that interesting, and then just leaves them hang - but there was almost no plot other than ""go here; do this"" until the end of the game after that.  The NPCs are also often lauded as revolutionary, but the most you'll ever get out of them is very poor cover fire (they even act all triumphant when taking credit for monsters that [i]you[/i] killed) or acting as keys made of meat.  Visually, it's a lot of gray underground tunnels, which fits the scenario, but is still boring to look at; things get pretty interesting toward the end, but that's not the majority of the game.  The character models are... well, it's 1998; they're going to look a little blocky, but these are pretty good from what I remember of that era.  The sound design is mostly fine; the audio is programmed in such a way that you should be able to tell where an enemy is by where the sound is coming from, and it's [i]usually[/i] close.  There's almost no music, and I know that's supposed to be atmospheric and immersive; it wasn't for me, but it wasn't a dealbreaker, either, and when you did have music, it was usually pretty good, even if it'd stop before it should.

Half-Life does some interesting things, and there are some pretty neat moments, but for what it puts you through, it just isn't enough of a payoff.  If you're looking to get into the series, I'd recommend just watching someone else play through it.  Or don't; I've just started Half-Life 2, and even though I'm not that far, the game has done a great job of telling me everything I needed to know about the first game."

Definitely feels a little unfair in the second half as well with the soldiers that constantly ambush you and the aliens that spawn in with zero indications to prepare you for them. Valve definitely learned their lesson with Half-Life 2, and I still think 2 is the far superior game, but this still has its moments that shine above the flaws. Definitely better than Black Mesa though, and the speed-running capability + abundance of mods for the game are sure to keep you coming back for more. Has definitely aged in a few areas, but still very fun and very satisfying to play through today."

After trying to get back into it an embarrassing amount of times since that first encounter - Half-Life's historical value was enough to keep me going, but only for a while - I finally hunkered down and played through the game start to finish. And... yes, I see why people love this game. I am now on the Half-Life 3 hype train.
If you are interested in the series at all, I recommend you start with this original version of this first game like I did. Yes, play the game as it was in 1998, not through Black Mesa and NOT through Half-Life Source. The graphics are dated, but most other things either haven't aged a day (like the sound, level design, and ""feel"") or haven't yet been fixed in newer versions (mainly, some agonizing combat sections). Again, Half-Life is important piece in history that is worth seeing in its original format, non-HD textures and all. Once you have a good baseline for the series, go ahead and enjoy Source and Black Mesa. But make sure you experience this game in all of its old-school glory.
But back to my story. When I first tried to get into Half-Life nearly four years ago, I had almost no experience with first person shooters. Nowadays, I do have games to compare Half-Life to, for better and for worse. I see how the Halo was inspired by the AI and level design of Half-Life and how 90's twitch shooters inspired the movement and arsenal of Half-Life. These comparisons made me appreciate the game, though they also made me wish for the Halo sandbox and the fast pace of the modern Doom titles. So, duh: Half-Life feels old. That's not a revelation, but it is worth saying because I made the mistake of playing Half-Life like it was Doom or Halo.
It wasn't until I beat the game and watched a couple videos about it that I learned that I might have been playing Half-Life wrong. Again, the reason I kept falling off of this game was because I just wanted it to be more like Far Cry 4. I was and still am frustrated with turrets that kill you in seconds, the incredible movement speed that makes platforming more than tedious, and the onslaught of aliens that keep me up at night. Those things are still problems, but if you take a second and plan out your encounters before going in guns-blazing, you might die a few million times less. Half-Life is all about tactics, not mindlessness. I was playing with the assumption that I had to think and shoot at the same time, but things work out a lot better if you think first and only then execute your 10th level plan. So while I personally hate to say that there is any ""right way"" to play a game, I believe there is with Half-Life. And I don't like that about Half-Life. Sure, you can technically get your way through the game playing like Master Chief, but let's just say that you won't have nearly as much fun as you would when playing like Gordon Freeman.
But all of this is to say that yes, you should play Half-Life. At the end of the say, it's awesome. It's frustrating, somewhat-dated awesomeness with a fantastic story that is fantastically told. You just might have to have some patience to supplement the awesomeness. Hope you like it!

It can be a bit difficult at times, but using your tools strategically can mitigate this quite a bit. It's not enormous, but quite a lot can be gotten out of it nonetheless. Fair warning though, some of the puzzles can be a bit tricky to grasp."

> The aliens sounded creepy and looked creepy which is crazy thinking how old this game is

> You get a little chuckle out of some of the characters and their monotone dialogue 

Things I didn't like:

> The crouch and jump technique. I don't think I can ever perfect that

I find the modern slow movement first person shooters boring. I definitelly prefer these old-school fast movement shooters. That's why I actually prefer Half-Life over Black Mesa. Of course I have to mention the top tier level design and probably the best artificial intelligence in a video game ever, that's almost mandatory when talking about Half-Life. What many people forget to mention though is the breath-taking sound design with all its echoes and resonances, which gives the game its amazing atmosphere.  Trully a pinnacle of the first person shooter genre."

11278,"     Text boxes, and cutscenes. 1997, nobody had truly taken advantage of the medium. Reading was the information delivery system of the book, and cutscenes, the movie. Both mediums were built to be mainly used in a 3rd person narrative, but the media of video games could be much more immersive. Then, E3 1997, an alpha was shown. Quiver, or Half Life. The scientists would talk to YOU, using their voices, coming from them. Never, ever, EVER a break from the 1st person perspective, entering a new era for video games. 
     ""Welcome to the black mesa transit system"". This era begins in a tram, showing you around the facility. Many today call this cliche, while in fact, this is the game that started cliches. All ready it shows the beauty of the GoldSRC engine, and the source engine to come. It allows for huge areas, and while today its easy to tell it's fake, even the faking of the entire black mesa facility is impressive. Unforseen Consequences and Office Complex provide atmosphereic horror, but We've got hostiles is the chapter that cranks the action to 11. Blast pit to apprehnsion gives exploration and puzzles. (Residue processing isn't that good haha) Questionable ethics and surface tension provide stunning set pieces, and show the lore get more and more complex, including a plot twist about the staff if you pay attension.

Unforeseen Consequences, We got hostiles, and Surface Tension are some of the best levels. Each provide their own fun challenges and lighten up on you when need be. On a Rail is debatable in its quality, the puzzle is frustrating, but once you pass it, it's more fun. Blast pit also provides a fun challenge, but the gimmick runs dry fast sometimes. Now for the infamous Xen levels, the really, really bad ones. At that point? Either find cheats and play it like that or delete the game and get Black Mesa or something. It's not worth it here"

11293,"In short: Half life is a good fps game even to today's standards, with one of the only problems being the last few levels.



I've had lots of fun playing this game, and i feel i should go ahead and review some stuff about it

WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!

Starting off with the gameplay,
The gameplay is really fun, with many enemies to fight or get around. Most of these enemies i really like, such as the Soldiers.

The Soldiers are really fun enemies to fight, they can run about, shoot you with Rifles and Shotguns, Throw grenades, Use Turrets, and come down from Helis!, alone they are quite weak, but working together while focusing on you can make them a tough threat!

There's also another enemy I really like in this game!

The bullsquid is a Xen creature that can shoot out projectiles and charge at the player, but what i really like is the way you can deal with them. Bullsquids have a odd mechanic that allows them to smell things like meat, they can also be distracted by it and go eat it, which allows the player a chance to go through them. I also like how they will try to kill other xen creatures such as the annoying headcrabs ( Which i'll get to later ) which shows how even though they are enemies in a video game, they will still hunt xen creatures like some kind of predator.


But there's one enemy in this game i got a few problems with,

The headcrab is one of the most annoying enemies i've fought in a video game, they will leap at the player and take a decent chunk of your health, and though they can be killed and avoided easily, the level design is what makes them such a problem. They commonly spawn in dark vents that you can't see in, and sometimes they'll be waiting behind some boxes, Hell they can even be teleported in sometimes at random, which is real annoying.

Weapons: There's a good amount of weapons in the game, that all can be useful. I usually reserve my pistol for headcrabs and houndeyes, and use my shotgun on the vorts, there's still plenty more weapons, such as the many kinds of explosives, and alien weapons that can be good to use against the enemies.

Levels: There's plenty of levels in the game, which are mostly good, except for some like On a Rail, which is quite annoying for someone who's just played, but going through it again isn't that bad. The levels all have a nice layout for players to go through, with many tight and closed up areas, with boxes or areas to get behind, along with some nice enemy placement.

However, the level design goes to shit as soon as you enter the final levels,

F U C K I N G X E N : Xen is by far the worst part of this game, the levels are large, and take advantage of one of the worst parts of half life..Platforming, it just doesn't work, not only do you easily take fall damage, but your character is really slippery, which is mostly fine since you'll mainly be in combat in the game, but when platforming becomes a main focus!?

FUCK

One thing i also dislike slightly is how they messed up some of the enemies here

The vortigaunts: These guys are a pretty simple enemy, they charge up a high damage attack that you can't be avoided in a open area, but the player can avoid it by going behind cover quickly, which is good to do normally, since most of the levels are in areas with lots of cover, but in xen most of the area's are open, so you'll just get hit by the vorts bolt.

Xen also has something else aswell,


BOSS FIGHTS: There is a "" boss "" more early in the game but i consider it more of a level that you have to go through rather then a boss.
But anyways, now onto the ACTUAL bosses, which i consider really annoying and bad

Starting with:

The Gonarch: This bitch is one of the worst bosses in gaming i have ever faced, and i'll tell you why.

The first stage is the most fine, it tells you what it can do, and you can avoid it's attacks with general ease

The second stage though is pretty annoying, since now there's a large hole in the way that you can easily fall into, and if you manage to get on a ledge there, A PISS SUCKLING HEAD FUCKER will jump right out and get eat a nice chunk of your health. Another thing i dislike about the gonarch, is that i don't feel like i'm ever doing damage to it, it feels like i'm trying to shoot a moving wall  that spawns mini headcrabs and occasionally hits me aswell as shoot jizz to attack


Then there's the third stage, which is almost broken.
The gonarch is supposed to jump down into a arena like spot, but instead that ballsacked bitch just stood there waiting for me to jump down, and since it was in a cave it could shoot its cum at me (Which btw, does a fuckton of damage) and hit me to K.O me. Due to this i had to load over and over again, until it finally got down.


Now onto the final boss, which is not as bad:

The nihilanth: A giant fetus with a metal butt plug up it's ass. Fitting boss i'd say for the end of the game, The nihilanth is a boss that is...OK

First you have to shoot some crystals so it doesn't heal(Which a new player probably wouldn't know, and just assume the crystals to be scenery) and then you have to shoot it a bunch until it's head opens up

The nihilanth has two attacks, the first being an attack in which it shoots a bunch of purple projectiles, 

And then there's the second, which i think can be annoying if your new.
The nihilanth can shoot a giant green portal, which teleport's you to an area, that you have to get out, this area includes some enemies aswell as ammo for your weapons. So, what's the big deal?
The problem here is that if you don't know you can go behind the large pillars to stop the green portal, then GOD FUCKING HELL it's sucks ass to go back to the same area's again and again, for fucks sake i want to fight the boss!

But playing through this again would likely be more easier, so it's not that bad,

Then there's the part where it's head opens up and you gotta shoot it, the problem here is that now you need to go on these floating pads, which can't decide if they want to shoot you up to his face, or up the nihilanths fetus ass. which is the one thing that i believe ruins the fun of the fight, but aside from all that, i think it's an okay boss ( Hell of a lot better then the moaning headcrab milf )


In general i think this game is really good, even though the last few levels kinda suck, and The gonarch is satans ballsack visuallised it's  a real good game!"

11303,"This game is still amazing in 2021. I cannot state how much of a culture impact this game has had on other first person shooter games. It definitely ranks as one of the many Influential Video games of the 20th century. Finishing Half Life is just the beginning.

11357,"I don't really need to say much, since everyone's thinking the same thing, but maybe I can offer an outside perspective. I never really dealt with games until the day the Playstation 2 port of this game finally arrived in the mail a few years ago. This is the first fps I had ever played, and the first one I was ever infatuated with. I'll tell you what, if the hours spent on the PS2 port could be transferred to my Steam Profile, the hours would be in the hundreds.


I owe a lot to this game and its creators. It opened up a whole new world of wonder for me."
11358,game is fire af
11359,I used to not like this game when I first played it but after giving it a second chance I've grown to love the game and it's combat. The game still has some of the best level design even when compared to modern FPS games. All of the weapons are useful and feel satisfying to wield against the different enemy types. Sometimes the player is forced to take damage which can be annoying but this is rare in the campaign and overall the game is pretty fair and balanced.
11360,Great OG FPS
11361,"Legendary game from 1998 with gameplay that holds up to this day. 

BUY IT ALREADY"
11362,Mmm... Gud Game
11363,"The Citizen Kane of video games, and it still holds up to this day. Everyone needs to experience Half Life at least once, the game is a testament to the incredible drama and player choice that made Valve one of the most respected video game companies in the world. To this day this silly little game is completely annihilating all the triple A moderns that have mastered the so called formula. Nothing EVER did single player narrative better than Half Life, which is why its such a titan of the industry. It's the game that started it all, and for that alone, it deserves to be worshiped. Conveniently enough, the game is far more than its legacy. Even today people are experiencing Half Life's amazing story (HLVR:AI) The game will never not be important, respected, remembered, revered, cherished, and most importantly, good."

100/10 game"
11374,gg
11375,Played it for the first time ever in 2021 and I'm quite impressed considering it came out in 1998. Very nostalgic too because I played a lot of CS 1.6 in my childhood and this game is the reason why CS even exists. The only let downs were the final levels and the endings were kind of meh.
11376,"Engaging, not too difficult even on difficult level, plenty of wide ranging worlds and types of enemy, and loads of cool weapons. Excellent narrative and some iconic moments and sound bites. This game changed history for FPS imho. I've played it now probably 200 times from start to finish and never get tired of it."
11377,awesome
11378,"
Things i liked:
-the puzzles
-the combat
-the atmosphere
-the story

Things i Didn't like:
-the entirety of Xen
-the length of certain parts (interloper and on a rail)
-the platforming

I would give this game 8.5/10. This is a must play game for anyone who has a PC. It hasn't aged the best in certain parts, especially the last half. Xen felt very rushed. However, I without a doubt don't regret playing this game to the end. Please play this game if you haven't."
11379,"Amazing. When I first played it I wasn't sure i'd like it considering its age. Half lifes world building is supreme. The weapon selection is extensive with quite unique weaponry. The story is amazing, the idea of fighting off a alien invasion is really cool, so much for just another day in the office for gordon freeman. The attention to detail is extensive in half life, surprising for such a old game, from small things like being able to operate the vending machines and regen health to being able to unlock caches of weaponry with companions scattered around black mesa. I would recommend everyone try Half Life at least once if their into video games. 

P.S. : Pro gamer tip activate the microwave in the staff break room, burn that casserole freeman!"

11412,A fantastic blend of stealth and horror combined with strategic gameplay that keeps you on your toes. I highly recommend anyone who enjoys FPS games to try this game out!
11413,"This was the first FPS game I ever played and it was surprisingly fun and like a page-turner. I was also impressed at the artificial brilliance of the HECU marines. My first time playing We've Got Hostiles (when I first saw how scarily good the marines' AI was) was kind of an adrenaline rush. My first playthru was on easy, and it was still insanely difficult (tho I've since got more gud).  I love how even a game with aged graphics can feel immersive, and the cliff portion of Surface Tension (one of my favorite chapters along with Lambda Core) still looks pretty decent even with Goldsrc. The level's design somehow manages to feel a lot less linear than it actually is.
In contrast to the rest of the game, Xen is pretty much the unfun kind of hard (especially the factory part of Interloper, which I think I've found to be more difficult than Black Mesa's version despite being much shorter) and kinda minimalist, especially after having gotten spoiled by Black Mesa's Xen."

11456,IT GOOD
11457," So, I decided to revisit this game again after my last replay, 15 years ago. Now, I'm not going to describe my gameplay experience because we all know that this game is a classic that everybody should play at least ones. Rather I will focus on the technical problems that I faced with the game playing it on modern systems. I need to mention that the game comes in its final version with installed HD-pack, introduced in HL: Blue Shift. This means that the Glock, the MP5 and the shotgun are reskinned to Beretta, M16 and SPAS.     
 First, I couldn't start the game with the desktop shortcut after I installed it on Windows 7. I've manage to start it with the launch button from the game's library page. After checking the video options I've decided to play on 4:3 resolution 1024x768 because if I tried to play on higher resolution or widescreen the game crashes. This didn't bother me because my monitor can change in 4:3 mode. I didn't experienced any bugs when playing it except few crashes when I tried to Alt+Tab.
 Surprisingly the game ran better on Linux. The game official support is only for Ubuntu, so maybe that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt managed to launch the game directly on Manjaro. I didn‚Äôt bother to search for solutions before I try the Steam Play Compatibility tool. Running the game with latest available Proton 5.13-6, at the time, was good. Honestly, I think that the compile was too good. The game launched in its default 4:3 ratio without the need to manually adjust my monitor. It ran on both ratios with all resolutions but I chose to play on 4:3 ratio because the widescreen is just stretched 4:3. Even the lag was on the same places as I experienced the game for the first time back in 1999. It really lagged couple of times but I think that this is from the game itself and not from the Proton. No problems with Alt+Tab. The game crashed only ones when a Steam friend message me.
 I suggest to buy the Half-Life Complete bundle, when it's on sale."

11507,"Every now and then a game comes along that has such a significant impact on the gaming industry as to redefine a specific genre. While some genres remain relatively stable, few have seen as much innovation as that of the first-person shooter. This is probably because the genre is still fairly young, beginning with ""Wolfenstein 3D"" back in the day and then ""Doom"", which defined the genre and paved the way for other games which used the same formula. Most of these games were focused around navigating through corridors and shooting anything that moved with an assortment of weapons at your disposal. Sometimes keys would need to be acquired before moving on to the next area, usually through the deaths of powerful monsters holding or guarding them.

- Redefined The Genre :

Half-Life redefined the genre by doing things differently. Instead of mindlessly gunning down wave after wave of monsters, the game makes you think by impeding your progress through the application of several clever and dangerous puzzles instead of the usual locked door and key system that Doom started. In Half-Life, players are required to think on their feet and react quickly to enemies, which can teleport in randomly as well as blockade themselves in areas with lots of cover. Couple this with an intriguing story that is engaging and unfolds as you play without ever being truly revealed and you have on your hands the science fiction phenomena known as Half-Life.

- Another Normal Day In Black Mesa :

The Half-Life story begins with Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist and graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is just an average day for the scientist, despite coming into work a little late. Today is the day he is scheduled to help the scientists in the research lab test a pure sample of some hazardous material of unknown origin. Upon setting the material in the test chamber however, things go horribly wrong, and the energy funneled into the material triggers a catastrophic ""resonance cascade"" event that not only destroys the lab, but opens a portal to another world that draws the attention of unfriendly aliens. Having survived the destruction of the labs, Freeman must make his way through the ruined Black Mesa complex in the midst of an alien invasion and try to figure out how to put a stop to it. Complicating matters are the U.S. marines, which have been given orders to kill anyone found at the labs.

- Mystery :

The first game in what would become an extensive series in an epic science fiction story, little tidbits as to what actually is going on are revealed as you play, leaving the player to discover the story as he or she progresses through the game. The end result is that several facets are still open to interpretation as the story is never fully revealed to Dr. Freeman (and thus, you, the player). Possibilities as to why the aliens are invading are hinted at, but never revealed, even as you face the mastermind behind the invasion at the end of the game. And then there is the enigmatic G-Man, who can be found behind the scenes occasionally as you make your way through the game. It is clear that he has had a hand in the events leading up to the resonance cascade, though exactly how or why is never revealed. There are many theories regarding the whole story behind the Half-Life series of games, and speculation among gamers of this popular series is rampant, leading more credence to the game's status as one of the legendary ones.

11508,very nostaalgiga
11509,A great classic FPS that has some neat logic puzzles and fun gunplay.
11510,Pet the headcrabs
11511,"Good game, decent story, rather long"
11512,i still dont get to know what the message was
11513,Better than Half-Life 2. I do not take criticism.
11514,It tastes like Chicken
11515,died every five minutes and nothing made sense 9/10
11516,fun
11517,One of the best games ever I remeber being a wayne when I was playing this the first time
11518,"Very good game, in my opinion best game ever, I'm on mac so game compatibility is key, graphics are still good after all these years and low system requirements help a lot. Thank you Valve for your games and services, as a young developer you inspire, so thank you"
11519,good game
11520,One of the best classic FPS games of all time
11521,"There are many games that can be called the best there are some people who like COD and some who like (dare I say it) the last of us part 2 but there is one company who have always made lightning in a bottle when it comes to a release and that company is valve. it was days like these when founder Gabe newel worked for Microsoft but at the time when classic FPS games like DOOM and Quake and Duke Nukem, were hitting shelves so Gabe quit Microsoft and quit his university to try and master what id did a few years ago, soon he came up with an idea a scientist and his daring escape out of his workplace. fighting a horde of monsters and aliens soon writer Marc laid law came in and together and a few other people they created... Half-Life

Half life takes place in the black mesa research facility where you are late for work and to add salt to the injury your co workers are confused and furious when you do arrive the entire sector is full of busy scientists and security guarding the uncharted, ""There waiting for you Gordon... in the test chamber!"" as soon as your in ""The barrel"" your given a specimen from the far reaches from XEN a border world filled with creatures and monsters all of a sudden explosions and portals start ripping all over the facility your life is now at stake...

your Friends dead the creatures roaming ll over the facility your option?... ESCAPE! as your wander back through the facility your greeted with your only friend and your key to victory a crowbar sleek shiny forged by fire and sent down upon your in your most desperate time of need sure you also have guns but shes practically perfect in every way. but whats what Gordon faces will be tough but you do have the suit to handle such travesty. the mark 4 hazardous environment suit or HEV for short is suited for hazardous jobs your given your shield at the start of the game. an icon for what this game has in store and anyone. the Enemy you'll be facing are of course the creatures from XEN but are sometimes usually quite easy to handle with other forces that you will become face to face with are a non alien threat. the HECU are soldiers who are here to clean up the resonance cascade but what the survivors don't know is that they are hostiles to them and will resolve by killing you

the landscape and environment is a little old for our time but in 1998 this was the top of gaming. The puzzles are oblivious to the seen to the weakest eyes of gamers and the platforming is well... A challenge to noobs, but what do they know about masterpieces ultimately Half life comes out to be a beacon to all who start off their journey

10/10"
11522,A classic. Everyone has to play this and the sequel at least once.
11523,"The only problem with the game is that it's dated, but it has a pretty good story. 6/10"
11524,best game
11525,Very fun
11526,It's Half-Life.
11527,glorious hexagons and low quality textures
11528,"The starter to the Half-Life Franchise, a great story from this game, Half-Life is a modified version of the Quake engine and this modification is called Goldsrc, the AI does have some issues, usually the scientists and security guards when it comes to following you, was way worse in 0.52 though, the graphics still look quite good today but you can clearly see they've aged a lot, the game has a great soundtrack aswell, I don't often make reviews so I don't know what else to put here other than I highly recommend Half-Life to you or look at the other reviews on the store page for this game before purchasing it"
11529,"The grandfather to games such as 'CS:GO' and 'Team Fortress' 

This game was an absolute gem back on its original console release and though admittedly now dated, gives you a sense of nostalgia akin to that of the old Halo games. 

If you're looking for a more updated and modern experience i would recommend the 'Black Mesa' game here on steam, but if you want to relive a true golden classic about shooting aliens in there 'Undefined Organs' then you would be mad not to pick this up!"
11530,Steam wouldn't exist without it.
11531,"This game was amazing for its time. Now, I think it's just fine, but it's definitely an experience every gamer should have."
11532,Masterpiece.
11533,"Overrated, gameplay is boring and janky and the ""amazing story"" everyone talks about is boring"
11534,"god tier game
no arguments just god tier"
11535,I could say so many great things about this game but i will make it short. This game is a amazing classic FPS masterpiece! Some may call it a gift from the gods. This game has a fabulous story that makes you want more and more and makes you want to play again and again.

11541,"HELLO GORDON! THIS GAME IS A 10/10! I LOVE WHEN YOU CAN DRINK SODA, SUGGESTION: MORE SODA."
11542,"beat it in 6 hours

its fun

"
11543,"What can i say that wasn't said already? Half life is an instant classic. Like Quake, or doom, is a game that you will always feel compelled to go back to. It's a game that knows how to put up a good fight. But also play a really good narrative experience in the middle almost with no story breaks in the middle. This is a game about shooting ugly aliens and overly talkative soldiers. And never tries to go too far into a story, because it knows it doesn't need to. Instant recommendation.

As an extra note. played both Black mesa and this game recently back to back. And i still prefer this game despite BM being cool and all. Butblack mesa Xen segment was WAY too long. This game ends every segment before you get tired of each. And that something to appreciate. Know when you gotta end a setpiece.."

11555,great game!
11556,it's fun
11557,this game is still worth it. awesome. beat it almost two decades after the release took about 15 hours and i wasted a lot of time running around the levels and looking at stuff but it was fun.

11575,timeless classic
11576,"I bought and played this game because it is one of the most well known and famous games out there.  I expected it to be good, and I suppose it was cool for its time, but it's a piece of trash now.  

The 16 hours I spent on this game were spent saving, saving, saving, and doing sections over and over again.  I only finished one playthrough.  Perhaps I'm just a bad player, but I had to repeat the same sections many times because I would come into the section with like 5 health, able to be one-shotted by a single round.  When you don't have any charge in your HEV suit, enemies do a /lot/ of damage.  For the final boss, I ended up using noclip and god commands because I just wanted to be done.

Again, this game feels like endless grinding, all to uncover a cool scene or piece of the story that's not there.  Instead of buying this game, play Half Life 2.  It's so much more entertaining and is worth your time."
11577,"amazing, one of the best games I've ever played"
11578,"The graphics could have aged better, and i am not entirely hooked on the story like everyone else is(or even understand it still), but i did like the gameplay, i said the graphics could have aged better, but this still looks good! And, with the ability to play online deathmatch servers(or other game modes!), its really replayable! I say, everyone try this! Not terrible at all, but not the #1 best game in the world, GREAT soundtrack, and you can play online servers! :)"
11579,b hop fun
11580,"Yeah, I think I know what my father meant
When he sang about the ""Lost Highway""
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris, he is a movie star, and he's moved off to L.A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down"
11581,"so basically i played this game because i wanted to play the other half-life games, but instead of making me excited for half-life 2, i became a lot more hesitant to start playing it. 

one of my main problems with this game is that the combat is very clearly split into two parts - a good part, and a bad part. when youre fighting the alien enemies, you can use the super-sonic speed that youve been given and its actually quite a bit of fun. when youre fighting the human enemies, however, the best strategy is to stand as far away from them as possible, since they literally cant hit you if youre too far away, but you can hit them. this leads to boring segments where you hide behind boxes until youre far enough away that you can shoot them without getting hurt. any attempt to take it fast paced will end up with you dying and it just isnt very fun at all.

my next big problem is that when i started playing it, i expected there to be a great story that comes with it, but this is only really partly true. there really are no characters, only blank slates that you run into during your time in the facility. the main character has no personality, which is fine on its own, but combined with the 0 other characters you actually makes it seem hard to care about the story aspect of the game. the most well developed character in the game isnt even a character, but rather the character of the government, which leads to the part of the story that i actually liked a lot: the way it tells the story. if youre not talking to a random scientist or some stupid security guard who tells you what to do and where to go, your main source of story telling is the environment. theres never an explanation (or at least one that i cared enough to listen to) about how anything happens or how it works, it's just there for you to see play out, which i really liked. this part is kind of a spoiler, but happens at almost the start of the game [spoiler] but the game never tells you how the ""zombies"" are made, it just shows you the head crabs and then later shows you the human with a head crab on its head. [/spoiler] There are many more examples of this kind of storytelling that i really like that i wont go over, but its pretty rare to see that in games.

all in all, it got me to finish it, which isn't very common tbh, but i think that mainly has to do with the fact that i wanted to play half-life 2 after. 

4/10"
11582,"one of the best  games ever
"
11583,"This game has the same immersive value that it did when I was a much younger man. I'm now a 40-something, and I remember when this game was new and the Valve games cemented their legacy with a combination of great visuals, intuitive controls, and excellent storytelling. For me, it was one of the moments where the storyline value of your average Roberta Williams text-entry game on a 386 met the intensity of the FPS world brought into fruition by Apogee/Id. Here I am, reviewing it as a guy with a career and kids and my adult son and my teenager both played the Half Life games. The only reason I can see not to recommend this game emphatically is if you just have a distaste for the sci-fi dystopia genre or FPS games in general. And, to call it either of those things is reductive. It has a synergy I don't have the words to articulate. Play it."
11584,its very fun and good story
11585,"Beat the game in like 7 hours
"
11586,k
11587,"It's a very good Horror FPS. The combat is great though the AI is a little clunky. It's graphics have aged, but i don't think that takes away anything in terms of enjoyment. The Scientists and Guards really make Black Mesa Feel like it's been lived in, though the scientists can be ironically funny."
11588,"Never gets old no matter how much i play it, LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!

More Half Life Please :-)"
11589,hmm yes good game yes yes
11590,Donuts
11591,The first game that set the standards of good imersive storytelling in videogames at the time it came out.
11592,I can't believe they put Walter White in a video game so I had to play this
11593,cool
11594,"Original Review: A pioneer in the FPS genre, Half-Life still holds up today. Except for On a Rail. 
And Xen. Fuck Xen.
But it's still a great game otherwise and I recommend you buy it.

Retrospective Review: I should go over what makes this game great.
The visuals, while somewhat dated, are great. The artstyle is semi-realistic, yet cartoony, and the animations nicely reflect this. The enemy variety is great, with annoying enemies to easy enemies, to thought-provoking enemies.
The levels are the most contentious part of this entire game, most of the campaign is solid. However a few chapters near the middle and end end up feeling stale. Not bad, just mediocre.
The deathmatch is rock solid though, no contest. And the modding support is second to none.

9.5/10. This deserved all of the Game of the Year awards that it won. This truly is a pioneer in the FPS genre. Buy it and play it."

This massive throwback of an FPS is only 400 MB or so I'd recommend Half Life. ''Eat lead, you outer-space octopus!"" - Barney from Black Mesa"

11612,"Really fun game, Requires Brain Power but if you have more then two Brain Cells it is easily understandable. Some parts of the game require you to figure out what the controls are since the game does not tell you but other than that great game"
11613,I was originally drawn into this game because it was SCP-esque and had no idea how fucking much I would love this game to the point that it's probably my favorite series right now

11628,"The game that started a revolution, the game that started a new age, the game that started a legend franchise, the game that is called Half Life. I don't think that you need any introduction about this game.

From me, 10/10.
I hope this helped, thank you and take care."

11631,"This game completely changed FPS games. Back when this came out a majority of the FPS games had little to no story. This completely changed that. This game deserves to be considered ""The Best PC Game of All Time."" My only problem with the game is the difficulty. maybe I'm just bad, but it took me 20 hours to beat it on easy mode. This game is exciting."

11653,"Half-Life is an old game. The graphics aren‚Äôt optimal and you move more awkwardly. But it‚Äôs a very nice game. Gordon Freeman is a scientist at the Black Mesa facility. Something goes horribly wrong. He has to shoot is way out of the facility. But the challenge starts with a crowbar and you have to find your way through fast appearing enemies and lethal defence systems. Later on, the military attacks the whole complex. The police force and the remaining scientists stay on your side, if you don‚Äôt harm them. Some of the enemies are previous, unlucky scientists controlled by headcrabs. The enemies are unintelligible. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a quite fascinating world where only Gordon Freeman can deal with the terrible situation. Worlds are interconnected through portals. You‚Äôre jumping, climbing and crawling. Being aware of the enemies is essential. The story is told by scripted sequences, which are triggered as you proceed. The attackers charge, beat, spit, burst, shock, bite, pull up, shoot in various ways, and throw. There are biohazardious conditions. And there‚Äôs this man in the suit, who appear to behind the mistake that was made.

I have played the game since very the end of the 1990s, and it was no doubtful the best shooter at that time. Half Life: Counter-Strike, a multiplayer, is still an attractive esports on TV due to it‚Äôs low complexity. It‚Äôs easy to understand."

11699,"This game aged worse than my grandfathers fertility, every inch of this game made me want to grab the revolver out of gordons fucking hand and blow my brains out with it. 

its slow, clunky, boring most of the time. 

For the first game this studio made, its not bad. Just nowadays by comparison its bad. Id just say to watch a review instead

in short: Goldsource Moment"
11700,This is my hiding place. Don't tell anyone I'm here! NOW GO AWAY!
11701,"Half Life has aged surprisingly well but its still an old game so it has several issues. It was a pretty experience for me though so I would recommend it. However, it isn't necessary to play this to understand Half Life 2,  so if want to skip to Half Life 2 (which is a much better game) then you can. Although I think its still pretty fun and worth a shot."

11714,Classic game 10/10
11715,"Half Life. what do i say about you?


I don't know, you're fun and cool but you're quite old too. i feel like, I shouldve bought Black Mesa instead, but i do enjoy Half Life.

11729,amazing
11730,"Cool, can you update tf2 tho."
11731,"It's the classic that brought us all here. If it weren't for this game I doubt we would even have Steam or Valve. Graphics are dated, of course, but the AI is outstanding for the time. It runs off a modified Quake engine called GoldSrc, the predecessor to the Source engine. The soundtrack is memorable, the enemies are fantastic, and the community is surprisingly active. 9/10."
11732,
11733,"I have played this game over 30 times in the span of 3 years on it's different iterations, Half-Life: source, Sven Co-op, gmod, mods and other versions. This is a must play even if you've played Black Mesa."
11734,Its good
11735,I played this game when it came out first time.  it was good then and it's great that i'm able to still play it now.
11736,"It's good. I'm really bad at figuring out were I am in video games, so it was a little hard for me. But other people are different."
11737,"|    |  |
| |   | _"
11738,"Among classic fps games, and games in general, I find that I'm quite happy playing them on and off. I'll boot it up, have a good time, and then be done to take a break. Half Life is different. It's a game that almost demands a single sitting, as each level progresses to the next almost seamlessly, save for a very brief loading screen and one instance that marks the end of the first half of the game. Even after that, I kept on playing all the way up to the infamous Xen sections. Xen was admittedly not as painful as I thought it would be, though perhaps Doom Eternal made me accept that first person platforming could be fun. Regardless, this is an easy recommendation. If you can last the 7 minute train ride, you're in for a treat."
11739,An absolute classic whose legacy speaks for itself. I Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
11740,"only played for a bit, it was alright."
11741,"buenisimo, los graficos no deben importar mucho en este juego pero es muy buena la historia segun yo"
11742,"Fun game. Played it when it first came out too.

Quote: Remember that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Probably worth a google?!"
11743,"This was my very first 3d shooter game. I remember playing this as a 9 year old on my cousin's PC and I told myself this is the most realistic game I had ever seen. The most horrifying experience I ever had was encountering the alien possessed scientist for the first time and all I had was my pistol. It felt that I was actually holding my gun and I was fighting for my life. And I remember dying a couple of times.  Bear in mind, it was 1999 and the only games I was exposed to was Super Mario and Contra. 

After playing for the first time, I had dreams about this game. I thought about this game all the time during breakfast, school time, homework and at bed. I didn't have a computer like my cousin's so I told myself when I would grow up, I will get a job and buy myself a computer with Half Life and that's it, I will be settled for life. Again bear in mind, I was 9 at that time.

Fast forward, 20 years later, I download this and play it, and my impressions are this (and I am trying to be unbiased while having my nostalgia goggles off ), the graphics and gameplay mechanics are way too outdated, the shooting is mediocre and I can kill that alien scientist with my eyes closed. So if you got into gaming very late, played all the AC, Far Cry, GTA, all those  high budget AAA games and then playing this, and thinking ""I don't get why this game is great"", I get it, I feel the same way at times, its too outdated. Its amazing how the games have come so far, considering I once thought Half Life had the most ""realistic graphics"" ever.

So, would I recommend this game ? Hell, yes. 

Tbh, I'm just playing it for nostagia's sake, but as I play it, I can't help but feel some of the things this game did right that we don't see in today's games, the setting. the mood. the tone of the environment. Its just a mix of horror, anticipation,excitement, you have no idea whats going to happen in the next room, and it all happen in real time, in first person, in your perspective. No cutscenes, no in game movies. You don't see that many games do that today, and that is what makes me appreciate Half Life.
This game will still be forever in my heart as one of the best games ever made.
My cousin is no more. R.I.P. Thank you for introducing me to such a game and making my childhood bright, whether you intended it or not."
11744,hlaf life
11745,Actually older than me and still great
11746,"An absolute classic. One of the few games every gamer should play at least once. DON'T PLAY ON HARD THOUGH, CERTAIN SECTIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS WITHOUT CHEATING ON THAT DIFFICULTY."
11747,Fun good classic game
11748,"great game

"
11749,What if it was called 'Full-Life' that would be funny I think.
11750,"the gameplay is engaging and rewarding when pulled off correctly, the level design is solid (bar on a rail and the entirety of xen) and the graphics have aged like shit but still have charm to them. the biggest part of this game has to be the way it handles storytelling. being in control of gordon while other characters relay info to you makes the game feel that much more immersive. a solid 8.5/10 experience that everyone should try at least once."
11751,It's just a Call of Duty clone.
11752,Recommended because it's Half-Life
11753,ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER...STILL FUN TO PLAY.
11754,This game is a landmark in the FPS genre. It completely revolutionized the linear narrative that many games are known for today. While it's fantastic it has not aged very well at all. The engine is janky and the final level xen completely kills all of the momentum of the story with long tedious platforming and frustrating encounters. 9.5/10
11755,half-life gordon
11756,play ag play it now
11757,Yes.
11758,"really just a banger of a game, kinda loses it in the last couple of hours it but like 90% of this is just gold."
11759,"This game is worth every penny.
As a wise G-man once said, ""Wise choice, Mr.Freeman""."
11760,Good Game
11761,"this games features and mechanics might be old, but they are gold, another timeless masterpiece by valve clap it up"
11762,"Even though my hours in this game are not correctly reported, this game is a masterpiece and arguably better than it's amazing sequel. Great replay value and outstanding combat that will leave you wanting more, but it's not too short.

A must play for any serious gamer, truly one of the best games of all time"
11763,Is good.

11765,this game is horseshit

11767,best game ever but i get stuck on some parts
11768,"The gameplay, story, and soundtrack were fantastic and overall it still holds up despite being made in 1998. While a few chapters were a bit frustrating I still had a fun experience."
11769,"A classic of immersion, and visual storytelling. There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said already. The only advice I can give you is to save and load often in the later half of the game."
11770,"It's a great game!
It has changed the entire gaming industry"
11771,"great game very important to gaming as a whole and is the first computer game i bought with money, i got this with the half life 1 anthology bundle and *HIGHLY* recommend it its only like 4 dollars more than just half life 1 and comes with opposing force blue shift and team fortress classic overall a great story better game and eve better impact on the industry"
11772,"For an old game, the mechanics and the gameplay are really good, and the time you spend on the game is worth it."
11773,"Step 1. Buy Half-Life
Step 2. Play it
Step 3. Sit through the long train intro
Step 4. Get HEV suit
Step 5. Klaxon beat"
11774,This game is awesome.
11775,that's alot of science
11776,good game

11779,Iam too excited
11780,"Fun game.  Finally got around to playing this a couple decades late, but it still holds up if you like retro shooters."
11781,Played it when half life alyx was coming out. It's a good game but it's hard at certain parts.
11782,very epic
11783,old but brilliant bit of nostalgia love this game
11784,play it
11785,yeaj
11786,Gaben Pog
11787,half life? more like 1/2 life
11788,I liked everything.
11789,old shooty game
11790,Gordon Freeman needs the 3 tbh
11791,"First time actually playing a First Person Shooter and I'm so glad it was Half-Life. Gameplay still holds up and level design is good. Good variety of weapons as well. Only weaknesses are slippery movements and crusty graphics and audio. 

Love how the game makes you think about your engagements with foes. How to use your weapons effectively and to look for hidden rooms full of goodies. 

Atmosphere is still immersive. Npcs have dialog with one another freaking out about the dangers in the halls and headcrabs in vents are scary. 

Overall Great game.
"
11792,"one of the best fps games ever, its kind of a must play for any gamers, i mean its half-life! i beat it on playstation 2 so im going through it again so i can play the expansions. its an easy buy"
11793,"A classic that in my opinion, still holds up to the modern standard of gaming"
11794,"veri nice yeas yeas
"
11795,One of the landmark FPS games. It's aight.
11796,when is full-life going to be released?
11797,"dont shoot, im with the science team!"
11798,the game that changed my life
11799,Masterpiece.  F*** ladders tho.
11800,You live under a rock if you don't know what Half-Life is.
11801,I'm kinda stuck on it right now. Will finish soon. Pretty good. Difficulty a little sporadic but the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting.
11802,"This is the one Valve game I don't like, I like Half-Life 2, but this one is just too confusing and buggy to grasp, with rare fighting situations and 90% of the game just walking around"
11803,Its good
11804,it good
11805,"I'd give it a 7.5/10.

The story itself is simple but has enough intrigue and mystery to keep you hooked throughout the entire game. 
The gameplay can be a bit clunky, but there's enough challenge and depth to the combat encounters to keep you on your toes. 
The soundtrack is used sparingly, however when it comes on it s l a p s. 
And while the final couple hours can be a drag with the infamously poor chapters surrounding Xen, the experience up until then kept me engaged enough to keep me going all the way to the awesome ending. 

$10 is 100% worth the price of admission."

Brings back memories - perfect 5/7"
11810,Gaming should be considered before Half-Life and after Half-Life. This game changed everything for the better in every way possible. Half-Life will always have a very special place in my heart.

Mind broken? SMH."
11815,"It's a good game but do remember that this game won't tell you anything and expect you to play smart. some tips I'll say is that red doors can be opened up, Don't be afraid to use everything in your arsenal, Don't charge at enemies without a plan if you play on medium or hard, and Revolver is the best sniper weapon you have."
11816,verya niceo
11817,"Great game with amazing storytelling, beautiful game design, and excellent graphics (at least for the time.)

Fighting and gameplay feel smooth as heck, and the game is overall sublime. I honestly recommend it, and I feel like the price is worth it.

11821,"It‚Äôs a great timeless story, compared to modern level design, some of the gameplay shows it‚Äôs age and it can be frustrating at times because it‚Äôs unclear what you need to do or where you need to go. I had issues at launch, so i typed in a command to fix it. the game then launched, but messed with resolution, refresh rate, and color correction. i also had issues with the final boss fight where the boss was impossible to beat, i had to go into console to fix this. It still had a great story, and it‚Äôs amazing what they were able to do with the limitations at the time, and fit so much game into so little hard drive space. I would recommend this to people who have shorter attention spans, but for those who have the patience to play through, and get some occasional help from a play through, it‚Äôs aged very well and has a great story"

11823,"If you want a game that's sort of like Alien mixed with Metroid Prime, then this is for you

11824,A classic worth playing
11825,"For a game that came out decades ago, it's 100% worth much more than just a measly 9 bucks. It might even be worth more than games are gonna cost nowadays (which is 70 dollars, which is funny because 60 is already greedy enough)"

Good game actually have a good story. Graphics is very bad but have a enjoyable gameplay. This game have very hard gameplay for new players like me lol. normally story can finish in 3 or 4 hours (i finished in 19 hours but im a little bit bad on this game xD). You can play online with your friends or anyone. This game doesn't take up much space only 299mb (the best game for 299mb).

Story
[/h1]
I told the full halfl life story in a guide. You can find that guide here if you want https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2428761739

In short: A scientist working for the Black Mesa company named Gordon Freeman goes to the place to make a production on an ordinary day. However, they make use of another portal for ships and those coming from this portal consult Black Mesa. Scientists hoping for help from the army begin to be slaughtered by the soldiers, the state decides to destroy everyone in this factory that went wrong. Gordon Freeman, on the other hand, has fun fighting the creatures coming from the portal with the soldiers and tries to escape from Black Mesa. totally this way

Since then I played HL in all kinds of forms. Modded, Black Mesa, HL2, Alyx. It all comes together.
HL is like the feel good movie you put on when you're ill or like an ingame vacation.
I LOVE THIS GAME!"

11857,"It was okay, not as fun as I remember, but okay. I still give it a positive mark because it is not like it is bad, it's just not as fun as it is hyped up to be. Sure it was very revolutionary at the time, but it is very much like Doom and honestly I'll take Doom over it any day. However, it is worth a shot if you like classic FPS."

11878,"HALF LIFE ORANGE VERSION 
Game of the Year Edition. by Sierra and Valve
This is a classic shoot em up game with crazy old school graphics and puzzles.
Some of the older classic games still have it and this is one of them, OK graphics aren't top notch, but the fun factor and puzzles are still there giving us hell and the Half Life Series have them in abundance.  Don't be fooled into thinking just because its old its not up to much. This game is far from easy and on any level I can guarantee you wont complete it in one sitting. I think some of today's game makers need to look at some of the classics because they have lost the art of whats fun and whats boring.  A lot of gamer's want the whole package quality graphics and free open world movement, but with out a reason for running round like headless chicken there's not much point to the game/program and its gets real boring really quickly. With loads to do, ammo to find, puzzles to solve, items to investigate and Aliens and Solider's to kill. This game still has it for me. If you don't mind classic Wolfenstein type graphics I know your love playing this. Have to say although the graphics aren't great, since the release and a few updates its not that bad, the game is very playable. Have fun guys life's to short not to enjoy every second."

The single player is fun too, it gives me a challenge with all of the puzzles, I would rate this game a 7.5/10"
11884,My GOD this game did not age well but damn is it still good

11893,THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING SHIT I HATE IT SO MUCH FUCKING KILL YOUR SELF WHO EVER IS READING THIS SUCK YOUR MYUM YOU NOG CHEESE DILDO FUCKING BITCH ASS I DONT KN0W
11894,Its a really good game and i think everyone should play it
11895,HARD ON HARD
11896,good
11897,"in half life, its trial and error. its very satisfying to get to point a to point b. if you like old-school shooters, puzzle FPS, and fighting aliens, this game is for you! its a 8/10 for me."
11898,i mean.. it's alright i guess? if it was around in 2001 i would love this. But i got lost a lot in this game. It's fine
11899,very pog gaem
11900,The movement tho
11901,"Played for the first time after 23 years, has it aged well?
Like the greatest scotch i've ever tasted! Amazing level design, unique (groundbreaking at the time) storytelling that doesn't take the controls away from you and that gives you some unprecedented level of immersion that i haven't seen in a while, every plot hint, every foreshadowing you find is up to you to find and that compliments the level design perfectly, some good puzzle solving and a final boss that was a blast to play!
A literal time capsule from the 90's, a must-play if you like classic gems.
But i should warn you, even this version is littered with bugs, not as many as the source version but there's some annoyances here too like randomly being stuck to the ground and some story events stopping all of the sudden, nothing that a quick-reload wouldn't fix.

8.5/10 can't wait to play its expansions!"
11902,The game is amazing even regardless of the fact that it was made in 1998.
11903,buy it. don't hesitate. just click the purchase button and buy it.
11904,This game was a masterpiece and still holds up today. I can safely recommend this fantastic title to anyone. but be prepared for a small amount of BS
11905,"The real legend,crowbar forever!"

11910,Hello Gordon
11911,The game itself isn't that bad but I encourage you to play Black Mesa instead.
11912,Really hope this game gets a sequel

11918,berr cool
11919,"Honestly, I don't get the hype behind this game. I've tried numerous times to play this in the past and I cannot seem to stick to it. It's generally just a bore to play. Not remotely interesting. Unpopular opinion, I know. Although, I'm fairy sure a lot of people like this game, because they're 'supposed' to like it. Cult classic culture..."
11920,it's cool
11921,"kind of a no-brainer that this game is good, its a classic after all."

11935,"Amazing first person shooter from 1998 and it still looks and feels great.
But I have one complaint and that is the two glitches I encountered.
1. I will occasionally get stuck in a wall and have to quick load an old save.
2. On Surface Tension I could not see the rockets from the tanks so I would die over and over again from something I cant even see.
So I would recommend this game to everyone if you can handle quick loading a save after encountering a game breaking glitch."
11936,me shoot soldier and alien guys and win the day's
11937,"What a game, fuckin sublime"
11938,Classic
11939,"This is my first real playthrough of this game. I can see why it has 50 awards! It has it all. A good narrative that doesn't intrude on the action, a variety of enemies, and story continuation! Other games don't have this. In the chapter 'Forget about Freeman' (Spoilers BTW) the army soldiers are starting to lose the battle, with Freeman and Xen dwindling their forces. At the end, they all say to back off, and that's the final level with Soliders in! Modern games don't have that. Would recommend!"
11940,"It's good
"
11941,"This is the most oldschool and stabke version of half life that's available. Except the physical version off course.

The game is great and a classic for it's time. If you find this game easy you usually don't take that long to finish it. It is also a speedrun friendly game for people that look into the speedrun community. I myself do not.

This is also the first game in history known for it's great execution of scripted events. Like scientists fighting with headcraps and map destruction during your playtrough. It also all feels like 1 big map.

The story however, it's fun but the main character doesn't speak. It is however a crucial part in the HL serie if you want to understand the story and lore of the game. In which case I also suggest the portal games."
11942,Love it. Lots of nostalgia

11948,"The oldschool, the original, the game where half the levels are frustrating as hell and the other half are masterpieces of game design. Anyone who wants to understand the history of the evolution of videogames as an artistic storytelling medium owe it to themselves to play this game at least once. Yes, it's a boomer shooter, but if you know that word then you don't need a review. 
I play through this series every couple of years, it's always a trip."

The old classic worth of every cent! What else is to say
about the game that changed the gaming universe back in
1998.... This game is never gonna get old with hundreds of the
mods released by the community!

10/10"
11973,yes. very nice!
11974,"Half-life is a thrill ride from start to finish. Every new encounter needs a new strategy. It's fast paced shooting makes it more intense than normal. You also need to think about your ammo, if you use A assault rifle on a hedcrab, you will probably spray your bullets everywhere and waste ammo. Killing the final bass feels good, But the thing I hate about half-life is the final chapter. The chapter xen feels rushed and unfinished same as interloper. If you want a better experience and better graphics, I should suggest Black Mesa. But overall half-life is well the best thing to experience well, half-life. Just please don't waste your money on half-life source, it is a complete train wreck. the old cover for this game includes text that perfectly describes the mechanics of the combat in this game. RUN. THINK. SHOOT. LIVE"
11975,"What else can I say that hasn't already been said, for as old as this game is, it is still a legend in the first person shooter genre, and the game industry as a whole. It changed the way narrative was written in games. The combat is fun and challenging. If you haven't yet, play this and play the remastered Black Mesa, made by Crowbar Collective."
11976,good
11977,"freaking good game, I play it since I was born."
11978,I 1st played black mesa and enjoyed every second of it but the original half life i totally understood why people now and and in 1998 totally enjoyed it 10/10

11985,Good game but the design is outdated and the story doesnt really intertwine with Half Life 2 so if you have a short attention span watch the ending on youtube and skip this one

And of course, A game is moddable for example like Half-Payne, and Brutal Half-Life.

12001,it wos good
12002,"A video game classic. How have you NOT played this game?

Unfortunately, I can only regard this game with respect to the extremely nostalgic memories I have of this game. Seeing this game for the first time in the 90s after playing DOOM for the last few years, just *blew me away!* Valve had the marketing term ""soft-skin technology"" that explained the smooth animations of its character's movements, particularly their mouths flapping during dialog, and it was incredible!

To this day, nothing can compare to playing mods on HALF-LIFE, particularly this one mod you may have heard of: TEAM FORTRESS CLASSIC. TFC was one of the first games I remember playing where, I'd start playing early in the evening - and 30 minutes later, the sun is rising outside. Good heavens! The *one more match* mentally hit me hard those nights. Back when us gamers were doing things on computers that have never been done before.

For the kids nowadays, I'm unsure if this game will be nearly as appealing as it is to me. There are some aspects of the game that will more than likely be frustrating for the younger generation of gamers. (I'm looking at YOU ladder physics!)"
12003,"yeah its pretty good

although the game looks like ass the graphics don't matter
the story is legendary and set the standard for video game stories going forward
drinking hand soap is more entertaining than the gunplay 
i didn't think xen was that bad, but it was kinda short. killing a giant fetus made up for it
on a rail is the worst part of the game

8/10"
12004,"Really fun if you want something to pay attention to but not need to use every brain cell for. I love the quick movement of it all, too. Rarely every do you get shooters that don't focus on being realistic with movements. Prefer this over Half-Life 2. Multiplayer is a gem."
12005,yeah its cool
12006,"I had a LOT of fun, but, I lost the game, I'm not sure how."
12007,its ok
12008,"pussy
"
12009,"This game must have been one of the bests of it's time. This game stands up today in terms of storytelling and world building. If you have never played this game and you don't want to because it's old, just try it."
12010,This is half life. play it moron
12011,Best game I've ever played
12012,holy shit
12013,There is nothing i can say that hasnt been said already about Half Life. Basically its a good game

12029,Hasn't aged the best but I wouldn't have stuck with it if I wasn't having fun. Definitely worth at least trying when it goes on sale for $2 I think. Crazy to see how this game has probably influenced so many other first person shooters I've played. Fighting the last boss kinda sucks but very neat ending.
12030,"If you are wanting a old school first person shooter with a great story and gameplay this is the game to play, I could go on and on with the detail and enjoyment I had playing what I have played so far. While the game may not look the best then what it had all those years ago it definitely proves that games can be good without good graphics. But let‚Äôs say you beaten this version of half life, there is two  other versions to play that are just as fun, if you have the money and time I recommend getting this version of half life then black masa  then get half life two and the two episodes. Half life is truly worth your time and all you gotta do is just let yourself go in."

12040,"Old Nostalgy trip, taking you back to 1998.

The steam edition of the game nowadays, changes the menu of the game to what was modern when Steam released. Games like Counter-Strike 1,6 Standalone and Half-Life 2. I miss the old menu of Half-Life one. Even though you can mod it back to the game if you wish it. You know, just for that nostalgic feeling when game was released and you booted it up the first times you played through it.

Other memories I have for this game is that just like with Quake II, I did not have a 3D card in my computer.
So I had to run it in the beginning, in software mode on a computer that could barely run it. Sizing down the resolution window so it wasn't larger than most people's smartphones nowadays in size.

Then of course when I did get myself a Voodoo 2 3DFX card, I did play through the game properly again, including Opposing Forces. Writing this review though, I still never played through Blue Shift. However, I did mod the crap out of the game, mainly all the weapons. The game also has tons of single player missions crafted by fans. Downloading the Quake Army Knife editor (or QArK) it was super easy creating levels for the game. Including everything else that ran on the Quake Engine.

Last thing I do also remember as 1998 was a Pirates Paradise, a lot of people did not buy the games for PC, they just copied or cracked them to run without the CD. Which is also the entire reason Steam was created in the first place to prevent. But Half-Life had an immensely difficult copy protection to crack back then. I took a long time to be able to make a proper copy of it's CD that the game came on. I did it, eventually. But I was 14 at the time.
But then, I loved the game so much I did also buy it once I could afford it. When I got a little bit older =)
It was the collection with Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Counter-Strike 1,6 included.

So, let's with the game itself then:
Why was it so spectacular when it was released. It is mix of Duke Nukem 3D and Quake 2. So why? What made it unique? 

It was simply the games AI for NPC's in it. And the sense of realism in everything.
Unlike Duke and Quake, the game did not encourage you to just run and gun. It was more about learning how the aliens behave, think before you shoot. You really don't even need to kill everything that moves in it. It has puzzles based on physics, although a very rudimentary one at the time. Move boxes to get where you need to go. I loved the guns in the game, that at least tries to look like real world existing ones, unlike every other game that pretty tends to go crazy in that regard and you don't even know what it is your'e holding.
In Half-Life the Glock, the SPAS shotgun, the H&K MP5 and last but not least the 356 Magnum.
This game was first with that.

I mentioned the AI as one of it's main points, and it is because it was very easy to develop path findings for them, they were smart enough to interact with you and objects in the world in a manner no other First Person Shooter ever did before. They help telling the story in a way that no previous FPS ever has. It usually was either always you and the bad guys. Or like games like Myst, that didn't have any NPC's at all. Or it it had to be like games such as Pandora's Directive, Tex Murphy with pre rendered movies. Or strictly scripted evens such as Monkey Island point and click adventures had. There were no fluidity to the NPC's, they did not react to random events.

They did, in Half Life. The game begins in a tram, a sort of railway system. You can watch a lot of things they scripted for the AI there in the short moments fore the game really starts. Enjoy it, it will be the calm before the storm. The moments where the guard walks up to you when you leave the tram, is nothing special. He talk to you, he has a strict scripted event where he opens the door for you. Even though Half-Life is the first shooter game you ever saw such things. People, in the game. Interacting with you, talking to you. You can even hit the use button on him and he has more things to say. You can visit the kitchen later on and destroy the microwave, and the NPC's sitting there will react to it.
But here it get's more interesting, you can lead them, take them with you once the game starts and you're trying to reach the surface of the facility you're in. And let's say it's a scientist, they don't react well to danger. They will run and hide. Promptly refuse to follow you further with an outspoken reaction. They will help you open doors with the retina scanners etc. So will the guards. The guards will also fight together with you against opposition. Completely unheard of in any previous game before this was released.

The other thing that gave the sense of realism was it's environment. An science complex deep underground but it looked plausible. Believable. Until you get to Xen that is the game becomes more like it's old school predecessors. Xen a very small part of this game however. The Aliens home world.

The game itself was created in small parts together with ID software. How else did Valve get hold of Quake 2 code and was able to implement it in this heavily modified iteration of the ORIGINAL Quake engine. That back in the day did not even have 3D hardware support. So yes, Half-Life started out using the Quake 1 Engine. (Which is why you can use QArK to build maps for it) It's heavily modified to the part where it makes even Quake 2 feel outdated in comparison.

The game had 10 of 10 Graphics for it's time.
10 of 10 Sound design.
10 of 10 Game play.
The story of the main game was also quite long for it's time. Takes you about 8-10 hours if you have no idea where you're supposed to go or do. Took me 7 hours now to run through it.
And then of course the Multiplayer aspect that took the world with storm. The realistic weapons compared with the futuristic ones. The movement of the player, provided a quite different pace than Quake did.
Think, before you shoot mentality replaced run and gun.

It spawned ideas to a game pretty much everyone, even those who doesn't even play games have heard of.
Counter-Strike.

And CS wasn't even the first, but only one of many modified versions of Half-Life. The modding community is still strong today. Despite Half-Life 2's release with it's own Source Engine. Half-Life still has a place in a lot of peoples hearts.

However with a small warning for younger people who is used to modern graphics. This game has not aged very well and may give you a feeling of what all the fuss is about. Although, reading this review I hope it sheds some light on that.

This game is still a 10 out 10 in my book."

12056,"Half-life is a classic game, and it's got valve's signature detail. While I wouldn't buy half-life for full price, it is still a game I would eventually buy (I ended up waiting until the christmas sales) as the story is amazing. Despite it's outdated graphics, the game still runs amazingly and captures everything you need it to.

Also, if you're planning on getting this game, please remember - the game's original motto is ""run, think, shoot, live"" (or some order of those first two words, I can't remember correctly). You should always prioritise running and everything else *before* shooting - you will never find enough ammo!"

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughtew togethew, and adopted ouw son togethew. They awe now both 4 yeaws owd.

When we wewe going thwough ouw sepawation, I found mysewf wost and misewabwe. I was sewf destwuctive. I got so mad one day fwom evewything spiwawing out of my contwow that I punched some concwete in a moment of ovewwhewming emotion. That caused me to bweak my 5th metacawpaw in my wight hand... my wowking hand... my games hand.. the hand that I hewd and cawwied my chiwdwen to bed with.. The hand I despewatewy needed to make suwe I couwd continue to pwovide.

Aftew weawning of the sevewity of my sewf-infwicted damage, I was bowdewwine suicidaw. Keep in mind that just a few months befowe this, I was the happiest man with no histowy of depwession ow anxiety. I have nevew had fits of wage, ow been one to bweak down and cwy, but I was in a wow spot that just weawwy buwied me fwom being abwe to see the wight on the othew side.

Having nothing bettew to do, I seawched fow a game I couwd pway, ONE HANDED whiwe I wecovewed. I somehow stumbwed upon this game and wead some of the weviews. I decided that it had to be wowth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, ow pway neawwy as wong as some of you. In fact, I may have onwy pwayed this game a day ow two.. With that being said, aftew doing so, I had a new found joy and hope fow wife. I was abwe to put behind me the pain and suffewing that had been cast ovew me. I was abwe to expewience othew peopwes joy and happiness. I was abwe to see the fwuits of my ""wabow"". I wewaxed fow 5 fucking minutes to this music wong enough to weawize that I was going to be okay.

Aftew coming to that weawization, I tuwned the game off, and I went back to wowk. It huwt my hand wike heww but I was motivated. I stopped feewing so damn sowwy fow mysewf, and I became the fathew I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am cwose fwiend with my kids mothew. We don't fight, ow awgue, ow say huwtfuw things to each othew. We awe pawents, and fwiends.

12090,"(After playing a bit more of this game, I started to find some joy. This review will be changed to recommended but I'm keeping my original review down below because it just shows how much this game sucks for new players. Have a good day everybody)
you know, this is actually kind of strange for me to actually talk about this when it is a very popular game that is from the 90's but i just want to put something out for the new player.
this game is actually really annoying when it comes to just navigating around, i've seen people say ""the path is literally straight forward most of the time"" as i literally force myself to use noclip to see where i am supposed to go, finding it out isnt easy, at all, and the only reason why they say that is because its literally their 500th time playing the f-ing game, and while this game can also be considered a puzzle game because of the way how you have to solve some after venturing around the area, that still cannot help the fact that you can lose your way on non-puzzle areas to. time for other things i have to say about this, lets see. oh yeah, the combat is okay, finding ammo is for some reason actually hard for no f-ing reason even when there are like 500 boxes to break open, the story is meh at best, and it doesnt give me the idea to actually try half-life 2 when i can, might only get that game to latch onto gmod. which actually makes me think, i should've just gotten the source version of this just to latch onto gmod, no other reason because the game is painstakingly boring compared to all the other games i've played. one final note actually, i would like to say that, all of this, is coming from a halo fan, so the way how i play halo can or does affect my opinion on this game, but i never actually try to compare the two, so you can kinda take that out."

[No spoilers but if you ever want to try this out for the first time without any prior knowledge or opinions about it, ignore this]

The farthest I've gone back in the day was ""Blast Pit.""After that chapter, everything was foreign to me. And when I was younger (and more impatient), I remember using a cheat code‚Äîwhich I have now forgotten‚Äîto skip everything and jump straight to ""endgame"" to see the ending. Even so, I vaguely remember some scenes of the first few parts. So I experienced most of the game for the first time.

Half-Life is an immersive first person shooter that offers more than just shoot 'em up gameplay. There's a lot of problem-solving to accomplish and platforming to perform. It also doesn't put you in a position where you always have to clear out your enemies. Sometimes you have to find an exit as quick as possible or stay away from certain rooms or areas. 

I seriously recommend going into this game blind if you're jumping into it for the first time, which means avoiding walkthroughs and playthroughs. Half-Life is highly enjoyable to experience for what it has to offer. The combat can be fast-paced, the jumpscares are still thrilling (for me, at least), and the constant thinking of how to get from one point to the other can be frustrating but rewarding once you get there. Some tasks can be challenging at certain points but the only times I really had to lookup stuff online was when I forgot what to do after a month-long or week-long break from playing. For every anxious moment the game throws at you, it also gives you those huge moments of relief and satisfaction once you get things done.

The story is simple enough to understand and doesn't need a lot of explanation. But even with its simplicity and straight-forward storytelling, it still managed to pique my interest. I will admit that the latter parts were a bit underwhelming. And I can't really say that the overall story was memorable. Nevertheless, Half-Life is worth playing even just for the narrative.

I don't necessarily know if this game pales in comparison to newer ones, because I also stopped playing video games around 13 years ago‚Äîalmost as long as the last time I played Half-Life. Returning to gaming at 30, I'm still impressed with 2000's era graphics of Half-Life. I'm aware that this is an updated version and there are recent remakes of this title. But what I'm trying to say is that it looks better than ever and feels just as fun as it was when I was younger.

With that being said, I'm glad that I revisited Half-Life and I'm highly satisfied to have finally finished it."

12179,"Ah, Half-Life. A classic game forever overshadowed by its bigger and more bombastic sequels, now brought back into the limelight thanks to the likes of Black Mesa and HLVRAI. Memes aside, though, Half-Life is a groundbreaker in single player FPS games that'll give you that late 90s PC gaming fix you didn't know you needed. It may not have aged quite as gracefully as Half-Life 2, but if you're willing to look past the potato graphics and the clumsy AI, Half-Life remains a treat to play, despite being almost as old as I am."
12180,"One of my favourite games, a pioneer in the bhop mechanics, it gave birth to csgo, yes, it is the one and only, half life. this game is brilliant, the story is great, the graphics are phenominal, (for its time) and overall just a really fun game! in my extemly controversial opinion, i think that the first one is better than the second, but you should play them both! but make sure to play this before 2 to get the story! 9/10"
12181,"Fantastic game even after all this years. It was certainly ahead of its time. Other than its graphics the game has aged gracefully; I now understand why it earned its spot as a cult classic of PC.

Excellent story; the game manages to build a compelling atmosphere that is memorable. The story is told through gameplay, not cutscenes. Shooting and enemy AI have nothing to envy modern games; the gameplay overall still very solid. Movement feels a bit slippery, but it does not impact playability. The graphics hold up better that I expected, but this is where the game shows its age the most; the atmosphere and other details do make up for it.

The level design is organic and creative; plenty of subtle details. Most of the game feels like one big thing, even though you are constantly going to new zones. The puzzles are challenging; the game does not hold your hand; this is from back when you did not have a marker on the screen telling you what to do and where to go; you have to listen to the game to figure things out and move forward.

Half-Life is old; if you cannot stand ""retro"" games, then it will be too dated for your enjoyment; however, if you can change between modern and old games without issue, then it's definitively still worth playing."
12182,its a good game
12183,gaming
12184,"HoLEE SHIT BABY THIS GAME IS GOOD

I loved pretty much everything about this, especially how damn seamless the game is. There's no cutscenes, no real loading screens beside the loading icon slowing you down for a few seconds sometimes, and everything just flows together like one complete package. I really had no interest in half life and bought this game because someone gifted me half life 2 and I wanted to play 1 first, but damn I got what I expected and more. If you don't care about this series and are randomly reading this, play it. It's one of the best gaming experiences I've had in my entire life. 

[i] This next part assumes you've played the game [/i]

[spoiler] I particularly liked the assassin segments. The way they take place in these huge sprawling areas with tons of artificial corners for the assassins to hide behind, and the way the echoey nature of the areas provide both an advantage and a disadvantage. For one, you can easily hear any footsteps the assassins make, but it also means your own footsteps overlap, potentially confusing yourself. Even after you've taken out every assassin in the area, there's no real way for you to know, so you end up tiptoeing around the area with your finger jittering over your mouse waiting to get hit. It's great that in the second and last assasin section you're forced to go up on the catwalks yourself since the assassins can't get down, meaning that if you camped with explosives like I did, you have to switch up your playstyle.

12216,GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIM
12217,I grew up playing video games in the nineties but never played Half-Life until this steam release.  It is definitely a very playable and enjoyable game despite the age of the title.  People's faces are spooky with the polygons as many games were in those days but still a beautiful game for the time and very cinematic fun.  Totally recommend to anyone who likes FPS with lots of blood and explosions and a sci-fi theme.

Games that put you in the middle of the story, not taking you away for cutscenes or anything, was rather revolutionary at the time, especially in the first-person shooter genre. Half-Life still holds up as a fun experience, only let down by it's horrible latter quarter in Xen."

the hd models, i dont necisarily hate them but i dont think it should default to them when you first play the game, thats really my only complaint about it! i do like half life and its MANY mods including opposing force, blue shift, heck even decay is interesting, all im saying is if you have 10 bucks, give the game a try ;)"
12286,"A classic game, but I do have 1 big gripe with it.

Sometimes (for me at least) its hard to know where you are supposed to go or what you are supposed to do.

Other than that, amazing game!"

12288,"Half-Life :)

This game is good if you like classic fps games
It also has high standards in terms of difficulty even if your playing on easy.
This game has some good soundtrack.
If you want a remastered version of It Id look into Black Mesa its 20$ but its worth the money.
The level design in this game Is just as good as HL2 with some glitchy textures here and there.
So overall I enjoyed this Its a great game.

This game isn't as good as people make it sound.

Maybe its because Half-Life 2 is really good (I have yet to play it) or the game was a revolution when it was released in '98, but this game isn't very distinguishable now. I wont judge its graphics because of how old it is, but I will say something regarding its story and gameplay mechanics. The story is pretty generic and bland, really nothing special whatsoever. In fact I would consider this a better shoot-em-up (like doom and quake) than a linear-based story game. Gameplay mechanics are also nothing great. You get a variety of weapons, a health system, and an armor system, every other interaction is pushing boxes or pushing buttons. Compared to the Valves portal series, P1 and P2 are phenomenally better.

Conclusion: Its a generic Shoot-Em-Up"

12368,very good game don't let the graphics get in the way of playing this game there are a few glitches but this game was released on steam in 1998. plus it has good plot that holds the test off time in my opinion it's so worth the money to buy this game and plus it still has an active community of many modders that create free mods so there is so much more content to discover. 9/10 i who'd highly recommend.

The game play was great, the story was solid, and the world is interesting and mysterious.  The only problem I had with the game was the hard difficulty setting because of how horribly unbalanced it is.  Enemies can literally take an entire clip of ammo to kill and some parts you had to save automatically so you don't die in huge fights.  Overall, this is defiantly one of the best games I have played in a while.

That being said, Half Life has some flaws, the biggest being the quality of the expericene. The graphics are the worst as old men will repeat voice lines and have only a set path to follow. The Al is ugly, and dosent compare to other games like skyrim or unturned. The main protatgists doesnt speak and just works, so I love the female minority representation.

12398,"nice! i was playing this on the period that you could play any half life game free before hl-alyx came out, and good classic!"
12399,very good
12400,"Actually played this game when I was 7 and it gave me nightmares lol

Playing 10 yrs later and it's like reliving my nightmare, still the best"
12401,"A classic for anyone who owns a computer. Kinda drags in Xen, but otherwise a well-done game made by a great studio."
12402,"once gordon starts jumping forward very many times, expect him in xen approximately 20 seconds from now on."
12403,"OK I am suprised at  myself for playing such an old game but I got caught up in the Half life Alyx hype (all justified). I skipped half life 1 and started at Half Life 2 but now I have completed all the rest I want to know why Gordon was held up with so much revere in Half Life 2. So yes the graphics are a little dated but not terribly so (it doesnt feel 8 bit!) Today I encountered an Apache helicopter and it was pretty dang good.
It certainly deserves its legendary status and is still well worth playing. I believe there are updated versions called Black Messa and Half Life Source which have updated graphics so I would probably have played those if I had known about them.  I never was a Half Life fan in the past as the horror element scared me off but now I am older and wiser I can now play without being scared of the half crabs but moving to Half Life Alyx and seeing how far we as a gaming community have progressed is real amazing. Art in all forms is what makes life worth living and this is a story thats deserves its legend reputation."
12404,"What Doom/Quake/Heretic aspire to be. An actual plot in a FPS that is interesting. Black Mesa looks good but I have never played through the original. Still holds up well today. Tip: interact with the security guards and they will follow you and do all the shooting and getting attacked, saves ammo and life."

12441,"Half-Life isn't just a seminal masterpiece that has brought on an entirely new era of gaming, The formula of Run, Shoot, Think. Compounded by the interesting setting, the superlative gun-play and movement, the enemy design, and the confounding multi-faceted, nuanced, and multi-perspective story and lore, make Half-Life a game that has aged like a fine wine, a truly timeless piece that anyone who enjoys games should play. 

If it ended at that though, I wouldn't be writing this review.

Half-Life spawned an entirely new formula for making games that others have replicated countless times, it has influenced countless mods that would go on to become their own franchises, games, or have influenced others to make great games. 

If you play or have played any modern shooter, any story driven first person game, or a game that was based on the engines that facilitated Half-Life, its sequels, and its mods, you have this game to thank, it was the first true story driven shooter.

Its our obligation to recognize greatness when it is present, and this game oozes it in spades."
12442,Still feel good after playing this almost a decade later. Makes my potato laptop feel like a supercomputer :)
12443,"Though this game was made in 1999, it still lives up today. Once you get past the fact the graphics aren't the best you've ever seen, it's really a great game. I just finished it, and I'm ready to play the next game."

12456,"A wise man once said that ""Story in a video game is like story in a porn movie, its expected to be there but its not that important."" Many game still fallow that rule today like Last of Us Part 2 but this rule does not apply to everything. If you want to know what was the first example Lord Gaben's immense power play Half Life, it still holds up."
12457,What are you doing reading this go buy it all ready.
12458,"So, I recently reviewed Half-Life: Source, the absolutely ABYSMAL Source-run ""remaster"" of this excellent game. In turn, I'd like to give a review to the original, just to be fair.
Half-Life came out at a time where I had yet to exist. The benefit of Steam and the internet existing is that I don't have to miss out on all these old phenomena that were around when I wasn't alive yet.
Half-Life is one of those experiences that I was very happy to finally play for myself.
I do want to be clear - this game still has flaws. While I feel it isn't always right to judge a game by the standards of a different time, I do also believe that the ability of a game to age over time is important nonetheless. Graphically, Half-Life aged... not so well. Unfortunately, as I stated in my Half-Life: Source review, the official Valve ""remaster"" wasn't really so much of a ""remaster"" as it was an over-glorified port. That being said, nostalgia can come into play here. Some may not vibe with looking at every triangle on a model when they play a game. You may not like how pointy the G-Man's chin is. But to be honest, while the game's visuals haven't aged great, they aren't bad. 
Graphics aside, the gameplay is very nice. The running is a bit fast for comfort at times, but the physics engine and combat are very nice, especially considering the time that the game released. Some puzzles can be finicky sometimes, and while game-breaking glitches are something more common in Half-Life: Source, I still occasionally got soft-locked behind blast doors (which is intentional game design, to be fair to Valve here), and there was one point where I needed to supply power to a tram, and it still did not function even after enabling all sources of power (I reset my game save several times and it eventually worked out of nowhere). But this was one minor flaw in an otherwise stellar experience.
The story is simple. It's not overplayed, and it doesn't take the forefront. It gets the player invested while giving the gameplay the reigns and letting it do the talking. It sets up an amazing universe that the remainder of the games take place in, and I cannot recommend it more.
Play Half-Life.
And when you do, make sure it's this version and not the Source port.
P.S., while I praised the physics engine, the platforming is kind of bad. Get used to dying from a long fall. It's a good thing this is a first-person shooter."

Every portion of every room has a purpose, the combat is clean and concise and the enemies are memorable and easy to follow when trying to take mental note of what each enemy is capable of. Age has slowed it down a bit, it looks like s**t and it has the occasional ""early 3D game design slog"" parts that you'll see in a lot of 90's games, but still one of my favourite games."
12502,YES
12503,"gaben is love gaben life

"
12504,very good
12505,"Don't get me wrong, this game is really, really fun, but there's quite a list of things wrong with it. Imagine a game with fall damage, now times the fall damage taken from falling by 10, then times it by 69420 and you'll get about the fall damage you have in half life. Oh? You barely fell off a ledge? Time to remove 75% of your health! It's incredibly difficult in lots of situations, even on medium mode. It autosaves at some really bad times, and sometimes you might even get stuck in an infinite loop of reloading and dying (although uncommon it isn't unheard of). I would've been able to brush past all that and my review would've been a yes but the final nail on the coffin is how bloody hard it is to figure out what it wants you to do, you have to go through all these different possible solutions to finally get a result that moves you onto the next stage for the cycle to repeat. 4/10"
12506,"This game has always been facinating to me. If you are used to to newer graphics, then this game will be a little harder to enjoy, but it will always be worth it."
12507,"Half-life is just a classic, you can't look past it if you're checking out the history of first person shooters. 

To understand the origins of the game, you must not look at it in the same spectacle of today's games. As a matter of a fact, it is best to become imsersed the the games of older years, yes, older than half-life. Play something like the original doom, and really spend some time with it, and have fun too. Then, take a step into Half-life, and play it in LOW CHUNKY RESOLUTION,  Trust me, in a way, the graphics are MUCH more enjoyable this way! Become immersed in the game, It is sincerely an evolutionary step, and the genre can learn a LOT from it!"
12508,"So I have a love hate relationship with this game. RNG is great cause it makes me feel like I'm apart of the world rather than the world revolves around me. There are time's I die thanks to something out of my control and that only happened a quarter of my time playing the game. My main complaint is the loading times where you think it will auto save but in fact you have to carry on a bit more in order for the auto save to be placed. A lot of my fears was in reality in this world and thank god it was at low poly cause I would've quit 5 minutes in if I was playing it in high poly or in fact VR. (I refuse to play Half Life Alex, except for the G-Man cutscenes.) It sucks that this was a port of the console version which explains the different machine gun but other than that and the save points, this is a fantastic game and I can finally play Gmod without Missing textures. (Well mainly for the textures connected to Half-Life 1.)"
12509,story based fps game
12510,"Fun game, now I can see why It's a classic, can drag on a little towards the end.

12553,its like half life 2 but before it.
12554,mega good at gay
12555,"Still an amazing game! While the graphics have definitely aged, they still look good, and the game play is amazing.  If you are debating between this and Black Mesa(the remake), do both! They both are good in their own right."
12556,"Half-Life was one of the original pioneers in the world of first person shooters. Instead of finding your usual shooting gallery game, you'll be encountering just as many puzzles and mazes as you do combat scenarios.
Also, if you don't like cutscenes, don't worry. You won't be getting many of those in this one."
12557,It's good.

12561,haha crowbar go brrrrr
12562,very fun
12563,amazing best game of the 90s. definitely worth $10

12565,"the game started well, i changed the setting to view full and it shrink to 3x3 inches and i dont know how to fix this to view game or change settings. can anyone please set default settings for my game half life please ? there should be settings changeable on screen with a key. thanks."
12566,It's okay.
12567,"Half-Life is an fps sci-fi action game created as Valve's debut game in 1998 using a heavily modified Quake engine called GoldSrc. As someone who had played 11 hours of the game and never got past Office Complex, I recently decided to pick the game back up and, to my surprise, it holds up really well. It (along side every other Valve game pre-2020) are basically essential owning if you have a Steam account.
Final verdict: Is good, get now"
12568,mister freeman what are you doing in this taco bell
12569,It pulls you in to try and finish it.
12570,good game
12571,"Old but gold.

12572,"this game is truly amazing, from the moment you start to the end its amazing, it was truly one of the best single player games i have ever played. :]"
12573,"Run.
Think.
Shoot.
Live."
12574,"Wow I finally played Half-Life.

In our modern age playing a game this old and steeped in so much history it can almost feel like examining a historical artifact. A person who enjoys games going back to Half-Life is akin to someone into movies going and watching Citizen Kane. In this case I can say with certainty that the homework was damn fine.

What modern gaming has taken away from this game is a long list but suffice to say this game is good of course it's good. The pacing is excellent up through Xen which yeah it's Xen it's not great everyone knows it sucks compared to the rest of the game and Interloper is just ridiculous but it doesn't destroy the experience. 

Surface tension is just one set piece after another of radical goldsource fps action and it's all interspersed with crouch jumping, pushing crates and sweet sweet button pressing action. God I love pressing buttons and turning valves and shit in these games makes me feel good.

Play it and gain some of that sick gamer cred. 

Pro-tip for the wise if you're gonna do widescreen you're gonna want to bump up that fov to like 106 though I prefer 115 toss default_fov 115 in the console and bam."

12582,half life more like hey dad please come back I mis syou
12583,"Ok, I have finished this game more than 100 times cracked and when the HL:A was released I played the Steam version on Linux.
I don't think I have anything bad to say for such a classic.
It's incredible and deserve to be played.
One day when I have the time and money I'll buy the ""Valve Complete Pack"" to play those games from Steam even when I have played them many times from pirate sites.
Valve have made games that can't be better than they are now (in story telling way) and they deserve the time and money spend on them."

12595,"This game did not age well. The three headed monster, or the tentacle thing inside the silo, that's when the game started going down hill for me. Had to continuously throw grenades of the monster would pretty much one shot you. Controls are way too sensitive so good luck turning and jumping without falling off a ledge or hitting something electrical. Then things are buggy, like when I get on the elevator after turning on the power in the level POWER UP, then two seconds after getting on the elevator I would instantly die. Or, ON A RAIL, you have to jump over a box so that you can run up a flight of stairs. Yeah, I can't jump over it. I assumed I had to jump over it, and then I watched a YouTube video just to be sure. I sat here for a couple minutes just trying to jump over a box and I couldn't do it. Tried jumping while hugging the box, tried jumping with a running start. Tried looking up while jumping.

All in all, I'm glad I bought this game as a bundle for only $6, because I am highly disappointed"
12596,"It's Half-Life. Still holds up pretty well in 2021. Despite some issues (scripting breakages that block progression, force replaying areas) it's still a fun romp through a broken industrial zone, where you fight against a decently challenging AI.

Side note: Beware the launch sphincters of Xen."
12597,"this is a really good game, i havent finished it yet but i love it so far, buy it if youre into FPS games"

12609,it gud
12610,Just a classic. Wish I still had my original box
12611,i only play this because  you can bhop
12612,"Stop reading reviews, just scroll up and buy the game."
12613,"I just can't get behind it, and this really pains me to say because I ABSOLUTELY loved HL2 and it's episode expansions (HL2 is also one of my favorite games of all time too, I played it like religiously on my old 360 when I was in 6th grade). I understand how revolutionary HL1 was for the FPS genre and I really respect it for that. But the game is really showing its age imo. I was really into HL1 when I first started it and played through the first few chapters (especially when you first got the HEV suit and that catchy theme started to play) but once I reached about close to mid way in, I just couldn't play it anymore.

Aside from the large and confusing environments (that barely give you any indication on where to go), the terrible platforming (I can't tell you how many times I died by falling off of a ladder because Gordon just wouldn't cling to it properly from a jump), that dreadful section with the green 3 tentacle monster (this part can burn in hell, the sneaking mechanics didn't even work properly), the terrible enemy placement (There's literally a section where you're going up on a lift and 3 soldiers begin to immediately shoot at you without warning, and you can't even properly take cover during this section. This was pretty much it for me.),and just the extreme difficulty in general (I was playing on normal and would get destroyed in most fights, and the fights I would survive I would be low on health. And I felt like the soldiers were just too op. Not only would they always be super alert to you to the point where you'll literally come around a corner and they'll fire at you instantly, but they would also hit you with perfect aim 90% of the time too. Hell, they can even one hit kill you with a grenade. They would also usually charge at you too and rush you. At that point, you would just have to pray and hope you'll kill them before they kill you.).

So yeah, I just couldn't get behind HL1. And that really saddens me because like I said above, I really loved its sequels."
12614,Great game so glad to finally get around to trying this classic.
12615,Now I need c r o w b a r
12616,"To really understand the appeal of this game you would have to be an FPS gamer in the 1990s.  The genre was very simple back then. Pick up key, open door, blow up monsters.  Half life put a new spin on things introducing NPC's, unique weapons and enviroments, and making the game more about just ""shooting stuff"""
12617,"It took me nearly 8 years but I finally played through all of this game.
It's pretty neat, especially for how old it is. There's a lot of times you have to think outside of the box to find some creative solutions to the puzzles given to the player. I don't really like the last 4 chapters, the atmosphere from the black mesa labs is really unparalleled against the platforming heavy alien world of Xen, it feels like these last chapters were rushed and the developer team couldn't flesh it out to its potential like they did with black mesa. Overall, a nice experience, it's absolutely a classic."
12618,"Half-Life is an amazing game, like really good. It isn't as good as people say, but its still amazing. Why I say it isn't as good people say is because there are a couple issues I have with the game, the issues I have with the game are the game doesn't do the best at directing you the direction you need to go to progress, and Xen, its not as fun as Black Mesa and the surface, but its still kinda fun. Other than those two things the game is amazing and you won't regret purchasing it."
12619,Yore Dead Freeman
12620,"the game that started it all, still really fun and challenging to this day. <3"
12621,yes
12622,"Very good, very atmospheric, good puzzles if that's your thing. I'm trying to beat it on Hard and it is fucking impossible. They just made health stations and energy stations tease you with a little sliver of health and the Enemies are fucking bullet sponges, would recommend, just not hard mode."
12623,"If your really reading this right now wondering if you should buy half life, what are you even doing? Just buy it."

12636,"I know what the thumbs say and how dare I say no to our Lord, but hear me out. 

This was a testing ground for a game that would later become Half-Life 2. You get context as to what is going on to catch you up for Half-Life 2, but that's about it. There are no interesting characters, the controls have a little slipperiness (likely trying to simulate how you can't just STOP walking in real life), and the gunplay got pretty boring afterward. 

It has 0 replay value, but if you want to know the story behind Half-Life, just pick up Black Mesa. From what I hear, it's a faithful recreation and the footage I've seen doesn't hurt my eyes if I look at it for more than 20 minutes. 

I guess it's cool that levels don't feel like levels. It's a big complex you run around in, scarcely seeing the outside except for a handful of times, and the loading screens are short enough. I want to like Half-Life 1, but I can't say I do. 

It's dated, so I'll give it some credit."

12648,funny crowbar man go brrr
12649,make the scientists angry
12650,"Informational:

THIS IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS NEGATIVE.

While the game is good, I wouldn't recommend to everybody.

I WOULDN'T recommend this game if:

-You are interested in mods, but don't have modding knowledge. (Installing 3rd Party Mods)

-You usually have trouble path-finding in other Video games.

-Have difficulty troubles in other Videos games on easy.

- If you base games on:
     *Graphics
     *Audio

---------------

If you think you fall into one of these catergories, but think you might enjoy the game. Download the Demo. Which (I think) goes from Anomalous Materials to Power Up.

If the ""wouldn't recommend"" section concerns you in the 1st and 4th statement, you can either buy Black Mesa, or download the Mod (It doesn't include xen though, I think).



As I usually go through negative reviews when thinking about buying a game, I put this as negative. But: I think it as me not RECOMMENDING the game to certain people.

If the ""wouldn't recommend"" section DOESN'T concern you, PLEASE get Half Life in a bundle with HL2 or on its own.

12651,"Classic of the classics, never gets outdated. Old-school FPS are totally my jam."

12655,I don't own this game why can I write a review for it :||
12656,Really ? ƒ∞s there other players ? )))
12657,"A very great game that could have been the cornerstone of what is now just a husk of a popular game franchise--purposely abandoned by it's developers for unknown reasons--that not only had (and still has) awesome modding scene (Counter-Strike is a notable example, Half-Life was it's pedestal before going it's way), but also hilarious lulz meme culture that slowly faded away as well. The memes are still alive though with new, loaded gen-z energy. There are tiny bits of akward moments, but they are quickly compensated by the pacing and overall good design. Everything is for the most part awesome, and there's nothing really to say except that it might be overrated, but I think that's a hyperbolic statement, as Half-Life deserves the good status it has to this day."
12658,cool game

12664,not hunt down the freeman. it's ok i guess
12665,"The original Half-Life trilogy will forever be my favorite set of games, and the first game really sets the tone.  What makes Half-Life such an amazing game is it's ability to tell a story with the environment itself instead of a traditional script.  Some of what you learn about Black Mesa is from the dialog you hear from scientists, security officers, and soldiers, but the majority of what you learn comes from just wandering around and observing the space.  Black Mesa is a real living facility.  Ultimately, with Half-Life valve created the ultimate dungeon crawler that no-one realizes is a dungeon crawler."
12666,"While it is really showing its age at this point, Half Life is a classic that keeps drawing me in with its brilliantly immersive atmosphere, memorable levels, unique weaponry, and satisfying gameplay.

There are admittedly some pretty frustrating aspects at times like slippery movement, a bad crosshair, ladders being annoying to climb, clunky platforming, getting stuck on terrain, tedious bosses, or dealing with annoying enemies.

In the beginning, for every one thing I liked, there was one thing I really despised. Even then, it still felt very satisfying to overcome a challenge that had me constantly reloading save files, though the game does badly grind to a halt when you spend too much time trying to beat a level.

However, the game has become far more enjoyable over time as I improved my mechanical skill and grew wiser in my playstyle, with most of my frustration fading away. 


Half Life is really at its best when you're immersed in the environment of Black Mesa and cruising through every challenge in your way, feeling like both a genius and a badass as you overcome your obstacles with a mix of strategy and skill. 

The weapons are really fun to use and are well balanced, with most of them feeling powerful in different circumstances. I also really like the variety in gameplay with various enemies that require different approaches, as well as puzzle solving, and platforming. You never really do the exact same thing for too long, before Half Life changes it up.



Even when you are just walking through Black Mesa, you're always travelling through areas in unusual ways, rather than just walking down hallways, shooting enemies. While the levels themselves are quite linear, the way in which you travel through them can feel less linear. This variety of gameplay and traversal really makes Black Mesa feel like a character within the game, as an oppressive, claustrophobic labyrinth, filled with danger.


Thanks to the solid variety throughout the game, I don't really get bored in Half Life, unless I am stuck retrying the same level.



Lastly, regarding the story of Half Life, while I don't find it particularly good, it was always compelling for me. The story is really carried by the brilliant way in which the game immerses you in its world and makes you live through the chaos. You aren't just witnessing the events that transpire, you're living through them.

Despite the barebones nature of the story, I felt like I was on an exciting rollercoaster ride and wanted to see what would happen next. This immersive storytelling, in combination with the atmospheric setting of Black Mesa, really invested me into a story and world that I would have otherwise never cared about. For what is such a basic story, the execution is remarkably good.




Half Life may not be for everybody, but for anyone who enjoys shooters I would recommend trying out this iconic, influential shooter and seeing what it has to offer."
12667,Shitty garfield kart copy
12668,Considering this game came out in 1998 its kind of a masterpiece. I'd say its worth playing since you can probably get it for under $10. But like most older games it has some really garbage game design in a couple parts.
12669,anal
12670,"i like game, game good, game fun."
12671,"I've played Half Life 2, and I love it, I also think the old Half Life 1 is also pretty fun as well."
12672,"Half-Life, a game 22 years old of writing, has a lot to be said about it, and a lot has already been said. If you somehow you haven't even heard of Half-Life or the series as a whole on a platform like Steam, then clearly you truly have been living under a rock, and have a hell of a lot to catch up on.

It's masterpiece of its time, but is extremely dated when playing it in the modern era. Obviously while graphics shouldn't define the gameplay and story of a game, it's very clear nowadays it's a game that when it came out, was revolutionary in the way it looked and acted. Even with that said, Half-Life is a game full of story telling, and people would happily argue it was a turning point for not just all story driven games, but the way a game should feel, act and play out. A timeline of games being Before Half-Life and After Half-Life. 

You can look anywhere on the Internet and see it is full of videos going over the vast and deep lore of the entire Half-Life franchise, speculations, anticipation for new games, lost projects, speedruns and so much more.

The game is less than ¬£10, and even though it may seem a smidge bit pricey for a 22 year old game, it's a must play to understanding a structural foundation for the games you love to play today.

One thing however, while the new Black Mesa game may look more promising to play, running on the Half-Life 2 source engine, with more up to par graphics, you must play the original first. The dialogue, references and general information will not make sense unless you play the original 1998 version.

Half-Life was a game that took the world's attention, and helped lay the foundations to the games you love and admire today."
12673,good game
12674,"Doom. Quake. Super Noah's Ark 3D. These are the games that defined shooters in the 1990's. In these games, you were running around, blowing up shit, usually with a vertically locked camera and extreme violence. The draw of these games was that they were new. In the 1980's video games were looked at as kids' toys with all the bright colors and the jump mans and all that jazz. But when Doom came out, the audience for gaming changed. Now it wasn't just your little brother running around and stomping on Bowsers or whatever, you were out there shooting guys in the face, blood everywhere. The thing you have to understand about these types of games, though, is that they weren't very subtle, and they weren't very pretty. They offered little in the way of plot and the levels often felt like labyrinthine mazes to navigate after all the shooting and the blood was over. The gameplay boiled down to shooting guys and then walking over their corpses until you got a key. Half-Life didn't do that. Half-Life gives you a goal within the first few minutes and makes it clear how hard it's gonna be to get there. Immediately you're thrown into combat encounters where you actually have to think about spacing, learn enemy attack patterns, and make every move count. Now, a modern gamer playing this game would be deterred not only by the graphics, but by the dated gunplay. I know that I certainly was at first. But the game honestly began to grow on me. While it takes a while to get used to, mastering Half-Life's combat is a deeply rewarding experience. In the beginning, you're put into the role of a scientist named Gordon Freeman whom no one really likes. You're seemingly always late, your coworkers talk down to you, and your job is to push a cart of magic alien stuff into a laser beam. But as the character of Gordon Freeman gets stronger, so too does the player. It's a game where you're constantly learning new things, having to navigate new scenarios, and getting new weapons in a supremely satisfying feedback loop. By the end of the game, everyone else in the facility that you're trying to escape from begs for your help and heralds you as a hero. This narrative connection to the protagonist is what makes Half-Life's sparse story so potent. It's truly a case of one man against the world, and you are going to die a lot in this game. But scraping by those tough combat encounters with only five health points remaining is tense and rewarding in a way not a lot of other games are, and I respect it for that. The final boss, while really mediocre, serves as a serviceable climax to the game. It's difficult to end video games, and throughout the game I felt like the quality just kept increasing. I was bored in the first few hours, but once I really got into it and learned the ropes of the combat and physics, I started to love it. Overall, I would recommend this game to anybody who loves shooters or is just curious to see how Valve started out. Peace and love, fellows and fellettes."
12675,"Ok, so this game is great, but PLEASE fix the glitch im about to say. I close half life, and steam thinks its still running, i press stop, nothing. i restart steam completely, nothing. please fix this."
12676,Why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties?
12677,"10/10 and i havent even finished it!
"
12678,"Its a fun puzzle game with a bit of easy and cheeseable fights. You should get it if you want to see what all the half-life fuse is about. The only problem i have is that a couple of the levels arent very clear on how to get to the next spot. I got stuck on 3 spots because the mechanic that was used was new and the game didnt teach me that it was even a thing i could do. also if you get stuck at the start it doesnt from what i can tell show you that E is the button to interact with things. Still a good game and the little problems are to be expected from a old game that was trying to figure things out without many other games to show them what not to do or what would be helpful. 

Edit: the final boss is annoyingly hard and is nothing like the rest of the game. it sadly ruined the end of the gaame for me. most of the game is a puzzle game with some shooting to get to each puzzle spot. but this is a full on boss fight with only a couple of puzzles. not a fan."
12679,"Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you're running late."

12713,A good game. Really recommend it and a good 18 hours of play time.
12714,Why Do they make us wear these stupid ties?
12715,A great valve classic
12716,"for how old this game is, it's still pretty addictive to play"
12717,"Its good
"
12718,"It's evident why Valve is held to such a high regard when playing through Half Life. Some sounds are dated but the music is great for the atmosphere. Gordon is equipped with both familiar and unique weapons. Control is quick and concise and smooth, the level design compliments the movement beautifully. An absolute classic that holds up decades after it's release"
12719,I liked the part where you play as Gordon Freeman.
12720,"HELP ME, HELP ME!"
12721,I LOVE ITTTT
12722,the hard mode is hard
12723,It's a classic. You're kind of obliged to play it
12724,Amazing game. Grew up playing it and will forever love it.
12725,Loved finally realizing my dream of playing as Bill Nye The Science Guy in a video game.
12726,"played on hard. very nice. fun, self paced game. takes brains to play but not so much that its a nuisance. highly reccomend to FPS lovers"
12727,"Half-Life is a pretty good game, and I enjoy playing it but you see, the problem is, I closed Half-Life 8 hours ago. Somehow, someway, it is still open and it's not even a tab, its not in task manager and Steam physically will not let me close it. I am stuck with Half-Life, it has been 9 hours of Half-Life. I do not see a tab, I do not hear the game, it doesn't even exist yet somehow it is still playing. 10/10 for game play and content, however 0/10 for being able to shut it down. I may never be able to shut down Half-Life, and I may take this game to my grave."
12728,I love to beat this game like how I beat my wife
12729,"It's pretty good
"
12730,"it's good, the xen parts require abusing saves, but cool for lore + story purposes. if u own this version u can get mods + the half-life ""Uplink"" or ""Decay"" fan ports"
12731,"One of the best game ever made. This game is a legend.

12732,the hecu did nothing wrong
12733,it's fun
12734,"Half-Life is a unique game compared to a lot of what's the standard for games. Half-Life is more than just some first person shooter with physics puzzles, it's a story told through the eyes of a man who has to fix the mistakes he's made, and over the time he's been granted the opportunity of life to save the world from an alien overrule throughout HL2. Honestly, the game is so much better than what I see from most games i've played regarding the FPS genre. The game is fun and the puzzles are challenging, and I tend to have a bad habit of getting lost in some areas only to find out it was right there in front of me. But needless to say the game is absolutely spectacular and even if you, yourself, aren't a MIT graduate of theoretical physics, cause that's just what a game really needs, some brain power for survivability."

12738,"No brainer. You really can't call yourself PC master race until you have played half life 1 all the way through. Truly a masterpiece of classic era gaming, I'd argue it's the greatest video game ever made, even surpassing it's successors."
12739,it's half-life what do you expect
12740,"Decided to play it on hard mode, as how hard could a 20 year old game be? After dying constantly and struggling for 10 hours, I finally beat the game. At the end of it all, I'd gladly do it again. 7/10"
12741,"22 years later and this game definitely holds up. The areas you explore, the different paths and puzzles for you to find and solve, it is simply amazing. The story is subtle but keeps you going, and as you inch closer and closer to the end, the game gets way more tense and suspenseful. G-Man has to be such a puzzling yet well made character, as you realize that he is involved so much more than we see, and the ending with him was simply amazing. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is remotely interested in playing. This game was way ahead of it's time, the models for NPCs and guns would of blown my mind, as well as the areas you get to see, the enemies you fight, truly remarkable."
12742,good music. good challenge. amazing story and well told
12743,STAHP
12744,Half Life is one of the best game. Just try and you will see.
12745,this saved my marriage
12746,very very good game i recommend it very much.
12747,I love this game
12748,halflife
12749,it alright
12750,"I love this game. It is fun whether you want a fast-paced shooter game or if you want to take a more careful, slower and more stealthy approach. All weapons have their purpose, and their balance.
The music, when it appears, creates the atmosphere, and it does it so well that most players may say they didn't even notice there was music. The levels, though, are immersive enough by themselves.

You know this game. It's Valve's first title, and, in my opinion, the best (excluding Half-Life: Alyx, because I haven't played it). Get it."

12758,Yes
12759,You need to play
12760,"Pros:
- Classic shooter

Cons:
- The platforming

I first played Half-Life in the early 2000's and actually never recall beating it until now. I would usually get to XEN and get frustrated with the platforming. The game is certainly showing it's age despite how revolutionary it was for the time. This is probably an unpopular opinion, but if you're one of the few that hasn't played this yet, play Black Mesa instead. They did a great job and I think it makes a suitable replacement for the original in terms of the overall experience and it makes a smoother transition into HL2. Otherwise, still a good game for it's time and worth collecting on the cheap."

12767, Half-Life brings the right amount of story in a way that doesn‚Äôt interrupt the joy of blasting everything in sight. It‚Äôs a surprisingly lenghty campaign but it never drags and the difficulty is just right. It‚Äôs more enjoyable now in 2021 when compared to the lackluster FPS offerings of today that I simply can‚Äôt be bothered with right now.

12781,"A half-life usually describes the decay of discrete entities, such as radioactive atoms. In that case, it does not work to use the definition that states ""half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay"". For example, if there is just one radioactive atom, and its half-life is one second, there will not be ""half of an atom"" left after one second.

Instead, the half-life is defined in terms of probability: ""Half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay on average"". In other words, the probability of a radioactive atom decaying within its half-life is 50%"

12815,really makes you feel like a half life 1
12816,"This game is surprisingly addictive, although I prefer Half Life 2 in nearly every aspect, the gunplay of this game is awesome, and highly captivating. The game itself, though still being fairly good, is quite dated, and I find some parts to be pretty confusing at times. Despite this, Half Life has some of the best combat I can say I've experienced. Some people call the combat boring or repetitive, I call it diverse and unique; the game can be quite difficult at times, especially in chapters like Surface Tension. On my first playthrough, I found some sections to be utterly unfair, but after you understand why you keep failing, you'll keep trying new strategies and eventually find a very satisfying way of completing the arenas. I love the game, and especially it's legacy on gaming, would recommend, prepare for some tough fights, and prepare for unforseen consequences."
12817,"The doors blocked me out of entering the building at the very beginning, a scientist was walking around in midair, and it bugged at the end and now all my save files play the end credit music endlessly.

Funniest game 2021"
12818,I mean its one of the greatest games ever made its the reason steam is here today. If you havent played it I'm truly sorry for your loss.
12819,Good Stuff but extremely complex
12820,"First off let me say that I went into this game thinking: ""I already know how the second game ends, but I'll play this anyways. What the heck. I got it in a bundle for 24 bucks, and it included ALL the others. Might as well start with the original"".

Let me just say that I went in expecting something good. Maybe I had my expectations a little to high.
But this game is just amazing.
Can I say that it's one of the best games I've ever played? If you took away the nightmare that was Xen, then yes.
The thing I loved the most about Half-Life is how much variety and content there was in it. The beginning was a bit slow, but when things picked up, they REALLY picked up. Each area felt new and exciting. Every part from the labs to the above ground areas, even the monstrosity of game design that was the alien planet was an amazing place to be in. The amount of places that are in Half-Life were so numerous that it really felt like a long journey. And don't even get me started on the ingenious scripted events. Those were what carried the immersion for me. I would have been bored out of my skull watching the events that unfolded as cut scenes, but making them live and in front of you just made it so much better.
I only really have two things that ruined the game:
First is the fact that if you manually save instead of letting the game auto save, you can just kind of prance around and load the save game over and over before you end up beating the level. That was my own fault, but to new players, I'd recommend using auto saves until you reach Xen, then  save every 5 seconds. Trust me. [spoiler] Especially during the final boss [/spoiler].
Second, I looked up how to beat the game with walk through videos and guides. DON'T DO THIS AT ALL UNTIL YOU GET TO XEN. PLEASE don't look things up, I am BEGGING you. Once you reach the alien planet, use as many guides you can get your grubby little hands on, because it's by far the blemish on the finely polished car. Just take my word for it and try to figure stuff out for yourself.
I really enjoyed Half-Life. It's not my FAVORITE game ever, but it's easily up there with the portal games, Mario Odyssey, and Garry's Mod. Can't wait to play the sequel
(My current computer can't run Half-Life 2, so I have to wait until I get a new computer to play it.)"
12821,e
12822,Good game
12823,just amazing
12824,Da physics a bit wonky innit
12825,Half Life is amazing I think every one should play it If only more games followed this style!
12826,"It's half life. Of course it's awesome. This game is just revolutionary. Before half life, fps games had minimal story and dropped you right into the action (not that that's a bad thing, I actually prefer doom over half life.) but this game changed everything. This is just about the first fps to have a real atmosphere, complex puzzles, and an actual story. This game set up one of the best franchises in gaming history, and I can't commend valve enough for this phenomenal experience. This game is kinda hit or miss at times, but when it hits it REALLY hits, but for the most part the levels are amazing (except for a few levels, and... all of xen,) and they all lead into each other so seamlessly. The combat isn't the best part of the game, but it's still GREAT. The hecu will always be more satisfying to kill than the combine. It feels like the game gives you enough health and ammo to just be comfortable and not have to constantly scrounge around and be stuck below 25 health constantly, at least on normal. This game is a 9.5/10 for me, the main thing holding it back for me is xen, and a few levels *cough cough* *on a rail* *cough cough*. even still, I can't recommend this game enough."
12827,"Often imitated but never duplicated (except for Black Mesa). Half-Life's visuals are laughably dated if retroactively charming, and its last leg turns into a quick and dirty Quake clone, but the rest of the experience still lives up to its reputation as one of the landmark video games of the 1990's. Its combat and variety in enemies and weaponry remains superior to Half-Life 2. Still has an active modding scene even 20 years later, with tons of maps and mods to play."

12829,good but uhhh
12830,"i recommend bringing a passport, trust me."
12831,"Awesome game, but to understand the plot you gotta go online. Otherwise, it'll be a decent puzzling shooter."
12832,I played half life 2 first sorry
12833,this game very nice eye like it
12834,its a hell of a half life
12835,wowzers! O.o
12836,my friend recommends this game
12837,"100% one of the best sci-fi first person shooter's ever made, It's a cult classic for a reason and if you haven't played any of the ""Half-Life"" games then you seriously need to 9/10."
12838,hafl liufe
12839,"This game is a classic for a reason. My experience with the original Half-Life started with the words ""It came out in 1998, it can't be that good."" and I was completely incorrect. While the scientists and security guards are more funny nowadays than immersive or realistic, I still enjoy the campy 'science voice' the VA uses for them (Coomer is of course a highlight). This game pretty much laid the foundations for every good first-person shooter following its release- both in narrative and gameplay- and this is for very good reason. You ARE Gordon, you can listen carefully to what the scientists have to say and try to save as many of them as possible (lol) or you could completely ignore them and shoot every scientist and security guard in the face mid-exposition dump and figure it out on your own. Everything you do in this game you do as yourself. Gordon never takes control away from you, there is never any text on the screen that tells you what to do, there is no minimap or compass or objective reminders, just ""Hey that scientist said something about the generator before I got bored and shot him in the face, I'll head there"". The design in Half-Life (and hopefully its sequel) is extremely refreshing to play in today's climate, and is really an extremely fun romp through a destroyed lab and a fun little apocalyptic scenario to boot. This is a must-buy for anyone who has not played it and certainly a library essential."
12840,"A certified classic, must play for any gamer"

12849,"I carried a security guard through a decent amount of chapters. He was my best friend during those times of desolate tragedy at black mesa. Frequent stops to  vending machines, discussion of whether or not I saw his last shot, asking to buy me a beer. Good times.
             
After rescuing a few straggling scientists in office complex, I turned around to find my best buddy... Slaughtered, on the tiled floor, by a lone head crab.
                 
In an unstable and deteriorating mental state, I bombarded that bastard of a head crab with my shotgun, pistol and all of my grenades, until I was entirely out of fire power.
                 
After about a week, my nerves had been recovered to a point that I could continue and play the game again. As I reluctantly passed though chapter 6, I was being followed by a few scientists. I needed as much company as I could get to keep moving on. I'm not sure what I did, or what sort of fate this game had led me into, but I suddenly came to my senses, as all three of the scientists went off script and exclaimed ""STAHP"" in perfect unison, in the dead center of a hallway. That word was burning in my mind. I was having office complex flashbacks. These three were trying to tell me something. I immediately ran. Bolting so fast that the scientists eventually stopped following me, as I carelessly left them in the distance. Despite how many others where counting on my to get the the surface, I was heading back down. I just couldn't bare to continue.
             
Once I got back down to the offices, I found all of the tables, crates, and movable items I could find, and I made the most beautiful grave you could imagine. It might have just looked like some oil drums, crates and a small box for a headstone, but I'm sure my long lost security guard would have had the utmost respect and appreciation for our existing friendship. 
            
He never bought me that beer he said he would, he gave me something so much more. An emotion and depth to a game that so many new modern gamers will never get to experience. A connection, and story with an NPC, as such I had, with my beloved security guard.

*I cried*"

12851,This game is so much fun that I could play this all day until Half-Life 3 comes out!
12852,"This game deserves all the praise and high status it deserves, it's amazing. While combat itself is serviceable and overall just standard FPS combat (with some admittedly original and cool weapons), it's the story, the characters and the world building that make this game as awesome as it is. The fact that the game's ""cinematics"" and story moments are always from Gordon Freeman's perspective and you never let up control of him during these, gives HL that edge, the seamless trip from the Hazardous Materials lab all the way to the alien world of Xen is fantastic, it's a phenomenal game that anyone with a PC should play. While it does have some incredibly dull, slow, confusing and infuriating moments (mainly the ""On a Rail"" and Xen chapters) they still don't take away the fact that the rest of the package is a pure, unadulterated genius 90s shooter that has a lot more to it than meets the eye"

12861,"[b] THE CULT OF FREEMAN [/b]

One of the all-time classics of FPS. This version has a built-in speed boost that can feel weird for those that haven‚Äôt played it in a while. Fortunately, Steam has excellent guides covering how to reverse this, in case you want it.

Not much to say that hasn‚Äôt already been fully covered since 1998 when it was released. Half-Life is history, but even to this day the game holds its original charm. It can be as challenging as you want, with a huge and dedicated community of fans that makes it more of a phenomenon than a simple game.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the Number 1 title to teach those that never tried FPS before. It illustrates remarkably well how a carefully developed game rewards effort and persistence in overcoming increasingly difficult odds.

Do not be afraid to try it out if you haven‚Äôt yet. It‚Äôs never late to play a game like Half-Life."

12871,"For God's sake, open the silo doors! They're coming for us, it's our only way out! Oh, my GOD, WE'RE DOOMED!"
12872,Does not hold up.
12873,"I'm hesitant to write a review for this game, as, by current day's standards, it doesn't hold a candle to other games of its genre. However, even now, more than 20 years post the release date, Half Life's gameplay is solid. it has elements that one can still find in recently released games, and it is nice to see that this game, together with other titans of its time, has such a profound influence on what we know and love to play today.

It is not without its flaws. Disregarding the rather lackluster options menu and the aged graphics, the game does a bad job of explaining things. Sure, there are people who give you general directions, but at several points in the game i found myself aimlessly wandering the map looking for the correct action to perform. Specifically, the gate at chapter 7 with the gargantua, and in the subsequent chapter when you're required to crouch jump for the first time are really poorly explained. Lastly, long jumping received no explanation either.

Despite these flaws, Half Life is still a decent game. You can't go wrong with this, especially since it is OFTEN on sale for less than ‚Ç¨2."

12900,"it's half life, what do you expect."
12901,"Gordon Freeman, in the flesh..."
12902,"Half life is an iconic game that you should play. You will be enthralled by the story and by the subtle dialog and story hints that are dropped throughout the game. For its release date, it is one of the best games made. Sure its aged a bit, but I don't think that a game from 1998 can not be aged. Just the fact that this game is super hard, and there is a large variety of guns makes it to where you don't get bored, even if you have a short attention span like me. 

A couple of issues with the game
Sometimes it's difficult to tell if your shots are actually hitting the enemy, but that can be blamed on the old age of the game.
On a rail is just not a fun chapter in my opinion. It's just being on a minecart track while trying not to die for way too long of a time.

A couple things I like
The puzzles are usually clear enough that even if you're stuck, once you figure out what to do you can't believe you didn't think of it before. There is a little inconsistency of what you can destroy and when you are able to smack through a door.

Overall, this game is awesome, and I give it a 9/10"
12903,Honestly one of the most overrated games i have ever played. I had so many issues with this game and just couldn't be bothered to finish it. There was no story present outside of the first 20 minutes and pacing issues leading to me running out of ammunition in a save file and having to restart the entire game. I'm honestly incredibly disappointed and upset considering the hugely positive reception and valve's other major accomplishments.

Half life is a puzzle game first and foremost, not a straight shooter, don't come into the game thinking you'll be doom-guy or master-chief, you are a vulnerable scientist, fighting to survive.

As an old game, half-life has it's fair share of jank but not enough to dent the experience or break the game."

Yeah, its graphics are dated and the game play is definitely wonky in some aspects, but it's such an enjoyable game that I feel it gets a pass on those. This game holds up like most don't. 22 years later and I'll pick playing this game over a lot of newer fancy games. It's really worth the play. This game was the one that got me into FPS. It started my love and enjoyment of PC gaming. It was such a wonderful game and there wasn't really anything quite like it at the time that it just holds a place in the hall of fame for me.

13002,+
13003,good
13004,"Gotta say, is not bad for a game that came out in 1998. Really held up well even in 2021"
13005,"SPOILER FREE:

I had put off playing this game for a long time. I was born after its initial release, and the only Valve titles I'd played were Portal and Portal 2. One day, I had a hankering to play a singleplayer game, having just finished a second playthrough of Dishonored 2, and I had picked Half-Life and it's entire series as part of the Valve Complete Pack two summers ago.

The nostalgia is lost on me, so I have no connection to Gordon Freeman, Barney, or any other characters from the series. Having said that, My experience with Half-Life was most similar to my first watch of Terminator, the Wrath of Khan, and Akira, and not because they're all 90s sci-fi pieces. Rather, I began to see the game's influence throughout everything I've played since. Weapons were familiar to me; small pistol does less damage than big pistol, enemies run from grenades, etc.

What I cannot overstate is how gracefully this game has aged. Enemies feel intelligent and alive; they duck for cover when grenades are thrown, they warn their friends when they spot you, and I even had a particularly smart one (though it could have been by chance) bait me into a room full of his friends. This game's difficulty is ideal. I'm new to Half-Life, but I'm no casual FPS player, either. I found myself regularly rationing ammo and health, checking every corner, and breaking every box in search of HEV batteries, but at the same time, enemies are not so punishing that you resort to shooting their toes from behind cover or manipulating their AI to kill each other. I found each encounter different from the last, and each environment forced me to take a different approach. I might take my time skulking around the outskirts of a warehouse with a revolver to pick off a couple baddies before going gung-ho into the fray with an assault rifle. I may have just acquired a new weapon, and want to try it out. Half-Life's combat allows you to be creative, and to discover your own stories in its loose narrative.

That being said, Valve's inaugural title has not lost its old school charm. Scientists and security guards are lovingly adorable, and I found myself taking every opportunity to keep them out of harm's way, only for them to run scared from a single grunt and abandon me. Enemies amusingly explode into a shower of gibs when killed. The technical limitations originally imposed on Half-Life's 1998 development streamline the gameplay more than you might imagine. When walls are made of flat textures, a hidden vent or some exposed pipes are a clear path forward rather than  a cryptic hint towards what might come ahead. The rudimentary modeling and textures have been utilized to the fullest though. Each area is distinct, memorable, and atmospheric.

I would be lying, though, if I didn't talk about my issues with Half-Life. I found myself underwhelmed by the lack of narrative, and likewise by the anticlimactic finale, though Half-Life is not a game one plays for its story. The soundtrack is sparse and at times cliche. I also found myself overstrafing, given that Gordon Freeman scampers along the ground at full clip regardless of how fast I might like to go. I found myself whizzing through dazzling environments when I would have rather been taking in the view.

Half-Life is a real gem, and you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing it, especially if it's already in your Steam library (which it probably already is). While some aspects are obviously dated, given that while our protagonist can stick to a ladder like a spider monkey, he can barely sneeze a grenade more than a couple inches, you will not be bored by this one-of a kind experience.

13011,I liked the part with the crowbar. 9/3
13012,Just recently got in to PC gaming so had to play one of the all-time classics. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
13013,"Epic!
No need to say more!"
13014,"its super fun to play and replay


:)"
13015,"An absolute classic masterpiece, everybody should play through this game at least once."
13016,good
13017,"The masterpiece of it¬¥s time . It brought us the storytelling from the first person without any cutscenes or a character who would tell us what is happening in the game . And trust me , the story of this game is really mysterious and interesting . It is a game which has very simple gameplay mechanics , linear but interesting  pretty large levels and you fight against big variety of enemies . The game is also not short , it took me around 10 hours to finish it without any tips from any social hubs etc. on NORMAL difficulty . You can also play mutiplayer which represents the oldschool deathmatch experience which is still alive . I recommend this game to everyone , even to NON-FPS players ."

13031,"I can't do my PC Gamer Rip off style review this time, so it's just getting the 5 star ratiing.

Half-Life is at the time of this long overdue writing is a 22+ year old game, a well revered grand slam classic, and most of all, the great grandfather of this platform, and modders alike.

Before Half-Life, First Person Shooters were all ""Run and gun, kill everything that moves"".  You could imagine my surprise when I, a child, shot a scientist in the head for the lulz, only to be met with a game over screen.  Half-Life added mechanics unprecedented at the time of it's release.

4.9/5*  I never give perfect scores, but this game earned it's place.  Well done Valve."
13032,"2nd best Valve game imo, good story and characters"
13033,its very good
13034,Good classic game
13035,"Though I am over 20 years late since release, I finally got a chance to play this game, and it is honest as good as many people say it is. If you have not played the original half-life yet, I highly recommend buying this game, especially during sales when you can get it for less than 3 bucks."
13036,"Although a relatively older game, it still has some very engaging gameplay mechanics and enjoyable levels. Gordon Freeman is apparently an unstoppable being which is pretty cool. 9/10"

13039,This is the best game I have ever played and I will continue to play it until half life 8 episode 2 comes out. (If it does.)
13040,fucking bullshit ass game
13041,"this is one of the best aging valve games, it's combat is fun and the AI are fun to fight against and the voice lines are great. totally recommend to people who are looking for a good story-line game."
13042,"Despite the fact that it's almost 20 years old, this is a great first game to an awesome series."
13043,Classic
13044,1 is superior to 2
13045,Combat is fine but the gameplay is fricking great
13046,its a really good game
13047,Always loved this game. A shame it is mostly filled with bots now.
13048,"i finally understand the hype of the half life series. i would constantly hear people always talking about half life this and half life that and ""when is half life 3 coming out"" and i never understood because i only ever gamed on console. however, ever  since i got my PC it was to play all these games that would never be available on console. so when i bought the half life collection i couldn't wait to dive in and now that i have and I've experienced half life and am glad i decided to play this amazing story game. i recommend anyone who loves a good story game to get this game and try it out. and if its the graphics that really bug you (which is understandable) then get black mesa a fan made remake of the first half life game that does the half life game justice with much better graphics."

Your enemies want to survive as much as you do, so its a good idea to come up with combat strategies. While it has clearly aged, the graphics and gameplay still hold up wonderfully. Kick it like its 1998!"

13135,"Great classic

13136,i fucked up the resolution
13137,"Im pretty late to the game, though it released before I was born, but I gotta say this game holds true to the franchise. The story ark, about Black Mesa, the military, the Xen Invasion, it all connects. I suggest getting Blue Shift and Opposing Force to get the full story, if you are into that. If not, it's a very fun, lengthy retro game with sci-fi specs. The only annoying thing is when going down an elevator, there is a chance for you to get fused to the floor, but nothing too serious. Also.....WE ARE THE SCIENCE TEAM!!! 

P.S.- For Opposing Force and Blue Shift, if your mouse starts bugging out while you turn, all you gotta do is go to the settings and mark ""Raw Mouse Input"" and it should fix the error!"

13139,this game is amazing

Sorry Mr. Freeman but euthanasia is looking like the only option here. Don't take it personally, it's just how the cookie crumbles."

13154,"Half life is a great game, the gameplay is fun and fast without feeling unfair. Sometimes I would fail again and again, and then I got past it and felt great, while I admit I used god mode every once in a while when I had like 2 health (but you can judge me idc). Is the game perfect, god no. I could name off a couple problems but, overall, it's pretty good. Except the ""HD"" Models, don't use them, it's so bad."
13155,fun :)
13156,"Truly a fantastic game, Xen can be a bit of a slog but its worth it to see the ending and feel accomplished."
13157,crowbar
13158,one of the best fps games ever created.
13159,"i love it
"
13160,"I just completed Half-Life 1 for the first time. It was very fulfilling to do so. I usually get stuck sort of early on in the game, but this time I powered through and am very happy I did so. I recommend this game.

The start is incredibly powerful and an absolutely iconic scene of Gaming. The following levels are equally strong, although as I am sure we all know, On A Rail can prove to be a very contentious level. I didn't mind it too much, but honestly just abandon the little traincart, making your way on foot is more effective. Otherwise, the levels after that were quite great. This game is difficult though, which I think is a good thing, but one should go into the game with the idea that at some points it can be as hard as Dark Souls.

Xen is another iffy chapter of the game. Really slogged through it using the Hivehand because I hand no proper ammo. Quicksave is your friend. I prefer HL1 Xen over Black Mesa Xen, beause it lasts only an hour which I find a lot more tolerable than Black Mesa's Xen. The Nihilanth fight in HL1 kinda sucked because there isn't a clear aim, but die enough and you'll figure it out. Again, I quicksaved a bunch in this game and I'm not ashamed of doing so.

To conclude, I think anyone and everyone should play this game, and I think it is a good game. However, I'm not delusional and it's clear that in some aspects the game has grown quite clunky. Got into playing it properly commited and willing to put in the effort, and you'll be rewarded with the wisdom Half-Life can give you."

13162,Just skip the Nihalinth
13163,It's Half-Life... need I say more?
13164,"Recommended for lore reasons, not for gameplay."
13165,It's very fun if you're smart enough to play it right! Which is why i'm bad at it.
13166,"Classic game. Still worth playing and replaying, even after the excellent remake Black Mesa."
13167,Very good game
13168,"What do you want me to say? It's half life, one of the most influential and popular games of all time and for good reason. Most of this game is fast. frantic gun fights cut up with some puzzles and exploration. the only thing I wasn't a fan of is the last boss battle, it feels very cheap at times and I refuse to try and fight a gargantuan mid boss fight."
13169,A great FPS with an awesome story
13170,Awesome

13172,"if you want a review on the classic hit shooter game Half-Life than you've come to the wrong place, instead, here's an outstanding pie recipe.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I have respect for the game and everything it's done for the FPS genre, but even if it were free (which, admittedly, it practically is), I cannot recommend it for the sole reason of it being a waste of time.
I got to nearly halfway through the game and just found it boring and repetitive, with a story and gameplay that's been matched and beaten in hundreds of different FPS games."

13186,"Incredible game, 12 hours well spent on an amazing game."
13187,"Hands down my favorite shooter game of all time. 10/10 Masterpiece. 

Pros:

- Great Story (though you have to pay attention and pay attention to details)

- No boring cutscenes or long waiting times.

- Extremely fun gameplay.

- Good mix between having fun, thinking, and shooting.

- You have to use your brain to beat this game properly, your not the guy from doom.

- Good puzzles.

- Intresting map design and landmarks.


Cons:

- If your looking for a game with characters, Half-Life one is not for you, instead, try out it's sequel instead. You do not need to play Half-Life one first.

- (Chapter Name Spoiler) [spoiler] A chapter named Xen and Interloper are downright boring at some times, and enemy spam. Though its near the end so you will still get a great playthrough. [/spoiler]

And thats about it!

Common Question:
Should I get this, Half-Life Source, or Black Mesa?

Hands down this. Black Mesa is fantastic and worth a buy after you beat the original, however, you will not appreciate it as much since you will have nothing to compare it to in my opinion. Half-Life Source is just a very buggy port of Half-Life to the Source Engine and not worth the money.

10/10"
13188,I Like It
13189,"Masterpiece
"
13190,"I had been wanting to play Half-Life for a long time now. This game is highly regarded in the gaming community as a classic FPS and I finally got the chance to play it.

 As a first person shooter, Half-Life immediately distinguishes itself with its gameplay mechanics. The shooting feels great, the movement is very characteristic and takes a while to get used to, and mastering bunny hopping and long jumps/crouches takes time. There are many weapons available that are unlocked throughout the game as well as many different types of enemies and encounters.

 Every area (until the last few chapters) is well thought-out, with hidden paths and secrets as well as challenging enemies. Every time you progress in this game you are presented with new puzzles you have to solve and this helps keeping the gameplay fresh and fun. You will also encounter NPCs scattered through the levels, some can help you defeat enemies or unlock storage rooms with loot, while others can help you open security doors and access new areas. 
 What's great about Half-Life is the way you have to approach the maps. I quickly found out that traversing them requires some skill in the mechanics taught in the optional tutorial level. Sometimes, it's the quick mash of these different movement mechanics that get you to that special hidden room.

 The enemies in Half-Life are varied, some human and some alien. Human enemies are mostly the same, with a few exceptions, while alien enemies are vastly different from each other. Some are quick, jumping parasites while others are big armored tanks. There are also a few ""boss"" enemies which can't be defeated by conventional means - in these cases you have to either escape safely or used the environment against them. Most enemies were fun and fair, with some being a bit boring or annoying (like the Tentacles and the flying aliens). I also found the enemy AI to be good, knowing when to hide, when to attack and forcing you out of cover by throwing grenades. Alien and human enemies will also fight each other which makes sense in terms of the story.

 About the plot: if you're wanting to get into this game only because you heard positive things about the storytelling, think twice. This being the first Half-Life game, it barely contains any story at all. Most of the plot is told through visual means, with rare occasions where NPCs will refrain from spouting their usual standard lines (most of which have been turned into memes) to add a bit to the story. I personally found the plot to be interesting, but poorly laid out, and that disappointed me a bit (that said, the game's final moments are great and I'm excited to play the sequels).

 The only negative thing I have to say about Half-Life is that the last four chapters are terrible. I couldn't believe how boring and frustrating the game became. The interesting maps and routes were gone, the enemies were annoying, and the final boss was a complete joke. Thankfully, it only lasts for a bit until it's over, and the ending is great.

 The online community is also still active as I was able to find populated servers to try out the multiplayer aspect of the game.

 In conclusion, I recommend playing this game if you're curious about it and enjoy a good FPS with bits of good storytelling. The gameplay is solid, the mechanics are great and aside from poor graphics and the final levels, Half-Life is a phenomenal, unique shooter that is worth playing.

Oh, and... F*** Headcrabs!!"
13191,pretty nice
13192,"As someone who only just did their Half Life journey, I can say that this series holds up.  Out of all of the games in the series this one is my favorite.  Don't waste your money on the Source version.  It is a poor excuse for a port/remaster and is filled with bugs.  This right here is the way to go."
13193,Its a classic I wish I had played sooner.
13194,Pretty good but needs a second half
13195,"HL was the game that changed FPS forever. The graphics are very 90s, but the gameplay is still state of the art. Given the low price, highly recommend."

13219,"Incredible graphics for 1998, definitely a classic for Valve's first game."
13220,not as good as the second one but still great
13221,It is a fun throw back to the past.
13222,such a classic.
13223,"i bought this game a year ago and am barely halfway through, why is it taking me so long to beat
edit: i finally beat it after nearly 2 years. i found out the reason it was hard was because i was playing wrong. google ""Why Half-Life 1 Is So Unforgiving"""
13224,cheese
13225,"Great game, very revolutionary for its time."
13226,"I was going to just write a little reference from Half Life with a recommendation but I think game has highlighted something really important for myself as a gamer and the gaming industry as a whole.

I've never experienced a game like this before and it goes to show just how generic modern gaming has become. Valve's attention to detail and open minded approach to level design allows for some of the most creative and original experiences I have ever known.
Despite the game being 22 years old, I was amazed by how advanced it felt with its imaginative solutions to challenges. This kind of gameplay is something I have always thought was the future of gaming, so it came as a shock to find that a classic title had achieved this many years ago. To put it in the most simple explanation - If you think of a solution, there's a chance it might actually work; so try shooting things and pressing buttons!

Upon finishing my playthrough, I have realised just how mind numbing modern titles are; it feels like the simple formula that so many developers follow now has shut my mind off to being creative with my thinking when it comes to approaching new challenges. 

At various points during the game, I was reminded of the puzzles of the Zelda series - particularly Ocarina of Time, and the gunplay of the original Doom titles, which was a clear indication to me that Valve understood the good gameplay mechanics that made Zelda and Doom so addicting and unique and then took it further with the extra power of computer hardware that was available at the time.  From seeing this clever formula in action, I feel that being given the opportunity to think outside the box is something that more developers need to explore.

The combination of unique and interesting story with sandbox yet varied gameplay is an experience like no other and I highly recommend this as a game for everyone to try at some point in their life because I am yet to have played anything like it.

Half Life 1 is by no means perfect, and there were moments of frustration as the game showed its age - however I did play on hard difficulty mode which is something I do not recommend unless you are ok we having to regularly quicksave and re-attempt. Probably one of the biggest issues is the parkour can be very annoying sometimes but it can also be really fun. Oh and also, there is no sprint -_-

The game requires you to think about the situation rather than running in and gunning down everything (on hard 1 v 1 can be death) so don't always rely on weapons. You can manipulate the environment to help you and stealth is often an option although this is not always possible.

So there is my review and it took me way too long to write but I think that this message is something really important for the future of the industry. Thank you very much if you've taken the time to read it and I wish you the best of luck if you decide to begin this journey, you've bought yourself a rewarding challenge! 

And for those of you who are still undecided - play this game and you too can become a fellow scientist ;)

Oh and one last thing, I was on the fence about buying [b] Black Mesa (remaster/remake of Half Life) [/b] over the original version and I'm glad I bought this first instead. Knowing some of the levels are changed in the remake and that a lot of the flaws of the original version [spoiler] especially Xen [/spoiler] are fixed makes Black Mesa look even more appealing!
[u] Please make sure you don't get Half Life Source because it's bugged!!! [/u]"

13247,"Just finished the game, To be honest, i really enjoyed it, the engine can make up some funny bugs and the story is really interesting, Day be so fine then BOOM, resonance cascade.

I like the old classic look of the game and the voice acting is well-done, the fact i can also use mods on this and it's an easy thing to do makes it more playable, the difficulty is mixed and you can meet a challenge that looks extremely hard but thats what makes it a good challenge.

Overall i really enjoyed playing through the game and i would recommend it to anyone that's looking for a game that's paced on your own skill with the engine. And as stated before, you can get mods on this thing to get stories made by the community"
13248,"story+fps=pretty cool

13249,good
13250,I think half-lief is a pretty cool guy
13251,Definitely a classic.
13252,crowbar
13253,i dont like guns
13254,My first time playing the Half-Life games. Still enjoyable in 2021. I think every PC Player should play the Half-Life games once in their life.
13255,Freeman is a dumbass
13256,uhhh it is good lol
13257,"One of the most influential games ever made. Though many of its qualities may appear standard by now, it is Half-Life that made them so. Despite it's age I'd argue the gunplay and level design still hold up and it's more then worth a try. (Besides Xen, screw Xen)"
13258,Half life is a that still holds decent even today. for the story and game-play [Bit clunky] but the game now is a little harder to. but reccomend.
13259,"lol

13260,Evergreen. Although there are too many bugs for my liking.

13264,"A classic that never gets boring, the only time I wouldn't recommend it is to people who don't like first person shooters, but besides that it's amazing, a masterpiece that was ahead of it's time and still comes together as an enjoyable experience. Worth any money you spend on it."
13265,"It's Half Life. If that's not enough to recommend it to you, I honestly don't know what is."
13266,"Rise and shine, Mister Freeman. Rise and... shine. Not that I... wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest... and all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... well, let's just say your hour has... come again.

The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So, wake up, Mister Freeman. Wake up and... smell the ashes..."

13268,"The singleplayer sucks
Multiplayer is good"
13269,good game
13270,"The original Half Life and the first part of the Half Life story. This game is great and still holds up today. The graphics are dated with low resolution textures and models but the gameplay and story make up for it. I'd almost recommend playing Half Life 2 first then this one. I'd also recommend playing Black Mesa after, it's a remake of this game with updated graphics."

13287,Twenty years and this game is still an adventure. Timeless.
13288,"It hasn't aged well in certain aspects, but it's a good game. Certainly has some spooky moments. It's just unfortunate that the spookiest ones can be platforming. At 17 hours to credits I'd say it was worth the time invested just for the chance to play hide and seek with the G man."
13289,its good
13290,"My first time playing Half-Life and my god was this game a masterpiece. I grew playing console games and the famous Master Chief of Halo, now into the PC world present with Gordon Freeman in Half-Life. Halo was always my favorite sci-fi shooter, but Half-Life now holds a special place in my heart alongside."

13300,Awesome single player fps game
13301,fun
13302,"Hello, Gordon!"
13303,"as someone who loves the series, I would really like to love this game, but I cant, the movement is very good and fun, the graphics havent aged wel butl its not horrible, but the level design is just straight up bad and unintuitive for someone on their first playthrough. I often found myself not knowing what I am supposed to do and it was very frustrating. not being able to load a previous quicksave like in half life 2 also worsened the experience as I would often softlock myself into a death loop and be forced to either cheat or use an autosave."
13304,"Half Life is a work of fps genius. The gunplay is fun and satisfying, the story is great although bare bones since it was the 90's, and the artstyle and aesthetic is incredible. I love the industrial gloom of the Black Mesa lab, and the enemy design ranges from basic human guards, to crazy alien creatures. The only complaint is the final levels of the game, where there are a lot of frusturating moments to be had in. Still an incredible game. 9.7/10"
13305,Yes.
13306,Best game in this side of the galaxy. The history its amazing. 10/10 would play again and again
13307,"Good game with some fun combat and interesting levels. The game does get a bit repetitive after a few hours, although the level design does make up for that. The story premise is interesting but I don't think it's a masterpiece like most people make it out to be."

13309,What can I say? It's Half Life. GET IT!

13327,"I love you Valve, thank you for making this masterpiece."
13328,"Used to play this game when I was a kid. Coming back to it now as an adult, I still thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did back then. The graphics are outdated, yes, but back when this game was new (it's older than I am), it was top of the line. It has a rich storyline, very amazing gameplay, and loads of lore. I highly recommend this game."
13329,half retardent
13330,rewind the zombie screams
13331,"After over 20 years, I was surprised how much the original Half Life held up. Before playing, I had come to the conclusion that Half Life wasn't worth playing and assumed there was no reason to play it over the remake, Black Mesa. However, after playing, I've decided that Black Mesa isn't so much a remake of Half Life as it is a re-imaging. As a result, both are great and deserve to be played. So, what exactly makes the original Half Life worth your time to play in 2021? First, the game-play has aged very well. There are some clunky aspects, most notably the occasional platforming the game forces you through, which can be frustrating. Despite that, the gun-play is solid, there's a lot of weapon variety and every weapon has a purpose. (Excluding the pistol, which, while very useful in the beginning of the game, sadly becomes useless as it progresses.) That being said, you can obviously get good gun-play from any other modern game today. What really sets Half-Life aside from other games is the story. It was a revolutionary story at the time and changed the way people thought of narratives in video games. Before Half-Life, narrative-based games where always text based or used cut-scenes to convey story. Half Life changed that. The player always has control of the protagonist, Gordon Freeman, throughout the entire game. The story is entirely optional, you can kill anyone you like and completely ignore it. (Which in it of itself actually improves the narrative as it allows Gordon Freeman to be a greater vessel for the player.) But for those willing to look, a very rich narrative is in store, one that you are given the option to experience through dialogue and general observations of the world around you. What also sets Half-Life apart from other games is the setting. Most of the game takes place in the Black Mesa research facility, with the exception of the last four chapters. Despite this, the facility always has to offer you interesting locals and new enemies.
In conclusion, Half-Life's combination of good gun-play and a complex but completely optional narrative are what sets it apart from modern shooters. Also, the OST is pretty kick-ass. That's why it's worth your time to play in 2021. It may not be pretty to look at but what's beneath the surface is definitely worth playing."
13332,really fun but its super hard
13333,"This game holds up to this day. I played this for the lore but the gameplay itself was alright.

I know we take tons of things this game offers for granted today so while you play it's important to keep in mind a lot of things were amazing for its time. The game didn't feel slow at any point, there's a good variety of different environments. As with a lot of older games, this is unforgiving at times and it will throw surprises at you so you better press F6 to quicksave every step you take.

After you play this maybe check out Black Mesa, the remaster of this original. 10/10 have it in your library."
13334,The Definitive Half-Life 1 experience!
13335,parfait
13336,I get to play as Gordon Freeman.

13338,Good 100% get

But, compared to new games ... are the graphics as good? No, ofcourse not, however I swear the AI on the Black Ops is better than any other game, the weapon balance is perfect, the in-line story telling is/was ground breakiing, and the tappity tap monster is still a bitch that gets my heart racing.

Absolute stone cold classic,

13379,Crowbar smash the box real nice. Great 90's wonk and ambition. Fun for the whole town. 9.5/10
13380,"What a ride Half-Life is. Valve's design DNA was present from the beginning, everything that makes this game great is present in each of their following games. With how much I enjoyed it now, at the very end of 2020, I can't imagine what it must have been like to play for the first time 22 years ago.

There are a few minor things that aren't perfect, but I think my biggest complaint is the lack of music. There are some tracks sprinkled here and there, but for the most part the game is silent in this aspect. I'm guessing this might be because of disk/file space back in the day, or maybe I'm completely wrong about that. It's such an easy complaint to make because their modern games have such fantastic music and use it so well. Even an online FPS like TF2 has such a strong musical association with it. I will say though, being born just a couple years after the game came out, listening to the final credits track made me feel like a kid again, something about that era I guess."
13381,yuh
13382,this is not real
13383,As someone who played this series the first time can honestly say that i now understand the hype and am now part of those who can't wait for the third installment. The only way to understand how the community feels is to play this masterpiece in which the game play is still fun and challenging for those who love FPS or  Sci-fi games.
13384,This game is a classic! Its shooting is groundbreaking and i love the story to it! Certainly a A++ if you love zombie/alien shooting games!
13385,"Clunky as all shit and legitimately bad for most of the middle, the classic intro sequence spanning the first few hours inside the facility and the ending in Xen make this game worthwhile in my eyes, at least for one playthrough. Certainly an undeniable piece of gaming history and stands the test of time in terms of storytelling and pacing, but definitely too primitive in the gunplay department to really make it a favorite of mine like it seems to be for everyone else, especially considering how groundbreaking and otherworldly good HL2 is. Seriously, fighting those hitscan marines and the tanks and helicopters and shit is true pain. I dont even remember most of the plot because it takes place in the incredibly platforming-heavy and practically unplayable 7 or 8 hours in the middle.

So, aged kinda badly but not entirely. Still worth one go, I'd say. If this were like 5 hours shorter and had like 10% of the platforming that it does now it would handily be like the best shooter of the 90s. But it isnt, and it doesnt, and so you should be very careful when you play it. Make a quicksave like every 5 minutes or else you will hate your life. On a Rail made me legitimately suicidal. And the DLC suck!"

13389,"A classic that never grows old. I am amazed at how much detail, story and interesting dialogue they packed into this game.

13431,"[h1] Review [/h1]
Before I start, I will say that I'm making this review for the consumer, not to make a constructive review for Valve since this game is already 22 years old (as of the time I'm writing this) and Valve has improved their games by a long mile ever since. I know Black Mesa exists but if you want the full 1998 experience, you could play this game. Trust me, it's worth your time.

[h1] Gameplay / Structure [/h1]
For a game in 1998, it has surprisingly held up well to today's standards and I can see how it has influenced modern day First-Person Shooters. The gun-play is simple, rigid, and responsive, you can switch weapons easily, and enemy AI is good. The marines' AI is especially impressive for its time since they behave like actual marines (i.e. retreating, throwing and timing grenades, and also ambushes). Shooting all of your enemies with your standard full-autos / shotguns won't always work since some of them will act like bullet sponges. Usually they respond differently depending on the types of enemies. Companion A.I. is kind of wonky as they will sometimes stop mid-way or block your path, but it isn't a big problem since you will navigate the game all by yourself.

Design-wise, the levels are good and they aren't maze-like or brain-dead simple as you can navigate some of the levels with ease. Objectives can be a little difficult to work on your own if you don't pay attention as the game doesn't have any way-points, arrows or memos. So you might need to rely on the environmental design to traverse. But sometimes, it's difficult to figure that out by yourself so you might find yourself stuck in some areas. There are also a few times where geometrical bugs can get you stuck as the game loads or if you went in a secluded space. Enemy placement can be overwhelming and frustrating at times [i](looking at you, helicopter...)[/i] so you will need to stock up for the big parts in the game. 

Xen is decent at best although a bit awkwardly designed. You might need some walkthrough guides to traverse and platforming here can be wonky. It's also shorter (an hour) than the Black Mesa parts but it doesn't drag on too far. 

[h1] Graphics / Aesthetics [/h1]
The world-building and atmosphere is phenomenal for its time. The huge complexes and rooms reminds you of warehouses you would often find inside factories but in a more sci-fi fashion. Outside areas and Xen are okay I guess, nothing more to say there. The pixelated textures and skyboxes aren't that impressive now but it helps bring out the vibrant yet oppressive atmosphere you're playing in the game. The particle effects and liquid physics are actually pretty impressive for its time, and there are some physics involved but it mostly involves some boxes.

Enemies are cleverly designed and are easily distinguishable. The cloned scientists and guards can be a bit immersion-breaking at some times but I wouldn't mind it. Sound-design is also great although low-quality (as expected), and it complements the world around you.

[h1] Story [/h1]
It's pretty straight-forward and simple. You are a scientist and things go to hell in the Black Mesa complex so you fight bad guys and stuff like that. I won't spoil anything but there are also some pretty interesting lore behind the environments and situations you walk in, including the enemies you fight. 

[h1] Overall [/h1]
This game served as a landmark for all the modern FPS games to come. Its immersive environments and tightly-packed gameplay is a big strength for a game. Although it doesn't come without its flaws, it's still great enough to play the game. I wouldn't really play the campaign again for long but it's your choice. I think it's a ""one-time"" experience for me since I don't want to experience the frustrating parts again, but you can always speed-run the game if you want. It's a solid game worth your time and you won't be disappointed."
13432,"for what it was, it was a fun game with an enticing story and some creative puzzles."
13433,"It good, i like"
13434,Hunt down the Freeman
13435,"Legendary Game. 
Although do yourself a favour and disable HD models in video settings tab. They honestly dont look that much better imo and they change the Glock into a Beretta and the MP5 into an M4! Which makes no sense as it uses the same ammo as your pistol lmao.
That aside, this game changed the fps genre so yeah, if you consider yourself a fan of fps games then you owe it to yourself to play Half-Life.
P.S. Don't play Half-Life: Source, cos it's a lazy port and a buggy mess, play the original only."

13446,"Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy romantic comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily aimed at animated Disney films.[6] In the story, an ogre called Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.

The rights to Steig's book were purchased by Steven Spielberg in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before the work was finished, Mike Myers stepped in to voice the character, which was changed to a Scottish accent in the process. The film was intended to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to hire Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation.

Shrek premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or,[7] making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so.[8] It was widely praised as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed $484.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It earned six award nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), ultimately winning Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation, and three sequels were released‚ÄîShrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)‚Äîalong with two holiday specials, a spin-off film, and a stage musical that kickstarted the Shrek franchise. Although plans for a fifth film were canceled prior to the fourth film's release,[9] the project was revived in 2016 and has since stalled, with production and a potential release date getting pushed back.[10][11]"

13448,"I played this to alleviate boredom during Covid-19 and damn it's good, easily one of the greatest FPS games of its time, i know Black Mesa is a thing but there's no denying the OG is pretty solid, too, aside from a few glitches here and there.

Now on to Half-Life 2..eventually"
13449,"Have enjoyed this game since it was introduced in 1999. Haven't tired of it at all.
Great online server resources."
13450,This is a kind of game that everyone should play at least once.
13451,"hard sometime but epic when kill science nerd
"
13452,"[h1]5.5/10[/h1]

While I really love the Half-Life Franchise, this game does not hold up. 

This game ISN'T bad, but I don't think it's the best way to experience the Black Mesa incident. My play through has been tiring, confusing, and frustrating. Hell, I haven't even beaten the game within the 10 hours I played.

If you want a more modern experience that's more reminiscent of Half-Life 2, play Black Mesa. It's a much more enjoyable experience in my opinion."

13462,This game holds up amazingly considering it's  22 years old.
13463,"Truly a very unique and interesting pc classic that revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. I love the tension overall, and sense of dread and uneasiness from the presence of enemies at times, it's perfect for this game specifically. Unlike other single-player fps games like Doom or Metroid Prime you aren't playing as a trained soldier or marine of sorts, you're playing as Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who probably has never held a gun before in his life. This isn't a ""run and gun"" kind of shooter, but more so a puzzle shooter that requires you to think as if you were in Gordon's situation in real life, which definitely can make the game a little difficult as I feel it does not do a very good job of getting the player into that mindset with the saves you can use over and over. The game admittedly goes very downhill in the Xen chapter and everything after it. Let's not talk about the on a rail chapter too, that chapter was shit. Other than these discrepancies, the game is great and something any fan of the first-person shooter genre should experience."
13464,YES

13485,It's a Childhood-Love and bond which is absolutely indestructible. I still enjoy this game so much and all the addons as well. This is pure nostalgia and everytime the startup screen smiles at me I get this warm and happy feeling from back in the days when I had it on CD..
13486,yes
13487,Far greater than his overrated sequel.
13488,I don't really understand how this game was praised for its story.
13489,"I‚Äôm not really sure why this game is so highly rated, there is a lot wrong with it.

Personally, I really am not liking it. It could have been incredibly back in the day, but it isn‚Äôt so good now. There just isn‚Äôt much good about the game. I had my hopes up for the story, but it has been rather simple and not really good, though I haven‚Äôt been through too much to have a strong opinion. Gameplay is mediocre at best. A lot of the enemies don‚Äôt feel like they are taking damage, so it‚Äôs difficult to judge if you have hit your shots or not. Sometimes, the shots just simply don‚Äôt hit, maybe some small box got in the way but even when shooting point blank with a shotgun some enemies will still survive because it somehow ‚Äúmissed‚Äù. The mobs aren‚Äôt that fun to fight. They have small hit boxes, jump at you before you can react. Another one has hitscan weapons so it‚Äôs hard to fight them if you don‚Äôt have natural regeneration. The ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù aren‚Äôt fun, but more frustrating. I often got stuck because I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I felt like I got softlocked multiple times. I even had to look up how to pass a certain level, which involved hitting a power switch which looked like some simple decoration and not the key to progress. The graphics are shit, I mean it‚Äôs 20 years old I knew what to expect, and the sound effects are also shit, yes I know it‚Äôs old but it still doesn‚Äôt help. The game also doesn‚Äôt seem to have a proper soundtrack, which is something I really dislike. It doesn‚Äôt have to be incredible or always present, but at least doing something like portal would have been nice. All in all, the clunky combat, bad parkour, no natural regeneration, confusing puzzles don‚Äôt mix well with the fact that the game is 20 years old. It might appeal to other people, after all I‚Äôm not a FPS guy, but I don‚Äôt really understand the hype of the game. Maybe half life 2 is better, I‚Äôll give it a shot, but I think I will abandon or refund this game because I really was expected something good, I really only want to play a 20 year old game if it is an absolute gem, but unfortunately this game isn‚Äôt it.

10 hours later, still don't like it. I found out that I was getting motion sick from the game so i messed around and changed some settings to make it less sickening. I always feel lost when playing, the game doesn't guide you to important areas like newer games such as hollow knight, lacking that great game design. I missed several important weapons that could have made it so much easier to continue. I had to watch a walkthrough to find directions and learn how to work through the stupidly confusing world. I always felt like I had to quick save every minute because of the terrible health design where you can lose half your health from a stray grenade that you cannot naturally regenerate. I haven't been enjoying it, maybe a remaster might be better, but I might be abandoning this game soon."

Of course the graphics are boxy and old school compared with games of today but for their day.... ground breaking. Even today the Half Life franchise is worth purchasing for a nostalgic trip back to your younger days and to enjoy a hell of a epic story line.

13584,"its interesting, i liked most parts of this game but when things got repetetive and those soldiers came along i just wnted to get over it so i could continue withthe sequel.
it feels like the end just keeps on getting pushed but that was just me getting bored with the combat.
smart AI, good puzzles and i loved the outdoor part.
its good ut i hope the HL2 is better. 7/10"
13585,"It's rough around the edges over 20 years later, but the game is an absolute must play, not only for the stellar design and gameplay, but just to understand and appreciate the importance of Half Life on future games of all genres."
13586,good)))
13587,Good Game
13588,Great plot and game play.Massive fun!
13589,it was a pretty fun game but not really something i would play multiple times. At certain parts i felt like my eyes where bleeding cause of how poor the visuals where.
13590,"If you haven't yet played this game and consider yourself to be a fan of FPS style games, then you owe it to yourself to give probably the most influential FPS game of all time a shot. Right up there with other masterpieces such as Halo: CE, Goldeneye, or Doom, Half Life innovated the genre.

Now, that is what pretty much anyone will say about this game, and I'm only about halfway through. I think that this common assessment of the game has held up so far, and it is quite interesting to play one of the founding fathers of the modern FPS. With that being said, however, I definitely would call this game very dated. It has aged poorly (especially on controller) and lacks the fluidity of newer releases (or anything not made in the 90s). Comparing the overall movement, gunplay, and feel of the game, I would say a game like Halo CE blows it out of the water. Where Half Life excels from what I've seen is level design, narration, and puzzle solving aspects. 

I would definitely recommend this game for 99c during a sale, but so far I don't think its quite as good as it is praised for. Its awesome for a shooter from 1998, but in 2020 it can feel like a slog to play through at times."

Not only because of the intriguing story and great gameplay, but also because of what it started. Valve showed everybody what could be done with how they fused sound, visuals and interactivity. They showed again that videogames are the greatest artform. Without this game the gaming industry would still be smaller than the movie industry, it revolutionized how we game today. It spawned Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Steam and inspired countless other."

13619,"As a person who has just started my Half Life story as of recent. I can definitely say this specific Half Life title offers a almost perfect balance of difficulty and tactile accuracy to anyone familiar with PC and (to some extent) console FPS history.

The only issues that I can think would hinder some of the experience, would be the jumping puzzle sections can be a tad bit wonky in specific situations, and, back tracking in certain locations in the game can be just a bit to much. This is a game from 1996 that has stood the test of time, so it has obviously been addressed in future releases.

Overall, if you want to experience this bastion of a series, This release needs to be picked up."

Alright, look; it's a Half Life game. This is a gem. First off, don't buy if you hate disgusting stuff such as [url=https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/4/4e/Barnacle_HL1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091228114122&path-prefix=en] This thing. [/url] It appears in most of the game. You need a decent IQ to complete this game; there can be stuff that have little hints / instructions on what to do. Cutscenes? No. You experience all of it in first person. Don't play for too long though, the constant puzzle solving, coordination, and button pressing can hurt your mind.

Look, just buy it."

13689,"Classic staple of the FPS genre, 100% recommend you check this one out. 

Also: now having played Black Mesa and this, I'd recommend you guys check this, the original game, (Not Half-Life Source for the love of god,) over Black Mesa. Where Black Mesa does a lot of cool things, you can't really appreciate them if you don't check out the original game. 

Also: Black Mesa drags out a lot of the set pieces from the original game, for better or for worse. For example, the Xen levels go on for around 3-4 hours in Black Mesa, where I spent maybe 45 minutes to an hour in them here. That brevity in many sections works in the original games favor a lot of the time."
13690,OLD GAME IS GOLD!!!
13691,"THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. 

I'm saying this as a someone who made a first time ever play-through in late 2020

When you think of the term 'video game', HL1 is the ABSOLUTE embodiment of it.

Gameplay, Combat, Environment and Storytelling, it surpasses these in every possible way beyond any modern game. 

I'm in awe as to how well, the movement, combat and gameplay holds up this far on, and dare I say it is still the best.

A Personal Favorite: 23 years later, the environments all look like something like they are out of 'The Backrooms' meme, there was not a corner turned in this game that wasn't in pure anticipation. 

It is truly a blessing to know that Gabe Newell himself was part responsible for the programming and design of this game. He is the reason PC gaming is so alive and well today."

13708,"The greatest FPS of all time...With some kinks

Half-Life is not only what I consider the greatest FPS game of all time, but it is also my favorite game of all time. So instead of talking about all the things I could say that make it so perfect, like it's storytelling, it's freedom, it's gameplay, its wonderful environments, its atmosphere. I will talk about the ways it's not so perfect, Half-Life has not aged well in some departments, it can be kinda directionless, comedic in moments where it's not meant to be, and a bit clunky with some mechanics and full areas. I mean have you seen Xen? It's gunplay is also very basic in most situations with it really only being held up with the excellent AI, basically what I'm getting at is the game is not perfect. But I love the game all the same and highly recommend at least one playthrough."

You, through Gordon Freeman's eyes, must defend this facility, and slaughter all the aliens who have wrecked the place. the game goes on for quite a while, having puzzles in it that may bamboozle you for the next 30 minutes desperately trying to find an answer. The graphics and gameplay of the game are a little like Duke Nukem' but really serious. there have been parts of the game that are not all enticing, but the gameplay makes up for that. This game has got to be one of the greatest games i have ever played, leaving you unanswered at the end..."
13736,Old school shooter that started the great Half-Life series.  Love it back in 99 when it came out.  Still love it today.  Can't go wrong with this game.
13737,very good game 0/10
13738,"Even if I haven't beaten this game yet, I can wholeheartedly say that I enjoy it.  Having not played it back in '98, however, I feel like I have some unique perspective on Half-Life.  The storyline is very well thought out in my opinion (Keep in mind I am currently on Chapter 17, so impressions are subject to change).  The gameplay, however, does get a bit tedious in some areas.  Especially on Interloper, where there are often many enemies around corners that must be killed at once.  If you end up at a bad spot at one point, you will probably have to load an earlier save.  This is mostly a problem with Interloper specifically, however.  Any trouble you may have with Half-Life will come from the fact that it is difficult.  Genuinely difficult.  I've been playing on the Easy difficulty, and the enemies still give me some trouble.  But I like that.  This game doesn't hold your hand in any way, which is a breath of fresh air from a lot of games that spoon-feed things like gameplay mechanics and story through cutscenes and interactive tutorials, which, while nice, can often become annoying.  Half-life lets you figure things out for yourself, which in my opinion, is great. 

One thing I discovered, however, is that Half-Life actually has a server browser with several deathmatch servers.  All of these are completely unpopulated except for two.  I joined one and managed to rack up 200 kills, but in the end, found it very tiresome to get beamed by people with a Tau cannon and Gluon Gun.  The multiplayer is overall very unbalanced, and not the most fun.  For that reason, I cannot recommend it to anyone.  

So in short, while I would say that the singleplayer Half-Life experience holds up, the multiplayer experience does not.

EDIT 12/31/20: I just beat the entire game!  It ends on a cliffhanger, which I found to be a bit frustrating, but overall, I was still hooked all the way.  I still recommend this game, even after all these years."
13739,"$2 on sale is well worth the money you'll get out of it. Not only is the vanilla experience worth the time you'll sink in it, the amount of mods that add extra content to it along with the ability to play multiplayer (using Sven) is one of the best gaming experiences you'll have with other people. It's a beloved game for it's unique entry to the FPS genre along with it's current fan support is a fantastic entry into PC gaming."

13754,yes
13755,"What else can you say about Half-Life that hasn't already been said? 

It's master class in terms of progression and moment to moment storytelling. The music and sound design is top notch and much of it has held up surprisingly well despite the low bitrate of many of the voices and effects. It remains darkly comic in its depiction of pretentious brainiacs getting turned into mindless maniacs. It's atmospheric and even a little spooky at times. There's very few moments in which you don't feel absolutely immersed in the role of Gordon Freeman: PhD in  Clangin' and Bangin' all the way to the surface and beyond. 

It is subjectively the coolest thing from the late 90's and I still love it very, very much."

13769,"So yeah coming from someone with zero half life knowledge before playing this and wanting to get an authentic experience, this game is great. I had a lot of fun playing, and I'm not even done with the storyline yet. When I first started up the game I was a little aprehensive to keep playing just because I got bored, so I picked it up again a few weeks later and wow, I was missing out. This game allows you to do things you didn't think possible blah blah blah fun game play blah blah blah. 

P.S If you think you are just gonna be able to run and gun your way through this game your wrong.

13771,"This is an all-time classic and still is a pretty unique experience for newer gamers. It's very outdated in terms of graphics, and the Xen levels are pretty terrible but it's hard to imagine PC gaming without this game. I played through the campaign and it brought back a lot of nostalgia for me. Before wireless internet was cheap for a teenager I would play games like this in my room from a CD-ROM. Yes, I am old."

13785,"At first I wasn't sure why this game received all the hype that it has but then I took it upon myself to buy this game and see for myself. And let me tell you I was not disappointed. The graphics, I can ignore because this game was released in '99. The lore is what makes this game so good. Its scary, it has some puzzles that forces the player to use his or her brain. And it can also keep the player at the computer for hours. This game will make you not want to leave your computer, seriously. Buy it because its worth the price and the fun and chilling experience that it immerses the player into."

13798,"Half-Life was one of the first video games I have ever played on the PC and the immersive experience left a very strong and positive impression on me. I fell in love with this game when I started playing it in the early 2000's; the atmosphere, game-play, and story was very good for its time - I highly recommend it for the nostalgia."
13799,"Game = Amazing

13800,its very epic i do reccomend
13801,It has a testicle monster in it. 10/10
13802,"this
"
13803,"The first time I've learned about Half-Life was from an interview with Valve that I read in a polish gaming magazine from June 1998. The way that the game was described left a very strong impression on me: from the elaborate AI through the importance of storytelling all the way towards the focus on realism of the world and the situation. Half-Life seemed like a project that could inject a much needed dose of innovation to the FPS genre and from that point onward I couldn't wait to play it myself.

The game did not only deliver on its promise. It wiped the floor with all the other shooters at the time and brought everyone's attention to how much more can be done in action games. It stood as a landmark achievement that, much like DOOM in the early 90s, inspired a large number of clones and copycats while it's overall structure influenced many FPS games in the future.

There's not much to say about this first entry today, 22 years after its initial release. People who haven't been there at the time will probably not fully understand just how important that title was when it came out. Not many games manage to have such an influence on the industry for years to come. For me it'll always be very nostalgic to look back at how it all started."
13804,pretty fun
13805,a
13806,A classic
13807,"Don't understand the good reviews.  Its essentially impossible to complete the game without reading or watching a game walkthrough in at least several points in the game.  At that point it becomes less of a game and more of an exercise in frustration.  Try getting through the 1st water conveyor belt room without watching a review.  The vast majority of people giving it positive reviews seem to be those who are older and re-experiencing nostalgia from playing it when they were younger.  I didn't play this game ""way back yonder"", but its repetitive and boring.  About halfway through I kept wondering when it would be over.  I'm not knocking it for its graphics, but for its gameplay."
13808,the only old game ive ever enjoyed
13809,Very nice
13810,"No, just no, the controls are bad! For old school pc players yes, you're used to the controls, but for every one else this is a game that needs to have it's controls tightened, and improved, but it's not for every one."

Weapons feel diverse and responsive and the platforming is a little too floaty, but for it's age is still perfectly serviceable.

If nothing else, this is a landmark FPS shooter and it's worth experiencing at least once. At this price too you might as well give the first few hours a try!"
13840,just play it
13841,This game truly stands the test of time. It's still just as incredible as it was back when it came out.

Update: I'm 12 or so hours in and it's a fantastic game, although On the rail was rather frustrating. Definitely one of my favorite games!

Final update: I finished the game a month or so ago I think, and it was pretty damn fun!"
13848,Foundational to FPS games. Iconic.
13849,"The game that took the genre to a whole new level. Even now, 22 years later, it still manages to impress, with obvious thought put into each and every environment, puzzle, and combat scenario. The relative lack of hand-holding makes you feel that much more accomplished when you figure out how to defeat a boss, or outwit a group of particularly tough enemies when you're low on health. It's a wild ride that almost never lets up.

Of course, seeing as how they were making things up as they went, there were bound to be a few missteps.  Jumping and climbing is terribly imprecise, which makes the final few stages on Xen kind of infuriating. You'll occasionally get stuck on objects for no reason and have to do some finicking to get free. And the last boss, for lack of a nicer way to say it, sucks. Unbelievably difficult and unintuitive, I definitely got hung up on him longer than any other section in the game. Oh, and the plot is mostly background noise, but at least it had one.

Good for a nostalgia trip, or, if you're a first-timer like me, a reminder of how big a leap this was for first-person shooters, and how much we've built upon it since then."

13867,"Half-Life is an amazing game!  The level design is wonderful; the chapter Surface Tension in particular is fantastic, and a classic FPS level.  This level design was quite immersive in 1998, and it still holds up today.  The story isn't anything too original, but the way in which it's presented without the use of cut-scenes or loads of exposition is simply outstanding.  The enemy A.I. is quite intelligent, and respond to the player in a realistic and believable way.  The human soldiers in particular are very smart, being able to flank the player, and lob grenades organically.  This game is also extremely well paced; intense firefights compliment smart environmental puzzles like a fine wine.  The weapons you acquire are also fun to use.  The MP-5 and .357 Magnum are great and useful weapons, and the Crowbar is iconic.  The scientific/experimental weapons are fun to use, the Gluon Gun being one of my personal favorites.  And, besides the frustrating Xen levels, the campaign in Half-Life overall is awesome and unique!  Half-Life is considered to be one of the best and most influential FPS games of all time, and it's acclaim is well deserved!  Half-Life is one of my favorite games of all time, and a must play FPS game.  Whether is be 1998, or 2020, Half-Life is a timeless classic."

13877,"Some people over exaggerate how good this game is and leave out some major flaws. What once was a masterpiece in the late 90's is now a decent and often meme-able piece of history in video gaming. Half Life is not at all a bad game, it's brillant for sure. The platforming is not very good and often is the worst part about this game, the difficulty spikes up a bit when you go against these very tanky, bullet spongy enemies, the levels can get super confusing and navigating them can also get annoying and frustrating. These are all issues that have not stood well against the test of time. 
But the story, the fun gameplay, the sound design, the music, it's very coordinated and enjoyable. You can still get a kick out of it till this day, there is always something there for each type of player. It's a classic, it really did pave the way for more story-based shooters. If you don't have this game in your library, you can't be called a Valve fan."
13878,10/10
13879,"Great Classic and started an amazing franchise and made shooters where they are today.

My Summary:
In Half-Life you play as Gordon Freeman a scientist at Black Mesa, where an experiment went wrong and he needs to escape as you fight creatures and soliders and do puzzles to escape.

Final Rating: 8/10"
13880,"An old-timer game that has aged pretty well over the centuries to come.

The gunplay is pretty okay, the shotgun slaps at close range against aliens while the revolver has potentional to kill in one well-aimed shot.

The enemies have some variety, from a meager headcrab to aliens shooting homing alien-wasp things at you. Though the main stay of enemies are bullet spongy - HECU grunts and the alien troopers."

13946,Insanely buggy. Absolute headache of a game
13947,It sucks tbh
13948,"Nice job Gabe, lovely collection of code and polygons."
13949,"can someone award this review, i need the badge."
13950,"I know this is a classic game and all, but I would not recommend anyone play it now, unlike Half Life 2. I was not able to finish this game, and when I was playing it was solely because of my love of Half Life 2. I would skip to Half Life 2 and not play this game."
13951,fun with mods and the impressive for 1998!
13952,"barney didnt give me that beer he owed me in both games
still he promises it tho"
13953,One of my first scfi horror computer games as a young teen. Such good memories crow baring every foe in sight.
13954,excellent atmosphere
13955,"Even though this game was made in 1998, it's still a good game."
13956,THIS GAME IS SO DANG GOOD
13957,"Beat the game, gameplay is very nice, story is kinda too simple, you do one thing go to a place do another thing and by the time you get to the end you're not even sure how the story brought you there, also the final boss is a joke, way to easy literally only need 7 crossbows shots, 2 in each of the crystals and then one in the head, all in all though, i can see why its a classic"
13958,"10 out of 10 the story is great and the gameplay is fun, a classic fps that i 100% recommend."
13959,An alltime classic
13960,just play it
13961,"One of the Classic games,"
13962,GREAT GAME GREAT STOPRY GREAT DLC's
13963,"I still remember the first time I 'played' this, on a friend's PS2 while he was out for a while. Not knowing what kind of game it was, the name and cover looked cool though, but I never even made it through the opening sequence. Had I known it was an FPS I might have pushed through, but just walking around felt boring, I quickly switched to another game. Oh silly young me..

Not only is the 'walking simulator' one of my favorite genres nowadays, when I actually played it on my PC many years later I finally got it. And I still consider it to have one of the best opening sequences today, the slowly creeping tension before all hell breaks loose, brilliant! It's a thrilling adventure with many memorable moments (I really love the ending) and a pioneer in environmental storytelling. While obviously dated in some regards, 22 years later it still holds up pretty well I think. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet, and if the age is an obstacle check out the modern fan remake Black Mesa."
13964,"Great game. Revolutionary. played though it many times. so many secrets, and very smooth gameplay. Must get."
13965,good
13966,good game

13970,"Nothing beats an original, well most of the time. Black Mesa is good but if you want the original Half-Life experience and you have an older or lesser powered machine, you can't go wrong with this one."
13971,gg
13972,"While many may disagree with me, I actually prefer the original to its more popular sequel. Despite the poor graphics and lack of basic physics, the ""run think shoot live"" design still holds up today."
13973,"Excellent game!  Despite its age, the story is still one of the greatest.  How could you not love this game?

Just buy it already!"
13974,holy shit why was the combat so difficult i had like no ammo towards the end i was losing my mind jesus christ it was so hard
13975,"I recently played through this for the first time using steam's remote play together, and it was a lot of fun! I'd never touched the half-life series before and can see where all the interest comes from. There are several points where the mechanics are janky, likely due to the time in which it was released, and the steam remote play made things unbearable for the person being streamed to (to the point where they could not see anything). Both our internet connections are quite stable, so I'm unsure what led to terrible quality there. But Gordon Freeman is an interesting character, and this story wraps up quite nicely at this one. Not quite sure how they're going to continue the series, but I suppose I'll find out as I play!"
13976,nice
13977,Although it takes a lot of RAM and video processing power due to the great graphics of this game i still recommend
13978,"good pace and level variation, combat isnt great but still fun."
13979,No life
13980,"This game is the most classiest game of the year! This baby brings back the good ol'ninties vibes! I LOVE how this game is starts off basic and then scary and puzzle-y like! I LOVE the voice actors as well! The voice actors are my favorite part(s) of the game! I also like the idea that you have to defeat the giant baby alien looking thing, but(t) that is not all! I just don't understand why the hell would SML dislike this game! This isn't a bad game for my own opinion, but I never heard of him saying that he doesn't like Half-Life! At all! Please tell me that I was blinded by Wiki Fandom or is it truly what he said? Enough about that! I want to say that Half-Life should at least not have a crappy sequel, because Half-Life 2 is, well, I lied about it being crappy, but it's an okay sequel!"
13981,good
13982,"It's a classic, probably the best half-life in my opinion. Gets confusing at times but of course there are guides online. In short, The game that started it all."
13983,Easy difficulty
13984,a classic.
13985,Half-Life is pretty cool. Everything else has kind of already been said.
13986,"dated as shit in some parts and i needed to look some shit up because some of the puzzles ARE FUCKING AWFUL ok so theres this one part where you go up an evelator. You stop at a floor and you go do stuff, you look around this FUCKING HUGE area and you cant find what to do. You know what you need to do? You need to GO BACK IN THE ELEVATOR AND PRESS THE SAME SINGULAR FUCKING BUTTON [b] AGAIN [/b]  WHAT THE FUCK
overall pretty good 8/10"
13987,This is so much better than half life source.
13988,Time to choose.
13989,Cool :)
13990,...
13991,"although the difficulty is pretty hard if u dont know how to find out where to go because u  have  to puzzle your way through, its still has a very great game play and story and the main character and has cool game play mechanics, this is the best video game franchise now that i appreciate this one more now that i know where to  go and know  how to puzzle my way through the game"
13992,"I honestly do not like this game.

The first half is fine, but anything from Surface Tensions onwards falls so flat on its face that it's just not worth playing."
13993,Is fun.
13994,"The more you play it the better it becomes. Having such a blast, even if I am 22 years late !"
13995,"Do not play Black Mesa
The story isn't as captivating as Half-Life 2, but its gameplay blows it out of the water. One of the greatest games ever made."
13996,is nice
13997,"I had already heard about half life before playing it, and now that I was able to play it, I am safely able to say that the good things said about this game is right. An absolute classic that most definitely stands the test of time."
13998,Pretty epic.
13999,
14000,Yes
14001,grate game
14002,good game.
14003,"The only reason people are playing this game is because it was popular years ago and its the template for a lot of fps games now but just because it was really good then does not mean its the same now. Im not saying its bad or anything, but its ran its course."
14004,k
14005,"Apparently a random nuclear physicist who's never held a gun can somehow overpower the entire US military as well as an invasion of omniscient aliens. 

Yeah that checks out"
14006,One of the greatest game ever made 10/10
14007,A hose is the best weapon
14008,This game is awesome. Still legendary to this day.
14009,Now I know when they say that a game is 'old school hard' they just mean it has shitty controls and/or physics
14010,"Game is a bit old, but still offers a lot of good game. I like it. You like it?

Game has very little bugs for being so old.

Story is immersive and fun. Multiplayer is fast and feels very smooth."
14011,great story even in 2020
14012,"I remember myself playing this as a toddler. I wanted to turn the volume down for the experiment and my parents turning it back up. It was scary.

Anyways, this is a staple for PC gaming.  It truly is a great game. People still make content about it two decades later, and for good reason.  The graphics did age, but compared to other games of the same era, this one comes out on top for me.

At least today, you don't have the long loading screen times.  You also got the mods, and support. 

I suggest getting the Valve Complete pack, as it offers a great deal on ALL of their titles. You won't be disappointed."
14013,My life got split in half
14014,The best game of 2020 LOL :-)
14015,"Really great game. Took me two tries to really get into it but this is amazing, right up there with Half-Life 2"
14016,Shit's Dope
14017,fun
14018,"If this is not in your game library, what is wrong with you?"
14019,"game sucks
"
14020,funny science crowbar game
14021,I'm stuck :(
14022,"so, I've finally finished it, I wasn't sure if i am ever going to play it but thank god i did, this masterpiece from the year i was born in struck me with it's cool ideas and creative situations placement, see, the gameplay is fun but isn‚Äôt that sharp the mechanics are some kind wacky but this is a good thing because it forces you to think out of the box, sometimes literally, valve wasn‚Äôt always the masters of game-play but rather the master of the game, it feels like there is a hidden directory to guide the situation you face in the game so it is always a blast to find the solution by yourself, they don‚Äôt tell they show, and this is a key factor for immersion.

in the end i highly recommend this game because of the story and the creativity that represents valve to its bone."
14023,The greatest game of all time. I played for hours and hours on disc. I am more than happy now that I snagged it on Steam.
14024,lol just shot my neighbours dog for barking really loud
14025,"[h1]Half-Life[/h1]
One of the very first games I've ever bought and one the very first games I've ever completed. Half-Life is a [b]cult classic[/b] that every fan of the FPS genre should play from start to finish.

For the year the game was released, it had everything! An advanced AI, a solid gameplay, a very complex story (too much science for my brain at least lol) and an amazing online multiplayer with various game modes! Hours and hours of fun (and rage too ngl xD) in maps like crossfire and many others!

Made a lot of great memories with this game.

Well, that's all!
Thanks for reading ya'll! :)"
14026,"Possible contender for one of my favourite games of all time! 

You play as a Black Mesa scientist named Gordon Freeman. You are having a normal day until you head into Sector C test labs and cause a resonance cascade by pushing an unstable  sample into the Anti-Mass Spectrometer. By doing this you open up a portal to the alien world known as Xen. This causes the aliens to raid Black Mesa and kill everyone inside.

Your job as Gordon Freeman is to escape the Facility and try to defend yourself from the Military which is sent in by the government to wipe all witnesses; including scientists.

- Great storytelling
- combat hasn't aged too well but still descent
- cool designs for Xen creatures
- very atmospheric, and bad ass, music (composed by Kelly bailey)
- Very nice set pieces
- Graphics haven't aged too well but you can use HD models if you want to

Overall very good game that i highly recommend to fans of both storytelling in video games and first-person shooters alike!"
14027,Love it i can see that hours of effort was putted in it. it is almost 2021 lol

14029,FREEMAN YOU FOOL!
14030,"This is the first FPS that I ever played. 
I was a wee little boy at the tender age of 8, when a friend smuggled in a copy of this game, which he stole from his father. We installed it on my laptop and played for hours. It was scary, fascinating, eyeopening. 
And still to this day, when I return to it, it never disappoints. A true masterpiece."
14031,FPS Classic
14032,Played as somebody with a full life. Very disappointed
14033,nice
14034,"One of my favorite singleplayer shooters ever. It's a fantastic game and only $10, I think you should pick it up if you don't already have it."

The graphics may not be as up to date as most these days, but hell give it a break- the game came out in 1999! Regardless, the story of the black mesa disaster carries the game and makes it enjoyable to no end, and kicks off one of the best series' of all time. -TL;DR- buy this fuckin game"

14064,"This game, other than graphics, still holds up very well to this day. The story and the way it is told is a true testament to the evolution of storytelling in games. The gunplay still feels nice, and I'd say is better than some 3D games of the early 2000's (such as fallout 3, no offence to that game though cause i still enjoy FO3)"
14065,"I cannot begin to describe how good this game is.
First of all its a Valve game which are normally all godly.

14071,It may not be the best looking game but its still very fun 10/10
14072,"This game can be downright scary sometimes, but it's still good. If you don't like the visuals, get Black Mesa, other than that, It should be a fun time."
14073,"An Absolute classic, even better than sequels, plus variety of expansion packs, Mods and fan content adds to fun.

soundtrack 10/10
very friendly for rookies that never tried to play it, but still challenging.
Black Mesa isn't better, you can't top this, even incredible opposing force (gearbox expansion pack for original Half Life) can't be as grundbreaking, it's not my favorite shooter but definitely one of 10."

14079,preeeetty good
14080,"It's really fucking good. Gunplay is fun for a TWENTY THREE FUCKING YEAR OLD game. Story is pretty good. Graphics were good for the time and I guess if you don't mind low poly and very blurry textures, the graphics kind of hold up a little. The ending was good. Too bad I ruined it for myself by using console commands."

14097,"An absolute timeless classic, to my eyes it holds up pretty well for a game from 22 years ago. Movement feels a bit ""slippery"", but you get used to it. The campaign is a blast, mostly an FPS with quite a few parts that involve a bit of puzzle solving and platforming."
14098,one of the best games if not the best i dont even have to tell why everyone knows what half-life is

14104,"[h1]Half-Life[/h1]

Is a classic first person shooter, running on the GoldSrc Engine, developed by Valve Software, published by Sierra entertainment on November 1998.

In Half-Life the player fill in the shoes of Dr. Gordon Freeman, 27 years old theoretical physicist late for his first day of work at Black Mesa Research Facility. He gets in the Hazardous Environment Suit, the experiment goes wrong, Resonance Cascade happens. Soon enough the first day on the job turns into Gordon's fight for his life during a cataclysmic event.

Over the course of the Black Mesa incident Gordon will acquire a large arsenal of military grade armaments, experimental weapons and tools. From the humble Glock and trusty crowbar, to the exotic crossbow and destructive Gluon gun. There're aways a good weapon for your situation you are in. And what are weapons for if not killing things? throughout Black Mesa you will encounter no shortage of hostiles from all sorts of Xen fauna, HECU and black ops, there's good variety of enemies for the time, and they interact and with the player in different ways. However the threat is not only found in enemies, but the hazardous environment of Black Mesa is in itself a danger, sure the HEV suit does a lot of heavy lifting for Gordon, but it won't save you from dissolving in a pool of acid of getting crushed by the collapsing facility debris.

In terms of controls, Gordon is fast, his air control is insane, and the movement is good and responsive, however I've seen complaints about Gordon feeling ''slippery'' this is a Golds thing that comes from its Quake origins, you keep part of your momentum when you stop running, it doesn't bother me at all it is a tiny thing, but I see how it could bother someone else.
When it comes to soundtrack, it is rather shy, but when it kicks in its pretty iconic and fits well with the energy and situation the player is in.

Valve keeps Half-Life up to date, so the game runs flawlessly on a fresh install ''out of the box'' on modern systems and hardware. It doesn't need any mods for it to run properly which is a god send when it comes to older titles such as this one, most publishers just slap a DOSbox on their games and call it a day like Bethesda did with Quake.

Half-Life is one of the first FPS games to make the jump from disconnected abstract maps chained in a episodic format to a fully story driven game. While I appreciate the simplicity and merits of its predecessors like Quake, Half-Life would go on to raise the bar and set a new standard in terms of quality, not only for gameplay but for environmental story telling and writing, both aspects that were yet unseen for the FPS genre of the time.

a instant classic that would change the way FPS games are designed forever. It's influence and success would cement Valve as a gaming landmark and give birth to future iconic games and franchises equally successful such as Counter-Strike, Portal and Team Fortress.

It is for this and many more reasons I consider Half-Life to be a Master Piece.
Run, think, shoot, live.

14105,"It was in general a very good shooter. I think a lot of players misunderstand it, and don't realize that you're supposed to play this more methodically, rather than going in guns blazing. One criticism I have though, is that it's just too long. Well, it's more so that many of the chapters, while fun, drag on longer than they need to. Also the Final 4 chapters of this game... kinda suck, but overall, a good experience that I'd recommend to anyone who's a fan of the series."

Literally everything except On a Rail and Xen levels

14108,Recommended. Old but gold.
14109,its got not-so-good grafix but it fun has an interesting story and you should get it
14110,"Still one of the best FPS Games ever made.
Easy recommendation."
14111,cult classic game and is still fun but if you dont like aged graphics or controls just buy black mesa a modern evolution of the game and is $10 extra but if you dont care that much just buy this instead
14112,Grand.

14114,gorden beats alien with krowpar very epic xDD

14118,"This is literally a masterpiece, despise it's age. If you time on your hands, go get it NOW!"
14119,An essential for PC gamers.
14120,a great game that changed how first person games would be forever..
14121,i think half life 2 is the better game here but 1 succeeds on delivering a more epic and adventurous feel that only few games are capable of. 8/10
14122,"Ok, I understand, it's a classic. The story is good and the graphics are enjoyable. The characters are rememberable and the maps are somewhat original. BUT, the bugs and the controls made me wanna go neck-rope. There are so many times where the ladders bug out or I fall through the map. The combat can be alright at some times but the times it fails strongly outshines the good about it. Buy it if you want but I will not recommend this game to anyone for the gameplay, but I can recoment it for eveything else."
14123,"This game is a must play in my opinion ! My first time playing half life was around 2009 , at my friends house . I loved it so much but I never got to the end of it ."
14124,HALF LIFE!
14125,"It's been 22 years! If you don't know this game by now, where have you been? The game shows its age, but the gameplay is still engaging and the story is still compelling."
14126,good
14127,"This was a long time coming. I never played Half-Life before, so one day I decided to fire it up and play because it has a decent modding community. Instead of replaying the same classic Doom mods over and over again forever. This was a fun 90‚Äôs cinematic first person shooter. It‚Äôs not as ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù as other shooters are today like Call of Duty but it is 90‚Äôs FPS cinematic. Unlike some of my favorite FPS games which have little to no story at all focusing entirely on gameplay.

The games story is primarily focused on a scientist named Gordan Freeman who needs to deal with a group of interdimensional aliens attacking a research facility called Black Mesa after they accidentally open a portal connecting their dimension to earth. From there things take a turn and become more and more complicated.

SLIGHT SPOILERS - [spoiler]At first it's just the scientists, security guards, and fighting off the aliens. Then the military shows up, it turns out that they were there to help cover up the experiments at the Black Mesa research facility. And by cover up I mean destroy any traces of the project by killing the aliens and the facilities guards and staff which includes you. You need to fight them off as much as you need to fight off the aliens. You fight your way through the facility dealing with soldiers and aliens as you go and the whole time there‚Äôs some mysterious man in a suit wandering the facility. You eventually go to the alien home world and kill the alien leader. It ends on a cliffhanger for Half-Life 2 where that mysterious man (whose nickname is The G-Man) hires you for a job by putting Freeman in stasis until the second game.[/spoiler]

Although the story isn‚Äôt why this game is popular. The games community wouldn't become lore nuts until Half-Life 2. Because the story isn‚Äôt all that special. This game was famous at the time because of its focus on realism. Half-Life came out in 1998 before that the most popular FPS game was Doom that was released in 1993. In Doom you go to a few different locations but none of the environments felt like real spaces. They felt like geometry that was hastily slapped together to somewhat imitate a real space. But prioritizing giving the players a fun playground to shoot their way through. In Half-Life the Black Mesa Research Facility feels like a real space. Unlike the starting military base in Doom for instance I can actually picture someone coming to work there. Another example is pickups, in Doom pickup items such as health and guns would float about an inch or two above the ground. In Half-Life ammo and health kits will be sitting on tables and shelves instead to make it more immersive. One more example is the story, like I said Half-Life is a cinematic first person shooter. Having a cohesive story in a FPS was new at the time. With Doom having next to no story at all.

Usually when I hear someone say ‚ÄúYou should play this game from the 90‚Äôs it was revolutionary for its time because of the graphics‚Äù I cringe. Because 90‚Äôs games had this weird thing where they were prioritizing making the whole thing look good over making it play well. As opposed to the original Doom which looks kind of ugly without modding it at least, but still plays very well. (Although that's probably subjective) One example that I like to use to make this point is Shenmue, a game that was famous for its time for looking good that looks terrible by today's standards. The gameplay isn‚Äôt very good either, because it‚Äôs just you doing a series of mundane chores and errands for the townspeople. The only reason why that game still gets so much praise today is because the people who played it years ago on the Dreamcast have nostalgia goggles on. It's the same for a lot of older games too and I appreciate that era of gaming because it helped bring the gaming medium into a league of its own. Computer games started to be something for everyone instead of just being a niche hobby for kids.

But it also means that a lot of older games didn‚Äôt age all that well thanks to improved technology. I think that may be why I never played Half-Life until now because I thought it would probably be a product of its time thanks to its focus on realism and in some ways it is. You can definitely tell that the game was made in the 1990‚Äôs but overall it's still a solid first person shooter. The beginning of the game starts out as a bit of a survival horror game with Gordan Freeman being armed with only a pistol and his famous and trusty crowbar. But eventually you get more weapons such as a shotgun, an assault rifle, and grenades. From there the game focuses on action shooting, platforming, and some light puzzle solving.

The shooting feels half-good. What I mean by that is that the guns you get are pretty decent and feel good to fire. You do get quite a few different weapons by the end of the game, 14 to be exact. But the guns I used the most were the MP5 submachine gun with an under barrel grenade launcher, the assault shotgun, and the colt python .357 magnum. Side note, I didn‚Äôt know you could mount an M203 grenade launcher on an MP5 SMG. The more you know I guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

The other half of the shooting isn‚Äôt that good. Most of the enemies will be using projectile weapons and most of the time if one of them starts shooting at you they WILL hit you unless there‚Äôs some cover between you and them. Basically if you can't see them they can't shoot you and if you can then they can. No amount of tactics or strafing side to side will stop every bullet from hitting you. (Not all the enemies use ‚Äúbullets‚Äù but you get what I‚Äôm saying) Some of the levels drag out for a little too long and the last few levels weren't all that good because of a massive difficulty spike. Also there‚Äôs quite a bit of platforming and I don‚Äôt like platforming in FPS games and I know I‚Äôm not alone in this. The AI was probably good for its time but by today's standards not so much. There‚Äôs some sections where the player needs to escort an NPC somewhere usually to unlock a door and the path finding is terrible. There‚Äôs a reason that what's seen as the gold standard for AI in an FPS game is F.E.A.R not Half-Life.

This was a fun game despite the age and rust. You can even bring the game up to a modern resolution thanks to Valve updates on Steam. Pro tip! When you first boot up the game go into the options menu and go to video. Then select ""Widescreen"" and ""1080 x 720"" Then go to mouse and disable auto-aim. The audio balancing could use some tweaking too. Go into the audio tab, turn MP3s up to maximum, and turn Sound Effects down a tic. It can be hard to hear characters talk thanks to the old and scratchy audio. Which is a problem in a story driven game with so subtitles.

Half-Life mixed up its enemy variety, weapon variety, and location variety in a way that gives it some really good pacing. Enough to keep me playing from start to finish and I enjoyed it enough that I can see myself playing it again in the future. Even though I still didn‚Äôt like it as much as classic Doom. I can‚Äôt wait to dive into the modding community for this game but first I have some expansion packs to play first, GG."

14133,its ok

One of the best games of all time and worth replaying at it's cheap price. My super underpowered work laptop plays this amazingly and it's a fun time kill reliving my childhood. I love it."
14135,masterpiece amazing god like story old but amazing
14136,lik
14137,I like this game and to those who want to play it let me warn you. This isn't your regular FPS you can't just run in and kill everything. You must Run for cover. Think of all options you have and what the enemy is doing. Maybe deploy traps for an ambush or use snarks to uncover some covered enemies. You must Shoot what you have and ignore what's not neccisary to kill. And you must live at all times. Never repeat something twice and listen to npcs at all times. You are playing like a scientist think like one! Over all it is a very good game.

14155,"Half Life is a game which has been out for more than 20 years now, being released in 1998, this game is still very relevant and interesting. The plot is huge, and I mean HUGE, once again considering the fact that this game was released 20 years ago 10-14 hours of gameplay was a big achievement. Even now most of the games can't be that long, and manage to continue to be interesting.
Also, I would like to be honest with you. I have never completed Half Life until today. And today I've played continuously for 10 hours in one seat. It's truly amazing that such an old game can capture your attention that badly."
14156,"This game is 22 years old... the one who changed what FPS are meant to be. I have played and finished the game many times, but still gives me sweaty hands and jitters everytime I play.

14163,"As someone who has never played any of the Half-Life titles, the very positive rating on Steam and the praise for the series online gave me very high expectations for this game, and I'm afraid I was a bit disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, there was lots I did like about the game. I found the story and universe to be excellent, and the mechanics were quite fun, for the most part. It was very exciting to find and use new weapons, especially as they moved farther and farther away from traditional weaponry. The game also had a lot of good level design, and there were lots of areas with multiple paths and lots of secrets, which was pretty cool.

There were a number of issues that prevent me from recommending this title though:
[list]
	[*]The visuals in this game are extremely dated. Textures are low quality, models are very blocky and have low detail, and the UI is small and hard to see. This alone didn't ruin the experience for me as I knew this would be the case going in, but they still leave a lot to be desired.
	[*]The momentum in this game was very frustrating and took almost the entirety of the game to get used to. You accelerate very quickly, and all of the movement feels as though it's on ice, as you continue to slide after releasing the keys. Given that there is a fair amount of platforming required in this game, this was pretty infuriating, and I often found myself sliding all over the place.
	[*]The game is pretty punishing. It's very easy to take damage very quickly, and it often seems a bit too unforgiving. The explosion radius is often much larger than it looks, and explosions do a lot of damage. Additionally, falls that seem harmless do a surprising amount of damage, and it is very easy to get killed by fall damage (which makes the previous point about the momentum worse as well). There were also a number of areas which contained hidden enemies or dangers that were very difficult to avoid, which made it feel like mandatory damage.
	[*]Most of the levels were very well designed and I had no issues, but I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the game. I found it too difficult to determine what I should be doing or where I should be going. Based on what I've seen elsewhere though, the final chapters are generally considered to be the worst part of the game.
[/list]

I must give this game the credit it is due. When it came out, it was very revolutionary, and it had a huge influence on many of the games we play today. However, it hasn't aged well, and the outdated visuals, the frustrating momentum, and very unforgiving nature of the game make it difficult for me to recommend. If you're picking it up for nostalgia or you'd like to play a piece of gaming history, then I'd say go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend this title otherwise."
14164,"I didn't start playing half-life 1 because of nostalgia because i never tried this as a child but i wanted to check it out, and its worth playing, much better then i expected."

14179,"Half-Life is one of the most influential games to have ever come out and has shaped the way games are designed even to this day. Half-Life does a wonderful job of immersing the player inside of the game's universe, it doesn't bombard you with exposition and it doesn't hold your hand throughout your journey. All of the information is given to you organically through different characters talking directly to you or talking among their piers. The world building also helps make the world feel most expansive by giving the player multiple glimpses into the world beyond what the player can physically see in the game. A massive strength this game has is it's ability to tell the player what to do without literally having to tell them what to do. There is never a time where the player should feel confused on how to progress, because each puzzle or conflict is expertly crafted so that the player can figure out  what they are suppose to do by themselves based on clues in the environment. Also Gordon Freeman is hot. But the icing on the cake for me was that Half-Life has a 

Pretty decent correlation to Minecraft; the best game ever made.

-- THIS GAME HAVE GUN!!! guns are totally #evil 
-- You are unable to place blocks in this game so can not make house

- Can break windows but not break blocks like in minecraft
- No crafting system
- smells

+ Zombies just like in minecraft
+ game looks like crap because old but minecraft looks like old game pixilated so it looks like minecraft
+ get to kill people (just like how you can kill villagers)
+ hot main character, steve is hot, freeman is hot. say no more
+ game is old as flip older than my mom even (not reallly) so this game cant be a minecraft ripoff
+ Title Half-Life has an ""A"" in the title. Minecraft also has an ""A"" in the title

14187,"This game is a fun to play but won't be for everyone. 

The campaign is a decent size and can be finished under 4 hours but as you can see by my hours that certainly didn't happen. This game is the definition of unforgiving. I finished the game with probably 100 saves on medium difficulty which I don't recommend for the casual player. 

This game uses the Valve engine and has the same issues as the Valve engine. For one it causes motion sickness. Unfortunately I'm the unlucky few that is affected by this but with a couple of settings changed I barely noticed or had symptoms. Minimize window (biggest effect), Change fov to around 110, Turn of Bobbing!, and Unlock frame-rate which is locked at 100. You can find how to do this online.

As for the story. I think most of us are familiar with the Mc Gordan Freeman. He's a scientist that had to toughen up to save his ass. I have to reiterate that this game is hard. They're are so many annoying easy to die to enemies like Doom. But unlike Doom the game can be very strategic. 

This is a great copp if it's on sale and would be fun and hard if you download a graphics mod. Funfact the moto of the game is ""RUN, THINK, SHOOT, LIVE"" but it should be Run, think, shoot, die."
14188,the game is amazing that i dont want to stop playing. the graphics are beautiful. the campaign is very fun. i think the money was very worth it trust me.
14189,fun

14194,*Do you know who ate all the donuts?*
14195,one of the best games there is.  legendary game - for good reason.  gimped badly in some areas especially the spider/crab thing.
14196,"Story: Nothing, like any other when it comes to visual storytelling. This first person shooter establishes a story of an unremarkable individual, Gordon Freeman. Gordon, the scientist and research associate finds himself working in a government funded facility. Black Mesa, associated with their questionable ethics. Gordon is ordered to volunteer on a groundbreaking scientific research mission. Unfortunately, the scientists are filled with pride, and they are too stubborn to take consideration of a possible catastrophic event. Despite their efforts of tuning their scientific equipment to safety, unforeseeable consequences came. This caused extra-dimensional aliens to manifest around the Black-Mesa facility, caused by the infamous anti-mass spectrometer. Gordon lost the people he knew, his associates, co-workers, friends and family. In spite of all of this, Gordon is confident enough to maneuver through the ruins of the infamous facility, with the aid of the cutting edge HEV suit, and his impeccable intellect.

Graphics: The visuals may appear archaic, but does not get in the way of the game-play. Graphic wise, It is comparable to Quake (1996) because it is technically a modification of it. The lighting, shading, textures have aged well, but not in quality. The three dimensional assets on the other hand, have not aged very well. The characters are walking sock puppets asking you to leave them alone repeatedly.

Music: Kelly Bailey, game's composer established an interesting soundtrack. I have my criticisms about it. Kelly seemingly taken many samples from many libraries, and remixed them to his own liking. The mixture of symphonic orchestra and electronic blends seamlessly with the theme, reflecting the industrial nature of Black-Mesa and Freeman's will to survive.

Game play: The game lends you good controls on your character, such as mouse, strafing, crouching and most importantly, jumping. The weapons feel just right and satisfying compared to ""boomer shooters"". It is unfortunate the mouse is not set up adequately, either the sensitivity if too high or too low. Sometimes, your mouse registers ""janky"" inputs. The level design is intelligently thought out, as Black-Mesa is put together in a realistic portrayal compared to Quake's abstract and psychedelic environment.

That is all I got to say for today, go away now."
14197,its cool
14198,"Revolutionary FPS mixing gameplay, maps and storytelling perfectly. There are a ton of weapons to choose from and they are different from each other so you will be using them all. It may be a bit hard but the experience is worth the effort. Buy this one, not the SOURCE engine version.

14200,"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat. Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90¬∞ or slightly greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs‚Äîor other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn‚Äîstrong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades). The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90¬∞ or lesser angle.[1][2] Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics.

Chairs vary in design. An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat;[3] a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest;[4] a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.[5]"

Introduction:

Half Life is close to the level of Doom when it comes to importance. At the time Half Life was cutting edge and introduced the new concept of level design that makes sense. Gone were the days of Romero's (admittedly fantastic) ""abstract . . . design"". Half Life was story driven, to be story driven and taken seriously, the setting had to seem real. It brought together it's spatial sense with aggressive action and interesting enemy designs. It had a simple story, but one that works well over the length of the game. Let's get into it, shall we?

1. Black Mesa

The setting; an X - Files - esque secret laboratory, both a government sponsored place of science, and a military bunker working with the unknown. It's a simple plot, but never had a plot of this magnitude been told in a video game. Before this, the only memorable shooter characters were Duke Nukem and Caleb from Blood. Throughout the game, you explore this facility, which is arguably a character itself. Journeying through Black Mesa reveals the questionable ethics of what had been going on there. It also features plenty of memorable scripted sequences and unique looking levels. All of this is shown to you in an unbroken first person perspective with no loading screens or breaks. 

2. Gameplay

Half Life has aged decently well in this case, the gameplay hasn't really fundamentally changed from Quake or Quake II, but the solid base is still there, this time with much more interesting weapons (not to devalue the Quake games, they have fantastic weapons in their own right) and the scripted sequences that really make the game immersive. These aspects really suck you in, so let's go over the weapons.

The crowbar, everyone know this one. The crowbar is your melee last resort and tool for breaking crates and vents.

The handgun, a pistol modeled after the Glock 17 of our own world. This is your bread and butter pistol, using the same ammo as the MP5 that comes later and stays a reliable long range weapon, It also stays useful for dealing with pesky headcrabs.

The Shotgun, and absolute classic. Definitely not realistic, as the alt fire (mouse 2 by default, every weapon has one) fires two shells at once, despite it having only one barrel. Great workhorse weapon for the Alien Slaves and a certain enemy I don't want to spoil.

The SMG, an MP5 that will probably be you main weapon. It's a little weird that it has a grenade launcher, but it's still a great weapon.

I'm going to stop here and I won't cover the enemies for the same reason: there's a lot of them and I don't want to spoil them as they're a lot of fun. Expect plenty of explosives and maybe even some ""science"" weapons.

3. Conclusion

Half Life is a great game, not perfect, but there is little for me to say that others haven't covered to death. Buy it an make sure to go into the options and turn off the HD model pack as they change the art style too much (use after your first playthrough, then see if you like them).

So finally, I do recommend Half Life, it really is special."
14247,"This game is great. If you don't have Half-Life yet, what are you waiting for? Such a classic and stands the test of time. Phenomenal."
14248,Shit game but its iconic
14249,"It's a pretty slick game. I personally felt stupid playing it, but that's because you need to think about everything before going into a situation. There are cool puzzles that require absolutely god tier intellect that only avid 
Rick and Morty fans will have, So to wrap things up, I think that you haven't lived until you Half Lifed."
14250,"The beginning of this game kinda freaking sucks. What? Some shit explodes? Aliens? COME ON REALLY? I DON'T GIVE A DAMN! Scientists? Military? Secret base? New Mexico? Maybe if it was the coast guard or the navy instead if the marines! Guns? Zombies? Assassins? Experiments? I DON'T CARE! HOWEVER, there is ONE redeeming factor in this WHOLE GOD AWFUL GAME THAT has LED me TO give IT a POSITIVE review. the part with the Ichthyosaur in the shark cage redeems this fucking shit game. positive."

Half-Life is a very well-known game franchise and it is most well known for having a story play around you as you progress through the game. This is pretty commonplace nowadays however and some people say the story of Half-Life is dull but I don't think so, even after over 20 years the story of Black Mesa and Gordon Freeman are still very immersive and is very enjoyable to play through. I recommend this game if you enjoy any Valve title because this is where their roots came from. And in Valve's own words and I quote, the graphics are:

14336,10/10 game
14337,"If you haven't played the Half-Life serious you're missing out. With inventive combat, levels and story. This entire series is gold. What more needs to be said?"
14338,"So here we are, where it all started for Valve, the original Half-Life, is it as amazing as everyone claims? Let‚Äôs find out.

Pros:

1. Good Graphics for a 1998 release, the visual style is very nice and charming to look at even today, character models also look good for the time as do weapons, and visual effects.

2. A very well built atmosphere with the survival horror aspect and each environment really adds to the atmosphere as a whole. You‚Äôll explore many labs, production factories, and even go outside the complex, and with the well built atmosphere in each area, you really feel like you‚Äôre there.

3. The Story at first is intriguing as you are left wondering what is happening and want to know more and this only continues as it builds up towards the end.

4. This game does something rather revolutionary for the FPS genre with the way it tells its story as during ""cutscenes"" if you will, you have the ability to move freely in the world while everything happens, meaning that gameplay isn't broken up during story moments, while this was technically already seen before in GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64, Half-Life does it better as you're given more freedom in the environment then GoldenEye and Half-Life is fully voiced acted as opposed to being subtitles only as seen in GE. Really nice innovation that Half-Life brought to the table here.


5. The gameplay has a good balance between your typical action that you‚Äôd expect and solving puzzles to proceed. Puzzles are well varied and take some thinking to solve, it‚Äôs a nice break from the action.

6. The weapons in this game are really awesome, from the 9MM Glock to the SMG, to the Shotgun, Magnum and the Crossbow and explosives. You have a pretty healthy arsenal of weapons here and each weapon feels unique and like they serve their own purposes with strengths and weaknesses. The sounds they make feel great and they're fun to use. My favorites have to be the Shotgun, SMG and Magnum, those 3 seriously pack a punch. Not once in this game do you feel like your weapon selection is lacking.

7. The enemy types you encounter are vast and quite varied. You‚Äôll fight Headcrabs, Zombies, Marines, Assassins, Bullsquids, Barnacles and more. Each enemy feels distinct in how they combat you and one must plan out different ways to deal with each one effectively, having multiple enemy types is always a good thing, especially when they‚Äôre done well like they are here.

8. The G-Man, I don't think anything else needs to be said about why this is a pro

9. Despite each character really only having 2 or 3 voice actors, the voices are charming if a bit cheesy at times.

10. The difficulties are very well balanced. The higher you go the more damage you take obviously and enemies take a bit more, and health pickups give you less health overall, but you never feel like it‚Äôs unfair. Half-Life on hard is a well designed challenge which is great as some shooters like to artificially increase difficulty.

11. While there isn‚Äôt much of it, the music in this game when it is present is quite good. It ranges from atmospheric ambience to heavy hard hitting rock that pumps you up for a big fight.

12. very good as the game is more focused on survival horror as you make your way through the Black Mesa Laboratory while aliens and various other creepy creatures invade the place, armed with only a limited amount of supplies and a crowbar, you have to really preserve your ammo to survive. I love the first hour or 2 of this game and I wish the rest of the game retained that horror feel.


Cons:


1. A few of the chapters in the game suffer from feeling either rushed or just being too long. The biggest offender and probably best example of this goes to On A Rail, it speaks volumes that nobody really likes this chapter as it's incredibly tedious and drags on. The chapter mainly boils down to using a monorail, having to stop a few moments later to either remove an obstacle or take out enemies and then repeating the process around 4 times or so, it gets old quick.


3. Some enemies in the game can feel a bit too bullet spongey which at times can make the game feel a bit unfair. The biggest offender of this is probably the Ichthyosaur as they take so much damage to kill and since they‚Äôre only really found underwater, this means the only 2 weapons that are really viable against them are the 9MM and the Crossbow as those are the only 2 that enable you to shoot underwater. Most enemies, even some that take more abuse than others, often only take more because they tend to actively avoid your gunfire such as the Marines, focused fire on them is enough to deal with them. But the Ichthyosaur doesn‚Äôt do this,


4. On the topic of enemies, one issue with this game is the hitscan problem. For those unaware: hitscan is a feature in games that essentially means if enemies have a line of sight on you, they will hit you, meaning they aren‚Äôt projectile based. Now of course this is common place in many shooters, especially back in those days, but in Half-Life at times it feels like you‚Äôre getting sniped and because of the hitscan, enemies can feel tougher than they should and often you can be punished for someone you cannot see. Just minor things like that can be a tad frustrating,
                                                                
4. Some sections in the game are a bit poorly designed to put it blunt, obviously this is more forgivable as it was Valve‚Äôs first game but it‚Äôs worth bringing up as a flaw. Some examples of this include sections where it is impossible to avoid taking damage although this is sorta mitigated by you getting health pickups but it doesn‚Äôt excuse it. Others can be enemies that can easily ambush you and you not being able to do anything about it without knowing beforehand that it‚Äôs going to occur, just things like that.

5. Xen, this whole chapter deserves it's own con because man it's just terrible and even Valve themselves admit to it's shortcomings. The novelty of being in the alien world wears off quite fast and the levels and tasks you have to do are just really boring and feel cobbled together. Top that off with a pretty annoying and tedious Final Boss and it's easy to see why even the most hardcore of fans stop playing when they reach Xen

6. The Decision to make Gordon Freeman be a silent protagonist while acceptable back in 1998, is honestly just plain bad by today's standards. Having him not talk is supposed to make you feel immersed into the levels and atmosphere but if anything I find it takes me out of the experience because you have all these characters talking to you like you're best buds are like you've been there for a while yet Gordon doesn't utter a single word in response, and due to cutscenes always being in first person, you don't even get to see him express emotion.




So with that said that‚Äôs mainly all I have to say about Half-Life. What do I think overall? I think the game is honestly a pretty great time, it has a lot of good things about it, although some things do miss the mark a fair bit, making the game a bit flawed in the grand scheme of things. I think while the game is great, I feel it is a bit overrated as I feel a section of it‚Äôs fans are blinded by all the positives and only sing the praises while ignoring the pretty obvious flaws on display. But hey it‚Äôs still a solid time and I‚Äôll be honest: on my first playthrough I didn‚Äôt enjoy it much but on a 2nd playthrough you do get to appreciate it a lot more. 


So I‚Äôd recommend this game if you are interested, it‚Äôs only 10 dollars normally and goes on sale often for far less than that so really what‚Äôs stopping you from trying it? The only thing I‚Äôll say is don‚Äôt go in expecting this masterpiece and listen to the hype as you may be disappointed like I originally was, but if you go in expecting a fun classic shooter, that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôll get. 

If I had to give Half-Life 1 a rating, I would give it a solid 8/10."
14339,very great game. Still holds up even today

14342,"There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't been said already. Half-Life is a classic that holds up remarkably well even today. It does start to wear out its welcome after you get to Xen, but the game overall is a good time and you can buy it for almost nothing on sale, so it's worth checking out if you want to experience a game that was very influential for its time. This was fun to revisit and I look forward to seeing how Black Mesa adapts HL1 for modern audiences."

14405,"Don't buy this game for singleplayer story mode. Old nostalgic contents, animations and vanilla menu doesn't exist which makes the game lose it all flavor. I recommend vanilla day one version v1.0 published by Sierra in 1998. You can get it from archive org, add me if you have any troubles on installing."
14406,"Half-Life is one of the best games of all time. Even though it came out before I was born and the graphics are dated, this is still my favorite singleplayer game. Half-Life treads the line between Quake-style boomer shooters and Halo-style modern shooters. It retains some things from the former, such as running fast and having many weapons, while requiring tactics like Halo to succeed (at least when played on hard mode). One thing important to remember about Half-Life is that it expects you to play smart and observe your surroundings. In an earlier part of the game, you find a flooded room with a broken ceiling light. There is a vent that you need to crawl through to continue, however, the wires from the ceiling light are touching the water, causing you to take damage when you touch it. If you're playing smart, you might ask, ""how could I turn the light off?"" instead of just tanking the damage. The one downfall of Half-Life (ignoring Xen) is its graphics, as they encourage the player to lobotomize themselves and just shoot, like other older shooters."

Cock and Ball Torture, also known as CBT, is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. Since 2010, the audio narration of the Wikipedia article on the subject has been used as a pranking device. In January 2019, posts using the phrase ""cock and ball torture"" as a punchline saw a surge in popularity on iFunny, Instagram and Reddit.

Since the upload, the narration has been used as a pranking device. For example, on February 22nd, 2015, Coub user idiot joke teen uploaded a video of several teenagers listening to the recording in an elevator. Starting 2015, the Wikipedia article on the subject was circulated as a copypasta on Reddit, while also appearing on other platforms.

On July 26th, 2016, Twitter account @cockandballbot was launched, posting quotes from the Wikipedia entry on the cock and ball torture every day. Since its launch, the bot has posted over 32,700 tweets containing quotes from the article.

On January 24th, 2017, YouTube user Tanyathsus posted the audio narration from Wikipedia to the website, where it gained over 18,000 views in two years. One upvoted comment under the video claimed that ""kids used to play [the audio] on random computers in middle school"".

Between May 7th and June 2nd, 2017, an unknown Instagram user re-edited the seth.v.2's post, replacing the last panel with an image of Minecraft Steve stabbing the Minecraft character Herobrine against the backdrop of the Wikipedia entry for cock and ball torture. On June 2nd, 2017, Redditor PKNessStorm uploaded the edited meme to /r/4PanelCringe subreddit where it gained over 900 upvotes in six months.

On March 16th, 2018, an unlogged Imgur user uploaded an edited version of the cover for Crash Team Racing video game with words ""CTR: Crash Team Racing"" replaced with ""CBT: Cock and Ball Torture"". On June 5th, 2018, Redditor The_Great_Curve posted a photoshopped image of Peter Griffin arranging a CBT session to /r/okbuddyretard subreddit. The post gained over 220 upvotes in six months.

The first first-person shooter game that really awake the whole world during 1990 generation. As a kid who played this game before, it's a serious fps game with you explore more levels and puzzle solving throughout the game. 

I don't have a lot of comment of this game because it's Valve first game that time and it was a successful sales throughout the whole world. 

If you never play the game before, why don't give a try? I know the game is old but worth to shot to play it if you are a fan of Valve and Half-life game.

The game can basically run in any pc with no lag as long your pc got ram lol.

Well it's fun but don't age well with new generation and trends. As a fan since I was a kid, it's an honor to play this game.

14464,The best game 2
14465,"Without a doubt a classic. 

Half-Life managed to tell a story without forcing it upon you. The story unfolds before your eyes without the need of a single cutscene. If you're just here for the gameplay, you can simply ignore the story, although I regard the entire storyline of Half-Life as one of the best, but sadly yet unconcluded pieces of writing that I have experienced.

The gameplay aged very well, as most of Valve's games did as well. 

I don't know what to say. It's a classic and every gamer should have played every Half-Life to know what the difference between a REALLY GOOD game and a throwaway AAA game that just lives for a year is. This franchise will just never die."
14466,Best game i have ever played!
14467,THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE... btw it's a great game for the people who search classics.

14490,"I thought it was a decent game at first, then I started to get annoyed by so many pet peaves and poorly designed parts of the game really took the fun out of it. One specific thing was the distribution of ammo+health which kept me at around 10 health for literally every portion. Overall, I'm disappointed for such a highly rated game that even the guns and hitboxes kinda suck."
14491,"Half-Life is a masterpiece by Valve.
I love it so much, and  it's older than me, dating back to 1998.
Half life makes such a good tone with it's coloring and  animating.
I think the game-play mechanics also work well with the theme, giving you the old Quake vibe.
It has many other fans games, mods, expansions, DLCS,  and some sequels."

You've got to hand it to these guys. Valve Software is a start-up, a relative unknown, with no track and, really, no business making such a mighty game. But mighty it is, the best single player shooter I've ever played.
It will be hard for some--mainly those who haven't played the game--to put their finger on exactly what everyone is raving about. There's nothing exceptional about the engine--it's a heavily modified version of Id Software's Quake. Its genre, the first-person shooter, has nearly been beaten to death. Its design couldn't be simpler: get some guns, run, shoot, jump; no laborious cutscenes or misplaced RPG elements here.

How many times have you shot at a monster only to have it either grimace at you blankly, perhaps firing off a few tepid shots, or slouch and drool while you pick off his comrades? Well, not here. The teams of soldiers you'll fight in Half-Life have to be the toughest, most convincing enemies yet seen in an action game. Where other opponents grunt incomprehensibly, these guys actually yell stuff relevant to the combat, such as ""Fire in the Hole!"" or ""Look out!"" as the grenades go flying. Then they actually try to get away from your grenades. And what's more, they also throw grenades at you.

Grenades might sound like a simple little thing to add to a game, and perhaps it is, but it adds such an extra dimension to the monsters' combat ability that it's almost like playing a whole new genre. Strafe, fire, strafe, fire just simply doesn't work every time. But in every other game, monsters either attack hand to hand, with area affects, or most commonly, with linear shots. It doesn't matter if they're shooting lasers, M-16s, or dollops of hot blue manna, it all comes in a straight line, and it all can be dodged. But change the angle of attack, and it's a whole new game. One little detail--one huge difference.

But that's just part of the appeal of Half-Life's enemies; unlike other games, they also cooperate. Teamwork, for monsters in other games, is if they all happen to be in the same room shooting in the same direction. Here, the infantry squads will split up, trying to hit you from several sides while one guy keeps you pinned or lobs grenades. It's surprising how entertaining well-implemented artificial intelligence can be, and it's probably worth it to play Half-Life just to fight its infantry. There could be a whole game based on nothing but fighting Half-Life's infantry.

Wait, there's more. How many times have you cleaned out one filthy, gory techno-dungeon, only to find yourself at a door that obviously leads to yet another, even filthier, techno-dungeon? How realistic is it to have obvious entrances and exits to levels--and what is a ""level"" anyway? An archaic holdover from Dungeons & Dragons? A convenient way of breaking up the game world so it can be loaded into memory?

Half-Life does away with the arbitrary concept of levels. Instead the world feels like a continuous whole, with small pauses and loads when you move from one area to another. This does create some problems when monsters are placed too close to the transition between mini-levels and you inadvertently strafe from one area to the other, accidentally triggering a load screen. But this problem aside, Half-Life's mini-levels create a more flowing and realistic game world, and so a more immersive one.

And freed from the stereotypical notion of levels, the designers were free to experiment with a wide variety of environments, logically linked and fun to explore. Every room isn't another corridor or another slime-filled dungeon. There are labs and warehouses, monorail stations and gun bunkers, missile silos and parking garages. The bulk of the action takes place in a deep underground military base called the Black Mesa Facility, but it is not confined there. You'll scale a canyon cliff and scamper through a military base. You'll ride weird monorails and climb through pipes full of waste. Virtually every location in Half-Life is interesting and unique.

This variety makes you want to keep playing Half-Life all the way through. How many times have you gotten half way through another game, only to say to yourself, ""Eh, I've probably seen it all. If I keep playing, there will only be more monsters, with more guns, more hit points and more grubby levels."" This is decidedly not the case with Half-Life.

Carefully crafted for the single player experience, every encounter in Half-Life is a new challenge, nearly every room throws out something you haven't seen before, every sound is a worrying cue that something horrible is about to happen. The sheer number of hand-scripted events and little scenes keeps the action moving, giving you a reason to keep playing, if only to see what could possibly happen next. I haven't had so much fun playing a game in years. I have not been frightened by a game in years. I have not dreaded corners like I have dreaded corners in this game in years. Half-Life is a superbly ambient game.

Is the game perfect? Of course not. Some of the elevators have a horrible sticking problem, and the ladders can be awkward to use. Occasionally the game chokes when a huge explosion happens. But these are minor problems.

Slightly more serious is the character of Gordon Freeman, who is rather flat and dry. I realize that the mood and feel Half-Life is very somber, very much in the mold of The X-Files, and a wisecracking Duke Nukem type wouldn't have worked. As a scientist and a specialist trained to deal with hazardous materials, Freeman is the right kind of character to serve as the story's alter ego, but his near total lack of personality--as far as I can recall, he never says anything in the game--leaves a little to be desired. Still, you could make a case that giving him a personality could actually detract from your ability to identify with the character. And certainly, the use of cut scenes or any of the other crude crutches of computer game storytelling would have detracted from the relentless pace of the game and the freedom and control you have over your character.

Internet play is more troubling. There's a built-in server list that works kind of like Gamespy, letting you find free servers quickly, which is a classy touch, but the matches themselves feel laggier than Quake. More to the point, it's obvious that Valve spent all its time and energy perfecting the single player experience, and so as far as deathmatches go, Half-Life's is just that, a standard deathmatch. But who cares? You shouldn't be buying this game to play deathmatch.

Really, my biggest problem with Half-Life was some of the level design, particularly in the middle stages of the game. Here the tension seriously sags, as you are forced to wander around some dreadful tunnels looking for switches in retro-gaming land, as jumping puzzles, switch hunts, and all the tedium of a dozen other games returns in force.

Pacing is important in an action game, since you want to break up the intense, heart-pounding shootouts with some stretches of creeping caution, even moments of relaxed calm. But in my view at least, too many of the middle levels rely on jumping puzzles, instant death traps, and almost sheer rote exploration via the save/load buttons.

However, once you get past the sewers, a seemingly interminable rail train puzzle, and the dreaded, obligatory underwater maze--once you fight your way back out into the open area where you have to mix it up with the camo guys again, the game perks up considerably, and some of the final levels in the military base are truly some of the greatest single player levels ever made.

If you look at my profile, you'll see that I have 32 hrs on the game. That's 18 hrs of agony. Shoot, die, respawn, shoot, die, respawn. I only made it half way. The other 14 hrs is a restarted walkthrough filled with pure fun and thinking. Run, think, shoot, live. Emphasis on think. Just buy it dude."

14531,"
The first part of the legendary ""half life"" series is more than a regular game. As well as ""CS 1.6"" I got acquainted with this game from an early age and with pleasure spent hundreds of hours flying. Over the past 20 years, a lot of good games with their own unique mechanics and gameplay have come out, but none of them have been able to surpass in ""CS 1.6"" and ""Half life"". The good news is that both of these games are still full of players and even at night you can find a server and hack to death like the good old ones."

14561,Just buy it and play. That's what I can say about this game. It is perfect.
14562,fuck the 90s
14563,Definitely a great introduction into the Half Life series. This one definitely was a breakthrough in gaming for the 90s and Half Life 2 topped it off even more with its amazing graphics. Although the sequel feels more smooth and fluid than this game it is a definitely a game worth the try but you can skip over this one and jump into the second Half Life if you please.
14564,All time favourite
14565,"I went into this game blind and it is a lot of fun, there were a couple parts where i was lost/ couldnt figure out what to do, but a quick google search helped. I would definitley reccomend this game if you like singleplayer games, 9/10"
14566,The original Half Life. Well it's hard to comment on this one. Certainly harder than most of the other games i play. 9/10 Would recommend
14567,pretty epic i would say
14568,One of the best games to play
14569,"This game is amazing for a lack of better words, things maybe get confusing at times but I can always find myself coming back to it."

14587,"Very long game, and the graphics have aged like swiss cheese. That being said, the combat is fun and the story is good, too. Have heard good things about Black Mesa (a remake of this)."
14588,"Awesome game.

Had to watch a gameplay every 10 minutes to beat."
14589,Can't believe Valve ripped off Black Mesa and made a worse-looking game. Still pretty good tho.
14590,It's Half-Life.
14591,A fantastic Classic. A game changer for its time and still worth a run through.
14592,Is good.
14593,this game gave me aids

14596,rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
14597,it was awesome
14598,"It's just a timeless classic. If you can overlook the graphics - you have easy to get used to physics, intriguing world-building, mysteries scattered throughout and lots of action-packed shooting. Replayability is fine I guess, but for that matter I would recommend the sequel. Otherwise - dive in, complete a run, and have fun along the way! It has little to no bugs, system requirements are the same like other 20+ year old games - you get the picture. On frequently big sales and in very money-efficient packs (like the Valve Complete Pack on sales). Highly recommended for FPS and single-player story-rich fans, a must-have for fans of the series ( Half-Life, CS, etc.). 

Score - 10/10"
14599,"Oh, hello Go-AHHH, HELP ME GORDON!"
14600,yes
14601,"I played this game about a decade ago and remembered very little of the game apart from the fact that I enjoyed it. I played the original version again (prior to trying the Black Mesa) and everything I forgot about the game made playing it again an exciting experience. This game is still very immersive, has plenty of jump scares and great story-telling, and is one of the best games I have ever played, even with its dated graphics. I still highly recommend this game."

EDIT: After playing this for the second time, I see now that this game is a masterpiece. It is a little dated, sure, but once you get used to how the game works it is an absolutely lovely experience."
14610,"Extremely good, especially for a game that came out in 1998. Do not let the artstyle fool you: you are no one man army in this game. Be smart. Think before shooting. 

Basically created the idea of storytelling in first person shooters, and the story is incredible even by modern standards. Plenty of replayability, so its well worth the money."

14639,"Half Life is a very interesting game. The story is slowly revealed to you, and Valve has made some very creative encounters.
However, do note that you will most likely need a walkthrough for a couple of levels, due to there being little to no clues as to what you need to do. 
I got 12 hours for 7 quid out of this game playing on godmode/
Worth it."

14641,"It 2020 year and this game it still good. Very interesting and good story.
Freeman you fool (it a joke).
Good job Valve for making this game."
14642,"I recommend this game for the simple reason that it is a classic. Apparently when it came out, it was the sh*t back then, revolutionary in a way. I played it for the sake of playing it, to be able to say ""Yeah I played the original Half-Life"" but that is all. I had to force myself through the game at times. It is a somewhat buggy game still, where you can randomly get stuck in the wall for example, or the in-game events aren't triggered for some reason which leads you to reload your last save. A 6.5/10 for me at the highest."
14643,"Good, is also classic"
14644,The game is pretty good [/spoiler]but the final encounter is complete hell [/spoiler]

14647,Half-Life is a game that everyone has already heard of so i dont think i need to explain why this is amazing
14648,CAN PLAY OVER N OVER AGAƒ∞M
14649,"I think this game is decent, there is a lot about it I dislike though. Keep in mind that I played on, I think it's called Medium or Normal mode. A big problem with this game is your limited resources, yes I know there is a lot of guns in this game which you obtain in like the middle of the game. I just feel that I try to reserve the greater weapons like the Rocket Launcher or the other powerful weapons. I mainly use the shotgun, the pistol, the revolver and the Assault Rifle. Which I feel like I am always running out of ammo and never seem to find them. I also have a big complaint over the amount of Alien Controllers toward the end of the game. Like I said ammo Is a big problem and this is how it affected the gameplay in this situation. I had a decent amount of ammo in the shotgun toward the end of the game and not a lot of ammo in the long range weapons, here's the problem. The Alien Controller likes to attack from far away, which the using the shotgun doesn't help very much with enemies that attack from long range. I also have an issue with the Alien Controller spawning because when I defeat an Alien Controller magically a few more spawn which I feel like is useless to keep trying to kill them but they get really annoying and do a decent amount of damage, Their spawning usually catches me off guard and I get shot and with limited supplies such as health and ammo, I just keep dying and dying and dying. This gets really repetitive and annoying. This is where I gained less interest in this game and I was already too far into the game to give up so I just was mainly focused on beating the game even though I wasn't having fun. I do think this game is difficult which I love difficult games, but this is different. The enemies aren't that hard to beat it's just the resource management. There is some great things about the game I really like, I really like the story line in this game and I love the, I guess you can call cut scenes although they happen when you are playing the game, such as scientists being killed by something random, which is out of your control. I like how the game does have places where you can take a break and relax after fighting a bunch of enemies, these are the places where you actually get to heal up and get ammo. I really like the unique weapons and enemies which usually will not pop up in other games. The soundtrack and iconic sounds in this game is amazing. I still do recommend this game, for this game to be released in 1998 is impressive, It definitely can live up to today's standards. Thanks for reading."

14660,"A true classic.  While some parts of the game haven't aged incredibly well (mostly the final boss battle, and the jump pads), almost all of it has.  If you haven't played this game, I'd say play this version first NOT the Source port or Black Mesa.  The game is definitely worth playing through a few times, so might as well try out the original first.  You gotta know your roots, and like a carrot, this root in gaming is damn tasty :p"

14662,"Valve's first game, which became one of the best FPS ever created. Half-life is over 20 years old, but it is still an excellent game, being better than several more recent games. In the game we control Gordon Freeman, a scientist (who knows how to use weapons), that upon arriving at his workplace, Black Mesa Research Facility, witness an opening of a portal that releases dangerous creatures that will put everyone's life at risk. That's where the game begins. As a great FPS game, we can move around, jump, shoot, crouch, push objects (albeit in a rather strange way) and we can also make actions, such as clicking a button, turning a valve, etc. The ambience of the game is excellent, both the indoor and outdoor areas.  Gordon is speechless during the entire game, however, we will meet other humans, scientists, security guards (who are helping us) and soldiers (who have orders to kill us). The variety of weapons is huge, we have the iconic crowbar, pistols, shotguns, grenades, mines, crossbows, rocket launchers, ray guns and weapons that the creatures use. Talking now about the creatures, the variety is also huge, the famous headcrab, the Vortigaunt, the blind but extremely dangerous Tentacle and many others that we find throughout the game. Each enemy requires a certain strategy, or not, it will depend on you. The game also contains some puzzles, some easier, others more difficult. The only problem I had was sometimes that Gordon just got stuck (it happened about 3 times), and I had to go to another save. Half-life is an old game, but it is still a great game that is very worth playing. The game deserves 9.8 / 10."
14663,:) a classic
14664,Peak Game!
14665,"HEGH! STAPH! ARGH! NO! 

God I love Half-Life. Definitely recommend: 9.6/10"
14666,"Half Life is pretty fun and I would likely recommend it based solely on it's low system requirements. Half Life has a bizarre difficulty curve that really caught me off guard and some sometimes confusing level design. I frequently found myself abusing the quick save (F6) and quick load (F7) function. 

Half Life's older game play definitely isn't for everyone and it would be a mistake to play the game based on the blind hype that plagues the review section."
14667,"So Half-Life is my favorite piece of media, but this game wasn‚Äôt my gateway into it's vast universe. Half-Life 2 was, and while that game has very similar design principles and thematic ties, it‚Äôs completely different from it‚Äôs predecessor. My first and fondest memories of this series is connecting with 2‚Äôs fleshed out cast of characters, and how fascinating and developed the world and the lore is.

Half-Life couldn‚Äôt afford to have those things. In fact, I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs a way less consistently good game than it‚Äôs sequel. Modding it is easy, and that‚Äôs the main reason why I mess with it so much. It‚Äôs more of a sandbox to me than a game. But every time I actually go to pick it up, I‚Äôm reminded that it‚Äôs high points are just the best in the entire series, and to understand why is to understand what makes this game so unique.

Many of the things that fans and critics claim Half-Life pioneered was actually done before it. Blood‚Äôs combat, in my opinion, is just as sophisticated and nuanced. And sure, while that game lacked a really good presentation for its story, relying on cheap cutscenes and loveable edge factor, Half-Life wasn‚Äôt the first to evolve past those things. Quake 2 and Unreal were among the first games to realize the FPS genre‚Äôs potential for immersive storytelling, respectively casting their protagonists as a space marine on a cohesive warpath and a prisoner ironically freeing an alien race from subjugation. And sure, those are simple stories with few moral qualms, but Half-Life wasn‚Äôt the first to evolve past that either. System Shock juxtaposed the player's human ingenuity and imperfection with the efficiency of technology, a cyberpunk metaphor for the battle of player vs. designer. Valve was no doubt inspired by all of these games, since those elements were carefully weaved throughout their product. Alone, they make the game a classic, but the ideas captured with those tools are what makes it a masterpiece.

Half-Life places you in the shoes of Gordon Freeman, who is simultaneously a combination and rejection of every game protagonist that came before him. The sequel highlights the fact that Gordon is not a soldier, or a gunslinger, or an action movie hero, nor is he an everyman that people can reliably look up to. Valve‚Äôs employees have stated that Gordon was intended as a blank slate; a faceless avatar. But like with all fiction, some of the creators‚Äô true feelings tend to slip through the cracks.

See, games back then, and especially now, are obsessed with the idea of escapism. Publishers and players want the biggest worlds, the most options, and the best character builds, totally separated from our reality. They paid for the experience and set aside the time, and so it should be their fantasy. So isn‚Äôt it fascinating that Valve, despite crafting such an acclaimed, intricate world, made Gordon Freeman into someone fatally flawed, totally devoid of their own free will?

From the few details we‚Äôre given in the game, Freeman is the type of person who‚Äôs smart enough to graduate from MIT with a PhD in theoretical physics, and work at the Black Mesa Research Facility- a place that, on the surface, seems to be any aspiring researcher‚Äôs dream job. Like much of the demographic at the time, he's an aging young man, perhaps a bit geeky given the books in his locker, with an interest in the more intellectual aspects of our world and his whole life ahead of him. But all Gordon does is follow the orders of old, tired scientists who get irritated whenever he tries to get their attention. Despite his implied intelligence, and his earned academic and career achievements, he's reduced to little more than a grunt for a line of samey, unknowable individuals, even though they are the only people that share his same passions. And despite living through the most cataclysmic event in human history, he is still the spineless pawn, neither his previous life or his new one meaning zilch in the face of a new reality. Resonance Cascade or not, his fate is determined as soon as he steps on the tram to work in the morning.

All this might seem like I‚Äôm reading too far into a silly action game, but Valve‚Äôs decisions were deliberate. Strong themes of subjugation, manipulation, and loss of agency are wrapped within this conspiracy-fueled world, which is webbed with as many lies, half-truths, and unknowns as there are tripmines. They could have given Gordon a voice to reason with the world around him and solve his dilemmas like a typical story. Or, if they were truly committed to making him a power fantasy, he could conceivably go home, smoke a stogie, and get laid after the credits like every other cookie cutter mother fucker. But they didn‚Äôt. In fact, no matter what you do as him, the game will always chastise you in some cruel, ironic way. Those grunts that killed twelve dumb scientists, with not one of them fighting back? If you kill them, you‚Äôre just as bad as they are; if you let them live, you‚Äôve proved their point. Half-Life is a game that only offers simple solutions to complex problems: Run, Think, Shoot, Live, or fail. In this way, it's aim is not to be truly immersive or escapist, but to confront the player's real, human element and emotionally shake it to the core.

I suspect that Valve saw a lot of themselves in Gordon Freeman, perhaps too much of themselves. They were all clearly brilliant people with then-untapped potential, held back in some way or another. Game dev and professional creative arts can be sobering, stifling white collar experiences; office jobs are the birthplace of escapist interactive experiences, after all. Seen in Half-Life is a belligerent combination of ideas, coming from young, aspiring creatives and experienced software engineers clashing with each other, many of them foreign to what it takes to ship a game. In most cases, this would kill a new team, but Half-Life is a rare example where everyone involved decided that the product they had and the people that they were should be seen, heard, and experienced in the most engaging and fun way possible. Ex-law firm secretary Marc Laidlaw, while crafting meticulous sci-fi epics, writes Black Mesa‚Äôs office staff and the bureaucratic G-Man with noticeable contempt. Sound designer and composer Kelly Bailey is terrified and self-deprecating in interviews, and in the OST his guitar quietly lies behind well chosen, but heavy samples. Artist Ted Backman‚Äôs creatures use sexual imagery with the intent to terrify players. Level designers John Guthrie, Dario Casali, Dave Riller, and Brett Johnson (among others) redefined the art while regrettably using cheap ideas under crunch. Alongside Gabe Newell, gaming messiah that has apparently earned the ability to say and do what he wants, none of them want to talk about the series‚Äô first entry anymore.

When I was 15 years old and first played this, I was oblivious to these kinds of things, and just accepted it as a game in black and white terms: the good and the bad, the innovative and the crude. As a young man, I‚Äôve realized that it is a revolutionary, powerful piece of ‚Äúvent art‚Äù made by extraordinary people trying to find their place in life, and Valve at their most raw, ugly, and vulnerable. I'm glad that their effort won 50 GOTY awards, since I can't see a near future where a mainstream title will have the balls to say what it did.

Half-Life 2 onward masked Gordon by giving him what he might have wanted in the first game: A huge world; a guard that was an actual friend; a scientist that respected them; a scientist who resisted authority; a totally evil military force; coworkers you could hate; a friend you could love. Though Freeman was still a silent, spineless pawn, it was all given to him, instead of having to reason it out on his own. And while Alyx is on the cusp of revealing that they were all just pawns, too, Half-Life will stand on its own by having said the same thing, in a more concise, vicious, relevant, and hard-to-swallow way."

The enemy encounters are varied and fun to strategize, due to the fairly advanced AI for 1998. This doesn‚Äôt mean the game is perfect however. Xen can be especially frustrating and drawn out and some escort tasks are a bit, well, troublesome to say the least. While the AIs great for enemies, it falters with NPCs and path finding a bit, causing you to sometimes get stuck when an npc blocks your way. For the ten dollar admission fee however, you‚Äôre still getting a great game even if dated in some ways, it‚Äôs valves first game and it really shows their talent as a studio."

It has some rough patches (surface tension is a pain in the ass), but is an amazing experience the whole way through. And once you do finish it, the first thing you want to do is play the whole thing over again. Also has amazing modding support and some cool addons. Overall, play it.

Also, the multiplayer is super chaotic but pretty fun, especially on crossfire. The ability to launch a nuke is perhaps one of the greatest design choices in gaming history."

Half life (as a whole series) is like the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Terminator movies or Kubrick's 2001 etc... it's timeless. Half Life set new standards for the PC FPS genre that are now followed by countless developers. There are just a few games that I would consider a ""must play"" for everyone and this is definitely one of them."

14704,An amazing FPS that revolutionized story telling in shooters. It may look a bit ugly but that's where Black Mesa comes in. Black Mesa is a fan-made remake of Half-Life which was approved by Valve. If you can afford it then buy it instead as Half-Life hasn't aged the best and the last few levels are a pain.
14705,"No need for many words, this is the best game ever!"
14706,"Playing the original Half-Life game was a really unique experience for me. I did not played this game at launch, but even several years later I feel that the immersion of the story is present, and the originality and greatness of the gameplay for that era makes this game certainly valuable. The story is solid and it makes for an incredible foundation for what would be the next release in the saga, Half-Life 2. The dialogues between characters generally contain useful information that is necessary throughout story, but even with it, certain puzzles and scenarios can often feel confusing and sometimes daunting.

The gameplay is rather solid and even though many things have changed in modern games regarding player movement, this title standardize most of the keybinds that are still used to this date. Player movement, as I said, can feel slippery and you might even have the feeling that Gordon is extremely light. Even though this is no longer common in new titles and can feel somewhat weird, you get use to this fairly easily and even though it is noticeable, it is generally not going to feel like a limitation when playing. Furthermore, you might also encounter with situations where you are glitched and you need noclip in order to continue with the story. This happened to me a couple of times but it does not make the game unplayable.

I find no point on criticizing the graphics of this game from a modern point of view, they are obviously dated and this is totally understandable of a game this old, but back in the day I know that they where outstanding. However, there is an option in-game to enable ""High Definition Models"", which increase the number of polygons in many models, and replaces some textures for higher resolution ones. This significantly improves the visual aspect of many items.

There are a lot of weapons to try throughout the story. Since you unlock them progressively, you will probably have the change of trying many weapons before beating the game, and since it is very common to run out of ammo,  sometimes you will also be forced to use weapons you do not necessarily like.

The soundtrack is impressive. Not only the soundtrack itself, but the moments in which some tracks are played. You will often find a good-timed track starting to play in precise moments creating memorable scenes. Personally, one of my favorite scene/soundtrack piece is in the Chapter 12 ""Surface Tension"", when you get into a drain hatch and when you start seeing the end of the tunnel, the classic Valve theme starts playing.

I totally recommend this game; regardless of the clear limitations due to the game's age I think that this game deserves an shot if you have not played it yet. It will make you understand how far we have come in every single aspect: Artificial intelligence, gameplay, graphics, level design, etc. It is also able to exhibit the the beginnings of this game genre and you will quickly understand why was this game that influential and important to trace a path of how will many games be made from that moment on."
14707,video gam good hyes
14708,"I bet you've never heard of this game, is pretty gucci."
14709,"Half-Life deserves all the praise it has gotten (and still gets). However, if you just glance at most of the reviews here, I doubt some of them can explain why. The vast majority are either high on nostalgia or blindly hate modern games and subscribe to the ""old but gold"" belief (which isn't always true as some old games didn't age well or weren't good to begin with).

So I'll be one of the few reviewers that will attempt to explain in detail why Half-Life 1 is so freaking awesome.

First, let's look at the story. A top secret military facility named Black Mesa conducts an experiment that results in the teleportation of aliens to Earth (and a consequent invasion). The US government, trying to hide the truth, sends the military to wipe out not only the aliens, but also all the employees of Black Mesa. You play as Gordon Freeman, one of those scientists trying to survive. I don't know; some people loved the story but to me, it wasn't anything special (and it's not why HL1 is loved anyway). But whatever your views on the story, you should appreciate the fact that IT DOES NOT TAKE CONTROL FROM YOU TO TELL IT. The story was written to fit the gameplay, whereas modern games do the opposite. I dread playing some modern games today because you have to listen to or sit through a scripted event before you regain control (and their stories aren't that good anyway). HL1 does have a couple scripted events you need to watch, but they are few, don't overstay their welcome and actually tell you ""Well s**t is about to get real"". So if you don't care about the story, then rest assured you don't have to.

Now on to the gameplay. Remember when I said the story does not take over control from you? Well you can play HL1 at your own pace. Level design is linear, but not the ""tight corridor"" linear. It give you enough room to move about and it encourages and rewards exploration. Regards the latter, modern games don't give the incentive to explore for the so-called ""secret collectibles"", you get nothing more than an achievement. In HL1, when you find a secret area, it rewards you with health, power, ammo and weapons. Now that's an incentive.

The game also does not treat you like an idiot. You have the general idea of trying to escape and trying to repair the damage done but you also have to listen to the dialogue from the scientists and security guards as to what you're to do next, and even if you don't listen, there are hints in the environment telling you where to go and what's your next move (like signs and printed warnings). No objective list, no map markers, nothing. Just go there or shoot something and see what happens. I like it. And usually when I got stuck somewhere and saw a walkthrough telling me what to do next, I genuinely feel like I ruined the experience of figuring out, like I thought ""How did I not see that?"" So please, if you get stuck somewhere, resist the temptation of looking up a walkthrough of where to go and what to do. Trust me, YOU WILL KNOW. Modern games, on the other hand, started bringing ""to-do lists"". Fine. Then it started bringing up maps with the objective mark. Eh, I can live with it. Then compasses telling you where to go. Okay, okay I'll figure it out. Now the marker is on the center of the screen. Great, there's no incentive to explore or use your head. And you no longer take the time to appreciate the environment because your eyes are fixated on the objective. Thanks a lot modern gaming! If 10 year olds could beat the game back in 1998, then why do we need all those crap telling us where to go?

Now on to the AI and difficulty. This is the one of the most well-coded AI and difficulties I have even seen. Do you want to know how good AI and difficulty is in a game? Ask yourself this: will quick-saving break it? Because in HL1, though you can quick-save, that still will not address the enemies and obstacles you need to overcome. In other words, there is no artificial difficulty like in modern games. You see, modern games try to rely on checkpoint placement to try and make the game more difficult. What it does is just make things more frustrating because it's really just relying on your endurance for difficulty rather than their own ability to try and kill you. Not so with HL1. HL1 is like, ""Oh you're gonna save there? LMAO, we're still here buddy. That ain't gonna help you."" All enemies require certain tactics to defeat them, even on the Easy difficulty. And if you think quick-saving makes the game too easy (which IMO it doesn't), then you don't have to save. So to developers, let us quick-save where we want. And if you think that will ruin the game, then you just need to code it better.

And the gunplay. Every weapon has it's use. I think this solidifies the idea that less=better. HL1 doesn't have a lot of weapons by modern standards, but they all have a purpose. I rather have a game that has less weapons but all have a purpose than a game that has 100 weapons but you use only 5 at most. And this is coming from a gun-nut who appreciates weapon variety in games, as long as all (or most) have a use.

Now on to the bad. Obviously, graphics have aged poorly even with HD models enabled. Speaking of the HD pack, I don't see the hate around them. It makes the models a little more pleasant to look at. My problem is that it replaces the MP5 with an M4 carbine AND IT STILL USES THE PISTOL ROUNDS FROM THE PISTOL. With the MP5, I understand as it uses 9mm bullets, but not with a rifle.

As for the human enemies (i.e. the Marines), they are one of the strongest enemies in the game (even stronger than most aliens). They require a lot of bullets to take down (though this can be attributed to their body armor). But remember when I said all enemies require tactics and the AI is well-coded? You will see this with the Marines. They won't stand out in the middle of the open with no sense of self-preservation. No, they will act and co-ordinate like a team. It's almost as if they're like the military (oh wait). If you are in cover, they will flush you out with grenades. If you do enough damage, they will retreat. If you run away to recuperate, they won't blindly chase you (though they sometimes will), they will wait in ambush for you when you come back. I know I was going to talk about the bad, but the bad thing about the Marines is that added to all these, they are bullet sponges. Even shotguns sometimes make them tickle. But for some strange reason, firefights with them are some of the best parts of the game.

I spoke a lot about this game and I'm sure I missed some (or even a lot) of other good things, but I just wanted to explain why this game is so awesome to me, and how modern games still struggle to reach even close to HL1. This game is a masterpiece. After playing this, you will never look at other shooters the same again."
14710,"9.6/10

Cool game to play again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again."

14761,good
14762,"Pretty cool storyline, has aged well, but scary. You will get jumpscared."
14763,"Everything that needed to be said about Half-Life has already been said. To simply put it, it's one of the best games of all time. You owe it to yourself to buy it and experience this masterpiece."
14764,"Half-Life holds up as a great experience still worth playing if you never have. Some folks will tell you that you can just play Black Mesa instead if you want to experience in a new and shiny form, but I personally think the actual original is worth experiencing on its own as well. This game should be overrated, and for some perhaps it is, but to me somehow it really is as good as its legacy."
14765,Know your history.

14772,"The gunplay is OK, I recommend not playing the game in a ""guns blazing"" mentality. You'll want to use more clever planning, resource management, and use of all your items while escaping Black Mesa. Great FPS, even holds up today despite it's clear aging."

14782,"I bought this game when it was on sale for 1$.
As of now I still have not beaten the game on easy mode while progressing pretty fast.
This game is long and difficult and I would recommend it to anyone who does not rage quit over ladders often."
14783,Its Half Life need I say more XD
14784,gman's bitch now
14785,I should not have waited so long to play this game. Still fun to play even in 2020.

14791,"I'm a bit late to the party for this one (if you consider 22 years ""a bit"") but after many recommendations and curiosity (since I loved the Portal games), i decided to give Half-Life a try. I didn't have many expectations going in, but if I did, I think they would have been exceeded. For a 1998 game, Half-Life has aged quite well and I feel less guilty about taking so long to play it; it isn't without flaws, however. For starters, the game is difficult right off the bat; this isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but it made things much less accessible. It also has some glitches (I played the GoldSrc version). I got stuck in walls and switches multiple times and while it wasn't game-breaking, it was noticeable. Once I began to acquire more weapons, I was having a blast (haha) shooting aliens and mowing down marines. On to Half-Life 2."
14792,"Play this, do not play Source, Source is terrible in comparison."
14793,"it fun

14796,Very amazing. Yes
14797,si.
14798,Honestly. If i had a more high graphic computer. I'd say Black Mesa would be better. Thank goodness i don't because then i don't think i would have gotten this game.
14799,It's Half-Life... No need to say more... The father of all FPS. Stiil one of the best games ever. 5 stars.
14800,The claaaaaassic. 10/10.
14801,"I finally got around to playing this, having only played HL2 during my teen years. While the game itself was pretty tough for me, being a casual player, it was very fun and rewarding! The little snippets of world-building are very enjoyable too."
14802,"Thank you Gaben!!!!
Absolutely amazing!"
14803,games good
14804,"i put off playing this game for like 2 year's, but now that i have completed it i can say that aside from some obvious age the game is quite enjoyable and a good game to play if you have some time to spare.

i would like to see a remake; i think it would be quite interesting"

14821,"pretty fun, probably the most realistic game I've ever played"
14822,"To be honest I didn't expect anything special from game made over 20 years ago , but I've been really astonished how good that game is. It has interresting storyline and although It was made in 1998  it's still playable. IMO It is worth to buy.

14824,I prefer original graphics game good also NO STOP NOOOO AH STOP NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
14825,mmm!!!!very very tasty !!!!!!
14826,Black Mesa ripoff.
14827,"Oddly I never played Half Life back in the day so I'm now righting that wrong.

All the plaudits it has received are well deserved, it's an FPS with puzzle elements that took things to a whole new level.

Is it still worth playing in 2020? Most definitely, it's atmospheric, engaging and still fantastic.

Sure there are some annoying mechanics when it comes to climbing ladders and moving boxes but this game was made in the late 90s. 
"
14828,yes
14829,very fun
14830,Most of the gameplay hold up to this day.
14831,"the first game is cool, and totally worth the price, buy it if you have some spare money."
14832,"It may not have High resolution or cool animations or fully rendered world. But what it has is a good story line and a very enjoyable gameplay. Sometimes you just need a little less expectations and look where games came from.

Love it 10/10. And if you dont have this game and youre looking for new this is the one to buy."
14833,The most unforgettable start to any series of games that I have ever played.
14834,"It's a really good game, with varieties of enemies, combat scenarios, and each gun fulfilling a different purpose. Level Design is mostly pretty good except for a few select sections but in general it's an enjoyable experience. There are some sections where it's easy to get lost, and On a Rail as well as all the Xen sections were amazing, but this was truly the birth of good first person shooter design."

I played this game long enough to get through the game intro and when i got control of the gordon freeman and realised keyboard only i logged out immediatly. But steam claims ive been playing this game constantly even though the window isnt open, i really dont have time to play halflife for 27 hours in 3 days something is wrong with the game time counter lol only reason im writing a review the ""27 hours"" on halflife that i didnt play and i see it on my profile most everytime i log in ive been playing halflife somehow while i was spending most of my time at work. I find that irritating i hope that gets fixed"
14850,a
14851,lots o' fun
14852,Awesome.
14853,"I am absolutely torn over this game, on one hand the story is brilliant and fun but unfortunately the gameplay does not reflect this. The set pieces where a pipe falls under your weight are im sure usually an interesting way to spice up an otherwise boring task however on those occasions where one has no health they usually end up with you dying instantly and having to reload an older save or try to glitch the game. Another huge issue is the checkpoint system, it sometimes does not bother to save for hour long stretches which have led to me having to redo boss fights from the beginning. I am not sure if these are due to my system being linux however i would have expected valve to correctly port their game. I do understand that this is an old game however my experience of games of a similar age have not been as bad as this. I have marked this review as yes i would recommend as i would as this is by far not a bad game, however i would recommend this only those who are willing to be slightly dissapointed, especially if you have played half life 2 which is far better."
14854,Incredible in VR
14855,A classic FPS
14856,does not hold up well
14857,"Out of all the games, this is my favourite. I loved the atmosphere and the heavy emphasis on the puzzles. I liked getting to know Freeman and the ending location made me :O. Was quite a thrilling game. Freeman was interesting because he was meant to be the non-military man, the scientist, running around in his glasses doing hardcore stuff. I thought he was a great non-stereotype main character. I still really fondly think of this game... years after playing it. Fantastic introduction to the shooter genre and worth picking up at any point. It has aged fantastically compared to other games made in the 90s/00s."

14863,Father of Counter-Strike.
14864,"It will always have a place in my heart as the game that set me on a course of life changing events. I remember buying the platinum collection over 20 years ago and couldn't wait to play. It's a game that doesn't hold your hand like all modern games. Half-Life teaches a great sense of movement and exploration with quick action that is hard to get anymore without complete directional assistance and signs. The nostalgia kicks in every time I play it. 

10/10
PS: I refuse to play Black Mesa...there is no point.. you should enjoy the original"
14865,cool campaign should check out remaster though it is pretty old
14866,Arguably the best FPS of the 90's. or at least my favorite. The game has great length and the best shotgun in video game history (except for Half Life 2) I played Half Life 2 on xbox when it came out but never played the original. so glad i picked this up it was a great ride now time to play Half life 2!
14867,"Its a classic, great time capsule!"

14880,"I would recommend this game to someone else if given the chance and they would probably like it, however it's just not what *I* look for in a shooter. I don't know, to me it just feels like half-baked puzzles with some half-baked combat sections in between. You may disagree and think that the gunplay is good and I respect that, but it's just not how I feel."
14881,Iconic game worth playing
14882,"good game , good story and any pc can run this game and even if its old it its really good the few things i dont like about half life is that its really slow and it can get a little bit tidies but it is still one of my favorite games 
and its just a timless classic .

14904,"A great experience, even in 2020. Ran into some annoying bugs, like getting stuck on geometry, but overall a good bit of fun. Some of the game design is a bit obtuse nowadays, but a walkthrough can be pulled up. Something i had to do quite a few times."
14905,Good story plenty of small puzzles to split it up so you are not just mindlessly killing. Occasionally throws an enemy at you when you least expect it just to stop you getting to that health box you needed..

----------------

Half-Life is alright... it is product of it's time. The graphics are aged, dialog and storytelling is bad and the VO is not great.
Graphic wise, this game was made a long time ago, so old graphics are to be expected. However some of the textures and lighting just don't quite work, and often ruin the sense of immersion.
Dialog and Storytelling are the main issues with this game. You have to stand right up to the people talking to even hear them, and often you wont even know they are telling you something, meaning you have no clue what to do in the story or why you are doing certain tasks (such as going to lambda station).
This issue leads into the VO. Clearly, Valve was only just getting the hang of things and their studio hadn't been able to get in ""New"" recording tech. And that is noticeable in this game.
Often I found myself bored and wondering ""When will this game end???"", and whenever i think that, something is wrong.
So, for these reasons, I don't believe I would ever play Half-Life again. However, if you have played other Half-Life games and want to see where it started like i did, I would recommend it, as at least you have that sense of curiosity to keep you going.
Half-Life gets a 4/10.

14933,"Pros:
-I got to be a soldier, a scientist, a space warrior, a crowbar-weilding maniac, and a Ghostbuster at the same time.
-Shot nearly everything in the game, including the people trying to help me.

Cons:
-In a facility practically overflowing with deadly weaponry, only one scientist thought to actually arm himself.
-I've become deathly paranoid about laboratories. Any time I'm in one, I start checking under the tables for headcrabs.

Highly recommended."

I should just buy Half-Life 2, this looks too old.
I know at first glance it looks boring and old, but it is surprisingly good for a 1998 game.
I reccomend the game to everyone, it gives a certain atmosphere to gaming.
The sound is the only thing i worry about, other wise great game

14943,"This game has really boring game play, The story is good and i like the story quite a lot. But i don't get a game for the story solely i get it because it's fun and enjoyable, and this game just doesn't meet those standards due to it having really basic combat along with very bad graphics. This is a game you only get for story, if you are looking for a game with good combat and that is fun to play. This just isn't it."
14944,Yes. Play.

14946,I've been playing this for 20 years.  It NEVER gets old.
14947,"cool

14948,Cool game
14949,"Still worth going through in 2020. Works well in 21.5:9 ultrawide. Do not play the Source """"""remaster"""""". Don't forget to use all the weapons available at your advantage: they are very underrated and it's easy to get stuck in the almost boring SMG/Shotgun loop"
14950,Dr. Coomer
14951,old but issa fun if a yu liek a games
14952,"Don't be turned off by graphics, this game has aged (mostly) very well. The story telling is done amazingly well, making it feel like most of things happening would happen even if you weren't there. Every weapon has a purpose and the right time to use it, while the shooting mechanics are basic, the part that makes them fun is making a strategy before going into a battle, you really have to think about what you're doing. Xen is garbage, it's boring and just acts as a way to add an hour or two onto the game. Overall though, I would still highly recommend this game in 2020, it's shocking how well the game aged for being from 1997."
14953,huver silahini alip gelyom kral
14954,"This game is just a few years older than I am, and it is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. I first tried it in high school, and found the experience frustrating, but recently I've been playing all the Half-Life games, and while I do enjoy the puzzles and physics in Half-Life 2 and its episodes, there's just something about this game that has me coming back every time. Even after playing the remake Black Mesa, I still think Half-Life 1 is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had with a video game. The only complaint I have about this game are the final chapters in the Xen dimension, but it seems everyone else has the same feeling, and anyway the rest of the game makes up for that flaw tremendously. If you have the time and the money, I would recommend getting this game because while it is over 2 decades old, a lot of the elements that were revolutionary in its time are still very enjoyable now."
14955,i like
14956,p
14957,yes
14958,"8.5/10, its great, its fuckin amazing, better than black mesa, don't @me

14959,"I love this game because it feels very realistic, despite the older graphics. If you like 1st person shooters, this is the game for you."
14960,"Legendary classic sci-fi shooter
i recommend you try online multiplayer after beating the game and you will find out that zombies shoot back!"
14961,IT GOOD
14962,go white boy go
14963,"Well, let's see, we have a good one here folks. Half Life was valve's debut title, but this is no rushed, poorly made, mess of a game, no, not at all. Half Life is one of the most revolutionary and fun shooters that I have played in a good while, and while it's graphics are dated, I still recommend it over Black Mesa because of the map layouts feeling better with more comfortable enemy AI. This game is so good in fact, that a twitch series parodying this game blew up and now my profile pic is from that series. While that series uses Half Life: Source, I do not recommend that version since HL: Source was clearly rushed with many bugs and glitches. Overall, it takes a while to get used to this game, but when you do, it feels like an adrenaline rush of an adventure. Now before I go, I do want to mention the combat in this game. The combat in Half Life feels great, but not everybody will like it. The combat in Half Life uses strategy- wait, wait stop, stop walking away.
When I say strategic, I mean that the combat has you revisiting encounters to see what works and what doesn't, and while it sounds boring, it's what makes the game shine. The combat in Half Life is better than any other fps I've played with it's over powered, but low ammo weapons like the ""Tas Cannon"" and ""Gluon Gun"", to the more simple weapons, like a machine gun that also fires grenades, or an alien that you shove your hand into, which makes you able to shoot smaller aliens that are like little homing missiles. This game is crazy, and while people poop on the ending area, Xen, I got past it pretty quick, and while it was boring at times in Xen, the rest of the game was one of the best fps games I have ever played.
I absolutely recommend this game, and it's only $10, but wait for the summer sale, so you can get the half life complete bundle for about $17 or less.

14964,Good
14965,"One of the first shoters I played as a child, which made me remember great moments. It's a classic shoters in my community. If you did not play it, I invite you to try it, in the same way as the multiplayer, the campaign is great."
14966,Im not very good at it but memories...
14967,good
14968,"I completed this game for the first time recently and while the game definitely shows its age in some places and the graphics haven't held up too great, the gameplay itself is timeless. The satisfaction of successfully reaching a new part of Black Mesa makes the gameplay a blast and will have you wanting more."
14969,Good but i hate the train section
14970,"I don't think it's as good as it's sequal HL2 because of it's how even on easy mode it's hard, also it's hard to keep track of what to do when you die."
14971,"One of my favourite games during my teenage years, really glad to see it has aged well. The story and gameplay are compelling and interesting plus it runs on most systems including my laptop that has onboard graphics.... Totally worth the price of admission!"

14974,"Half-Life is a gem of the videogaming history that puts you in the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a physicist who, following an accident during an experiment in the Black Mesa Research Facility, must survive an alien invasion and stop it.

I'm not going to lie, I never played an Half-Life game before. However, I constantly heard about how great the series was and decided to give it a shot. What do I have to say? The game still holds up in 2020 (it came out in 1998) and has got a beautiful story.

The puzzles aren't easy and they do require some thinking before doing anything. Nothing in the game's world is put randomly, and even the small detail can make the difference. The same thing applies for the fights, thank to its complex AIs. You have to pay attention to your enemies and the game will not hesitate to punish you if you stay in a safe spot for too long.

I'd easily give this game a 8/10. The graphics, for the time it was created, were good and, generally speaking, is still able to excite and entertain even today. Great job, Valve!

[i] [b] Time to choose... [/b] [/i]"
14975,"Really good game. The graphics can be hard if you're a snob, but they're fine otherwise. There are some glitches at the end of the of the game but besides that it's a great game."
14976,pretty epic game
14977,"This game is so good. The story is great, the gameplay is fun and I can't wait to play the sequel!"
14978,Good morning Mr. Freeman
14979,CLASSIC AND THE BEST PERIOD
14980,100%
14981,Great game even if it's a horror and graphics were great
14982,"Old, but gold"
14983,"Truly an amazing expirience I would not have anything to say against it and it's story but the chapter on the rails wich for me was the longest chapter and I hate it. It was also not fun in anyway.

But the whole experience was amazing and takes about 8-10 hours to complete. This game has emersive gameplay. It's true that the graphics are a little dated but that is to be expected with a game so old and if you are looking for new graphics I'd suggest you play Black Mesa (The remake of Half-Life) but this game will do and it's fun.

I rate the game 9/10"
14984,yeah pretty cool
14985,"This game right here is outstanding! I have put so many hours into this single campaign and boy do i love it.

10/10 - would commit genocide against the HECU again!"
14986,Headcrabs <3
14987,must play
14988,"pros
- mods work and are easy to install
- the game has an understandable story without any cut-scenes
- good arsenal with no over board concepts
- the length of the game is long but not to long 
cons
- some chapters take up a good chunk of play time and these chapters are made poorly
- some fights are repetitive and just an exchange of damage until one dies
- H.E.C.U guys are made well put like the fights there attack cycle is repetitive and they always just yeet grenades intruding your spot of cover and forcing you to run away before you are damaged leaving you vulnerable

despite these flaws this game is fun to play always filled with hidden secrets and worth the price"
14989,This game kicks ass lots of action and some puzzles.Plus cool guns.
14990,resonance cascade i forgot
14991,fam just play it

15005,A scientist man tries to escape a lab infested with aliens
15006,hard difficulty
15007,"The original Half Life, a classic

I've never finished before because the end was too hard for me as a kid but now i could and it's great !
The final boss was fun to fight, and i really like the ambiance of it

The level design is well made, sometime you'll have to resolve some ""puzzles"" to progress in the current level and there's A LOT (at least for me) of hidden monsters so, prepare to be scared at WHATEVER moments ahaha, like, they can just BREAK THE WALL and attack you, or if you're in a vent with no sound but you walking, they'll jump at you in the dark and many others way to make that game more like an horror game than something else x)

I personnally liked that because you're more afraid to be attacked it adds some suspense and stress, especially when you just fought many ennemies and ended up with 10hp and a little bit of ammo, you don't really want to be attacked :)

This is a good game and i recommend playing it, im now playing Opposing Force and Blue Shift to see Half Life 1 with another point of view and understand some things of the story that i maybe didn't when playing this one"
15008,nice and classicüëå
15009,yes

15013,"Ive played this game trough many many times and its still an amazing and legendary game.

Maybe im just nostalgic but D*mn I love this game"
15014,"I never played this growing up like a good bit of folks on here have, but I thought I'd try it out after hearing so many positive things about it. I was a bit worried before starting that the controls would be clunky or it wouldn't be playable without some sort of mods. It really says alot that this game still holds up to this day! I have never played anything quite like it. For me personally, the controls were simple enough for me to enjoy it but every chapter was such a challenge! I've played fps's before but man, they did something here. Currently playing Half-Life 2 and I can't wait to delve deeper into the franchise!"

15023,"---{Graphics}---
Well it's an old game, but after ten to twenty minutes you get used to it.
The 3D models are ok, but the texture are what make so old looking.

---{Gameplay}---
Easy to play if you already played an FPS.
If it's your first FPS, you better play in easy.

---{Game desing}---
Sometimes difficult to understand what to do. (happened 2 or 3 times)
Doesn't tell you explicitely the keys to do certain actions.

---{Audio}---
It's sometimes difficult to understand the dialogues, but the rest is more than ok.

---{Audience}---
Teens or older.

---{PC Requirements}---
As long as you have a graphic card, you're good to go.

---{Difficulity}---
The 3 difficulties are accurate.

---{Grind}---
Depend on the gap between the difficulity and your skill level

---{Story}---
Probably the best thing in this game + the ambiance makes it better.

---{Game Time}---
Took me 11hours in normal mode.

---{Price}---
If you can catch on sell or bundle its relly worth it, otherwise the price is OK.

---{Bugs}---
Won't happen in a normal gameplay."

15041,really good for 1998 standards
15042,Game of the Year no matter what year it is.
15043,"A classic, really shows how they just let the player roam free in the world without any major arrows pointing to where you need to go. You have to figure it out yourself. Gametime isn't that long, completed it in like 8 hours. Quite an experience."
15044,"even tho the graphics are looking old the game itself is a legend.

buy it, 10/10 you wont get tired but you would probably get bored."
15045,Half life Legendary game although I did not pass it in the steam but I passed it on the pirate I will pass it again with pleasure
15046,"To start, Half Life is a timeless masterpiece. The graphics are not that outdated as you might think and the AI can be really tough sometimes. Also the game helps you a lot during the start of the game. For example you meet your first enemies which are small and you can beat them with your trusty crowbar. The further you progress, the more stronger weapons you get and so do the enemies. I never thought i would enjoy a game this much. It made me laugh, rage and enjoy FPS shooters in general. The AI can be a bit broken sometimes but it is not as broken as in Half Life:Source (this version has way less bugs). So if you are looking for a fun and fast paced FPS game that has an unique and amazing story then this is the game for you.

PS: I got this game for free because someone had two copies of it and wanted to give one away. It made me buy the other half life games as well.

15048,d
15049,good game but you do get lost alot
15050,it is fun
15051,it old but it good
15052,"I honestly did not enjoy this game. I really wish I did, but it just wasn't that fun to me. Combat is drawn out, the 90s level design makes it super hard for you to know what you're supposed to do or where you're supposed to go. The rail cart part was absolutely horrible and made me want to stop playing. There were so many times when I almost gave up on this game, but I went through it (sometimes with cheats if I got annoyed) and beat it. The story is fine, but due to the lack of subtitles, its really hard to understand what people are saying sometimes. The weapons are one of the only pros of this game. They all have their purposes. 
Thankfully, this game did not turn me off of the series. Half Life Alyx has been a blast, and I'm sure the Half Life 2 will be better than this game. I would just skip over this one and watch a youtube video of it's story."
15053,Good game

No wonder this is the game that made Valve so popular.
Graphics aren't the best but the game was made in 1998."

"
15099,actualy this game is very good. The oldest game of Valve. Half-life is good for a game that is released in 1998
15100,after all these years it's still is a bad ass game to play.
15101,tis gud
15102,"This game is a classic... of sorts. It's an important historical milestone, like star wars. Also like star wars this isn't the original version. the UI is different, most of the stuff that I remember causing me grief is still here, most of the stuff I liked is gone. This is the ""Special Edition"" of Half life, that retains many of the bugs of the original: invisible walls, janky physics that will get you stuck mid loading screen, jerky motion, dumb AI... However you do get some of the improvements of the modern era: widescreen resolution (that you could get in the original just as easily), simplified soulless UI, HD models that are less detailed than the originals. 

The game is a fun romp, through Black Mesa. The people in charge of this project, particularly the level designers are clearly talented and excel at something that .... few modern games do well, environmental storytelling. It also has some non-environmental storytelling, and no unskippable cutscenes. Instead you have unskippable tedious sections. ""host_framerate 0.09"" bind that to a button, trust me. 

The platforming is surprisingly good. At least not nearly as infuriating as in BMS. Except the launchpads trigger in a very janky way, are totally unreliable, and the cases where you would need them always have some time pressure which makes this doubly more infuriating. Obviously this could've been fixed years later... It wasn't but at least you have an M4 instead of an MP5. 

The later half of the game: xen, is thankfully less than half of the game. It's tedious, but mercifully short and to the point. A virtue that BMS lacks. 

The combat is highly reliant on level design. This is great in most cases, because the level design in the main half of the life (pardon the pun), is actually not bad. Despite the fact that marines are hitscanning grenade spamming gods, they can be cracked just like a puzzle. It's run think shoot. If that's your jam, I'd advise you to play Deus Ex, but this is an acceptable introduction to the genre of shooters where brain is as important as brawn. 

This game isn't ideal, but not by any means terrible. You can't legally obtain the masterpiece that this version is based upon, but it is nearly as good as the old game. If you have disposable income and want this exact game because you want to experience **half life** this is the best legally available version. If not, and you simply want to try half life... you're better off without it. This game pioneered the genre of run think story driven shooters, but its execution is extremely rough. It has a remarkable atmosphere and some jank that you either love or hate. If you do, this version is doubly infuriating because that delicate nostalgia is tampered with... if not, you will feel that this game is about as polished as a brick wall, and you will feel cheated. This game's rough edges are atoned for by the retro atmosphere, despite its very modern formulaic approach. it is unfortunate, but it lacked the creative genius of Warren Specter, and the technological finesse of John Carmack. What it had instead, was much better, but has become so prolific that better, more polished implementations of this very formula suffuse the modern gaming markets. It's not at all terrible, but not a solid recommendation. It's still WAY better than Black Mesa Source, so I would encourage you to play this instead of that. 

P.S. On Linux, I would recommend using the native executable, for the fonts. The performance deficiency is barely noticeable, and while I did have tentative success running Brutal Half life, it crashed very frequently. I would advise not using Steam Play unlike Black Mesa Source."

i mean its a decent game overall but most of the time i have no idea whats happening, maybe i dont have a high enough iq idk
also this game does not explain the controls so when the scientist said ""yo practice your long jumps bro"" i was like ""ok but how"" and then i thought about how mario does the longjump in the mario games so i tried that and it actually worked! that was such a powerful gaming moment

also this game crashed several times while i played it, and there were 2 times where it completely broke my laptop and i couldn't quit the game or do anything with the keyboard and mouse so i had to force reboot my laptop which was so freaking annoying

i think to truly enjoy this game you have to be a dinosaur who played it when it came out 500 years ago so you can enjoy it on the sake of nostalgia
otherwise its just an ok game"
15144,"Bit janky, but fun"
15145,Bro it's Half-Life just buy it.
15146,"I played this in February of this 2020 and enjoyed it very much, now I have been playing this wonderful game for almost a year and a half.
The story mode (to be Valve's first game) is very good and with all the new features that the GoldSrc engine added in its time it made it very innovative, the multiplayer is quite nice and the game also has its charm due to the countless mods that made people and its wonderful sequel with the Source engine, it hurts that Half-Life 3 is not going to come out.

(I got this game when it was temporarily free on steam, then i bought it on december of 2020.)"
15147,"One of the most important and still amazing first person shooters, a legendary game that definitely has earned its reputation"
15148,Classic but good
15149,"This game is a masterpiece, a classic and probably one of the best I've played. Valve is known to release major games and most of them are some of the most memorable games there are. This is a game that was released in 1998 and it still holds up today as a fantastic game. I cannot recommend this game enough and Steam has it on sale all the time so just pick it up, you won't be disappointed. The only thing I would complain about is how the story ends because it is so abrupt. It left me with a lot of questions but I suppose that's what the next games are for, right?"
15150,old school awesome!
15151,"classic. amazing story, gameplay, puzzles, and atmosphere."
15152,good game
15153,No-Life
15154,LEGEND
15155,"The lack of instructions and arrows to tell you where to go are part of what makes this game immersive (even though the graphics haven't aged well). It is also, in a sense, a weakness, as I was sometimes stuck, not knowing what to do, because no interactive object really stands out (aside from, what, the red buttons?). And not knowing where to go too, I found the backtracking really confusing. 
The large variety of weapons calls for strategy. Count your ammo too, sometimes you're short! Again, the lack of instructions on how to use some weapons is hindering progression. Especially when you haven't seen anyone use that weapon in front if you, so you don't even know what it is supposed to do (if you know the one I am talking about, seriously, tell me: how were we supposed to know?). Some weapons are dangerous in close quarters, experimenting could end badly :,)
Some parts of the game are plain traps, you have to die at least once to know how to avoid/get prepared. I don't really care, I save often, but new player beware!
Some jumps are tricky, and frustrating. Those are rare, and the way you can use the map is interesting! Screw ladders though. And screw those people who are supposed to follow you and open doors, sometimes they won't...
A lot of different maps, even if some don't make sense, you still get the feeling you went through half the globe lol"
15156,fire emoji
15157,Good game.
15158,A masterpiece. My favourite first person shooter game of all time.
15159,Absolutely Nostalgic. I miss playing this game at night when I was 15.
15160,That rock is full of MAGIC
15161,It was me. I ate all the donuts.
15162,nice
15163,"this is pog

15164,nice
15165,Played it before Steam existed. The manual smelled very good.
15166,gouda
15167,eat my poo
15168,I mean what can I say other than the fact that this game is a masterpiece!
15169,it good
15170,"Funny :)

15171,"This game just wants you dead. Around every corner, is another enemy, and after you kill them, another spawns behind you. There are many sections were either the environment will kill you, or a well placed Mounted Machine gun, rocket launcher or sniper planted by the HECU will. Some parts of this game are outright near impossible, rage inducing, I hit my keyboard and almost broke my monitor because of this game, but the amazing cut scenes, puzzles, and story kept me going. Half Life is truly an amazing game for its time, and still is an amazing game. Just a little bit to get used to, with Freeman being able to run like Sonic, and jump like a frog, but when he hits the ground, half the time he dies. Moral of the story, don't do your first play through of this game on hardest difficulty, it will absolutely screw you. it is a must for a person who wants to play classics."
15172,B U Y I T
15173,"I couldn't defeat at the last boss, Good game."
15174,"If there was a button to skip the wiggedy wack opening trolley ride I would rate this the most explosive fiction of our generation. However it must settle for being simply 9/10 bargain bin bozo bonger. Gotta get it if you want to see what real game design looks like. Also just turn the game off once you reach Xen, there is no hope in that place."
15175,my favourite all time game
15176,"Where it all began. Truly one of the G.O.A.T
A nice mix of horror, puzzles, and combat. The lore is super cool too!"
15177,"A gaming classic, Half-Life does not hold up as much as it sued to. However, when judged against other games of the time, Half-Life is a technologically innovative and feat in visual storytelling. 7/10."
15178,"A classic pc shooter that tells its story without cutscenes but gameplay and atmosphere. Im not going to spoil to much but at the start of the game you travel to the entrance of the lab by train in the black mesa complex. which is kinda part of the portal story but don't worry about it. Anyways throughout the whole ride theirs alot shown with the environments of the facility showing the process of the maintenance in the building going deeper and deeper down from the rails. Truly a great introduction in video games that you can only see once. Because after that it only gets boring with it being so long that you cant even skip. I guess they didn't have that technology back in 1998. I think that's all I need to say. Theirs is a huge point at the start that changes everything but that all I need to say. You should probably play the first in the series before the others. The story gets very complicated fast. That's all I need to say... about the story! don't even get me started on the gameplay. ""You cant do it"". Who said that? O i'm getting started now. The gameplay is incredible I don't really think that the guns are what make the gameplay fun its the enemy and item placement the really shines. The movement is a bit weird with long jumps and walking for no reason. Just play the game then play half life 2 that's where it really gets good. I mean really good. If I had 2$ for every time I said gameplay I could buy this game again. So go play it!"
15179,"An amazing game which, i my opinion, still holds up today. would recommend to anyone even those who have played black mesa as they are very different games."
15180,"Good game, If the graphics look old then play Black Mesa instead."
15181,why do you not have?
15182,"Influential, thrilling, a wild wide filled with many twists and turns. What more can be said that you haven't heard a billion, gajillion times? What are you doing if you're on Steam and you don't have this essential classic in your library?"
15183,"This is the best game ever and nobody can change my mind ! 
Go play it now and see where it all begun :D"
15184,Very good
15185,A great game released in November 1998 and is now a classic
15186,very good gmae i l iek

15194,yes
15195,"Really fun and challanging game. The platforming is pretty slippery, but there is not a lot of it in the game."
15196,It'd be cool if there were aliens in this game
15197,cringe sequle
15198,Legendary masterpiece. Every time I pass as if for the first time. Game for the ages! Bravo VALVE !!!

15209,Greetings!
15210,It's a classic. Nothing much else to be said. Great game. Worth the price. Get it.
15211,"I bought it, it's pretty swell.

Wish there was an extra-extra-baby mode though."
15212,I think that Gordon Freeman should be allowed to befriend the aliens.

15214,Yes

15217,aged like your ex but bhopping is just fun now as it was then
15218,"good, 8 hours to finish(no achievements)"
15219,"A great game. It shows what happens when you strip the graphics of a game, and just have pure gameplay. Shooting against the military feels better tan most games today. The boss fights and mechanics are great. Would recommend."
15220,"game go bhop, hop hop hop"
15221,"It's good, with a few exceptions.  It had some bad platforming and minor bugs, but overall, I liked it."
15222, M
15223,"Very nice, bhop down the tunnels to easy win against the government"
15224,Haven't even finished it yet and is already my favourite game
15225,funny man go shooty shooty
15226,"Game is very dated, but as a player just getting into gaming and the half life series, I was still able to appreciate it for what its significance may have been at the time. Cool story, HD models were better, and overall a very well thought out game. Completed in 23 hours on Easy Mode. Most of my difficulties were with the physics of jumping/landing, ladders, and getting killed by fans/turbines that I was seemingly well clear of. Only a couple bad glitches that forced me to revert to a previous save point to resolve. Excited to play Blue Shift, Opposing Force, then HL2. Still enjoyed the Portal games way more, but I'm not a FPS person, and my opinion might change after playing the sequels."
15227,this game gives me anxiety every time i boot it up 10/10
15228,"cool game good buy
"
15229,FOR GOD SAKE OPEN THE SILO DOOR
15230,"This game is a classic! ur stuipid if u dont have this game,so get it TOO STOP BEING STUIPID"
15231,a
15232,"One of the best game of all time. I used to play this game on my phone and i was just amazed. The game was just amazing, the game was very story driven, the game was very epic and overall i was having fun playing the crazy game, and the guy in the hazard suit from the game. The game is good and sometimes fun but its gets annoying since people will disagree the game with their stupid suggestions (lol i dont remember the people) and the game requires a lot of playing so you can see the game you've never seen before like this. Luckily the game provides you with good time. The game is a lot of fun to discuss with friends. 8.5/10"
15233,half good life bad
15234,it good
15235,Insanely good.
15236,Old School FPS what could be better?
15237,CLASSIC
15238,"This game is great, dont get me wrong. the only issue is that after a while it get unbelievably repetitive and kinda boring. its a hell of an experience to have under your belt but GOD does get repetitive. yes i recommend, but just a fair warning."
15239,good
15240,This is a really good game. It's very fun with the amazing storyline.
15241,have played before
15242,nice
15243,I love the classics of half life They are worth buying even full price
15244,I would really ask you to buy this this is a quality game for it's time.
15245,I think game is awesome but for some reason I play is something bad happens that night or next day so
15246,"epic and creepy ambient shooter from the late 90's, dont play online cause its kinda dead ngl and boring.

id rate it 9/10 deducted -1 cause of online gameplay experience
"
15247,This game is a true adventure.
15248,"amazing game, stands the test of time"
15249,"Holds up surprisingly well to this day, mostly due to superb level design. The environments and the way how the game makes the players interact with them to problem solve their way through is mostly pretty creative, the shooting hasn't aged well compared to other classic games like Quake 1 and 2 but overall Half Life still stands as a testament to good old school FPS design."
15250,It's Half-Life
15251,worth it if on sale
15252,its frickign half life it doesnt need a 3d card to play so yes yes ye sye sye sye sye ety sey syer ye sye sye ye sey syeyhs yhe  ye s ye syes yees
15253,"It's fucking half-life, come on now."
15254,very fun except i wish they made an official remake with updated graphics and fixed bugs
15255,Definitely a classic! Love the game and it's great on Steam!
15256,GAMER PUSSY SHIT DUCK FRUCK OH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA NIGGA
15257,good game
15258,wait what?
15259,good
15260,look above at my hours at review
15261,You know what it is already
15262,you're gonna need your passport
15263,"amazing game.

best story telling and atmosphere i have ever seen in a game.

10/10 recommend buying, preferably on sale."
15264,Hello Gordon!
15265,Fun game and story
15266,"i have not played for 90 hours, i could not turn it off for 80 hours"
15267,It makes you feel like batman
15268,"This game isn't bad by any means but I found there was a certain point where I got pretty bored. Mostly this game is good for the story and early game play, but other than that, I can't say I was the biggest fan.
This might just be preference though!"
15269,Classic. Must have
15270,f0ck alien cattos >:l
15271,Yeah it's really good.
15272,its fun
15273,A classic that still holds interest despite thoroughly outdated graphics
15274,Hard
15275,Old but fun! Really takes you back to that era of these types of games. My dad even played it!
15276,its fun i would like a 3rd 1 tho
15277,"I thought people were exaggerating when they complained about the final chapter of the game, but no, it really is significantly worse than the rest of the game. Overall the game is great. It's dated of course, there's some cheap deaths and some frustrating moments, but overall it holds up well. The game feels quite modern in terms of level design, it doesn't just expect you to look everywhere with no clues, but usually has NPCs tell you what to do, so if you listen it's pretty clear.

Overall I would recommend, just be prepared for Xen."
15278,"Good game, graphics are farily good and fun gameplay. The only issue is the glitches but theyr'e in frequent."
15279,"Attractive gameplay, stunning design, interesting story, and catchy soundtrack.

This is what I call an example of a perfect FPS game."
15280,"I originally beat this game on Sven Co-Op with my friend, it was very fun but it allowed us to use shortcuts making the game less enjoyable. If you buy this version the loading screens are also seamless, I'm not sure if I prefer this over half life 2 but it is amazing! ( Also it looks better than sven co op )"
15281,"Held off for a long time playing this series in the hope I wouldn't have to wait for episode 3, but I broke down and bought it and I'm very glad I did."
15282,"Summary of what happens: Crowbar man makes a portal, it goes wrong then a bunch of aliens come through, then a bunch of soldiers come down you defeat them then you go into the portal into Xen and defeat aliens there and then defeat a Alien baby. G Man then takes interest in you and says ""Hey man u can work with me if u want but if u dont u big die"" then you say yes and he makes you sleep for two decades"
15283,Epicest game ever
15284,"This game is from 1998, let that sink in. And its still very well worth a look in 2020, 22 years later! It aged very nicely.
It also spawned the most famous multiplayer shooter of all time with the 1.6 release.
Half Life is the best gift valve ever gave us."
15285,its gud
15286,There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said.
15287,"very very very nice game no question about it, but if you haven't played it i would instead recommend you check out the fan made remake of this game, ""black mesa"" which is this game except improved in every conceivable way possible"
15288,still worth playing 22 years later
15289,"Honestly one of the best video games every created, really wish we would get more experiences like Half-Life.
You wouldn't really expect a nearly 24 year old game to be more fun than most modern day games, definitely worth a play if you haven't already."

15301,the year 2020 and this is still the most immersive singleplayer shooter available
15302,Graphics are not great. Stick to CsGO
15303,It's really good my favorite chapter is the second one
15304,haf lif
15305,"Not my type of game, but still, I really liked it. I hated the m4 recoil, the character movement and the fact that around half of the time I had no idea why I was doing whatever I was doing, but it sure was interesting. Playing this game in 2020 is quite weird, but it was a pleasent retro experience. I can't believe this was done in 1998."
15306,"slurp

15307,10/10 i just hate gordons ponytail

15309,"it gud

15310,"As someone who first experienced and played it earlier this year, this game holds up incredibly well to this day. Easily one of the greatest games I've ever played. The parts nobody likes (On A Rail, Xen) are actually really good too, ngl. Half-Life gets a 9/10 from me."
15311,Awesome classic fps!!
15312,It's nostalgic for me! This game came out when I was 11 years old!..I'm playing it now at 33...and it's still amazing...WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!
15313,"wonderful game! acoustics are a little weird, but it's 22 years old. very great game! would recommend."

15320,Amazing game even now in 2020. Simply a classic
15321,"This is a classic. The story is compelling and the game play very good by the standards of the games at the time. I think this game still holds today, even tho I could be better in terms of its visual. If you like to experience a game that change the FPS genre for good, play this game, you won't be disappointed."

15337,"It's fucking half life. What else do I have to say? Well, I'll say this, if you're a pc gamer and you don't own this game, what the fuck are you doing?! This game is always heavily discounted down to a meer $1! Tell me what you can buy for $1? Besides my soul of course which, isn't even worth a cent."
15338,can anyone tell me why i must purchase it as I used to play it before?
15339,Old but very good game
15340,"Trust me,
When you fire this game up,
your little fuckin' nuts are gonna start quaking, buddy.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-YEAAAAAAA

15341,One of the most influential shooters of all time. What else can I say?

15346,Pretty epic
15347,"its good
"
15348,god help me
15349,is good
15350,"The game is still surprisingly fun and intuitive even after 20 years, and this is coming from someone who is playing it for the first time in 2020. The controls are still mostly comfortable, level design is creative, the enemies are surprisingly dangerous, and although the graphics are noticeably dated there is a kind of cheesy retro appeal to them, even if they aren't as impressive as they were back in the 90's. If you're looking for a good FPS game and have never tried this, or if you want to see where Valve began their mark in the gaming industry, than you can't go wrong with Half-Life. I give it a solid 5/5."
15351,lemme tell you something its a fucking master peice
15352,"Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.

15358,"A true classic of gaming. A little rough around the edges due to it's age, but generally everything about Half Life is still incredible all these years later."
15359,"nostalgia
and my favorite game CSGO wouldn't be here without it."
15360,although i had to cheat some to pass some levels overall its a good and fun game
15361,"Instant Classic, Couldn't stop playing it or thinking about it"
15362,Better than Half Life 2
15363,"its good,"
15364,It's ok
15365,Game good
15366,"good
"
15367,"Its been like 6 months after I finished the game, Nothing has changed, it's still one of the best games of all time."
15368,the only problem i have with this game is that I can't finish it in one day.
15369,Best game ever play it NOW
15370,"Sickest speedrun game I've ever played, no cap. My face when suitman looks at me and I go ""bruh"" and he walks away, epic. Got it in that one ValvE Super Sale where all the games were like $11 bucks, and HL1 is definitely worth that price, so it's nice I got everything else too. Now Gordonman can bhop from one game into the next with relative ease. If you're gonna be playing with friends, get Sven Coop instead. If you're lookin to be the doomslayer of scientists, you've got your game. 11/5"
15371,"Very fun game. Although it is the original, how the game was meant to be played, I feel that the source or Black Mesa would have nicer graphics. Still fun game!"
15372,Game sucks.
15373,"This classic game was one of my first pc games and then console games. storyline is good, and while the graphics are certainly archaic by now it's still very enjoyable to play, FPS kinda game with a good story ftw
I'm not very good at reviews but re-playability is very important to me, i come back to games over and over and this game and its sequel are both very high on my list of faves."
15374,yes
15375,"Look Gordon, ropes!"
15376,Just a great game. Campaign goes for a while aswell which i loved
15377,I'm With The Science Team!
15378,Great start for the saga. A must!
15379,"holds up rly good even today ngl.its still better then 99% anime games KEKW

15380,"My brother played for the 5 hours, so I wouldn't know if it's good or not :D"
15381,Classic
15382,
15383,cool game
15384,reminds me of half-life 2 idk why
15385,"Played on hard. You will never have 5 minutes where your health is above 5HP.
This game will kick your ass again and again.

15388,"Download the original version, the source version is fucking garbage."
15389,"pretty lit, very nostalgic. glitchy in some spots but eh, its made in 1998 and the mechanics are super sick. love the story line"
15390,AAHHH  no  hello   do you know who ate all the doughnuts?  you will have to wait until after the test
15391,"Probably the most legendary game ever, without it CS, Gmod, HL2, and other source games couldn't have been possible. One of the best game ever"
15392,Still one of the best FPS games ever made!
15393,"amazing
"
15394,not the game i expected
15395,"call this game old and ""dead"" but this is very fun and addictive and the gun logic here is better than csgo logic(every time in csgo when you pull out the gun your character cocks the gun back) but sadly this game has a lack of direction and is hard to figure out on your own but that is just one bad thing the rest is amazing"
15396,yes
15397,yes

good game half life is the way to go"
15402,too short
15403,"Absolute classic.
21 years later it still holds up.
You owe it to yourself to play this game.

Half Life 2 may have better gameplay, but the original three by far have the better story and atmosphere.

A literal game changer."

15406,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
15407,You know its already good
15408,have you seen my coffee cup
15409,"Oooh, i get to be a contrarian! Yay!

In all seriousness, I would enjoy Half Life. I might enjoy it a lot... if not for the unintuitive level design and interaction.
I can't count the number of times I've lost my damn mind stepping onto something which looked safe, but wasn't (even though it seemed identical to another safe thing) and when I failed to reach a platform or latch onto a surface because I wasn't doing the right keyboard shuffle when I hit it.

When you get past all these little complaints... it just feels like a shooter game. Granted, it's enjoyable, but I don't see what's particularly special about it.
I'm sure it was really good for it's time, but it's probably like Star Wars or most cartoons: it's only truly enjoyable if you grew up with it, and I didn't. I heard there was a fan-based remake of this game, and I'm sure I'd love it to death. But not right now, my forehead is bruised from slamming it against the keyboard so many times."
15410,"pp big after playing,"
15411,It's good but not as good as the Half-Life fans claim it is.

15418,"first first person shooter with a story:great graphics for 90's (still good today)and 9,10 ai definetly recommended.(update) mp5 greanade not realistic still a very good game."

But still it was so much fun, and it's a great game.  I'd suggest buy the bundle if you wanna play through the Half-Life franchise, but if you just wanna play through this game then buy it separately.  But to be a real GAMER you must beat this game."
15451,"One of the best story driven game from the 90's I've played ever.
Really enjoyed playing it and would replay it over and over if it weren't for Garry's mod and the half life maps resized mod but the original is still worth paying."

15467,cool i guess
15468,"Classic game that should be played through in order to gain an understanding of the events before the 2nd game. Still holds up well today, so yes I would recommend this game to other players."
15469,"Half-life (symbol t1‚ÅÑ2) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value. The term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo, or how long stable atoms survive, radioactive decay. The term is also used more generally to characterize any type of exponential or non-exponential decay. For example, the medical sciences refer to the biological half-life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body. The converse of half-life is doubling time.

The original term, half-life period, dating to Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the principle in 1907, was shortened to half-life in the early 1950s.[1] Rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element's half-life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of radium to lead-206.

Half-life is constant over the lifetime of an exponentially decaying quantity, and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation. The accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half-lives elapsed."
15470,Half-Life is dope but I would recommend playing the Source version or Black Mesa instead of this one.
15471,sexy game
15472,timeless
15473,"Wisely done, Mr. Freeman. I will see you up ahead."
15474,I played this game bc of course i had to its Half Life come on and i gotta say its a retty fun game altho i do have a lot of problems with it but i still enjoy it all around the combat is fun yes but you will probably never run that low on any ammo and for the first 3d of the game there is this scary atmoshphere and the combat in general is fun altho the soliders are actually a bit annoying you'll probably be fighting them 50% of the time and there hitscan enemies which means if they see you they will hit you instantly and i feel like the guns dont really do much damage they do do some but ti doesnt loo like it they sure do feel powerful like the shotgun or magnum all of the guns have a nice punch but when your shooting the soliders you just shoot them till they die and keep doing it you cant really tell how much damage you've done and they can shoot fast which deplets your health fast and the AR which is pretty much the weapon you should use against them doesnt really work and bc they can kill you pretty fast i just main the crossbo and shotgun to dispose of them quickly but the rest is fine just a little problem i have and yeah it is a game from 1997 but the grapics area bit...janky and when outside of the Black Mesa complex the graphics really show there age i also really love the level design and atmosphere its top notch and you feel and think as Gordon Freeman bc you are and i think the devs did a good job at that the rst of the game is fine and fun i hated the zen level tho its the final level of the game. I enjoyed the game and i can see why people consider it one of the best pc games back then and one of the best games ever yeah I CAN SEE IT but i dont personally dont get me wrong fantastic game and i like the story and atmposhere but i have so many gripes that kinda just mess the game up a bit and nothing really blew me away maybe i expected too much for this game but i hear that Black Mesa fixes most of my problems but dont get me wrong i liked the game a lot and you should defintily get it and these problems are just m own problems and some people ive talked to didnt have issue with it but still great game definitly would reccomend.

15495,"So I bought a Valve pack a long time ago that came with counter strike AND left 4 dead 1 & 2 a while back, it also came with all the half life games which I didn't care for. Then just this past week I decided to give half life a real chance and started playing the first title.

I AM SHOCKED that this game came out in 1998, this game has so much depth, lore, and I can see why it has such a huge following. I imagine this game was a leading force in gaming in general, I can't even think of a game that would've been this good out in 1998, amazing amazing amazing. I'll be playing the rest now."

15499,"One of the very few games that stood up to the titans that were Quake and DOOM, Half-Life revolutionized storytelling in games and I'm so glad it did. The way the levels just connect seamlessly together is nothing short of groundbreaking for the time. Still a blast thanks to the modified ID Tech 2 engine."
15500,"Amazing game, I would recommend this to anyone who has either played, portal, portal 2, TF2 and Left 4 dead 2, really great game. I just love it a lot, the graphics still hold up so nicely today, enjoy!"

15509,"It's not too late to join the party! Play this if you haven't!

I really liked this legendary classic game. Most of my gaming experience has been with games released around 2010, and Half Life was a well needed breath of fresh air from what I'm used to. Good mysterious story, plenty of fun weapons to use, and it actually requires a minimum of brain power for the occasional puzzle. Also, unpopular opinion, but I love first person platforming and this game had little bit of that too. If you haven't played this yet, hop on it you'll have a blast. There's also just something so satisfying about old timey games like this one..."
15510,good game uhh multiplayer is boring as hell but fun campaign definitly not replayable fubnn

15520,"I started up this game not knowing what to expect. Wondering if it would be as good as everyone says it is or if it was just their nostalgia speaking. Within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, I was absolutely hooked and enthralled. I played every chance I got and beat it in 15 hours. Granted, 2.5 of those hours were just waiting in menus. 

TL;DR play it even in 2020."

15525,"This was my first play through EVER of this game and it's def one of the best games I have ever played. Even though the ending was spoiled for me, I really really enjoyed this game. If your procrastinating whether to get this game or not, you should give it a shot, the beginning is a little boring but as you venture on in the story it gets really fun. I made the mistake of playing this game with HD weapons, next time I'll play without them, make sure to not play without them if you have that option. Cheers!"

15531,"i've heard for years about this old classic, and honestly even with how old it is it's genuinely fun. the controls are nice, and the gameplay's enjoyable. i bought the entire franchise all at once so. i know it's gonna be great. love it to bits"
15532,"This was huge technical achievement admirable even to this day. It is a game the Valve learned to make games on. And it shows. And unlike other valve games, this aged very poorly and is held alive by mods.

Just unless you have something to prove, don't play this on hard.

Game broke on me completely, I have no weapons, all enemies and events got restarted and next area wont load. What a piece of ****.

+ genious enemy AI
+ masterful worlbuilding
+ Genuinly amazing interconnected ""levels"", they are rich, meaningfull and look like something, that could exist
+ Graphic design
+ Sound design

- Braindead friendly AI
- Shooting is **** and was hated even at the time. It is acceptable only thanks to decent sound design
- Even though your guns do almost no damage at all (8 headshots to kill a man), you are constantly swarmed by enemies
- The number of times you are forced to take damage is outright ridiculous
- Physics are and always were broken beyond belief, to the point of being considered a meme in the comunity
- Even though physics don't work well at all, huge part of the game is dependent on them and you may need to reload area, because crate you need to jump on to progress decided to climb a wall.
- When there are pickups on table or a low crate, forget about walking up to it. Hlaf of the time you will have to jump on top of it like an uncivilised ape to pick them up."

The game is nice and challenging and the variety of weapons is nice, however there are a few times were the game pulled a fast one and I either died or lost a lot of health. But in all honesty, the game is pretty good.9/10, would recomend."
15553,This is the Grandfather of most FPS games! A must-have if ever there was one.

15559,The game may get a bit frustrating at times but it is a legendary title in first person shooters and video games as a whole. It is such a journey to enter this time capsule of the ninties and is a lot of fun to this day!
15560,"An engaging and fun game, a certified classic with ingenious level design and game-play. Definitely in my opinion, one of the best games of all time.

100% recommend to anyone looking for a captivating puzzle game, it's action packed and feels great to play despite the age of the game."
15561,"good game, i really enjoyed playing this (or the WON version since i only played like the 1st chapter of the steam version)."
15562,Love it
15563,"Half-Life is an absolute classic. It's right up there with Doom, Quake and Blood as one of the most influential FPS games ever made. Half-Life 2 (and Half-Life: Alyx!) would go on to continue Half-Life's legacy of innovation.  

That being said, it's got some 90s jank, for sure. Maybe I'm just bad at the game, but I get killed by doors more often than I'd like to admit, and some scripting sequences have a tendency to kill me too LOL. I won't even talk about how jank ladders are...

"
15564,"Although I never played Half-Life when it first came out, I still find this game to be pretty darn appealing. Although it's an old school first-person, shooter, it manages to hold up for the most part. If you are a fan of sci-fi/horror you will more than likely appreciate this game. 

I find the controls are for the most part fluid. It very much reminds me of Doom controls in terms of how speedy your character moves around the environment. That being said, the most frustrating part of this game also include the controls in terms of the jumping mechanics and especially going up and down ladders. Despite these flaws, I was still able to obtain much enjoyment from the game.

The enemies in this game are pretty basic sci-fi horror tropes but they do provide a little bit of variety. Being a fairly old game, it doesn't feel incredibly intoxicating when you kill your enemies but despite how old it is, it still provides some pleasure when killing the various foes you encounter throughout your journey.

All in all, I loved the game's story-concept and most of the gameplay. Although I think it would be difficult for younger gamers to appreciate the old-school look and mechanics of the game, it can, with time, still be appreciated as the masterpiece it was and still is."
15565,One of the best fps games I've played!
15566,wow. just.. wow. this is an amazing game. like... wow...
15567,this is a good game.
15568,Just a classic innit.
15569,Set a new standard for FPS games that is still being replicated today. Wayyyyyy better than Halo which I grew up on.
15570,"Not gonna lie, haven't played this game as a kid hence I don't have any nostalgia factor towards it.
As a huge FPS fan I loved this game. Gameplay is great, fighting is in my opinion well balanced and umm, it has WASD as a default configuration.

First.

Ever.

Although Quake was the first true 3D game, Half-Life was the first FPS that we know today - weapon to the right, hand to the left of the keyboard."
15571,whole life
15572,"Played for first time on story mode, but it very good for that year."
15573,I loved playing this as it was exciting and fun. Some of the sections are a bit tedious but this is outweighed by the many highlights.
15574,What can I say about this masterpiece? How can I even find the words to describe it? When it was first released I was 14 years old. Now I am 36 years old and still playing. Playing Half Life. It's like travelling back to my youth. And the experience is the same or even better. Felt like a masterpiece back in the days. Still feels like a masterpiece nowadays.
15575,"This game does not hold up as well as I'd hoped. It was fun for the first few hours, like, 7/10 kinds of fun. Nothing remarkable, but not bad either. Then it got to the point where nearly every room is some sort of trap, puzzle, or platforming segment designed in a way that will kill you before you can possibly think or react appropriately to avoid it, making the entire experience feel like a series of cheap deaths, trial and error, and the occasional reference to a walkthrough. I'm sure some folks will write me off as just being bad at the game, or being too stupid to comprehend how amazing it is for a game that came out in 1998, and make other such excuses to invalidate my opinion. I've played more than enough old games to know what I'm talking about. If I gave it some more effort and gave it a second playthrough, then sure, maybe I'd end up loving it, it's happened before. But much like other important games from the 90's, this one takes a tremendous amount of effort to have fun with. I respect this game for what innovations it brought to the table, but the number of times I groaned and said ""Fuck I hate this game"" while playing it started to add up to the point I can't heartily recommend it to newcomers without adding a thick air of caution. It's hard in a bad way. The kind of way that turns a three hour game into a ten hour game for the first playthrough."
15576,"It's Half Life.
Do I need to say more?"
15577,"good

15578,DON'T SHOOT! I'm with the science team.
15579,yhalfe l;ife
15580,"Very addicting, sometimes it can make you rage, but it is really fun! I'm almost finished the game- and I'm excited to see the end! It is pretty gory and terrifying tho- xD"
15581,"Half-Life is a good experience and a great history lesson. The innovations it presents are taken for granted now (Barring needlessly minute AI programming that the player will likely never see in-game, such as programmed scents). The game is fun but definitely suffers from the poor shooting mechanics of Goldsrc (That later carried over to Source games). Guns feel floaty and non-impactful, some of the puzzles can be annoying. enemy AI is well-designed but fairly simplistic, and the difficulty is very inconsistent from moment-to-moment. There are definitely things that die-hard fans will defend as essential pieces of the experience, but to the average gamer they are simply annoyances.

Half-Life is an important part of FPS history, and that's where it's main value lies now, but it is still [i]fun[/i], even if that fun is at times bogged down by frustrating level design or mechanics. The fast paced, run and gun gameplay is addictive, and the weapons are fun to use and experiment with. The story and moment-to-moment scenes of interacting with the Black Mesa staff are enjoyable. The dialogue is humorous and the game knows when to be terrifying when it needs to. 

All in all I would recommend playing through it on medium difficulty and understanding the hype. If you're really interested in Half-Life, Black Mesa is a much more enjoyable experience but it would be wise to experience the original first. The Opposing Force expansion greatly improves on many aspects of this game by streamlining the experience and adding many more interesting weapons while cutting out the crap that plagued the first game. If you enjoy this title, I strongly recommend that one. 

4/5, a piece of history that has not aged well in many parts, but despite that, holds up strongly for pure fun factor."
15582,Good game but graphix are kinda bad...plus the title's chemistry reference is unnecessary. Please consider changing the name of the series for the next installment because the current one is very triggering.
15583,"Very fun, play on hard difficulty for a real challenge"
15584,it's a video game
15585,"Half-Life is indeed a masterpiece I've thoroughly enjoyed this classic, even by today's standards, I would recommend"
15586,freeman you fool
15587,"play this, it's fun . don't play like you're doom guy cuz you'll just get killed a lot and not have fun. play the game like every fight is a puzzle, use your guns like they're utilities first, and weapons second. use all of your weapons. remember to use your bombs and just remember, Gordan Freeman isn't a trained soldier, he's a scientist. you should rarely jump in guns blazing."
15588,"For the most part the game is fun but usually half-life has a lot of bugs. For me, I've found head-crabs that glitch through walls and the boss in the chapter, Power Up has a glitch that makes it wall hack for some reason. But despite being a sometimes buggy game i'd rate it being a 10/10."
15589,The best game ive ever played.
15590,enjoying this after 22 years in vr! just amazing!

this game is ok, not as good as half Life 2, but it was out in 1998, windows xp was not even out back then, 
this game (probably) run on windows 98 on launch, so it is really unfair to compere it to Half life 2,
for it's time it is impressive game.

15623,"Total classic. Story-line is amazing. The music enhances the whole experience by a lot and I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good run-n-shoot fuck shit up (screw stuff up) game. The puzzles are crafted really well and still holds up to this very day as one of the best FPS games ever. Avoid the Source port version of the game if you can, and if you want a graphically better experience, pick up Black Mesa.

[b] If you're having issues with the music cutting out, download the Half-Life soundtrack from the Store page. [/b]"

15625,yes
15626,its a fun game to play when you wanna get into a fun story game. the only problems is how difficult it can get some times having to save kill something save kill something move and save ext. other  then that its a fun game and i highly recommend playing it before half life 2 and alyx.

I now have to buy the game all over again and they killed the original so it does not work,  
(aka so in all actuality, they stole the game back from me)

Portal is way better"
15676,"One of the best games of the 90s that launched Valve into the current juggernaut that's taking mine and your money to this very day. This will forever be one of my personal favorites up there with its sequel.

You're immediately placed in the role of a guy running late for his job. Instead of hurrying you into the action like other shooters preceding it, Half-Life starts with a slow tram ride intro that masterfully sets the scene and takes you into the heart of this mysterious underground research lab, Black Mesa, which is something akin to Area 51.

You'll pass through security checkpoints, get suited up, maybe blow up a casserole, and take in the atmosphere this game creates around you, before putting you in a frantic escape situation when your experiment goes awry.

Valve really wanted to make the game feel like a continuous narrative, where you never leave the POV of your character for cutscenes, mission breaks, etc. Each area connects directly from the previous, making Half-Life feel like it has a sprawling contiguous map, even though short loading screens help hide the map breaks.

The graphics definitely look like a product of 1998. You'll encounter flappy muppet mouthed scientists and security guards all throughout the facility, all speaking in the same couple of voices. Valve is no stranger to overusing the same few skins and voice actors, and that is a trend that carries over into Half-Life 2.

Enemy AI was groundbreaking for the time. Marines can dynamically coordinate with each other and their tactics are not easy to predict. There's a wide variety of enemies here ranging from your basic alien fauna, the enslaved vortigaunts and alien grunts, the US marines sent in to ""hush up"" the situation, and a course, zombies.

Though NPCs are mostly generic, there is one character you'll notice ""observing"" your progress from time to time. It's the enigmatic GMan, whose purpose in all this remains unexplained to this day.

Towards the end of the game you are teleported to a parallel world known as Xen where the final confrontation takes place, and many people rightfully recognize it as the most poorly aged and out of place portion of the game. There are a few sections that could've been trimmed (namely the On a Rail chapter) but overall the game is very well paced and it's clear Gaben and crew knew how to keep the player interested and pushing forward. 

This is a classic shooter and you owe it to yourself to play it at least once. It works flawlessly on modern systems. If you absolutely can't get past the graphics, look up Black Mesa which is an unofficial remake and does a pretty good job of what it sets out to do, though it's no replacement for the original."
15677,fun classic

If you're into modding, this game has thousands of mods out, and Valve even provides the tools to make your own. It's worth a buy, and you'll find it to be a staple in your steam library. The multiplayer, while basic, is fast paced and fun. The ultimate 90s FPS."
15703,"I refuse to go another step!


"
15704,pretty good
15705,fun for bhopping
15706,"timeless masterpiece, no more words needed."
15707,"Now, to be honest, I do have a few nitpicks with some bugs, and I don't adore the game yet (I say yet because I've played through it once and haven't modded it), but I think this is a must-play regardless. Gameplay is insanely fun, the story is really intriguing especially when you get deep into it, looks great despite its age, some intelligent puzzles, great boss fights, a vast amount of enemies, what else could you ask for???

Puzzles are very crafty, but I find some of them to be either buggy or have some stupid way of figuring out the solution.

For gameplay, there is a varied way of approaching fights, but for the most part the game is pretty much linear (which is okay), however once you get to Xen shit goes baller with the boost jump, platforming, and slew of new enemies, which help to really vary the gameplay!

Yes, it looks outdated, but I think it's great looking for the style. That's also why Black Mesa exists.

Characters are charming, especially the scientists which are hilarious, and add more to the game than you'd think.

This game is a 9.5/10 for me. It has so much to it despite a few annoying bugs, and while you may not love it at first, I bet if you play it more than once it'll grow on you"
15708,"It's a fun classic, play it."
15709,"Fucking awful game, do not buy"
15710,"Good game. After 56 hours of dying repeatedly, I think I've noticed that the difficult mode is exactly what it says it is. I don't recommend that you play on the difficult mode, unless you want to smash your keyboard. As long as you stick with the normal difficulty the game should be fine.
Don't smash your keyboard friends, stick with the normal mode and have a good time."
15711,good
15712,"Half-Life is a great game. Easily one of my favorite games of all time and I only started playing it this year. The main game is great. I love running through the halls of the Black Mesa Research Facility and blasting aliens and HECU grunts. The only parts of the game I could really do without are On A Rail and the majority of Interloper. Xen in general was kind of an anticlimactic disappointment after the downright amazing game before it. When you start playing Xen, you wish you were back in the Black Mesa Facility and that feeling never goes away even after you defeat Nihilanth. Speaking of Nihilanth, I found the fight to be way too easy. Nihilanth does next to nothing except for use cheap attacks that can kill you even if you're at full health. I would've preferred a much more interesting fight for a final boss but when it was over, there was still a great sense of accomplishment. Everything before Xen is great but Xen itself is mediocre. I love this game to death and the online multiplayer adds to that. The multiplayer is very fun and I'm online most days due to the multiplayer. I've replayed the campaign for a second time partially and I'm loving it all over again. Valve made an excellent product when they released Half-Life. It's just too much fun to stay away from for long.

In short, 8.5/10 would highly recommend regardless of whether or not it's on sale. I'd say $10.00 is way too low for Half-Life. I would've gladly paid more for it."
15713,one of the games of all time
15714,"Literally played this game that I've already beat on the Source version just to check out the amazing new feature of being able to exit back to the main menu while in the singleplayer campaign. Best update ever, would spend ¬£7.19 again just to exit out to the main menu."
15715,"awsome game
"
15716,GOAT
15717,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said? One of the greatest singleplayer FPS of all time. A timeless classic that I thoroughly enjoy playing through once a year. Playing smart in this game makes you feel like an actual theoretical physicist, and it encourages you to do so at many points. Fantastic game all around 10/10"
15718,this a good game  well is a clasic but is so good you cant fight with zombies soldiers and aliens and scientist xD and secuirity guards well you have a lot of guns just buy it is so good
15719,"So, it's Half-Life. It's a great game and everything, but I don't think so. Long, annoying puzzles are most of this game, and I LIKE puzzles! But having to spend 15 minutes just to run over to some stupid generator and back is NOT fun. I think the shooting kinda sucks. Even though the aiming is fine, it's just not satisfying to kill enemies. (Or scientists.)"
15720,"Unbroken (mostly) first person narrative that's still impressive today.
Gun play can be a bit weak but its still very technically sound.
It's worth playing If you're at all interested in the development of FPS games. 
"
15721,"This game is in my favorites section.

Such a classic. This is a FPS where no one holds your hand to show you what you have to do and where is the next checkpoint, but instead, is built in such a way where you will be able to figure it out yourself. 

It's a must if you want to understand the history of FPS video games. 

Sadly, Half Life 2 is nowhere near as good as Half Life 1."
15722,good game
15723,"this game is a HUGE part of my childhood, and i love it.

but i mean, everybody knows half life, this review is kind a useless."
15724,It's hell but it's good.
15725,good game
15726,Don't go crabbing.
15727,HELLO GORDON
15728,gdfr5
15729,it started off a a Quake mod and then evolved to become a new standered in gaming and storytelling in games. it is a very addictive game. the only major drawback is that sometimes it wont fully close when im done so it makes it look like i have more hours on than i do. i am only about halfway through the game and i havent even gotten to the expansions yet. theres also a cool little multiplayer on here i play every now and again. yeah it hasnt aged the best graphicly (most early 3D games havent but i have a soft spot for them anyway) but still its a must play for a reason. it is impressive for the time and still kinda impressive today. yeah theres a lot of loading zones but still its a fun romp for what its worth. i got the base game and the 2 expansions for like $14 so i cant really complain. its worth the money (i may be a bit biased as i do quite enjoy games like Doom and Duke and stuff though) if you like the second game you will like this game. even so theres still Black Mesa if you want a slightly different expierence.
15730,Un clasico de los buenos.
15731,fuck
15732,man free
15733,yes it gud
15734,"First keep in mind I played through on the hardest difficulty, maybe the normal difficulty fixes some parts of the game idk.I really REALLY wanna give this game a positive review, the gameplay is superb the gun play is challenging and interactive. The ammo and health pickups aren't scarce, but they certainly aren't plentiful which makes the constant search for said ammo and health feel less like a chore. The enemy designs are amazing, each one makes noises and looks completely different from one another making it easy to pick out which enemies your fighting. but...  but this is not enough to make up for huge flaws. Firstly, several enemies are just down right mean to the player. Not in their difficulty, but in their placement. I thought most enemies were fine, those invisible guys are such an un-fun enemy. They have the health of a military soldier, they are invisible, they are very quick, and they fire fast guns that deal massive damage. most areas of this game were forgettable at worst, but the fucking minefield bullshit was some complete dogshit. the mines trigger-boxes‚Ñ¢ were larger than they should have been and there is no way to find where they are without wasting 50 bullets on shooting the ground. The mines do not have a different coloring, they do not make noise when you get near them, they just explode. You end up wasting your, as I stated earlier, valuable ammo or just have to trial and error it with saving and loading. But the biggest problem by a million miles is how fucking glitch prone this game is. I get it, its old and i'm about to play Black Mesa so hopefully i'll have a better time there. Anyway I cant explain how many fucking game breaking glitches I got during my playtime. I don't want to spoil anything here so if you want to know the ones I remember or have a convo, we can do it in the comments. Anyway I feel bad about the rating but its how I feel.5/10, just disappointing given its god status."
15735,This is one of the best video games I have ever played.
15736,GOLD!
15737,despite having 1998 graphics this game still manages to scare the shit out of me

15744,"This game shows how far games have come.Sure, it was defining for its own era, but it shows its age (crosshairs, greased-roller skate movement, etc.). It can stir up some nostalgia, but even so sometimes it's just best to let memories be memories."
15745,"This game is a classic and a must. Unfortunately the graphics is quite outdated but luckily Black Mesa has just been released and it is basically the enhanced modern version of this game, so get that one instead."
15746,good game
15747,"A classic PC game from the 90's, get past the graphics, because this game is an experience that I highly recommend all PC gamers play through once"

15755,Gud Game.
15756,classic game good
15757,Has a much better combat flow than the sequel.
15758,While the graphics may be dated (get Black Mesa if they bother you too much) god is the gameplay and story so FUCKING good. One of the best singleplayer games I've ever played (first would be Borderlands 2 ;)).
15759,good
15760,"This is one of the few games I can come back to over, and over, and over again and just never get sick of. The way this game is paced, the way the intensity builds up throughout the course of the campaign is just so satisfying. And the soundtrack just rocks, with each replay I'm always looking forward to the next set-piece and accompanying banger. Half-Life is a classic, and one of the best shooters ever made."
15761,"One of my favorite games of all time
this is just my opinion but I prefer it over the second one"
15762,"Even 22 years after it's initial release, the game still holds up and I would cosider it a must play, even just to experience this legendary game for once in your life. 
The gameplay itself and the atmosphere are still great, and the only negatives are the awkward platforming, some frustrating bosses, and obviously that the graphics haven't aged well. 

If you can live with the outdated graphics, there is nothing that can hold you back from playing this.
Otherwise the Black Mesa remake is supposed to be great."
15763,good game
15764,Gordon! its not shutting down!
15765,yes
15766,Very good
15767,When Half-Life 3?
15768,"This game is super close to being a masterpiece. I always put off buying and playing half life for a long time. A few months ago i bought all of them and i was blown away. The game is 22 years old but doesnt feel very clunky or outdated. The gameplay requires a decent amount of skill and strategy because of the games difficulty. The story is well made and the DLC expands on it a lot as well. Sadly the ending isnt nearly as cohesive as the rest of the game. Levels are uninteresting, bland and longer than needed. If you enjoy single player FPS games this should 100% be in your library."
15769,the game has been interesting as i was not born in the 1980 but still this is a great game that has been even more popular with hlvrai
15770,It was good
15771,i liked the part where you blow up barneys stupid low poly face with a shotgun
15772,Its good
15773,Just a masterpiece of its time. Its a shame valve isnt so interested in continuing the series :(
15774,Why do we have to wear these ridiculous ties?!
15775,Fun but frustrating at times.
15776,im with the science team
15777,"This is a completely revolutionary fps for the time, but yes it has aged quite a bit. Firstly the graphics aren't to hot and the bullets feel kind of weird. Also I heard that valve won a prize for making the smallest aiming reticle possible. And while I'm sure some of this sounds bad if your willing to look past these issues you got a great game. The story is captivating except for around the middle were it feels like your kind of just going down a never ending tunnel of tasks. But the first 6 and the last 4 chapters are awesome because there able to tell so much story without any crazy cutscenes. And the selection of weapons are out standing for the time considering each gun has there pros and cons. And there are multiple ways of going after and enemy and you kind of pick your own play style. The world is massive and lively the story (for the most part) is stellar the shooting and graphics are kind of meh but it's all worth it. Definitly reccomend this game to a person willing to let go of issues like un modern graphics and game design to experience a classic gem valve has made changing PC fps for ever."
15778,"its uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yea 
its a game"
15779,"A MASTERPIECE. I only got this game so I would know the story before playing half life 2. I haven't played 2 yet, but MAN has it got a high bar now would buy for 60 dollars!"
15780,"Okay, so we all know about Half-Life. Being Valve's debut title and setting the standard for FPS games of today.
But I'll blab about it anyway.

Dr. Gordon Freeman: Theoretical Physicist, is late for work at Black Mesa; a research facility that specializes in portal technology. After donning his HEV (Hazardous EnVironment) suit, He proceeds to Anomalous Materials to preform an experiment with his fellow scientists; where they accidentally cause a resonance cascade, which rips open a portal to Xen: A dimension home to a bunch of aliens that start pouring in, leaving the staff and Gordon to defend themselves.

Things get worse when the HECU (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) arrive. They're the military's cleanup crew you see? But not only are they're here to exterminate the aliens, But also terminate anyone associated with the project to prevent public panic, Their primary target: Freeman himself.

So now we got the scientists and security team left helpless, the aliens invading Earth, The HECU trying to eliminate both factions, and Gordon is stuck in the middle initially trying to escape the facility, then finding the lambda team to contain the situation, finally heading to Xen to end the invasion once and for all.

But first he needs to make his way through the damaged facility, use an old rail system, traverse an abandoned waste disposal plant, then head to the surface where the HECU are waiting for him. Luckily for Gordon despite being a science guy, He's pretty handy with guns, Loads of guns. Plus a crowbar.

Now as for the gameplay, it's what you expect: You shoot things, reload if needed, gather ammo and health, repeat. But you also do some platforming here and there as well as vent-crawling. However despite it being influential story-wise the game itself is kinda mediocre, It's not godawful, only serviceable. For example the machine gun (either an MP5 or M4 with the HD pack turned on) is an absolute bullet hose, where the redeeming factor is its grenade launcher. not all guns are bad mind you, but that's the one people tend to bring up. Moving on, you can have NPCs follow you (scientists to open doors with eye-scanners and security guards to aid you in combat) albeit the AI is a bit derpy.

Finally there's the HEV suit, at a glance it's just a fancy looking hazmat suit, but it's a fancy looking hazmat suit that's awesome! Not only does it administer morphine when at critical health to keep you going, it can be used to traverse unsafe locations of course, but also act as an armor of sorts against the many enemies you come across. It even comes with a flashlight!

While Half-Life is a bit slow in the beginning where it might turn some people off and some parts can be frustrating to the point of save-scumming, It's still playable and being updated to this day along with its expansion packs, but I'll cover those later. 

In conclusion, Mr.Freeman: Run. Think. Shoot. Live."

There are definitely a couple times when I got stuck, but the game is great at making it clear what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go. That being said there is a lot of trial and error (though I did my first run ever at medium difficulty) and you might die a lot. Still, a super fun and interesting game!"

15842,if you're just getting into pc gaming and have already completed portal i absolutely recommend this as your first fps. don't be afraid to use a walkthrough though (i recommend bigmacdavis)
15843,"It is a very fun action packed game 10/10 would recommend
"
15844,"accidentally left game on after improperly closing game. Actual play time as of writing: ~30 mins. Great and balanced game, like the movement style. This should be a parkour game."
15845,The cake is real!
15846,very gud
15847,it's ok
15848,aooga
15849,Classic game...  Replay quality is about as high as it gets.

15852,yes

15854,its half life
15855,What else is there to say? A legendary game.
15856,Beat all of Half Life games except newest one; enjoyed every moment. This one...first one is probably my favorite.

15861,"It lives up to its reputation. If you aren't a graphics snob then I imagine you will enjoy. It is of course dated, but is still a lot of fun."
15862,i loved it! i downloaded it while it was free!
15863,Derp
15864,fun... but play black mesa its better
15865,i mean its alright i guess
15866,its ok
15867,When I was a kid I bought this game for my PS2 and it didn't work. When I went to return it there were no other games I could buy cuz I didn't have a lot of money and I had just moved. I got sad because I just moved and I had no friends so all I did was play video games. I realized that I didn't have anything that made me really happy and I cried. The story is good tho
15868,great fun but kinda criptik
15869,Its just a great game. Play for a good time. :)
15870,its half-life
15871,"The game might be old but its for sure a 10/10. i finished it 1 time and currently downloading it as im writing this review to play it again. the expansion packs are also good since they give you a perspective of the event from all sides (except the aliens of course). I bought all the half life games (except Alyx) when it was on sale for a pretty cheap price and i dont regret it. if you arent sure if you wanna play it just wait until a sale or something,nonetheless theres a reason people call the half life series the as the best. The half life series has a 10/10 story and for me personally is totally worth buying."
15872,1998 game but still a good game.
15873,this is one of the most influential games ever just buy the damn thing. 8/10
15874,"This game STILL influences over 20 years later and is STILL one of my top 10 games I've ever played. This review is for those who wonder whether they should play this post-2020. 

The one thing that keeps me coming back to Half Life time and time again is the AI and  level design. This game doesn't have cut scenes but instead puts you into dire situations and in unconventional environments (gun fight while descending a cliff). You are almost always on the brink of death and forced to think about how you can use your environment and current ammo to your advantage. This game celebrates creativity and never has you wondering ""will the game let me do this?"" instead the game says ""go for it"". For example... imagine this scene which represents only 30 seconds of gameplay:

I am out of heavy ammo, low on health, and just got out of combat. I cut a turn and see the path ahead is the top of a dam. It looks like I will need to cross it. To the right of that dam is a huge body of water and a lighthouse stands in the middle of it. I start sprinting along the top of the dam to get to the other side. When I reach the center, I hear what sounds like a helicopter's blades. Suddenly a helicopter appears over the horizon. Helicopters, in this game, don't go down easy and I currently don't have the means to destroy it. The helicopter begins shooting at me. The first bullets miss and land 10 ft in front of me but the trail of bullets quickly climb towards me. I'm wide open and completely exposed. In panic, I make a sharp right and dive 200ft off the dam into the water to escape the gunfire. The gravity of the fall puts me several feet underwater and I hear something snarling down here. I look down to see a piranha/shark-like creature with jaws open wide and coming at me fast. At the same time, the helicopter's bullets begin to rain down from above. The bullets are slowed down slightly by the water but I still get hit. I start swimming as quickly as possible to the lighthouse and see a ladder I can climb. I get bit by the shark-like creature as I climb up the ladder. Finally I find myself in a control room with a big red button where I can catch my breath. The helicopter circles the lighthouse and manages to hit me through some windows, I quickly push the red button and hear something underwater opening. Which means, now I'll need to go back underwater and face the shark/dodge the helicopter to find that open hatch in order to escape. I dive back into the water.

And that's just 30 seconds of gameplay. You could approach that same situation in a number of different ways, this is just how I experienced it. That's how the whole game is. It's a thrill ride from start to finish. Go in blind, don't look up anything online for help and experience this game fresh. I wish I could go back and experience this one again for the first time."
15875,half lif
15876,"This is old epic game
"
15877,e
15878,I first played Half-Life as a demo that came with a SoundBlaster PCI512.  I played it on a Pentium with no 3D acceleration.  It was awesome then and it's still awesome now.  It's one of my go-to rainy day replays.
15879,i love half life
15880,"This game can be a little confusing but if you play this game, on its own its actually pretty fun and you'll probably spend hours playing it without realizing it."
15881,great game i totally recommend playing it
15882,"VERY VERY fun, great lore and story, if you take your time and not run and gun, you can really hear different views and you can only learn about certain event by just listening to to scientists, guards, and soldiers. Overall a AMAZING game
"
15883,I WISH VALVE COULD COUNT TO 3
15884,best
15885,It doesn't need explaining to know how legendary this game is.
15886,"i really like how the scientists here were almost killed but will say ""i seem to be seriously wounded""

b r u h"
15887,"scientist ''OH THANK GOD I'M SAVED'' BAM gets shot, me backs away"
15888,This still stands the test of time. It genuinely deserves the hype it has been given. I would thoroughly recommend this game to novice and seasoned gamers alike.
15889,"it's the original half life, nothing else needs to be said."
15890,"Played this since I was 7 or 8 years old
that's when I created my Steam Account
Didn't even have a store back then
This game is a classic though, 
I used to play half life 2 over and over
But I went back and got into speedrunning on half life 1
And I discovered the sheer replayabilty 
involved in developing intricate techniques and skills
If you lean against walls or strafe into them while running forward
You gain increased speed
Trip mines can be used as steps to climb
grenades once cooked in your hand
When traveling fast enough, usually in air
The grenade will explode behind you
Allowing gaps to debridge themselves
The charged gauss gun or beam rifle
Can propel you through the air
It shoots through walls and it also ricochet off angles
Grenades and explosives make enemies flee
Use this often to by pass or kill hit scan attack style enemies
Break line of sight, but remember enemies will flank you
Or flush you out of cover with grenades and such
The AI is smarter than other AI made in games today
It's made for the soul purpose of murdering you
That's why the scientists if you hold E they will inject you with morphine
Healing damage when it's under a certain threshold
You also need to lead idiots around who will forget to follow you
If you are an asshole and move too fast
Stop friendlies and clear the area before letting them re follow you
Two stlyes of friendly NPC's exist, ones a walking medkit
 and the other can deal nice damage
But they are very vulnerable and brave to a fault
The rest is a mystery that I will not reveal because it would ruin it
You really should just go in blind
The game has a story that tells itself through the gameplay
There are no cutscenes
Your character stays silent
Allows you to put yourself in their shoes
Even though Gordon is a genius
And he has radical political views about
Sustaining the ""Free Market establishment"" 
Whatever that means, child labor probably
But his Admin disagrees and there's a conflict
That's the story using euphemisms
Just remember to spam E on that microwaved casserole
It must explode in order to piss off that Magnusson device
Should be to the right when you go to put on your work attire
Oh and you start out on the tram to work, already late as fuck
And it's exam day and your making everyone look bad
They already look bad... Black Mesa is the most problematic
 of all the research facilities!.
According to that Administrator I was talking about
And yes he's there, watching you work, every step of the way
Not only that, he pays you to flip switches and press buttons
So what are you waiting for? Get out of here S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
They are waiting for you Gordon... In the test chamber..."
15891,wish it could be free again so i can play with my friends :/
15892,"suck a good game
"
15893,Good game. Needs more gin.
15894,"Despite being over 20 years old, Half Life's story and combat mechanics make it well worth playing."
15895,fun
15896,cold classic! its 22 years old and play with friends play any diffculty! and sorry for bad spelling. and i like it so thanks valve for making this game!
15897,"[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP_rkV7BtQ8]Mmmm yes... they dont do games like that anymore. 
(YT link)[/URL]"
15898,"This blew my mind back in the day. I won't pretend it's aged flawlessly, but it's still a hell of a game."
15899,"yes it good game
"
15900,"Good morning, Freeman!"
15901,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER CREATED.
15902,"Do not know what the hype is about, Feels like trash to play. just because it was good when it came does not mean it holds up in this day and age. overall disappointed."
15903,its a fun game and is kinda hard I would play it if I were you
15904,"Yup, it's a video game."
15905,"Good game, never finished it."
15906,Better than the second imo. At times it feels like a campy b movie and that's why it's great. Controls have definitely aged though.
15907,Really good action sequence and great story
15908,game breaks to much for me to enjoy
15909,"It's good, it's still worth playing."
15910,My Childhood game. Nostalgia 10/10 <3
15911,"This game is incredible, has wonderful walkthroughs, amazing gameplay, it‚Äôs worth it! The only downside is the graphics, but it‚Äôs still a legendary game!"
15912,"Game is fun
But man i suck at this game"
15913,I love this game.
15914,"Crowbar

Would recommend 10/10"
15915,"It's mindblowing how well this game holds up. The graphics and mapping are dated, but the gameplay and world building is on par with modern games.

The absolute best thing about Half Life is how perfectly well it runs. Normally you'd need an emulator or mess around with some files to get older games running, but Half Life runs perfectly fine. A rarity for retro shooters."
15916,"wow even on easy mode it still feels like hard mode, at least as a first play through. There's a run and crouch movement (where's walking), zero room for a mistake, marines like to say go f yourself with their rifle frag grenades often, to many glitch spots where you get stuck and your forced to kill yourself, and target sight so tiny that you'll be wasting ammo often. Game is long so I enjoyed that and I've heard 2 is better anyways. Here I thought dark souls was hard, boy was I wrong."
15917,"Idk what I can say that hasn't been said. One of the most important, and now historical FPS titles."
15918,"This is the best FPS of all time, And my favorite game of all time, Play it to the end, Play Team Fortress Classic, Play Deathmatch Classic, Play the expansions, Hell, PLAY RICOCHET!"
15919,steam is obv run by autistic retards
15920,goat simulator and gmod!!!!
15921,gud gam
15922,"This game might be old, but it is still great."
15923,"Next generation graphics.

10/10."
15924,"Fun and constantly exciting, there are lots of ways to enter and interact with combat making you feel free but isolated at the same time!"
15925,xen kinda sucks but the rest of it is ok
15926,"I am biased for Half-life. So old so many fun hours spent.
Had this before steam existed and bought it again to have it in my library."
15927,nike
15928,wow!
15929,good game to play casually and even better game to speedrun.
15930,it was fun to kill things
15931,fun game
15932,still holds up although it feels like you're running of wet floors all the time.
15933,yes

15935,"TLDR:  Rail-shooter that once set a standard and is now showing its age.

I remember when Half-Life spilled onto the scene twenty years ago. At the time, people were still arguing the supremacy of Quake vs Duke Nukem vs Doom for the king of the FPS heap. Then in stumbled a new game, sometimes dubbed the ""thinking man's FPS"" and the genre was never the same again.

I got it on Steam mostly on the nostalgia factor; I sank so many hours into it back in the day I wanted to see if still measured up. Taken in isolation and compared to the games of its day, I think it did all right ... but as one would expect it has ceded ground to newer and better shooters since then.

Half-Life is the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist at Black Mesa, a top-secret research facility where scientists are monkeying with stuff they shouldn't be. As usual, that kind of nosiness doesn't end well. A dimensional gateway opens, flooding the facility with all kinds of beasts and it's then up to the player to help Freeman save the day. You'll find a crowbar to defend yourself, then plenty of other guns and goodies along the way. Eventually, the military will show up to rescue everyone ... I mean, ""rescue"" everyone and things get more complex.

Gameplay is straightforward, with a default WASD/mouse movement scheme, L/R clicks to attack and alternate attack. The controls are ... adequate. Certain objects--such as wheels and switches--can be interacted with to open doors, raise or lower water levels, move cranes out of the way of rail tracks, etc. The game pretty much has one path you can follow so if you find yourself unable to advance, you'll have to look for some of these items. Some advancement requires puzzle solving; for example, the Blast Pit requires the player to find and turn on the oxygen and fuel lines to fire a test rocket--though to get to those, you have to sneak past a blind but very powerful mob that can basically one-shot you. Just don't make a sound. Generally speaking, the puzzles add depth and tension to the game, though some are aggravating. Far too many points in the game require pinpoint running and jumping and I'm glad that (aside from platformers) modern games have largely left that trope in the dirt.

Enemies are varied and have their own behaviors. The most basic alien animals will simply charge. Humans will fire and seek cover. Some of the more exotic aliens present their own challenges. A handful of big ones are all but bulletproof, forcing you to find other ways to evade or defeat them.

The game's ambiance is pretty decent; before the disaster you'll see scientists and security going about their daily tasks, discussing experiments and other happenings at Black Mesa. After, you'll find their bodies, or see them getting attacked and eaten. Those that live often offer to help Freeman by opening doors or providing clues about how to get around certain mission objectives, and so on. You can ask security guards to follow you and they will do a decent job of attacking enemies for you (though the guards don't last too long). Consoles will randomly explode, radio messages about what's happening can be heard, and you'll come across the military fighting the monsters, in some places giving you the choice of running through while everyone's distracted or just killing them all.

One nice aspect is that because the game is older, it runs well on just about any modern machine, with a small footprint and virtually no disc space.

Having said all that, the game feels dated because, well, it is. Textures and shading are some of the most glaring examples. For all the NPCs you'll see, there are like three models for scientists and one for security guards, and all are pretty angular, even on higher resolutions. The game will sometimes load new areas and even on a powerful PC, will freeze in the middle of a hallway for five seconds with the word ""LOADING"" on the screen. While the sound is mostly good, it's limited. Each enemy tends to make one or two sounds, repeated over and over. There are only a handful of military ""radio static"" message patterns, all of which sound like dull squawks. Again, dated.

This game is also a fair bit harder than modern shooters. Maybe I was just younger with faster reflexes when it first came out but I remember back in the day HL being one of the only shooters where I felt the competitive multiplayer was more forgiving than the single-player game. Even on easy mode, it is very simple to get shredded in by enemies in HL, or fall to your death, get electrocuted, run into industrial fans, fry yourself in radioactive goop, etc. There are a lot of ways to die in every area and most players will find them.

My biggest gripe is about the controls which feel sloppy and uncontrolled. Simply tapping the AD keys (even holding Shift for ""slow"" movement) can send you flying to the side. Great when strafing to avoid combat. Bad during precision jumping sequences, which this game has aplenty of and the jumping, especially in places where you can't get a running start, feels very inconsistent.

Half-Life is a good game and a good throw back. I don't think most people will find as sharp as today's best shooters--in appearance, content, or interface--but if you can pick it up for a couple bucks, it's still worth playing.

Pros
- Nostalgia! Can still be fun, after all these years
- Minimal install, runs well on just about any modern machine

Cons
- Anyone who grew up on modern shooters is probably going to find it unforgiving
- Graphics, sound, and controls dated

Final Score: 6.5/10"
15936,fun
15937,It is a great game but is stuck saying purchase
15938,classic.
15939,"Half life is an amazing classic shooter, it began one of the best video game franchises."
15940,"Might've been good when it was published but today everything is just simply terrible.
It includes a lot of:
- getting stuck in floors
- NPC not doing what they're supposed to do, locking the game
- things that aren't obvious but never explained
- falling since you're basically always running on ice
- visual glitches

Kinda sad to see how bad it really is since otherwise it doesn't seem too bad but yea it's definitely not something I'd recommend unless you want to get a headache everytime you start it"
15941,"Yes
"
15942,it
15943,a legend that holds up.
15944,"Of all the Valve games, this one has easily aged the worst. A potentially interesting setting and story that devolves into a plot-hole minefield and gameplay that is akin to being a rat simulator- I've never spent so much time in narrow pipes and crevasses.

The claustrophobia, repetition and old, ""sticky"" gameplay legitimately give me a headache."
15945,"It is the beginning of gaming life for me. Even it is released in 1998, it is still really good and enjoyable to play. Awesome script of game play and map design. Good graphics regarding 1998. And it is beginning of a legend."
15946,"Ladder controls and platforming suck, the Xen levels are ass, On a Rail is dogshit.
10/10."
15947,"This game is really cool. I'm too young to comment on if it was ahead of its time or not, but it feels like it was, you know what I mean?"
15948,"A classic! This game basically pioneered FPS games. It's really fun even to this day, but it is quite long sometimes. And it can be hard to figure out what to do to progress. It took me almost an hour to get past the part with those giant alien claws."
15949,life-half
15950,"""It's not-it's not, 
it's not shutting down!!!!""
"
15951,"Por algo es un clasico
"
15952,yes
15953,Clasic
15954,Now this game is the best game i have ever played: The game servs a purpose and that is fun. The game mechanich might be old i know i know but its still fun and if your bored after playing it trough there is still stuff to do if you never played half life and think of getting it then get it its the best game out there.Now there is a thing i do not like: The HD version it kinda ruins the athmosphere you can of course turn it on or off but still its kinda useless unless you want the game to look a bit better thats all folks
15955,"Game is not stinky. 
Graphics have gotten a little stinky with age but overall if you somehow haven't played this yet then wait for a steam sale and survive an alien invasion in a top secret lab."
15956,"I just played this game for the first time ever. Even though it's very old, it still holds up as a playable shooter, and I can see why it is considered one of the greatest games of its time. The puzzles were really fun, even if the gameplay itself was quite simple."
15957,boring
15958,fun and very entertaining
15959,"a very great game for you guys if you remeber old version of this game i should say you getting old :(
"
15960,"nvm mind im good 
"
15961,"it will never get old, must have for die hard fps fans, period."
15962,"I'm with the science team !

This is the far as I go
This is the far as I AHHHHH
Ah EH aaahhh aaaaaa
Freedom,
freedom,
Freedom, you fool !
I can't think of so much more
shut up shut up"
15963,fun
15964,"I was kinda hyped up after the reviewws and after hearing my friend talk about it but I myself can't really get into the game. It's just a shooter and it didn't age too well. Also: moving boxes is really glitchy. Comments under this review told me that if you don't care about money you can buy the game black mesa, it looks ay better."
15965,"It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said about Half-Life.  A seminal work in the evolution of the FPS genre, this game didn't invent things so much as combine a lot of good ideas into a great, polished package.  Continuous, fixed perspective (i.e. no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow or deliver plot), environmental storytelling, light puzzle-platforming, and strategic enemy AI were not new, necessarily, when this game came out; Half-Life just does (most) of this consistently well.  Add a popular and active modding scene that pumped out amazing content, much of which went on to become full-fledged games of their own (Counter Strike, Day of Defeat, Natural Selection), and it's no wonder this game holds such a special place in many a gamer's heart.

It's not without flaws: some platforming is a little aggravating, the combat is alright by today's standards, and the last portion of the game (""Zen"") is a departure in quality.  Even so, I can't help but look back fondly on this game, even the blemishes.  At least a bit of that is nostalgia, but there's plenty of games that I hold nostalgia for yet can't bear to play again because of how poorly they've aged.  This is a game I can easily come back to over the years and still have a fun time with.

If you're interested in experiencing some of the roots of the modern FPS genre, or are just looking for a quality game that will run out-of-the-proverbial-box on a potato, you're in for a good time."
15966,Do play.
15967,"This game literally started Valve's career.  Even though this was made over 20 years ago, this is probably my favorite game of all time"
15968,"EXTREMELY FUN game. I haven't beaten the game as of making this review and i'm on Surface Tension but so far the story is interesting, the gameplay is a hard-hitter for me and if this game keeps up like this- it might just be favorite games of all time material."
15969,This game is amazing. It has an amazing campaign and an awesome multiplayer deathmatch. The theme of the game is perfect. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
15970,"People say it didn't age well, but for my first time playing half life i've been enjoying it a ton."
15971,steam yoinked this game from my library but overall very good yes can confirm
15972,"This game is so astonishingly good that even in 2020 it's addictive. Way ahead of its time in story, gameplay, and more! It's cool to see creative works that, regardless of the limitations of the medium in a given era, manage to transcend those limitations through sheer heart, passion, and devotion to the craft. Bravo!"
15973,it's $15 just do it
15974,SNARKS OH GOD THE SNARKS
15975,"This game is one the best I've played in years. Atmospheric and revolutionary. I love every bit about this game.
However I must ask a few questions. Why doesn't Gordon speak? When is Half Life 3 coming out? And why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?"
15976,"Come on, you already know this game is good. Get ready to defeat all the different enemies the game will be throwing at you and expand your arsenal while uncovering the story of Black Mesa and Co.
The gameplay slaps.
The story slaps.
Just do yourself a favor and get it, so you can also experience the insanity that is Half-Life."
15977,wow that was pretty cool
15978,"i downloaded this because of the show ""Half Life But the AI is Self-Aware"" . very gud"
15979,It does not age.
15980,"not fun i headshot barney and he yelled and shot me i died
10/10"
15981,"downloaded the brutal mod, having fun with it!"
15982,Good ol' first-person shooter with aliens.
15983,This game is SICK
15984,its fun
15985,it a very very very very large good
15986,"This game has aged very poorly. It is so difficult and unforgiving, the last part of the game sucks because it's just platforming, you can barely make out the audio and there aren't any subtitles so if your next objective is told to you through dialogue you won't know what to do"
15987,"6/10

After replaying this game it shoots up to a 10/10, now seeing what this series develops into with Half-Life Alyx. Man I wish I had a VR headset."
15988,yes
15989,"it was alright when the first time i got it, but then afterwards it kept on crashing and crashing, if anyone has any advice on to fix it from not crashing all the time please help me"
15990,cool game
15991,Good gam
15992,"hell ya'


"
15993,"The original half life while dated still hold up in both gameplay and plot.
Top rated in 1998, top rated now."
15994,10/10 classic
15995,vewy noice
15996,It's amazing The AI is Good The story is amazing with a cliff hanger for half life 2 then half life 2 E1 then E2 then alyx and black mesa is great.
15997,"played because it's a classic and i feel the need to play every valve game. fun, but would not play again."
15998,good
15999,"Gordon still didn't get his coffee probably...

That's the biggest tragedy probably"

16003,Classic game
16004,Dated Gameplay
16005,Really enjoyable game with a banger soundtrack
16006,Classic Shooter.
16007,yea
16008,game good
16009,"An absolute classic.  And a fantastic candidate for modding. Definitely buy if you have gmod. Especially if you also own a vr headset.

the standard controls, tropes, and quality of life present in any shooter game were originally more like ""groundbreaking half-life features"" when this came out.

does it hold up when compared to modern games? or any other entry in the half life series? not by the tiniest shred of the imagination.  

if you need to know more than that, the levels are designed like setpieces for you to be amazed by, surrounded by first person platforming.  unfortunately these setpieces are only amazing to an audience of gamers who were aquainted with what they thought were the limitations of video games.  Many a dad had to see what looked like vomit angrily thrashing on a screen as their excited kid showed it to them.

and the platforming gameplay...

it's ice.  every surface has the effect of slippery ice, and gravity has no arc to it.  you fall in a straight diagonal line in the direction you were moving.  these two things together mean that the actual gameplay is more of a game of simon says while you wait for the next oldschool digital piece of art."
16010,hey catch me later ill buy ya a beer
16011,"After playing through this game in its entirety, I believe that if you get it with the Orange box, it's worth the playthrough if only to see how games used to play. I don't recommend purchasing this game to playthrough separately however, since 'Black Mesa' is literally just this game but remastered without annoying bugs, glitches, and bad gameplay mechanics. The story is iconic and leads into the critically acclaimed Half Life 2 that we are still waiting for the sequel of today. Weapons are all unique and fun to use in their own way and the map design is well crafted with an interesting and clever push on having you explore for secrets to gain that little bit of extra ammo. Overall I give the game a 6.5/10 with a majority of its loss in points due to how poorly it has aged."
16012,Half the time I had know idea were I was going or what to do
16013,"It's one of the pioneers of the FPS genre. Incidentally, it also happens to be one of the best ever. Favorite FPS of all time."
16014,Still better then many games of 2020
16015,A classic. And a great time if you have a lower end PC and want some fun shooting action. It holds up for the most part.
16016,"it's half life (1)  good combat, cool puzzles, and fun levels 100% recommend playing"
16017,its fun
16018,I LAZOERD AN ALIEN AND MY WANOR GOT HARD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
16019,lol
16020,"Super good, except for the Xen levels where almost everything is a mess, lol."

This game is a must play for a gamer."
16023,"""Hey, catch me later and I'll buy you a beer"""
16024,"A classic, with an engaging plot."
16025,This game is the best of best when it comes to retro games. After this much amount of time I still enjoy playing it.
16026,üëç
16027,Love the story so far.
16028,Graphics are really shit compared to Half-Life 2. Why does anyone play this now-a-days?
16029,a
16030,graphics and story line
16031,i L O V E this game it is one of the best games i have ever played and i got interested in this game through garrys mod because its based off of half life 2 and when i saw it based off of half life 2 i searched up half life 1 and i was not disappointed. the last things i would want out of this game is knowing when shepard and colette will come back and the first time i ever played a valve game was left 4 dead 2 also my cousin used to be afraid of mr.valve idk man the person in the startup 11/10 donuts
16032,cool game
16033,it old but fun me dad said it fun and it is
16034,good
16035,Good
16036,"This is NOT an action game. This is NOT an adventure game. This IS a horror game, but it's the type of horror that makes you want to play it forever. I'm writing this after I got through playing for the day, and my hands are shaking so hard, i can barely type."
16037,i need it its not free
16038,"[h1]A truly iconic game, a must-have for fans of FPS games.[/h1] (spoiler-free)
I wasn't at all into shooter games, before my boyfriend introduced me to the Half-Life franchise. At first, due to my lack of experience in shooters, I disliked this game and found it boring. And so it happened, I abandoned it for a year or so. After coming back, I fell in love with this game and am insanely proud it's my first PC FPS game.

The graphics are obviously not perfect as for today's standards, but to me they give that retro vibe which I haven't experienced back in 1998 due to my age. That too, you can play using the HD models (changeable through settings).
The story told is quite tragic, but at the same time is adventurous and thrilling. The player's goals change as the game progresses, which doesn't let the gameplay get boring. Puzzles are also available.
There are no cutscenes in the game, the story is told by the environment and npcs, causing you to carefully listen and observe. Sadly for me (non-english speaker) there are no subtitles available.
The silence of Gordon Freeman throughout the game really lets all your emotions and feelings to be freely expressed, without you having to play as a personality that's not yours. Your personality becomes Gordon's personality.
The game is amazingly optimized for modern pcs, on my old non-gaming laptop the game ran pretty smooth, only rarely experiencing framedrops in intense scenes.
The game does indeed have flaws, but they're minor and can be reasoned by the limitations of the time it was made in.
As I said in the very beginning, I started loving Half-Life only after a long time of playing. When I got the full feel of the game and realized how much I love this game, it eventually ended, leaving me with a mixed feeling of happiness and regret. Don't repeat my mistakes. [b]This game does leave you wanting for more.[/b]

I highly recommend this masterpiece.


"
16039,this game is fun but its easy to get stuck.
16040,"like game it reaallllllllll;ylyylylylylylylyll good
"
16041,A bit confusing but a ton of fun
16042,good game
16043,"Best shooter game I have ever played. I recently played this game in 2020, and its better playing this game late than never.

You need to work around a collapsing world fighting off aliens, while scavenging weapons of others and finding health chargers to re charge your health. Each level is well designed, with logical thinking gone behind it where you must think smart to survive. The storytelling of the game is immersive and really puts you into the shoes of the character.

To simply put it, the game is a masterpiece and revolutionises the entire genre, even to this day. The graphics definitely have not aged well, but nevertheless, this game is a must play!!"
16044,childhood game
16045,This is one of the best games on Steam
16046,"I enjoyed this game way more than I thought I would. (I played this on Sven, that's why it looks like I have almost no time in this game.)"
16047,"100% recommended, graphic is great for a 20 years old game, cool mechanics, great movements, fun puzzle, kinda scary if you are under 10 years of age. 1 of the best game/easier for speedrun if you are into it."
16048,Finally
16049,Good shit.
16050,amazing shooter that aged really well. gameplay is fun but I didnt really care for the story. level design is also really good
16051,This game is a classic and one of the best games I have ever played. The fact that you can create and download mods for this is great because you can make your own experience with the same engine. 10/10
16052,sans
16053,"Good game, not for anyone who grew up on fortnite."
16054,"At the time of this review, I haven't quite beat the game yet, still having some more story left. What I've played so far is nothing short of amazing. Although this is obviously not as rounded and polished as HL2 since it came before, you can see the heart put into this game. It really immerses you in the Half Life universe and makes you want to keep going to see this through. Would easily recommend to anyone who has had an interest in the Half Life series.


EDIT: 20 hours in and I have completed what paved the way for the legendary company that Valve truly is. What a remarkable time. Story was superb, gameplay was fun and active, seriously no complaints here. And that ending, chilling as hell... Doctor Freeman..."

16061,"So far, I absolutely love this game. But currently I cannot progress forward because of an elevator in Xen that does not work. I have tried closing out of the game and Steam, and loading an earlier save but neither have worked. Generally the game is glitchy so I hope this is only a temporary issue that will fix its self. For everyone who is interested in getting this game, I'd say it is worth the purchase but just be aware that the game has plenty of glitches most of them being harmless."
16062,"Interesting story line to unravel and interpret as you play. 

There is a good amount of challenge unrelated to combat, and the game keeps you on your toes. The power scale works very well, with scaling weapons but no boosts to defence so you are ever vulnerable and outsmarting enemies is an important skill throughout the entire game. No enemy stops being a threat!

16076,"I have a lot to say about this game, but I'll start off with: 
-
Interesting and deep story line + many fire fights and some puzzle elements = Very fun even for a first game by Valve. (For those who didn't know, Half-Life is the first game Valve ever made) And to people who are confused as to which version of this game to buy if you haven't played already, get this 1998 release version. Half-Life Source is only VISUALLY better. The source version has some more game breaking bugs than the original 98 release which is disappointing and can at times ruin the experience if you're not aware of it while playing. Not to say this version is perfectly bug free, but it's the best stable version there is.
-
Side note: Most people must have at least *heard* of Half-Life. Who doesn't know about Gordon Freeman and his trusty Crowbar? He is an iconic character to me. Idk about you but even though he's a silent protag, the game gets the messages across mostly well.
-
This game in my personal opinion is great for those who are into first person shooters, and like solving some puzzles on the side. Because there's some sections where you can get stuck if you're either not paying attention or are not careful. I've gotten stuck plenty of times trust me. Overall, I'd say experience Half-Life if you haven't already."
16077,This game is terrible! Terribly underappreciated! This hidden gem from 1998 has gone under the radar for far too long! This game was ahead of its time and its a shame that no one appreciated it at its time of release. Hope we can see the devs come back for a sequel!

16121,"Ugh the graphics have obviously not aged well but that is to be expected. The sound and voices also have obviously not aged well. I love the jiggle physics for the female black ops breasts haha. The enemy US marine soldiers had amazing AI for their time they can charge your position, throw grenades, yell orders to eachother, and try to flank you. Problem is they're all bullet sponges and the shooting in this game has dated as bad as it's sequel. Also the Marines are using MP5's with grenade launchers when realistically they would all be using M4's and M16's with grenade launchers! Valve knows nothing about guns! All in all this game and it's expansions have aged poorly over the past decades. I 100% recommend the remake Black Mesa! I'd still very much prefer and recommend Black Mesa over this and the sequel as Black Mesa seems to have the best gunplay and polish in the entire franchise and that remake was made by devs not by Valve!!! The only thing I like from this game is that the female black ops have bouncing jiggling boob physics lol. Last thing is holy fuck is the opening train car sequence way to fuckin long like holy shit it's way to long which is fine for a first time playthrough but you can't fuckin skip it on multiple playthroughs! The Xen setting looks like complete dogshit and you're better off playing the remake Black Mesa instead!"

16147,"I admit, this is probably one of the greatest games of all time, but it's in one of the most broken states I've ever seen of any game that got released by a big publisher. Literally, this game crashes on any loading screen. I'm questioning if this is actually the Source version, but I've got one of 2 things you should do intstead:
If you have a GPU, buy Black Mesa, a remake that I imagine runs much better, or download the Dreamcast or PS2 version, which are closer to the original."

It's a great game but some parts of it make me want to take a Headcrab and Just Wear it on my head and Accept my fate. The Gameplay Is Tight and Solid with fun weapons and Decent Difficulty Albiet I Probably Should Have Started with The Easy Difficulty As It took Me 23 hours to Beat the Game. I Hate The Stupid Tram Part and The akward Gravity and Platforming In XEN is pretty Annoying. The Atmosphere and Lack of Soundtrack Is Better than Half-Life 2 in my Personal Opinion however That Is Subjective, There is One Song in the Game where Every Step You Take is a Note and I thought that That was Genious. Overall 7/8 This game has aged better than many others from the time but it's not at all perfect."

16157,"i do believe this game was fun when it came out since good graphics werent really a thing

however i got bored really quickly with this game, probably cause im not really used to old graphics"
16158,"I‚Äôm not sure how much I have left to say about [i]Half-Life[/i].

I write a [i]Half-Life[/i] comic, see ‚Äì a mightily expensive bit of fan-fiction (if this opens me up to charges of bias, I apologise; hopefully the game‚Äôs reputation can supersede them). So professionally it‚Äôs taken up a lot of my imaginative space for the past five years, a period of time in which, for most other people, [i]Half-Life[/i] was more or less dead. Almost everything I‚Äôve had to say has been poured into that comic and there‚Äôs still a few years left on it. Perhaps even another five. I‚Äôm conscious of wearing myself out.

At the same time, it‚Äôs important to stay rooted in [i]Half-Life[/i] so I don‚Äôt risk straying too far from the franchise that kick-started the whole endeavour.

And so roughly every couple of years I revisit the series to check in with the characters and world. It runs the risk of tedium, but luckily for me [i]Half-Life[/i] is still as playable and entertaining as ever.

[h1]DOCTOR FREEMAN THE PRUH-FESH-UH-NL[/h1]

A watershed moment for the first-person shooter, [i]Half-Life[/i] would instil in Valve the belief that in order for the series to go forward, it would consistently need to reach the heights of the game that started it all. A tall order, but one they have proven time and again they‚Äôre capable of meeting.

Revisiting it last week, I was reminded of how I experienced [i]Half-Life[/i] as a 10-year-old (11?) kid. I was so enthralled with the prospect of being hapless theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman that I‚Äôd effectively role-play specific sequences. It was a way of corralling the narrative to fit my desires ‚Äì a testament to the relative elasticity of Valve‚Äôs design, the potency of the game‚Äôs immersive setting, and, clearly, an early warning sign as to my latent obsessive tendencies.

When the tram came to a stop outside the Anomalous Materials lab where Freeman works, I‚Äôd keep shift pressed down from the moment the door opened to the eventual test chamber disaster. I knew Freeman was late, but I didn‚Äôt imagine him running through the steel corridors like a madman; I wanted him to be a professional. (Now I crouch-jump through the lab and hop on tables when characters are speaking, studiously turning my back on them.)

And when a certain crucial decision had to be made, I‚Äôd walk Doctor Freeman to the end of the tram to gaze into the colourless void in mock contemplation. (Now I make my choice the moment it‚Äôs available for me to do so, checking off another completed playthrough.)

I had more time then. Now I‚Äôve got other, more adult things to be getting on with.

Like writing comic-books based on video-games.

[h1]LEGACY[/h1]

Valve‚Äôs achievement was, and remains, monumental. With its tale of science-gone-awry unleashing interdimensional chaos on a top secret facility, there was nothing unique in and of itself about [i]Half-Life's[/i] story. But in terms of the way that story was [i]told[/i], in immersing players in its smartly realised setting and placing them at the heart of the unfolding drama, they created something unforgettable.

Its story was a simple one, but it changed the way developers approached how they thought about storytelling ‚Äì especially in the domain of the first-person shooter.

It changed the way I thought about them, too.

The moment you push the crystal into the beam and split the world, I get chills. As arcs of green energy lash angrily across the chamber and glittering particles of light materialise above, drawn to the crystal like a moth to the flame, I am reminded of what it was like to experience [i]Half-Life[/i] for the very first time. And in doing so, I am reminded of how what came next shaped who I am today.

I didn‚Äôt know it when I was a kid, but Gordon Freeman‚Äôs mishap would resonate far beyond Black Mesa, rippling through time and space and giving birth to a cast of characters I‚Äôve been proud to spend a good chunk of my adult life with.

It‚Äôs impossible to experience [i]Half-Life[/i] without them. I‚Äôm grateful for that.

And here I am now, nearly 800 words in, having only planned to write a short piece about how [i]Half-Life[/i] still holds up today. But you‚Äôve read enough about that. You already [i]know[/i] that. The Resonance Cascade left a sizeable dent, impossible to ignore, secure in its legacy ‚Äì an inflection point, from Freeman‚Äôs dim prospects as a theoretical physicist to the very shape of the first-person shooter. And to my professional life as a writer.

Twenty years later and apparently I still have plenty to say about bloody [i]Half-Life[/i]. I don't know whether or not I should be embarrassed about that, but at least the 11-year-old (10?) me would've been happy.

In a way, I'm still pressing down shift."

16202,"despite coming out in 1998, this game is still amazing. although yes, I did enjoy Half life 2 more, it's still impossible to criticize this game. time has not been kind to the 1990's graphics and low resolution and blocky models, but there is still some satisfaction in blasting through the countless obstacles (with the occasional help of noclip). I would recommend disabling blood and gibs via the parental control in the options, as things can get rather violent at times. every chapter of the game has multiple mini-bosses which you have to fight using not only locations on the map (such as electro-frying a gargantua), but also cooking headcrabs, houndeyes, bullsquid, and everything under the sun with half life's weapons. even though the gravity gun didn't exist yet, and some today call this game's guns rudimentary, it's still impressive. even if you like modern graphics or better weapons, if you want to blast some HECU marines, aliens, or even your own allies, then spend some money and get ready to mind-blow your friends with this game! (not being sarcastic, BTW)"

16209,"I've only had this game for a couple days and it is amazing. the graphics look great for that time and it is really fun. the only gripe i have about it is the difficulty. yes i just started playing 2 days ago, but this game is genuinely hard. other than that, this is a great game and i recommend this to everyone with a steam account :)"
16210,"The game is pretty bare bones by modern standards, but the game still holds up and is one of my favorites. The influence of this game cannot be overstated. Get it."
16211,I think its fun just gotta keep your eyes peeled and keep moving!
16212,camera kept jerking around besides that cool game
16213,cool
16214,I cant get past the first level
16215,"Just gonna be honest. I enjoyed the first hour or two of the game, seeing the infamous black mesa that is referenced so often in newer half life games. But over time the gameplay gets stale and frustrating. It gets progressively more difficult, to a point at which you have to reload saves continuously in order to perfect your play. health is so scarce that if you complete an area but lose a tiny amount of health, chances are you are going to restart it in order to do it without losing health. From the exceptional reviews i was assuming the game would still hold up, even for a new player in 2020. And it did, for a little while. Older games typically revolve around the save and reload mechanic, allowing them to make exceptionally difficult levels that you can brute force your way through, but its just not fun or immersive when compared with the modern style of game. The graphics aren't great but when i finished the game the graphics were not what left a sour taste in my mouth. Instead, the slippery movement and the bullet sink enemies left me feeling frustrated and bored. Levels which involved platforming were so annoying because whenever gordon moves it feels like he is sliding about an ice rink. Enemies took so many bullets to kill it just felt boring to hold down the trigger and wait for them to die, wasting all my ammunition in the process. The level design is slightly worse than ok, its easy to get confused with the number of crossroads but in the end you get through it. Overall, you may enjoy it if you wear a pair of nostalgia glasses as you play but personally, as a new player i drew more frustration from it than i did enjoyment."
16216,its classic shooter action. you have to use you head sometimes too. all the guns feel good to shoot even the pistol.
16217,A classic FPS that is still fun nearly 20 years after its original release.
16218,good classic
16219,my game broke
16220,"this is epic, what else can i say?"
16221,"There's a reason for Freeman being a theoretical physicist, unlike Doom, Quake and other games where you're rewarded for killing every enemy, finding every secret, etc, Half-Life is more puzzle focused and it becomes apparent that you can't (low ammo, low health, overwhelming) or shouldn't (losing ammo, potentially losing health) win every fight, so you must traverse through trying to outsmart or avoid a lot of them.

The deathmatch is great, I thought I would suck at it but I only mildly do so therefore it's great. Unless you're being tapped by bhopping demi-gods who fly across the map killing you 17 times in the span of 4 seconds.

Absolutely epic game."
16222,you know what maybe i'll buy this game again sence it was free before
16223,jes i veri lik te gaem becuz i cane bunihup veri eatsyu
16224,"I played the Steam version first for free. I did not complete the game because the free to play time expired. So, II purchased an original  retail copy of Half-Life and started playing.  I had to play the new retail game from the beginning because I had no game saved files for the retail copy. So I quickly realized that the Steam version looked much better and had an up-dated configuration menu for modern PC hardware. Live and Learn, Verne -).  
I purchased the Steam Version and am playing now to finish the game.  Valve keeps updating this game with patches - for the Steam Version only, though. It seems that Steam Store is the only place to buy an updated copy of Half-Life. The price  seems reasonable."

control feels like if you were a rock in a butter bath and the grabing mechanic for some reason does not work, and the stuff just slides away without my control
Enemy placement is absolute BULLSHIT, Headcrabs are everywere and one shot you with good health, even zombies, wich are actually good enemies, can kill you with ease
And level design is confuse as hell for me at least"
16234,Good game
16235,"Very good game, and one of my absolute favorites. Fun to play with or without cheats. Sometimes it's a bit confusing where to go, but it adds to the kind of puzzle aspect of the game, and the issues I do have are very minor and petty, barely even worth mentioning. If you like a compelling but not overwhelming story, adventurous FPS games, or just feeling like a one man army, I highly recommend this game and its spin-offs and sequels."
16236,"Going from playing the Black Mesa remake to playing Half-Life 1, is like going from Zelda: A Link Between Worlds back to Zelda: A Link to the Past. If that makes sense.

16240,"I tried playing it as nostalgia on my new PC and if you go into wide screen mode you can't play at all or convert it back what a waste of 14 dollars
"
16241,It gets more updates than Team Fortress 2
16242,"Half Life is a sci-fi, adventure, and sometimes horror but it tells a really good story that started valve or if you don't like single player or trying to find something else to do then you can click on a server that's on the menu when you open the game so you can play with other people but the half life series pretty much changed everything along with steam but if you want to find a new series that sounds interesting then you would enjoy half life because it's like Doom but your in earth and there's an alien invasion. It has no chaotic gore like Doom but you still have fun while playing half life. The game is short, it's like 3 hours long. Oh yeah don't mind when it says ""loading"" most the time when you see it while playing so it process the game and maybe can give you a check point or save the game before you close the game. But the game is still good. Bye."
16243,"Difficult, fast-paced strategy shooter. Very advanced for it's time."
16244,yes
16245,The game is good. buy the game.
16246,"Awesome game. But i'm biased, played this when I was a kid."
16247,"If you want to play Half-Life, get Black Mesa. HL1 is pretty dated with bad level design and bad/unfair AI.
It is fun in a pinch though."
16248,fast
16249,bhop lol
16250,mastapeice the reason i keep playing this game for hours is because its about combat puzzles play it like that than you will be amazed of how fun half life is and it was made in 1998 i think

16253,[insert half-life 3 joke here]
16254,"Intro:

Released in 1998 for the PC, Half-Life runs on the GoldSrc engine, which is a heavily modified version of the Quake engine. This game is well known for pioneering story-telling in video games. Video games before Half-Life had very simple stories, usually written at the back of the box. Games like DOOM focused mainly on the gameplay, leaving story as an after thought. Half-Life aimed to change this, and it succeeded tenfold. 

Gameplay: 

Half-Life is a typical late 90's shooter. You have your roster of guns and can carry all of them (as soon as you obtain them), you move quickly and therefore, combat is very fast paced. If you aren't an old-school FPS player, then I recommend playing the game on Easy if you've never played it before, as the higher difficulties can prove to be quite brutal. 
The gunplay feels great, with a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and almost all of them serving some sort of purpose throughout the campaign. (i.e. pistol for picking off headcrabs and barnicles, shotgun for tankier enemies, magnum and crossbow for long range etc.). There is also a wide variety of enemies. Early on, you will be fighting aliens and zombies,  but later in the game there will be marines and assassins, as well as more difficult alien enemies, each with their own quirks to spice up gameplay. In the end, it feels like a game of chess, as each gun serves a different purpose and is good against different enemy types. One issue I have with the gunplay is that it this game has no bullets, but instead, hitscan weapons, meaning there is no way to dodge the projectiles fired by marines and some aliens like the vortigaunts. Overall though, gameplay is very satisfying. 

Level Design: 

Level design, for the most part, is fantastic. The game has 18 chapters total, and each chapter is split into multiple levels. The transitions between levels are smooth and fast on modern machines, and hardly break the immersion of gameplay. Some levels also have very well designed arenas to combat enemies in. 
That said, this game is extremely linear, but I'd say this works in its favor, as it aims to tell a story in a fully interactive environment. Control is never taken away from the player, and the introductory 2 chapters are completely devoid of combat. This makes for an extremely memorable experience, not seen in many games nowadays, which tend to overuse cutscenes and feel more like movies than actual games. 
The only part of the level design I did not enjoy, were the Xen levels (During the last quarter of the game), which feel very rushed and barren compared to the rest of the game. If you don't particularly care about the story, I might go as far as suggesting you skip these levels, as they are mostly just platforming, with small combat sections in between. (The first Xen chapter can literally be beaten in about 5 minutes during normal play)

Story: 

The story follows Gordon Freeman, a young theoretical physicist who works in the Black Mesa research facility. One day however, an experiment he is a part of goes horribly wrong, opening an inter-dimensional portal to a border world known as ""Xen"". Aliens from said world start flooding our world, and soon the entire research facility is overrun by them, and it is up to Gordon and his fellow scientist to find a way to close the dimensional rift before it is too late.
Throughout the entire plot, Gordon does not utter a single word, nor does he have any background other than the theoretical physicist part, meaning he is the perfect vessel for the player. Want to be a complete psychopath and slaughter everyone in your path, including your fellow scientists? The game lets you do that. This is one huge advantage that other games of this time period or later don't have, be it due to essential NPC's or morality in-game choices.  
I will not spoil the ending (though most people most likely already know it by now), but I will say that for newcomers to the series, the story becomes very interesting the further you go, mostly because of a mysterious figure you will be seeing throughout the game known as the ""G-Man"". 
The story itself isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's the way it is presented to the player which makes it memorable. As mentioned before, you are always in control, and therefore, feel like a part of the game world. 

Graphics: 

Graphically, this is the game's weakest aspect. The graphics have aged horribly, and textures are upscaled and heavily pixelated. Models are also quite low-poly, especially if you aren't using the HD models (can be toggled inside the options). Some people may enjoy the graphics style due to its retro charm, but most may be put off by it. On the bright side, the game  fully supports modern resolutions and can be played in 1080p (And I think even 4K, but I was unable to test it) and at 60 FPS. 

Sound: 

This game has brilliant sound design. From environmental echoes, to amazing gun sounds and the occasional music that plays during combat, fitting perfectly with both the atmosphere of the game and rythm of the combat. Voice acting on the other hand, however, isn't that great, and some voice lines are quite low quality. 

Verdict/Conclusion: 

Half-Life pioneered story-telling in video games. Not only does it perfectly incorporate its story into the gameplay, never even once taking control away from the player, but it is also extremely satisfying with its gunplay. The story, although nothing spectacular, is strengthened by the fact mentioned above. Graphics have a neat retro feel to them, but may be off-putting for most. Level design is stellar, and outside of the few ending chapters, it has great pacing and combat sequences, as well as memorable set-pieces. Sound design suffers only from poorly recorded voice lines here and there, but overall does a great job to immerse the player and have guns sound like they truly pack a punch. Overall, this game gets a 10/10 for me, as it is one of the most influential games of all time, and should be in any FPS enthusiast's library."
16255,as a gordon freeman simp i approve
16256,"Play it, suffer."
16257,"I played this because it is a piece of video game history, with the difficulty on normal. As somebody that grew up on hand me down style PS2 generation games, games that were inherently broken in some parts and limited technically by a controller, I can say playing this was incredibly frustrating. The game is not inherently difficult, but lots of the issues provided with the base game and limitations of the time make it so it doesn't quite hold up in terms of quality. 

Movement is like sliding on butter, the game tries to autoaim your gun for you and fails miserably, some enemies will happily one shot you, some enemies are unkillable, movement in the air is nearly impossible and incredibly inconsistent, environmental cues trigger without warning and will one shot you. Put these all together, and you get every level in the game, the final boss with this is amplified to such an aggravating extent. Games that are hard to be difficult, like Cuphead and Dark Souls have fleshed out systems that only sometimes toss you for no reason. This game, a normal game, tosses you every few minutes. I attribute most of this to how old it is, and that's okay - it just was not a fun game for me.

16285,"[h1]Even more than 20 years after its release Half-Life is still among my personal Top 5 best games of all time. It‚Äòll be very difficult for me to describe this game without using superlatives in every sentence. [/h1]

Before i played Half-Life at some point during 1999, i already had brief experiences with earlier 3D shooters. I knew what Doom was, had briefly played Golden Eye and Duke Nukem 3D on a friend‚Äòs N64 and even had few Botmatches in Unreal. They were all good fun, but compared to Half-Life seemed downright unimpressive all of a sudden. Half-Life was the game that ultimately converted me into a dedicated FPS fan until today and it was the first game that completely sucked me in with its atmosphere and cinematic approach. At least in terms of overall gameplay, pacing, story-telling and building atmosphere, i still compare every fps to the Half-Life series to this day, particularly the first game.

To speak about the story is somewhat redundant at this point, because i guess EVERY gamer knows about the basic premise of Half-Life. But to sum it up shortly: You play as 27 years old physicist Gordon Freeman, who works at the Black Mesa Research Facility, located deep within the deserts of New Mexico. One morning you play a crucial role in an experiment with a strange and seemingly extraterrestrial material, which goes horribly awry. The experiment opens up various portals to another dimension and as a consequence Black Mesa and the surrounding desert are flooded with foreign creatures intend on killing everyone and everything. As Gordon, your one and only goal is to make it out of the research facility alive and escape the chaos surrounding you.
The story itself is as basic as every other fps from throughout the 90s. It is basically a combination of the plots of Doom and Quake (extraterrestrial beeings attack through portals after experiment went wrong) and Unreal (protagonist tries to escape from a desperate, live-threatening situation after severe accident). What sets Half-Life apart from the likes of Doom and Quake and really made it raising the bar for fps game design (along with Unreal to be fair), is not the story itself, but how it was told. There were no cutscenes and no screens full of explanatory text. You were witnessing the whole plot from Gordon‚Äòs eyes, never leaving this perspective and never being pulled out of the gameworld by seperate levels like in doom or quake. All you could see and hear the whole game through were the world, events and characters immediately surrounding you, and so you piece together the big puzzle by just paying attention to the things happening around you as you try to escape. The level design is so much more believable and immersive than in other fps of that time and this approach to world-building and storytelling is half-life‚Äôs biggest accomplishment and makes it the first action-movie that you yourself play the lead role in. Ever wondered how John McClane must have felt during ‚ÄûDie hard‚Äú, or Ellen Ripley during ‚ÄûAliens‚Äú? Go try Half-Life and you‚Äòll get the idea...

To be honest, the rest of Half-Life wasn‚Äôt that revolutionary even in 1998. I consider it to be pointless (and also a bit unfair) to discuss all the aspects of the game in great detail in 2020 and compare them to the recent standards of modern fps games. Just like the first Doom, Half-Life has maintained a status as sort of a timeless classic (rightfully so!!!) and the only way to get a somewhat objective, unbiased, nostalgia-free opinion on the game is to read a review from around the actual time of half-life‚Äôs release. But to avoid stirring up unrealistic expectations, it should be mentioned that grafics, controls, gunplay and sound were only slightly above average, if at all, at that time. Even the soundtrack, which for me personally is still among the best and most enjoyable video game soundtracks ever composed, sounds admittedly a bit dated nowadays, so it is somewhat forgivable if younger players fail to see the importance and impact this game had on the industry back in the late 90s and early 00s.
But between the releases of Doom in 1993 and Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare in 2007, Half-Life has been THE most defining first person-shooter for almost 10 years straight. Fortnites, Battlefields and PUBGs come and go, but Half-Life will always be there in some form or another, even if we still have to wait for a conclusion to it‚Äôs story arc 13 years after the release of Half-Life 2 Episode 2 and the series basically being a living corpse (thx anyways valve for HL: Alyx, but that‚Äôs not what we hardcore Half-Life fans want *coughHL3cough*). The first Half-Life is one of those very rare games i‚Äòd say that not only fps enthusiasts but absolutely every gamer, from the super mario fans to the world of warcraft devotees, from the call of duty fanboys to the indie game worshipers, from the filthy console peasants to the glorious pc master race, from the 16 years old gamer girl to the 50 years old video game veteran, has to try at least once. What the Beatles‚Äò ‚ÄûSgt. Peppers lonely hearts club band‚Äú-album was for Rock- and Pop music, Half-Life 1 is for the FPS genre.

16291,ages like radioactive wine
16292,ahh yes Half life the best game of the world I finished the game but i was sad bc is very very good game but valve release half life blue shift and half life opposing force. If you have potato pc i recommend to play all the games of half life 1 and 2 !!
16293,"infuriating at points but overall i enjoyed the game thoroughly. Not perfect if you have a neurodivergent (as in, non-average, such as ADHD/Autism) brain because some puzzles rely on you thinking of something in the way developers want you to, which not everybody can. Still, if you don't mind looking things up every once in a while, would still recommend!"
16294,"This game is like, probably one of the best games you can get on here, and the price is pretty darn good"
16295,"A pure masterpiece. This first version of the Half Life genre is certainly a must-play for any pc gamer. Even though it did not age well graphically, the gameplay gives the player an unique challenge between fps action and puzzles. I fully recommend to play this on the hard difficulty to get the greatest experience from this game. Don't forget the great story and atmosphere in this game. 

If you are interested to try the Half Life genre, this one is certainly the first you should try. The game 'Black Mesa' (recently released by fans) is also worth a check if you prefer the visuals."
16296,yes.
16297,FML. It took me an hour figuring out how to fking kill this Nihilanth.
16298,"While not as good as it's sequel, Half-Life is still worth playing today. It's a great game that made FPS games what they are today. While Doom was the 1st evolution of FPS games, Half-Life is 2nd evolution."
16299,good
16300,Holds up even today (except for Xen.) 9/10.
16301,BEST CLASSIC GAME ON STEAM
16302,"Very entertaining and paved the way for future fps games, also has very classic moments which are fun to play through. Can be pretty frustrating but the ending is worth it. 10/10 would not say a word the whole game again"
16303,gud
16304,Half-Life is a beautiful masterpiece! While yes the graphics are bit dated but the gameplay is still amazing! Thought there are some flaws that make it kind of annoying. One of these is the way you can move objects around. In Half-Life you can shove objects around by running into them. This is a good way to move them but can take awhile. Or instead of that you could press e on them and move them. It moves much faster but.... it's almost uncontrollable! In order to move it must hold e and walk around and depending on what way you walk it will slide in that direction. This works until you realize that the objects have no friction when doing this and will fling across the room. Other than that the game still holds up really well and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a little challenge and fun.
16305,good game obviously
16306,"For the longest time, I've ignored the HL series for pretty much no reason until May of this year by gamesharing with my friend, I instantly got into the game. Ever since then I've loved the entire HL series and quickly became a fan, while HL2 is good, HL1 is the game I keep seeing myself coming back to along with its expansions, Opposing Force and Blueshift. Great game, great expansions and if you're reading this and still haven't played this series, do it now, you won't regret it IMO."
16307,A Amazing game. Better than Half-life 2 in my opinion.
16308,"Playing this in the modern era (or at least, in the era I'm currently writing) may actually do this game a few favors. Mechanically, it's sound; it's an FPS on a PC, without radical movement concepts to wrangle. To be fair, there is annoying platforming sequence that tests the limits of jumping in a first person perspective. To its credit, it feels tacked on and doesn't make up a bulk of your interaction with the world. You'll often be shooting at things and using environmental puzzles to advance. Said puzzles are intuitive enough where you'll often know what to do without needing a guide, but not so obvious or repetitive where it feels like filler. 

Where this game has aged the best may be in its atmosphere. It's a special sort of isolated, haunting experience to play a game where you don't really know what the world is capable of. This title doesn't have to carry the weight of decades of spin-offs, sequels, one-shot comics, and the litany of other expanded universe bloat that current shooters suffer from. The primitive character models buoy the unease of uncovering an otherworldly mystery. There's an almost Lynchian aesthetic."
16309,"I don't have anything really new or insightful to say that hasn't been said.
A classic that still holds up, until you get out of this world."
16310,"This game is a classic, unfortunately, I was a little late to the party. I do not regret buying this game and it's definitely worth the money considering how cheap it is.
This is a truly great game and anyone who enjoys a good FPS or someone who wants to try playing an FPS should play this game."

16317,Hello Gordon!
16318,"This game still holds up to this day and is one of my favorites!

The story is awesome
The gameplay is awesome

The AI is really just.. out of this world! The characters in this game are almost too realistic and you can really feel their emotions trough the wonderful voiceactors.
No but in all seriousness, this game is awesome and i absolutely love it both for the amazing story ark and the less inteligent AI. The fact that this game is old and doesnt have the best technology, only adds to the awesome factor!
And the charcters are the best part!"

16324,amazing game with near flawlass story telling and gameplay
16325,"It's really good for being an FPS from 1998, but be warned, its pretty hard.

16326,cool
16327,"the standard for all FPS games, and clearly a classic.

16338,"Freeman, I've been waiting for you. One of your scientist pals said to give you a message. You're supposed to take this old rail system up to some kind of satellite delivery rocket. I don't know where it is exactly, and the old guy was so worried about getting out of here alive he didn't tell me. The main thing is, the military aborted the launch, so when you do find the rocket, you'll have to get up to the control room and launch it yourself. He said something about a Lambda team needing the satellite in orbit if they were ever going to clean up this mess."
16339,This game is good but like
16340,The game that started it all. Nostalgia hits every single time the old valve screen loads <3

16343,"When you play a 22 year old game for the first time in 2020 and still find it better than tons of AAA crap (looking at you Activision and Ubisoft) , the game speaks for itself. Ohh you're asking me why I never played this before? Well I had heard so much about this game, I didn't have it in me to pirate it for all these years and I joined steam only few months before I purchased this legend. And trust me, it was totally totally worth it. 

P.S: I am ready to be crucified and burned on a stake for claiming HL1 >>>>> HL2 and the episodes. Mostly for that impending doom feeling, the beautiful geography outside Black Mesa and Xen. I was so crushed when I found out the sequels wont have Xen. Thanks the almighty GabeN for Opposing Force.

P.P.S: I played with the subtitles mod hence the '20 minutes'. I have 10h and 6h respectively in Opposing Force and Blue shift if you wanna verify. They didn't have a subtitle mod sadly. Also possibly my only gripe with the game."
16344,Can't beat the classics.

16349,"great game, it doesnt take really anything to run the game perfectly but it is a bit hard to get into because its most likely different from any other fps game you've played. i dont really know where im going with this review. its half life its 10$ just play it AAAAAAAAAAA"
16350,"Playing this game was an absolute torture.
would recommend 10/10"
16351,"Low poly and scary, felt like a book except you felt watched"

16360,Never a dull moment with this game. Great game

16362,DON'T SHOOT! I'M WITH THE SCIENCE TEAM!
16363,Its ok
16364,good game
16365,very cool
16366,OH MY GOD THE GAME EXISTS!
16367,AWESOME CLASSIC fps game
16368,"Half-Life is a little janky in its old age even compared to some other contemporary shooters but comparing it to games like say, Quake II would be selling it short and not giving it credit for the things it accomplished. It's no less of the thrilling, roller coaster ride of high tension than it was at launch. It changed the way we viewed video game worlds, storytelling, puzzle solving and interactions.

It's worth experiencing for anyone interested in the history of video games and it's the reason you're on Steam today reading this review because there would be no Steam without it."
16369,Good game would play again
16370,"the og, whats not to like"
16371,hldm
16372,nice
16373,"One game that changed the entire industry, and while not a gods gift from heaven to earth its still a very solid game that defined the dark mysterious fps genre. Overall design,music,gameplay is solid and holds up

16377,The original the one the only this game was my life as a small child and to start playing it again on my own machine is something the would blow my tiny brain back in 1998.
16378,the game i play the most is  half life  and i always will
16379,good and cool
16380,worth the price
16381,11/10
16382,"the game that started everything... Thanks Valve :)





Now give us Half Life 3"
16383,still holds up 22 years later
16384,"Amazing game, if you don't like shooters I would still recommend. It was one of the first games to include a compelling story and environments. The graphics aren't very good and most buttons and control panels are just changing textures, but this was 1998. If you play this and you are a fan, think about getting the DLC, Sequels, or Black Mesa (A fan remaster of this game)"
16385,Classic and fun. This is a must-play.
16386,very good
16387,"its still a really good game for its age, it might not hold up graphicly but not many games are still being talked about 20 years later with the same enthusiasm as when it was released"
16388,"it. amazing.
that all i have to say."
16389,It's a really good and classic game. I'd play everyday.
16390,"I hate the controls, but it's okay."
16391,Ultimate classic
16392,"Crack Life > Half Life.
Do you even lift bro?"
16393,Took away half my life
16394,"A beloved classic with impressive AI and satisfying weapons to use. Map design, however, hasn't aged well and certain levels can be confusing on where to go and how to proceed. Nonetheless, well worth a playthrough and a purchase at full price."
16395,Half-Life was probably one of the most enjoyable experiences i have ever had with a video game but the H.E.C.U soldiers are annoying but i would happily rate this game 9/10
16396,Amazing game! Don't be fooled by the graphics. (Though I think they hold up very well).
16397,"Bro, just buy it. You know you wanna"
16398,Can get extremely boring at some parts but i think the story was great
16399,play it just play it just play it or Gabesgonna use the source gun
16400,"Hello, Gordon!
"
16401,i hate the game that how the rooms look this game is a old game
16402,8/10
16403,It's Half-Life
16404,"Very cool, ok"
16405,"I never bought into the hype of this game when i was growing up, so i never understood why the community begged for Half life 3 / Half life Episode 3. After a friend played through these games, and then again with me on Co-Op, I can now see the fandom behind this series. Half-Life was very enjoyable and had plenty of interesting parts that held my attention, plenty of hard parts that had me going, and a boss fight that was ..... interesting. The Story of half life is bonkers, especially if you read what they were going to do for Episode 3.

I've never played any half life game up until the last 2 months. Highly recommend playing Co-Op as well, despite significantly more bugs in all half life games."
16406,The action is awsome.
16407,One of my favourite game series
16408,Old but fun
16409,"The kind of game you must finish before you die. If you stuck at some point, just read a guide! You'll not regret it when you finish the game."
16410,its a classic and the best FPS games ive ever played
16411,old but fun
16412,"the game is pretty good, the soundtrack is amazing, the graphics are outdated but still acceptable, the atmosphere is also good. 8/10
"
16413,"Half-Life is a good game.
Make yourself a favor and get it.

16418,"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Freeman the wise? I thought not. It's not a story Gman would tell you. It's a Black Mesa legend. Darth Freeman was a Dark Lord of the Theoretical Physics, so powerful and so wise he could use Physics to influence the Xen dimension to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Physics is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be scientific. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."
16419,yer daddys on fiiiree
16420,As of 2020 it still holds up and is as fun as when it came out back in 98
16421,The gunplay is better than in 2 lol
16422,This game gave me a headache but it was worth it. 8.9/10
16423,"It may be an old game but it's still a lot of fun.  As they say: an ""Oldie but a goodie..."".  A fair challenge when played on the toughest level and a fun ""speed run"" when played on the easiest level."
16424,AMAZING
16425,this game is sort of hard for me but it has good gameplay and enough enemies.
16426,This game gave me an irrational fear of swimming.
16427,"A fun, action packed shooter with lots of nice secrets and lore inside of it."
16428,"One of the first games that changed the sci-fi game industry, great start, great story. Highly recommend if you don¬¥t mind the old look of 00¬¥s games"

"

Such a rich detailed story and love the setting of this game. A true classic!"

16436,[spoiler] big fetus with big head die [/spoiler] :)

16448,Very good graphics. Nice gameplay. 10/10
16449,best game all  time 10/10
16450,"This was one of the best games I have ever played. There's a reason this was tagged as ""Masterpiece."" In Half-Life you play as a scientist by the name of ""Gordon Freeman."" Gordon faces combat puzzles that you must solve to escape the Black-Mesa facility after a Resonance Cascade. The game is really fun, especially after you make a good plan and execute it flawlessly. That is, up until the ending. At the end you go to an alien world named, ""Xen."" The game sacrifices everything for cool visuals (keep in mind that they're obviously bad by today's standards.) I would quit at Xen, but it's worth every cent."

16461,"Finished it a few days ago and I love almost everthing about it. 

what a classic"
16462,"While I cannot disagree with the fact that Half Life 1 was revolutionary for it's time, I have to be brutally honest and say it simply doesn't hold up anymore by today's standards of game design and gameplay and I really didn't enjoy the game much.

This review is still positive because it of course wouldn't be fair to judge a 20+ year old game by today's standards. I just want to give people who might expect otherwise a heads-up."
16463,It's a gud game

16467,"I really loved this game! I am really surprised that in 22 years there is 0 games with such a big story line! One thing I absolutely love, is that with your crowbar you can almost destroy everything and almost interact with everything. I am really surprised that a game which was made 22 years is still in top 10 of FPS games! I really loved this game and if you have spare 8 dollars then buy this game and experience for yourself! Thank you Valve for making such a good game! All of Valve games are good and that is what I love about Valve!"
16468,This game is good better than I thought it would be.  It's just a master piece for it's time.

16470,"Kind of a slow start but it picks up about a quarter of the way in. The action's rather good when you encounter it. I found Half-Life packed with a surprising amount of environmental puzzles, many of which were easy enough to understand but the in-game physics made them frustratingly clunky to execute. I see what the developers were going for but a few obstacles came across as obtuse. For example, some enemy vehicles you can destroy while identical others you strangely can't. I also got stuck on a particular level because I didn't know you had to duck-jump onto a box; why not just add one more knee-high box to the pile? Overall though, Half-Life still became addictive in its gun-battling and its (mostly) clever level design. I can understand why it was so groundbreaking in its day."
16471,"I love this game it is such a classic and it started one of the greatest franchises ever. I love the gameplay, the npcs, the unique weapons, and the sci fi aliens."
16472,"i am with the science team
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
16473,After accruing a N I C E playtime count I'd say just play it already. It can run on basically any potato pc these days. Don't miss out on this classic.

16484,"I'm Sean Prime and I approve of this game!
"
16485,"You've got to hand it to these guys. Valve Software is a start-up, a relative unknown, with no track and, really, no business making such a mighty game. But mighty it is, the best single player shooter I've ever played.
It will be hard for some--mainly those who haven't played the game--to put their finger on exactly what everyone is raving about. There's nothing exceptional about the engine--it's a heavily modified version of Id Software's Quake. Its genre, the first-person shooter, has nearly been beaten to death. Its design couldn't be simpler: get some guns, run, shoot, jump; no laborious cutscenes or misplaced RPG elements here.

The weapons aren't spectacular either, just your usual array of realistic modern firearms and a few alien gadgets with some new twists. The creatures in some respects are fairly standard, and many of the levels have been done before. Taken separately, no particular element in Half-Life shines above the rest, nothing makes or breaks the game.

No, the real secret is that Half-Life is truly the sum of its parts. It takes every element in this oh-so-predictable genre, re-examines it, improves it, and then meshes it with the rest to create a constantly surprising, internally consistent, and always entertaining game.

Here are some examples. How many games have you played where health packs, armor, ammo and guns are simply lying around as if some Power-Up Santa Claus had emptied the contents of his pack on the floor? You can almost hear the level designers saying to themselves, ""Okay, a health pack would be a good item to put in this otherwise empty room.""

In Half-Life, weapons and ammo are taken from dead soldiers or other logical places, like a weapons locker. Armor isn't lying around in the form of glowing icons or leather helmets--instead, you're wearing a battery-powered hazard suit, but since it's a fairly standard bit of equipment in this secret base, power outlets are conveniently scattered throughout the complex. Doing this makes the game world feel all that much more real. The more real it feels, the more the player is sucked into the game. This is called suspension of disbelief, and while few game developers seem to be aware of it, Valve is and they make it work for them, over and over.

How many times have you shot at a monster only to have it either grimace at you blankly, perhaps firing off a few tepid shots, or slouch and drool while you pick off his comrades? Well, not here. The teams of soldiers you'll fight in Half-Life have to be the toughest, most convincing enemies yet seen in an action game. Where other opponents grunt incomprehensibly, these guys actually yell stuff relevant to the combat, such as ""Fire in the Hole!"" or ""Look out!"" as the grenades go flying. Then they actually try to get away from your grenades. And what's more, they also throw grenades at you.

Grenades might sound like a simple little thing to add to a game, and perhaps it is, but it adds such an extra dimension to the monsters' combat ability that it's almost like playing a whole new genre. Strafe, fire, strafe, fire just simply doesn't work every time. But in every other game, monsters either attack hand to hand, with area affects, or most commonly, with linear shots. It doesn't matter if they're shooting lasers, M-16s, or dollops of hot blue manna, it all comes in a straight line, and it all can be dodged. But change the angle of attack, and it's a whole new game. One little detail--one huge difference.

But that's just part of the appeal of Half-Life's enemies; unlike other games, they also cooperate. Teamwork, for monsters in other games, is if they all happen to be in the same room shooting in the same direction. Here, the infantry squads will split up, trying to hit you from several sides while one guy keeps you pinned or lobs grenades. It's surprising how entertaining well-implemented artificial intelligence can be, and it's probably worth it to play Half-Life just to fight its infantry. There could be a whole game based on nothing but fighting Half-Life's infantry.

Wait, there's more. How many times have you cleaned out one filthy, gory techno-dungeon, only to find yourself at a door that obviously leads to yet another, even filthier, techno-dungeon? How realistic is it to have obvious entrances and exits to levels--and what is a ""level"" anyway? An archaic holdover from Dungeons & Dragons? A convenient way of breaking up the game world so it can be loaded into memory?

Half-Life does away with the arbitrary concept of levels. Instead the world feels like a continuous whole, with small pauses and loads when you move from one area to another. This does create some problems when monsters are placed too close to the transition between mini-levels and you inadvertently strafe from one area to the other, accidentally triggering a load screen. But this problem aside, Half-Life's mini-levels create a more flowing and realistic game world, and so a more immersive one.

And freed from the stereotypical notion of levels, the designers were free to experiment with a wide variety of environments, logically linked and fun to explore. Every room isn't another corridor or another slime-filled dungeon. There are labs and warehouses, monorail stations and gun bunkers, missile silos and parking garages. The bulk of the action takes place in a deep underground military base called the Black Mesa Facility, but it is not confined there. You'll scale a canyon cliff and scamper through a military base. You'll ride weird monorails and climb through pipes full of waste. Virtually every location in Half-Life is interesting and unique.

This variety makes you want to keep playing Half-Life all the way through. How many times have you gotten half way through another game, only to say to yourself, ""Eh, I've probably seen it all. If I keep playing, there will only be more monsters, with more guns, more hit points and more grubby levels."" This is decidedly not the case with Half-Life.

Carefully crafted for the single player experience, every encounter in Half-Life is a new challenge, nearly every room throws out something you haven't seen before, every sound is a worrying cue that something horrible is about to happen. The sheer number of hand-scripted events and little scenes keeps the action moving, giving you a reason to keep playing, if only to see what could possibly happen next. I haven't had so much fun playing a game in years. I have not been frightened by a game in years. I have not dreaded corners like I have dreaded corners in this game in years. Half-Life is a superbly ambient game.

Is the game perfect? Of course not. Some of the elevators have a horrible sticking problem, and the ladders can be awkward to use. Occasionally the game chokes when a huge explosion happens. But these are minor problems.

Slightly more serious is the character of Gordon Freeman, who is rather flat and dry. I realize that the mood and feel Half-Life is very somber, very much in the mold of The X-Files, and a wisecracking Duke Nukem type wouldn't have worked. As a scientist and a specialist trained to deal with hazardous materials, Freeman is the right kind of character to serve as the story's alter ego, but his near total lack of personality--as far as I can recall, he never says anything in the game--leaves a little to be desired. Still, you could make a case that giving him a personality could actually detract from your ability to identify with the character. And certainly, the use of cut scenes or any of the other crude crutches of computer game storytelling would have detracted from the relentless pace of the game and the freedom and control you have over your character."
16486,This game is good. I realy enjoy it. I recommend it.
16487,Classic - one of the original FPS games that elevated the ganra
16488,i love it
16489,better graphics than real life
16490,a little bit long but its fine lol
16491,when the crowbar is government property :(
16492,This game was 2 years ahead of its time.
16493,"Legend games, but i like it."
16494,"This game was pretty fun, I didn't get to beat it all the way but. Still, I didn't see any glitches at all. I'm not gonna say the graphics are the best because the game was made in 1998. a great game for 1998!?"
16495,"Half-Life is one of those games that you *HAVE* to have and experience, it is the definition of thinking on your feet and shooting at the same time, with a story you can follow through easily and be amazed at how deep it can go when you research it; even though it is now ""old"" it doesn't lose it's grip to impress you in some way or another.
Oh yeah, this game has so many mods, that it's just, over-whelmingly fun to play them all and have a blast with it.
So yeah, get this game."
16496,"People new to the Half-Life franchise may wan't to skip this game, as it is easy to just watch a playthrough of it, or just read a summary of the story somewhere online, and many aspects of it are very outdated, especially the graphics and textures. Although playing this game isn't a requirement, it is still a very good game, and I would still recommend it.

Here are some reasons you should play it:
[olist]
[*] It's a great, 10-20 hour experience.
[*] It's low price.
[*] Although the graphics are outdated, the designs of the enemies and NPCs are still pretty good.
[*] It has nice selection of weapons that you discover along the way.
[*] It has very satisfying gunplay.
[*] It has a good story.
[*] It has fairly well-designed puzzles.
[*] It has a great soundtrack.
[*] It has great sound-design.
[*] It's fun to speedrun (for those interested).
[/olist]"
16497,"Play it, you won't regret it."
16498,"This game is amazing! I love it so much, I little bit on the challenging side at moments. But it hasn't aged a bit, (From my perspective)"
16499,"In my opinion Half-life 1 is like a 6/10. I found this game pretty boring. the campaign is average. Each enemy felt the same. I also do not understand how Gordon is considered a good protagonist, even though he does not speak and is considered a good guy even though you could kill scientist's and security guards, you know your allies. The multiplayer was slightly below average but also not many people where on the servers. HL1's multiplayer is slightly different than HL2DM(new game but still has the arena elements) and OpFor(which was very similar but had more weapon variety but the maps where still shit) 

this is just my opinion, I know i have a very unpopular opinion. I know almost everyone will comment saying my opinion is wrong or something else.  But thank you for reading my post.

Here is a pros and cons list in my opinion

Pros
The soundtrack
The weapon design 

Cons
The multiplayer 
The enemy placements

16500,this game 100% needs a remake
16501,"I mean it's Half Life. If you haven't played it yet then you should. You've had 20 years so get to it. Also don't play source it's a buggy mess and just makes the game worse.
"
16502,Nice.
16503,Pretty cool game. Gameplay is great and holds up really well. Graphics are outdated but have that old school charm. You should definitely play it if you haven't already.
16504,I enjoyed it for what it is.
16505,its a classic

16519,10/10... its half-life what did you expect?
16520,"Who am I to not recommend Half-Life?
Storyline, gameplay, creativity."
16521,It's just good.
16522,"Take Quake's stellar movement and its engine, add a near seamless narrative containing subtle morality choices and questioning from beginning to end, make the combat encounters moreso strategic than skill based and that's Half Life. While the majority of the game is stellar, memorable and fun to play through, chapters like Surface tension, Interloper and Nihalanth substantially sour the experience, especially on the hardest difficulty."
16523,It's a fun game. You should play it.
16524,Time to choose.
16525,"Suit up as Gordon Freeman, a silent doctor who has to make his way through the alien-infested Black Mesa facility and has to fight his way through various enemies. The gameplay is simple without too many gimmicks, but a fun experience nevertheless."
16526,one of the best games ever!!!!!!!!!!
16527,Good game if you like a challenge......Also great story on the 2 one

16554,"the game that started every FPS game possible (if it wasnt for Quake ofc)
man, what a game! i remember being my first FPS game i played. the plot, characters, design when i was a kid was completely amazing, and it still is. i love how Half-Life franchise started here, from a simple GldSrc game to a Source one. not to talk about its betas/prototypes, expansion packs (Blue Shift, Opposing Force, Decay...) and many mods (official like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress / non-official like They Hunger and Echoes). those are an extra of what the GldSrc Engine game are capable of.
concluting that Half-Life is still worth playing at the present times, in Story Mode, Multiplayer Games and in-depth stories, mysteries and experiences about the games/franchise just to place together the pieces of the puzzle."

16558,"I can see why this game was not only influential in first person shooters, but also in video games in general. This is probably one of the first action games to have a deep story and prove that both RPGs and adventure games are no longer the only ones that could tell stories."

16571,What can I say that others can't. It's a classic!
16572,Very fun. More fun then a lot of todays games campaigns.
16573,"Very fun game that I played in this god forsaken pandemic, good for horror-ish shooting. If you don't like that, then you won't like this. It's also jank as fuck but it doesn't ruin the experience for me, but it might for players who don't like that. Also this game is hard as shit. I'm not exactly an expert gamer:tm: so I had to play on easy for me to get anywhere at all, so keep that in mind and even then I save-scummed alot.

I like most of the weapons that aren't the shotgun since they're fun and they get their use in most situations (except the shotgun). The sound-mixing is really good at creating that atmosphere. There are also little things that I really like such as the dialogue from the npcs or the fact that the ai for the human enemies is actually pretty smart, creating a good challenge. 

Has a few flaws that are definitely noticeable. First is the lack of subtitles, which can be modded in, but if you do, the save files for the original game will not be compatible so you will have to start over with the mod specifically. I think that valve should've added a patch with subtitles in the game itself considering it's been over 20 years. Xen and the final boss are the jankiest of the jank in the whole game with bad platforming being a core element of these last few stages. Chapter 7 + 8 are probably my least favorite outside Xen because I think the enemy from c7 should've been slightly nerfed (not a fan of it in general) and c8 is slow as fuck and kinda boring. The fact that the guard and scientist models are mostly the exact same annoys me a bit, especially since there's no women at all in the game. These aspects didn't ruin the game for me, but I probably won't be replaying it soon, though I would still recommend it to players who like challenging shooters with 1998 jank.

[h1]HOW THE FUCK IS THIS GAME CONSIDERED EVEN REMOTELY GOOD[/h1]"
16576,"THE GAME THAT STARTED IT ALL
Back in the 1990s, First Person Shooters were nearly all identical in design philosophy, with your game either being Doom, or a Doom clone.  Every new FPS had the same formula, with its own stylistic changes, Doom was a Sci Fi game with light horror elements, Duke Nukem 3D was a ode to 80s action flicks, and Quake, while being in 3D, was just Doom with a darker tone. That is in no means a diss to these games, they are all great games from this time period, and my profile picture is Duke Nukem right now for crying out loud, but it was the truth. FPS games hadn't had a real major change in terms of gameplay, and by 1998 it was getting old. You can only go so far rehashing the same type of game before it gets old, and it was very true for the Doom type shooters. 

And this is where our savior GabeN steps in.

Back in 1996 two former Microsoft developers Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington formed their own Game studio in Valve, and quickly  began work on Half-Life. Releasing in 1998 it was a huge success, surpassing anyone's expectations.  Critics praised it to the sun, and the consumers came out in droves to buy it. Very few game developers can make as big an impact with their first game as Valve did with Half-Life. For example iD software,  the developers of the father of FPS games Doom, started out with the mediocre Commander Keen, a Mario clone for PC, and the successful, but not majorly so Wolfenstein 3D before they got to Doom. Even Nintendo, the most iconic game company of them all, took over a decade to release a hit game, and that is without mentioning the near 90 years before they were making Video Games. But what made this game so huge?

It may seem hard to believe now, but Half-Life was mind blowing in 1998. This was a FPS game with a great story, great graphics (at the time), and groundbreaking gameplay. The games story seems rather simple today, but back in 1998 this was revolutionary. Remember that this was a time before stories were common in games. Most games, especially first person shooters, would have only the bare minimum of a story, for example Doom's story is basically just Demons break through a portal from hell to a human colony on Mars, and to even know that you would need to read the manual Doom shipped with. I still don't even know what Quake 1's story is supposed to be about, if there even is one. Half-Life did things completely different, by opening the game with a bit of a slow burn tram ride into your work, the Black Mesa Research Facility. Once you get off the train you are met by a Security guard, who may or may not be Barney Calhoun who brings up your running late. You soon run into a scientist who tells you that they are waiting for you in the test chamber in perhaps one of the most unsettling ways possible, which is an excellent use of foreshadowing. Before you head there you must go to your Locker room and grab your HEV suit, and maybe blow up some guys microwave casserole on the way. You arrive at the test chamber shove some alien rock into a machine and then everything goes to utter shit, with you briefly teleporting into an alien world, and return with Black Mesa overrun with aliens, and utter carnage. I won't spoil anymore, as there are a few more twists throughout the campaign that it is best you don't know about if you don't know already. 

The gameplay in Half Life is pretty standard, with a collection of your standard FPS weapons, such as the Pistol, Revolver, Shotgun, Assault Rifle (complete with a scarface style grenade launcher attachment), and a somewhat unique weapon in the crossbow. But before you get any of these, you start with a trusty Crowbar, which has in turn became an iconic part of not just half-life, but Valve as a whole. It's a slow burn to get these weapons, and you don't want to overuse them when you do get them as ammo is limited, so it is best to use the right weapons for the right enemies. There are some more unique weapons in the game as well, but it is best to let you discover those yourself in my opinion. 

The enemies in Half Life are all quite iconic now, with the Headcrab, Valves own version of the Alien Facehuggers, the 'Zombies' which are human corpses take over by said headcrabs, Vortigaunts, which are a really unique alien who can shoot orbs and teleport and an array of others, many of which are best encountered going in blind. 

As you progress through Black Mesa you will come across many scripted events that allow the game to tell its story without forcing you out of the gameplay once which is something that even to this day is unique and quite awesome. 

The graphics were great at the time, but didn't age very well looking back, which is too be expected when returning to a game from over 20 years ago. 

And if that isn't enough to sell how damn important this game is, release this is the game that the original Counter-Strike was a mod for, and also the game that Team Fortress Classic was a mod for. Both games Valve scooped up and started selling physically with Half-Life in a bundle that lead to this very platform, Steam, created so Valve could keep Counter-Strike and any other games they make up to date easily. 

Now no game is perfect and let me get this clear to end this review their are some decently large flaws with this game which boils down to 2 things. The platforming sections, which aren't terrible, but don't really fit in either, and the elephant in the room, the last 2 hours of the game. The platforming is easy to excuse as at the time it wasn't bad and was pretty decent, but it is the section of the game that has aged the worst, the last 2 hours of the game on the other hand, were lackluster even for 1998 standards, and Gabe Newell himself has stated it is the one thing he wish he could change in a Valve game. There are also a few other sections that haven't aged well, most notably the section on a rail, where you need to take an annoying raid on a kart, but aside from these 3 problems, the game has aged very well. 

Overall I 100% recommend you play this game, preferably before you play Half-Life 2 which has aged a bit better,  as for $10 normally and as low as  $0.99 on sale it's a no brainer,  where you can't go wrong. I also strongly advise you stay far away from Valve's official Source port of the game Half-Life Source with the exceptions being if your buying the Valve Complete Pack or play Gmod and really want OG Half-Life materials."
16577,"outdated but significant, just like terminator titanic or jurassic park.
Far from required, but if you wanna dwelve into the lore of video game history (PC), this is a good start, or THE start to be precise as far as mainstream PC gaming in general is concerned. its pretty good 7.5/10 today with that in mind. Out of bounds rating when released
might be slightly biased. i guess for zoomers this is like shit, but this was the shit"
16578,Definitely shows its age but a very good time so far! Best played with a friend in voice chat so you can make jokes about Gordon opening doors by headbutting them. Props for not having that issue older games seem to have where Tabbing out makes it next to impossible to tab back in. That's probably the most impressive part to me since Bioshock has that issue and it came out like 10 years after this game.

16597,"I'm not a fan of FPS in general but i played this on the free period before the ""Alyx"" game released.

In general, it's a solid shooter at least for its own age.
the graphics are outdated but thanks to valve they kept updating the game to work on new system which is a good thing from the developers.

The story doesn't seem that ""deep"" and ""interesting"" as others would say. it's a classic game of a scientific experiment gone wrong causing aliens to appear and you will be of course the hero who will kill all of them.

People would refer to that mysterious figure appearing at the end of the game and taking all kind of BS theories about him to give the story some ""depth"" but in the end it's pretentious and plain exaggeration to say the least.

one thing i particularly liked about the game is the loading system which doesn't require a loading screen on its own but the game will automatically load the next area the moment you step into it. that means you won't have to wait for a loading screen and also it'll give a feeling or continuity rather than interruption.

in general it's a classic game for shooters lovers but not me."

16632,"Finally got around to playing this ""classic"" from 1998, and wow... just wow... what an utter disappointment.

I'd say this game aged poorly, but I have doubts it was any good to begin with.  While not the worst game I've played, not by a long-shot, it is still not something I'd recommend.

The first issue I had where the movement controls.  I've played arena shooters so I know what a fast running speed fells like.  However, it feels like Gordon is wearing roller skates in this game.  Combine that with the precision platforming, (yes in a FPS), and you have a formula for frustration.

The game also has some lousy signposting even for 1998 standards.

Then you have the enemies who do insane amounts of damage, especially at later levels, on even the easiest difficulty.  The hit detection can be wonky at times.  (Died on time to an enemy soldier despite me having his head right in my cross-hairs and firing full bore at nearly point blank range.) 

I lost count of the number of times I rolled my eyes at a cheap death.  It got boring.

I really tried to like this game.  I wanted to love it, but I can't.  It got so bad that in order to just finish it I activated cheats, I was so fed up.

I doubt I will ever replay this, and have no idea how this became a ""classic.""

16634,"Run, Think, Shoot, Live. This game is fast paced and methodical with planning out how you're gonna kill the enemy before hand. Giving it tension like you could be seen by a soldier at any moment while planning if you move a little too much, making sure to have back up plans in case. plus its narrative, I'm not going it to spoil for the 6 people who haven't played this master piece of a game.

16638,"This game is very good, but it is actually very scairy at some times and places. the graphics are very good for being so old"
16639,best game ever other than half life 2
16640,"I've never played the half-life series and always heard good things about them, but I didn't have the consoles growing up so I never played them. Playing this in 2020, I enjoyed it, reminded me of simpler times. But I wasn't particularly wowed by it. Or at least not enough to understand the hype around the series. Looking at other shooters of the time, South Park 64, Quake II, Tom Clancy's Rainbox Six, Dark Forces II, it really was impressive. I remember the graphics from Dark Forces and Rainbow Six, so Half life did shine among them I'm sure.

The game was fun, the story was lacking, the long line from start to finish being mostly seemless was nice. That said, while little details like microwaving the soup until it explodes, the vending machines, little bits of dialogue saying hi to Freeman... all that was nice, but I felt there was a distinct lack of story. I only knew that I was Gordon, I was going into work for something. Then I go press a button because someone told me and all hell breaks loose. Then for some reason we're the ones who HAVE to go and do a bunch of stuff. I guess it's because Gordon's the only one with the hazard suit on? Or because he's the only scientist who hits the range and gym? I'm not sure. But putting that aside, when there was small bits of exposition it was barely enough to tell you a vague objective and I often was doing puzzles because I saw them and figure'd I just needed to do it, not because anyone explained why. I did the whole rocket-kills-the-alien puzzle without having any idea WHY I was doing it and it was only after the alien died that I realized that I was doing that to open up the hole to travel some more. Then, the game ends in the way that it does and we're left with no particular answers or clues as to why this strange person is giving us a portal home or what they really want. Is it the mystery that got people intrigued? I don't understand. I hope that by playing the second game I'll get it some more, but while the first half-life is fun, and was unique in some ways, it just seems like a solid game to me and something to inspire a million decadeslong memes about half-life 3 never ever. I guess I'll learn more later.

Good game, worth the price, plays well on windows 10. Pick it up."

16647,"""If you thought all action games were the same...""

""...Think again.""
- Half-Life Box.

Absolute Poetry and the best way to describe the game. 

Half-Life isn't your Brother's quake, it isn't your papa's Doom, and it surely isn't your granddad's Wolf 3d. Half-Life is something else. The enemies are dangerous, always present, and their tactics always change. You can't just go in and shotgun a marine, then move on. No, because you will waste a lot of ammo on one of them, and by the time they are down, about 3 others have probably dog-piled you. You need to use every one of your weapons to their full effect, and find creative uses for all of them, in order to not only kill your enemies, but to also flush them from cover and into your gunfire. They know how to use their weapons like professionals (Because they're mostly army grunts), and you are nothing but a lonely scientist. What are you going to do to fight them?

Answer: Superior Intellect.

Because of this, Half-Life is an incredibly unique and fun action FPS which is doubtlessly timeless. While many prefer HL2, I will always have a soft spot for Half-life. And hey, if you are reading this review, then you can thank Half-Life for putting Valve on the map, and subsequently making Steam. So, there's that!

Half-Life is daunting, challenging, and tough as hell. But remember:

Run.
Shoot.
Think.
Live.

HŒªlf-Life gets a solid 8.9/10 from me. The physics are slightly janky, but it is fun as hell."
16648,Yeah this game is a f*cking masterpiece. Valve set the bar for FPS games way back in 1998. Everything about this game is revolutionary. 10/10 everyone should play this game along with sequels

16656,"No exaggeration, one of the greatest games in history. The way cinephiles watch Citizen Cane or music fans listen to The Beatles anyone who cares about the history of video games have to play Half Life. It doesn't age well, especially in graphics, but in many ways this is among the most soulful games in the world"
16657,Wonderfull
16658,"This game isn't perfect. But I think the experience as a whole makes up for it's shortcomings. First, I'll get to what I don't like about this game.
Half-Life has a big departure from classic FPS level design. Instead of a maze shooter where you find switches/keys to progress in the level, Half-Life's formula is relatively linear. Although this isn't necessarily bad, the game will feel very dumbed-down to someone who is used to Doom and Build engine games. There are a few levels that are a bit more open, but they all usually are long, boring, or tedious. 
But besides that (and a couple glitches), I had a lot of fun playing this game. I think the weapons are fun, the mechanics nice to mess around with, the enemies enjoyable to battle, and the story interesting to think about. I think if you're a fan of classic FPS's, you should play this game if you haven't already. Even if you aren't usually one to play first person shooters, check this one out."

16663,"7 / 10. Painstakingly tedious.

Half-Life is one of those games that are so known that it's kind of impossible to say something bad about. The nostalgia googles are on and no-one's keen on taking them off.

Dubbed ""one of the three titans"" (alongside Unreal Tournament and Quake III: Arena), this was a must play at the turn of the new millennium. The internet cafes were crowded with people playing the titans and also other less mentioned games (like Delta Force or Rainbow Six). The thing is... everyone played multiplayer (death match) and mostly the mods: Wanted, Opposing Force, Counter-Strike. Almost no one would play single player.

I remember asking people in the day if the single player experience was any good, but most players told me they either hadn't played it or that is wasn't all that great. As someone who hasn't played the single player experience back in the day, I can surely say that playing this game decades later is a whole different experience that it would have been in '99.

Visually, the game looks great for the time it came out. It has it's distinct look and feel but after finishing the game, I do feel that a lot of elements were inspired by games that were happening in that time frame, especially Action Quake II (which is funny as Counter-Strike would become the spiritual successor), Unreal (the Xen levels) and Duke Nukem as far as some panels and details go.

What I find particularly weird is that later iterations and mods (DM, CS) would bring more improvements which were never back-ported. I really wonder why they didn't take the time to keep all games at the same level of detail.

The sound is generally bad. I understand that positional sound was a great thing at the time, but for the most time you can't really understand what anyone's saying. The sound options don't have any effect on the game. Music is nice but it's so rare that you'll probably miss it. I found myself actually listening to external music because everything was too bland.

Gameplay is where the mishmash comes in. Controls are dated. Very clunky, needing very high coordination for some areas. Some jumps require perfect timing. Climbing and descending stairs was never a strong point, but that fall damage really hurts (you get less damaged from enemies than from the fall damage).

The first 3rd of the game is really good. You feel engaged. Everything is done and detailed in a perfect manner. After this point, the game quickly comes to a crawl because every 5 minutes you'll encounter precisely engineered annoyances. Every step you take you'll get shot, jumped-at, exploded, stalked, etc. It becomes so tedious that a typical player would just consider it's not worth the effort. Everything is scripted to be against you. If this game was made today, I would say that developers purposely made the game hard, but that was the way of thinking for the time.

The puzzles are so prevalent that I feel this game is a Puzzle game with Shooter elements and not the other way around. And everything lacks detail. You either get it or look up a walkthrough. Hints are rarely introduced and there isn't any map or general guidelines.

There's a handful of bugs which sometimes can stop the player's progress. Saving is plentiful. Save scumming is essential. You don't take too many steps without the need to reload. All these traps and forced difficulty really play a toll on your nerves and overall opinion.

Balancing is mostly ok, but sometimes munition is lacking. A third of the game I couldn't find any magnum ammo. The Xen levels are the worst offender. The Hive Hand would be your main choice and it slows everything to a crawl (shoot, miss, wait for reload, repeat). Some weapons are introduced too late and some items are too abundant (there's not too many uses for the tripmine).

Enemies are not too diverse. Some of them, like the soldiers, are overpowered (grenades every few steps, with pinpoint accuracy). There's not such thing as stealth. Every enemy knows where you are. There's no point in having a silent crossbow if the enemy shoots you before you even have the time to target them. Scripted events make enemies invulnerable. Also there are some triggers that never get disabled (and always spawn new enemies).

Overall the experience is ok, but with a lot of highs and lows. Playing it in short sessions is the key to beating the game.

As I was saying earlier, this game would have been a great deal in it's day, but it doesn't stand the test of time. It's all down to personal tastes, but I feel that this game is just ok, that very rare mainstream ok game. Looking back at Shooters made in the second half of the '90s, I dare say Half-Life wouldn't have even been on my top-choices list."
16664,Very good game overall. Some sections are a bit lackluster like the parkour sections and the final few chapters but I'd say that the rest of the game is a magical experience. If you've never played the game before I'd definitely suggest purchasing it.
16665,11/10
16666,i only played this because it has a hot guy on the cover
16667,this game was one of the best games i have played. Its hard at times but it was great playing it
16668,"Classic first-person shooter game, worth playing again and again."
16669,Classics are classic.
16670,pretty fun
16671,"A blast from the past and a must-buy for FPS fans, if only for the historical value. There are some strange bugs though, which I never noticed when I was a kid, but luckily nothing too serious."
16672,"Pretty amazing that a game from this long ago still holds up as being really enjoyable, and easy to recommend playing after this long. Incredible atmosphere, great design. The movement will absolutely frustrate you nowadays but it's still a classic FPS obviously."
16673,"This is my hiding spot, and I'm not moving until the situation has drastically improved! Now go away! And don't tell anyone I'm here!"
16674,first gold :)
16675,"I am 20 and it is weird playing a game older than me.Its my first time completing the game and its still very fun. Jumping is a bit floaty but i loved it overall. It deserves to be called a classic.
P.S: Do not use the new HD Models for your Weapons."
16676,perfect game
16677,fun
16678,perfect
16679,gg
16680,play this game if you have fingers
16681,Just a fun classic game. It's a little dated by todays standards but dang if it isn't fun.
16682,"my dad bought me this before he left to get cigs and im still playing waitng for him to come back
"
16683,"Wow, I have not yet completed it, but it is genuinely amazing, it is challenging and it has an amazing plot, I played the second one instead of the first one first. (Did not completed it). But wow, it is awesome even if the graphics are shit, they did not age that bad to be honest, totally awesome and I am in the rail chapter. 11/10"
16684,"this game will age really well, not by the graphics however but through the gameplay"
16685,game been lagging for the past week
16686,nice game
16687,COME ON ITS HALF LIFE
16688,"Good game but harder than my dick..
 I don't know how to feel about that"
16689,gud gayme
16690,fuckign awesome sick old time with the buds in the old half life radiative mates and yeah.
16691,"publisher is not valve lol
the publisher is sierra."
16692,Re-visiting an old classic. It still holds up.
16693,The legendary game!
16694,Fantastic game. I prefer Half life 1 over 2. Has much more re-play ability and is overall more enjoyable to replay.
16695,extremely fun for an old game
16696,v cool
16697,this is a good game to play when you are stoned out of ur mind
16698,its half life
16699,yes
16700,Its only a real Legend
16701,good game
16702,One of the best games of all time.  Single or Multi Player versions are classic now.
16703,freeman is a fool
16704,"even being as dated as it is, still was really fun to play"
16705,"One of the best Classic FPS games that changed the genre for the better. Besides some minor hiccups with the barren alien world ""Xen"", and the maze of ""On a Rail"" it's levels give great and varied set pieces that are still fun to shoot and crowbar your way through even today."
16706,"It's half-life,  what did you expect?"
16707,good
16708,"I really enjoyed this game back in the day when it was new.  Now there is nothing new about FPS,  but the premis the mission i felt was what made the game great.   Your not a commando,  not a superhero or superhuman,  your just a scientist trying to get out alive.  I like that and while its a short game it has replay value.  This is why i recomend it for anyone who want a good story with their shooting."
16709,"It's half-life, just buy it.
But If you want financial advice, buy the Valve Complete Pack during sale.

Now for benefits of really buying it over cracking:
Your opinions are valid since you own the game.
using mods is insanely easy.
You can say you opted in for the beta branch."
16710,"Very well made game, One of the best I have ever played, With great Gameplay and puzzles."
16711,one  of the most classic shooters ever invented.
16712,"A true masterpiece, one of the most important video games in the industry."
16713,h
16714,amazing game
16715,half my life ago this game was already created
16716,literally every single problem with modern fps games started with this and people still think it's good
16717,"The game that started it all... Half-Life laid foundations to FPS genre as we know it today, as well as Steam storefront. Its status is above legendary, and if you haven't played it yet then I have no clue what you were doing with your life until now."
16718,10/10 would get stuck in a door and get infinite health again.
16719,10 out of 10!
16720,"i usually play deathmatch, because it's hella good, but the campaign, the gameplay, and EVERYTHING is awesome as hell. A good purchase of 9.99 USD$ for a great game."
16721,"This game is a classic and came out in a time when the most story out of a game was:""oooo spooky demons"". It's a hard game that will kick you if you think you can just run and gun. like the advertisements say:""run.think.shoot.live."""
16722,"yeah, da great game."
16723,"good ass game
deathmatch is worth the price alone

16726,"Half-life is my favourite game. I love everything about it. I don't have a single complaint except that maybe the fish/shark guy is FUCKING TERRIFYING. 

10/10"
16727,you know its the best
16728,It's pretty decent ngl.
16729,why is it half
16730,"I experienced two subsequent bugs which effectively soft locked my run in the POWER UP stage. Before that the game was a fun, fast paced and atmospheric shooter with interesting level design and an engrossing story. The monster designs were unique and challenging to face. The shooting was visceral and fast; accompanied by a useful movement kit. The story was immersive and surprising; it caught me off guard several times. I heartily recommend the game until the POWER UP stage, and cannot comment past that."
16731,"probably worth spending money on it if you're in for a nostalgia trip. if you think that's it, there's couple of fan-made mods around the internet that you can install btw."
16732,play it

16738,Nice and casual Shooter and lots of fun.
16739,it's ok
16740,Good
16741,Epic story-telling and multiplayer (aka crossfire)
16742,"The moral of Half Life is to not show up late to work or else you'll end up fighting a giant baby in an alien world.
"
16743,"Playing a game that is 3 years older than me is crazy, but this game is a true classic that is still fun today, 21 years later!"
16744,"Should be played by everyone interested in video games, just for the historical aspect alone. Aside from that fact, it's a fantastic puzzle shooter that holds up shockingly well with age. This game is still worth way more than $10, so unless you can't afford a big mac combo buy it and play it."
16745,"There is a reason why this game rivals other first-person-shooter games of the 90's, such as Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem, and that reason is the incredibly immersive storytelling; most other games will force exposition dumps upon the player - but not Half-Life! Instead of having to sit through boring exposition and dialogue you have no interest in, Half-Life tells a story with its incredibly immersive world, a world that few other games can rival. The game is one, long journey - no filler, no wasted time, no annoying interruptions, and certainly no times where you are forced to deal with situations in specific ways, which brings me to my next point: freedom; Half-Life is an extremely linear game, which completely contrasts what I just stated about it being linear, but that is where you are wrong! - the linear environments and level designs allow for a well-tailored experience that was built in a fashion that every single weapon (even the weak pistol) is useful. The sheer amount of weapons and options combined with the freedom the player has in using them lends itself to pure freedom for the player in combat, thus giving it some of the greatest combat, if not THE greatest combat, in any FPS game ever made! The game is perfection and has aged like a fine wine in both the game-play and story department, with the tiny exception of ladders (which are clunky nightmares), so I absolutely insist on anybody reading this to buy this game if they are interested!"
16746,"this game is pretty cool but also annoying, its honestly impressive for the time but the collision/hit boxes are really bad sometimes."
16747,"It's a classic. Nothing more to say about it. If you haven't played, you should."
16748,"What else can I say. One of the most famous games of all time. Graphics are heavily outdated, but the story still remains one of the best of all time."
16749,UHHH its half life its sick obviously
16750,"Before:
Never seen a more clunky game in  my life. The big ""masterpiece"" sad fanboys boast about falls short. Pc will never reach console games when it comes to movement; This shit game is the proof proof of it.

After:
Excellent game makes up for it's clunkiness. If they kill off Gordon in future the franchise is dead; nobody likes Alyx."

16767,"I really liked it! I heard over the years that it was good, and I came into the game not expecting much since it was an old game; BUT I was surprised to find that I thoroughly enjoyed it to its fullest! The game has some really nice mechanics for an older kind of game. Music rocks, and the movement can be a little clunky, but its pretty great. Truly a masterpiece that withstood against the test of time."
16768,Game's Great! But how did it get best game award.

16782,"yeet
"
16783,good game but it really creeps me out for some reason
16784,"great game
this is kind of more of a review of half life 2 but like
for sort of the same reasons i like portal more than portal 2, i like this more than half life 2 and the episodes
its a simple concept, essentially just reach the lambda core to go into xen and survive along the way
half life 2 is overblown in a narrative sense, going around a whole city and saving the world
as a setting I like black mesa a lot more than city 17
also while i understand why all the npcs treat gordon like literal jesus in hl2 i think its much more interesting in half life, hes just a guy, the right man in the wrong place
its a lot more believable, hl2 is biblical in proportions
half life is also not gimmicky for the most part apart from on a rail which i do hate but given that thats one chapter out of the whole game that i outright dont like, i think its excusable
and while xen as a whole can get frustrating, i like the setting and i also dont think its that big of a deal as it doesnt feel as boring as literally all of hl2 up until you are in the citadel
in hl2 route kanal, water hazard, ravenholm, highway 17, sandtraps, nova prospekt, anticitizen one, and follow freeman (which is basically all of the fucking game) are all gimmicky as fuck, boring, and frustrating
half life is just better imo in every way
and while i dont hate half life 2, i will probably never play it again while i've played through half life several times already since first getting it a couple weeks ago
and while i do think the difference between portal and portal 2 is comparable to hl and hl2,
with the first being a concise, full exploration of its concepts, i think portal 2 expands on these concepts within the confines of the world set up in the first game in a believable and fun way
there was a lot more of aperture to see and more technology to test
but hl2 fails to expand in that same way because it leaves the setting of half life entirely.
portal 2 takes place sometimes literally in the exact same places as portal, and while i know in opposing force black mesa is destroyed, that doesn't make it not a problem that half life 2 and the episodes are in a completely new setting
in my opinion i dont really agree with the choice to make a sequel to half life
and being disappointed with hl2 makes me appreciate half life a lot more
its probably the best fps of all time
in the genre i dont think anything really compares
and its up there with my favorite games now"

16791,"good game for figuring out things
"
16792,"A great start to a great franchise. Can't believe how well the first couple of Half-Life games hold up. The atmosphere in each game is gorgeous, engrossing, and irreplaceable. It's a distinct style that only Half-Life could pull off. I'll miss the veterans who worked on this game; it's clear those lost influences have impacted the direction of modern Half-Life, for better or worse. But I will always be grateful for the world this introduced, and the influence it has had on the games that came after, the developers it spawned. If you can't tell, I really really really like this game. A lot. Play it. I don't think you'll regret it. This is playable history for an entire industry."
16793,"[h1]Made the FPS genre better[/h1]
Before Half-Life, the FPS genre had almost non-existent storylines that appeared as a paragraph at the end of episodes like in Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake outside of being mindless shooters. Half-Life pushes the stereotype by forcing you to use tactics for dealing with your targets as well as solving physics puzzles. To incorporate the story, this game puts you into the mind of Gordon Freeman. Everything you see, Gordon sees. You commute to his job, talk to the scientists, and overheard the soldiers plans while still being Dr. Freeman."

16806,Hello Gordon
16807,"Somehow, I missed this classic when it was first released.  I got back onto Steam and thought I should catch up.  Even though I'm only two-thirds of the way through, it's been like a page-turner.  Of course, the textures look primitive now, and there are only about 10 different NPC models, but I don't really notice.  The level design is clever for a linear story line -- some puzzles require you to backtrack to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time through.  I especially like how each weapon type is suited for different purposes.  Obviously, if you're new to first-person shooters, you have to play this game, but even if you're a veteran, play this to appreciate how Half-Life influenced many FPSes to follow."

16820,"(No spoilers, and this is an actual review intended for those not familiar with Half-Life)

This game was revolutionary, and a must-play for anyone who is interested in video game history. That said, I think the point of Steam reviews is more about if the game is worth playing on its own merits, and imo this one hasn't really held up super well. There's some things that are still great in modern day, like the atmosphere and sound design (although the actual sound quality is about what'd you expect from the game's era). However, to be honest, I don't think those just looking for a game to have fun in and don't really care about history and 'playing the first Half-Life' and such will get much out of this.

This game has some serious flaws, some of which I've heard even the most die-hard fans acknowledge, and others that apparently are a hot take from me for whatever reason. I think most people agree that the last two chapters are pretty lackluster in terms of level design, as well as some other bits throughout. In general, this game has a lot of 'where the hell am I supposed to go' moments, which can be pretty frustrating, though I can forgive that since to be completely honest I am the sort of person who gets easily lost in both games and real life. (In other words your mileage may vary)

I think the gunplay is this game is generally pretty crappy by modern standards. And I don't mean crappy as in just mediocre, like in Half-Life 2, I mean actually annoyingly bad. My most hated weapon in particular is the MP5 (or the M4 if you're using the HD pack [which don't by the way because it sucks]). Every bullet seems to go left or right and anywhere but what you're aiming at, and not like in Counter Strike or other games where it's an actual pattern you can control. It's just basically unusable, which sucks since you kinda have to use it unless you want to have a very hard time getting through certain sections. Only a few of the weapons have any power to them, due to floaty, dated looking animations. 

The AI is generally pretty good, a bit too good aim-wise in my opinion. You can get pixel-sniped in this game pretty easily, which is especially annoying during some of surface sections. Other than this though you will definitely feel like you're fighting formidable foes throughout the game. Soldiers especially have very complicated scripting in certain areas that make them behave more like real-life soldiers. They will flank, lob grenades, and get to cover to gain the upper-hand. The AI is overall is challenging, but mostly fair.

As many will say and I will agree with is that this game is world-class in storytelling and atmosphere. It starts very slow, setting up the world and events that play, before thrusting you into survival-scavenge mode. I don't have many criticisms here, except that a more robust 'level' (or chapter) select probably would have been helpful, like was done in the sequel. The game generally keeps you immersed very well, with an optional but fairly helpful tutorial level. 

This is a minor nitpick, but I'm generally not a big fan of games have a quicksave feature over more optimal checkpoints, as personally it takes me out of the world because I'm worrying about whether I should save now or wait or whatever. Also, the voice acting, while very funny and something I love to quote to friends, is kinda bad. It's not really the voice actors as much as it's the writing; again though it's pretty funny and honestly one of the parts of the game I cherish. 

In summary, while the game definitely is very important and has very real high points, I don't think someone who doesn't already have an alternative motivation to get through the game is likely to enjoy it nearly as much as people like to say. If you've never played a Half-Life game, to be honest I would recommend skipping this one and its expansions, and just start at Half-Life 2. The sequel is a much better all-around game, and retcons a lot of stuff anyways so it doesn't matter that much to be out of the loop. If you're into older games and somehow haven't played this however, you may be into it.

There are some parts where I needed to consult a guide but those where far between. the game's great, and I look forward to what the rest of the series has to offer, as this is my first time experiencing this landmark series."

16836,"I'm not usually into FPS games. Every single one is the same: you're a military dude, running around in a big open map with all your friends shooting other military dudes. If you shoot enough of them, you win.

This game is the opposite of that. The story is well-crafted. The graphics are quite appealing for how old they are. and it's quite fun to play. The one downside is the difficulty, though you can get past anything with enough attempts.

16837,i played this game for more than 80 hours and i havent even completed it yet
16838,"So much has been said about this game that it hardly feels worth even reviewing, but in spite of the fact that I've been immersed in Half-Life lore and fandom from a young age as a PC gamer and FPS fan, it's only been recently that I've actually picked up the game and played it, so please consider this a review for the benefit of people who may have heard a lot about Half-Life but just haven't gotten around to it yet.

The one thing that everyone praises about this game above all else is the way that it seamlessly marries story and gameplay, and I have to say it lives up to the hype.  The game is well-structured and paces itself so that the story unfolds at around the same pace that the mechanics do.  It all flows pretty naturally, beginning with Gordon Freeman as a humble scientist and following him as he adapts to a bizarre situation and becomes something much bigger than he was before, and this whole time the level design organically teaches you the game's basic mechanics and encourages you to use them to get better at the game at your own pace, so you never feel like you're being left behind but it also never feels like you're having your hand held either.  The story is rarely if ever intrusive, meaning that you can enjoy the depth of Half-Life's story at your leisure if you please or you can just treat it like a fun shooter and ignore the story entirely.  It's up to you.

The gameplay isn't without its quirks.  There's a lot more platforming than one would expect, a product of the age in which Half-Life was developed.  If you're not accustomed to platforming in first-person it may take some getting used to.  Crouch-jumping also doesn't feel quite as smooth as it is in more modern games, but with practice you'll get the hang of it.  There were only one or two moments where the platforming felt intrusive and out-of-place and they were generally short enough to be forgiven.

Some friends I've spoken to take umbrage with the inventory system in Half-Life, preferring the more conventional weapon-swapping system in which you use the scroll wheel to cycle through weapons, whereas here the scroll wheel cycles through a menu that you have to pick a weapon from.  At first this seems like a bizarre choice even for the time, but on reflection I actually quite like this system, because it adds an extra second of panic when you're trying to swap weapons in combat and that works really well with the story.  Gordon Freeman is not a trained soldier, he's a scientist who happens to have a suit of power armor on; he's not trained to deal with the stress of combat and that's reflected in that extra second of clunkiness you'll get when you switch weapons.  Sure it's not the smoothest design, but Gordon isn't a smooth fighter, at least not until the events of Half-Life 2 when he's got more combat experience under his belt.

If you absolutely must play this game unspoiled then you can stop reading here assured that I thoroughly recommend Half-Life as a classic shooter with an excellent narrative focus and solid gameplay that still holds up today.  Give it a download, play it through, hunt for some secrets, download some mods, play the Deathmatch mode, have fun.  It's well-worth the ten bucks Valve is charging for it these days and it's certainly worthy of your time.



So spoiler time then: I hate this game.  I'm serious, I fucking hate this game.  Specifically I hate the last few levels, after Gordon teleports to Xen.  If you have friends that played Half-Life you've probably heard them say that the Xen levels are terrible and they really are.  I was having a ton of fun shooting zombies, sneaking around military personnel and alien invaders, and letting the levels challenge me to figure out the best solutions myself in real time.  Then Xen happened, and the entire dynamic of the game changed.  Lower gravity, heavier emphasis on platforming, more numerous and increasingly annoying enemies, really difficult to find ammo, confusing level design, and a constant sense that you have no idea what the game wants from you.

To be clear, I think I would have liked Xen if the game had done a better job of setting it up, but as it stands it comes right out of nowhere and leaves me utterly gobsmacked at how fundamentally opposed to the core design of Half-Life it really is.  I think I know what they were going for: Xen is supposed to be the point where Gordon steps into an utterly unknown world and has to survive on his wits and intuition, but instead what it feels like is my asshole friends stopped Highlander right towards the climax and put Highlander 2 in instead.  And then punched me in the gut.

I was so utterly repulsed by Xen and so frustrated with how bullshit the enemies and level design were at this point in the game that I actually stopped playing.  I will never finish Half-Life.  Why should I?  The game's ending is plastered all over YouTube and the sequel has been out since 2007.  I know what happens, and I know that there's a better game in my library waiting for me to play it.  Why would I waste my time with this crap?

Despite all of my revulsion for the penultimate chapters of the game, however, my recommendation stands, because at its core Half-Life is still a five out of five classic shooter with a well-deserved reputation as an innovator in the market which the industry continues to use as a design template to this day.  It just so happens that right towards the end its five star score to drops down to a two star.  I know that's harsh but I'm trying to give an honest review based on my experience with the game.  Maybe you won't find the Xen levels as offensive as I did and that's fine with me; do enjoy them at your leisure, but you've been warned."
16839,"just.....play it.


just do it"
16840,"Best game I ever played. The story is good and gameplay is good too. I like the online deathmatch too. The gun's are fun to use and some weapons deal lots of damage but don't have lots of ammo for it. The only melee weapon is the iconic crowbar and you get in the second chapter. The pistol is your second weapon you get after the crowbar from a dead security guard. I don't want to talk about every gun in the game but I'm sure there are lots of videos or guides for weapons.

16870,"Half life 1 is a game from 1998, in that times a revelutonary game with a nice story, good fights and awesome graphics, well in that time at least. Now 22 years later, it..... lets get straight to the point, it is just bad, graphics are not even toaster alike, to the point where u actually need to find me a PC wich can NOT run it. The gameplay is too easy, the levels give you no challenges, the midbosses and final boss are no problem and the story is poorly told/just too short. Sometimes u encounter bugs(i get it, every game has them) but i feel like i encounterd bugs very often in hl1 in comparisin that it has this short playtime. I cant recommend anyone playing it if they want to have geniuine fun for getting in the hl franchise, for that i can only recommend the hl1 remake ""black mesa"" wich tells the same story in a better way with better graphics, longer and more challenging gameplay, and just an overall better game. 

HL1 fans will dislike that rewiev, i know it already."
16871,"One of my favorite franchises, I really enjoyed it. Every now and then I replay it and it feels so good!"

16874,>using the hd models
16875,"Absolutely revolutionary for it's time, it redefined the fps genre."
16876,Games ? you love them ? Then this game is for you my friend. As long as you can look at 1998 graphics.
16877,"yeah pretty good ngl
"
16878,"For a game more than 20 years old, the graphic looks low, but the storyline is excellent! The gaming experience is still exciting.

But I should say, the 92F/M4 combination is not as good as the original Glock 17/MP5. Don't they know that M4 use .223 rifle cartridge and 92F is a 9mm? How could they share the same ammunition!?"
16879,i killed scientists
16880,"Coming from games like TF2, and Quake, I initially had a hard time going through this game. Half-Life 1 is not a game where you just run and shoot. Instead, if you want to complete the game without savescumming, you have to pause for a moment, and plan out your actions accordingly. When I had realized this, the game got alot more fun, and alot more interesting."
16881,"Cannot say it didn't have it's good parts, but MAN is the platforming bad, mostly cause of weird control while in the air.
Would've made this game a thousand times better if they had either cut out the platforming or at the very minimum, removed Lambda Core, cause boy howdy that level is the bane of my entire existence.
""Go through this level that consists of unlabeled portals that don't tell you what they do or where they lead to, just jump in and pray to god you don't get fucked!"" is the real catchy slogan for that level, not to mention that there are parts in the alien levels that really get on my nerves as well.
I see why it's considered a classic, but it has some real irritating flaws that should've been ironed out before being released.
Overall, I'd say it's a 6.5/10. It's all right, but really knows how to grind my gears."
16882,"For being an old ass game, it still holds up and is one of valves greatest masterpieces that set the base for the rest of valves quality games."
16883,After playing the portal series (probably my favorite games so far) I decided it was time to play the Half Life games (One down one more to go) and after beating the first game I can say that this is definitely my favorite game after Portal. I loved the story and challenging fights as you made your way through the underground labs of Black Mesa. If your looking for an amazing game to kill your time with during quarantine then I would most definitely suggest this one!
16884,FOR GOD SAKE OPEN THE SILO DOOR! THEY'RE COMING FOR US IT'S OUR ONLY WAY OUT! OH MY GOD WE ARE DOOMED!

16895,v good
16896,my god what are you doing
16897,"What more can be said about this game, Valve is like an unstoppable force of quality and the first time people realised that was with this game. This is seriously the first real attempt at "" Story Driven Video Games"" Half life was a game changer that anyone practiced in the game industry knows about and likes. Half life gets its reputation deservedly, and many many games like to take inspiration from it, like listening to a war veterans stories and writing a book about it. 

The game generally was instrumental in its release era, it threw tons of interesting puzzles and ideas at you and told you to get used to them, you spent a long while trying to find a solution and when you do it feels great, the plot is serious and interestingly original, gordon freeman has a great design, a great feel to him, like he deserves to be where he is and know s how to operate things like the energy weapons. The alien and enemy designs are fun and creative, the atmosphere can scare talibans out of their bomb vests. The underwater parts were frightening and pisspants thriller. The gunplay is solid and satisfying, the Nihilanth Boss fight is god teir with its level design and the ending is god damn wonderful.

There is no such thing as perfection, however, and there were some small issues i have to nitpick, sadly.
The flashlight kinda sucks, its lighting is weird in a way that its more like a concentrated beam of light than a torch, its better than the Opposing Force expansions goggles but still, the AI is clunky, bots that you need to progress need alot of handholding to get where you want, the enemies are really solid for the most part, except for the occasional steph curry perfect grenade throws and those aliens that shoot homing missiles that hit you through walls and stuff. The Xen Climax was also pretty unfair and clunky, i think it was Interloper with the fucking platforming bit that forced you to fly up in the air and inevitably die from fall damage, fuck interloper.

Get this game with the valve bundle to get every valve game. The Half life series is legendary and no valve-made half life game has failed to amaze the time it was released, who the fuck knows WHATS gonna happen after Alyx but considering Half lifes roots as one of the best gane series of all time, all we can do is patiently wait for the next video game revolution"

16907,"There is a bug in chapter 7 that prevents the player to progress... 
there is nothing to be done"
16908,"I mean, It's Half Life..."
16909,"This is really the greatest story-based game I have ever played.

16917,pee pee poo poo good game
16918,Still a great game after all these years. I used to play through the whole of it almost every week growing up. I've seen some newer players on Twitch get put off by the light puzzles and the absence of story cutscenes but I feel this makes it stand out these days and I sometimes wish more modern games adopt the show don't tell type of storytelling that this game has. A timeless classic.

16934,"Back in 1998, Half Life 1 was released, It was ground-breaking. It won a lot of awards. But does the game still hold up? Yea I'd say it does.

However, there are some certain part that have aged. This game being released in 1998, does really show. 
-The Graphics are.. well obviously has aged quite badly. This isn't really fair though as this was of course back in 1998.
-The Movement is pretty janky, You feel pretty slippery and often times you'll accidentally fall of platforms from said slippery movement.
-The weapons are alright, They certainly do a some decent amount of damage.
-The gameplay is wonderful, I had a lot of fun playing this game. It could kill a decent amount of hours.
-The story is pretty alright. It's not too complicated and very simple.
-The music is incredible, I really really love the music. It fits the game nicely, and is really enjoyable.

Overall, If you have a few buck to spare. I'd recommend you buy this game. Like a lot of Valve games, It's pretty cheap on sale."
16935,You should try Half-Life Google Translate Edition.
16936,The most hilarious NPC voice lines of all time. Worth playing just for those scientist screams
16937,"Just a classic fps. I think it's still very fun and playable today. I don't care that much about graphics, but then again I grew up with an NES so my graphical standards are different than some.

17012,I think the half life series is great and you have to play the game but personally I struggled to get through this one due to the graphics in 2020. Most people can get past it but for me I struggled. This is coming from an avid fan of Sonic Adventure 2 but I would still take it with a grain of salt.
17013,"Despite playing  it 22 years after it came out, I still loved it. The gameplay is great, with a wide variety of weapons and many different kinds of enemies to face. The story and the setting it brings really adds to an atmosphere of mystery and discovery as you find a way to escape the situation you've been brought into. I've only played this game once, putting quite a lot of time in that initial playthrough, and I can definitively see myself playing it again in the future. In a world where new games are constantly being developed and improved upon, I think Half-Life will always be a classic that still holds today."

Game 2/10
Value 5/10


Worst game I played. I dont know why is this legendary. Just because of nostalgia , it kept running. Even I (Non Pro Writer) can make a more engaging story than this. The story is "" Opps! Now get out"" stretched too long. This could be the game that can start making me hate my childhood games. A BIG NOOOOOOOO!  This game has nothing to offer. Play ""Portal"" instead.

I thought games like this don't age, well I was wrong.

I didn't enjoyed anything in this game even after completing 50% of it. Unreasonably hard. I am not a fan of good graphics but this game looks disgusting. Very very bad development , I don.t recommend this at all. Even in the discounted price. Portal was 100X more fun than this. Don't know why this is highly rated. Wasted time & money both."
17060,"An incredible romp through 90s fps goodness. Sure it's a bit dated but the combat, immersion and graphics have a real charm to them. ""Interloper"" can suck my ass though."
17061,"Nowadays, this is still considered one of the best puzzle games ever, valve made a good job develping half-life with a bunch of unic weapons, story, mobs and creativity experience.
I would rate this game in 9,5/10."

17063,"It's just a classic, fun game. You can play it for half an hour or three hours at a time. It looks a bit old (naturally) and the movement takes some time getting used to, but overall still a great game! Of course it might also be some nostalgia speaking, but 10/10."

17088,"Honestly, it doesn't really hold up for me. I played through this game because I was interested in knowing the story before starting half life 2, since I got that game during a sale. The story for this universe is very cool and knowing what happens in half life is useful but the gameplay was infuriating. I can recognize that this game was amazing for the time, especially in terms of realism and story-building, but the actual experience of going through this game was like pulling teeth. Enemy placement is designed in such a way that you WILL take damage no matter how cautious you are, enemies will spawn behind you and they will hide behind corners lying in wait. I had to resort to saving constantly because you have to make sure you have enough health to make it to the next health station and some areas REQUIRE you to know what is about to happen or you will take damage from something.

TL;DR: Story is worth knowing, actual gameplay experience is agonizing. Read about what happens then play Half Life 2."

However, the controls are just terrible, especially in the platforming sections. Furthermore, I feel many of the areas are just full of traps for first-time players (like myself), and a lot of my deaths just felt cheap. The hype surrounding this one is not warranted, in my opinion. Hopefully the sequel is better. Overall, I can see this game being an influential piece of gaming history, especially in the FPS genre, with its storytelling and setting. However, I can't say that this game has aged well mechanically."

There are even tons of mods to make the game look more HD, if you can't stand the old school graphics."
17128,"I can‚Äôt help but feel I‚Äôm missing out on something because every single positive review seems to be talking about a completely different game than the one I played. I should specify this is a review of the first 3 hours of the game (I couldn‚Äôt bear it any further) from someone who is completely new to the series, unconcerned with its legacy. 

The graphics and overall presentation hold up fine. They would obviously be considered dated by today‚Äôs standards but they‚Äôre pleasant, if unremarkable, and don‚Äôt break immersion.

The issue with Half-life is... well... everything else. 

The level design is shockingly bad from both an aesthetic and functional perspective. The muted greys of the facility are repetitive and boring and the game somehow fails to make a secret underground nuclear(?) military research base novel in any way. If vents turn you on you‚Äôll be hard as diamonds by the end of this game because the sheer amount of them is staggering. There are puzzles I suppose (I stacked a crate!) but the strongest puzzle is ultimately going to be finding a reason to continue playing. Few if any of the puzzles are engaging or challenging and feel more akin to busywork. 

The layout is twisting and bizarre to the point of having nothing in common with any real life building whatsoever. Its so shockingly so that it constantly breaks immersion and provides no sense of progression. It feels as if the player is merely tossed around different parts of some massive sprawling purgatorial corridor, never gaining a sense of whether they‚Äôre closer or not to the end goal (escape?).

Of course this would not be a complete non-issue if the shooting was the focus and the setting was just an excuse to get the to meat of the game (e.g. mario 64). However that‚Äôs not the case- clever storytelling through gameplay and environment are often touted as a major draw of the half life series. There are certainly instances of this - learning the military is in fact not there to help as you watch scientists gunned down from above, or seeing some poor soul dragged into a vent in the distance, foreshadowing the arrival of (yet more) headcrabs. But these instances are here and there and aren‚Äôt interconnected in any interesting way. 

Furthermore the actual meat of the game (Puzzle solving, FPS gameplay) is‚Ä¶ passable at beast. The shooting is OK. I didn‚Äôt expect much and it delivered wholesale on that expectation. The guns are generic dollar store military weapons and feel underwhelming to shoot.

There‚Äôs very little in the way of mechanics or movement to learn, and the dominant strategy ultimately comes down to simply running past most enemies (the most pleasant way to play the game on hard). On the rare occasion however, the game flips the script and you‚Äôre stuck between hordes of vortigaunt and the exit hoping you don‚Äôt get insta force-lightninged to death while you wield the worst shotgun known to gaming history. Obviously this is 1998 so I‚Äôm not expecting current day AAA levels of feedback and tuning in the gunplay, but compared to something like Doom or even Marathon Half Life‚Äôs gunplay can‚Äôt hold a candle and feels phoned in.

The movement is clunky and has some weird kind of inertia to it. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem in your average FPS but the game is filled with an outrageous amount of platforming over instant death pits (Sometimes several in a row) meaning you‚Äôll be restarting at the same checkpoint over and over unless you‚Äôre save scumming s.t.a.l.k.e.r. style. Another weird design choice in this vein is crouch jumping. It‚Äôs unclear to me why crouch jumping is so heavily implemented in the game. It feels janky and adds nothing whatsoever. Why not just let Freeman jump higher? 

The ladders make me want to blow my brains out. 

I can‚Äôt say whether the story picks up later or not but the beginning has nothing to offer. The silent protagonist is a theoretical physicist who works with highly dangerous alien materials. This seems novel, and a welcome change from the characters that seem typical for the genre. But nope. Half life is just an cool man who kills aliens and doesn‚Äôt afraid of anything. 

On hard the difficulty is inconsistent, ranging between easy (most segments with the soldiers) to extremely punishing (office with the vortigaunts), and the game rarely finds a way to slowly build up difficulty or create a skill curve. 

There are some novelties in this game, and those occur when the puzzles mesh with the combat, like leading superior numbers of enemies past a room filled with turrets while you dash behind the boxes to avoid getting shot. This is good fun and I imagine this is what made the game a hit, but for every one of these moments there‚Äôs another level segment filled with god awful platforming, crate stacking, and vents. 

I‚Äôd give it a 2/5 at best. There were things to like about it and it‚Äôs clear the game was hugely influential but poor design choices and underwhelming FPS gameplay middle this title and prevent it from holding up alongside other FPS classics."

"
17137,"(i have played this game during a free week 3 or so months ago, please do take this review with a grain of salt, as i haven't finished the game yet, but i will update this review once i do)
Oh man, where do i start? This game is incredible in so many ways! For starters, it blends puzzle horror and action elements beautifully and everything is very well paced. Never are you too scared, too stressed, or too worked up. It's quite amazing how the devs managed to strike such a good balance, they've hit the nail on the head! 
Often times you'll find yourself doing very interesting and fun enviromental puzzles, or going through small airvents cluttered with all sorts of diffrent creatures, or gunning down Marines with grenades, shotguns, crossbows, fuck it, even crowbars, if you're an absolute masochist!
The game also heavily rewards you for exploring and taking your time to search through every nook n' cranny and smashing every box you can find. the rewards are pretty basic, but often time much needed.
The difficulty is never really an issue, because the game is fair and rather forgiving, however, sometimes when doing risky jumps and manuevers it can be a little frustrating, atleast in my experience, although i might just be bad at fps platforming. either way, nothing deal breaking, just a bit of a incovinience

Overall, if you haven't played this game before for whatever reason, do yourself a favour and pick it up, even if you're a pussy like i am, i guarantee you'll be able to pull through even with all the Headcrabs popping out of vents, and Headcrab Zombies bursting through walls, you'll get used to it eventually, and come to expect it"
17138,Killing scientists is fun.
17139,Amazing and challenging game worth your time. An amazing story with amazing characters. Would recommend to all!
17140,"Where it all improved... Advanced AI, innovative HUD, engaging story, no cutscenes, gory gibs, large maps, advanced physics engine, damn good horror, cool creature design, silent protagonist and lots of crowbarring action. Half-Life 3's memic reputation and legendary status as the game to break all games is built on this game's legacy and status as a prime first-person shooter for the PC. Please Valve, learn to count to three (3)."

17144,SHOOT GAME PUZZLE
17145,"It wasn't all too long, and was fun almost the entire way through.
The final boss was surprisingly easy, almost disappointingly so.
Spoiler warning after this point.
I'm assuming the final boss was so easy because as soon as I was getting less assault ammo, I started using something else to conserve it. Went into the boss armed to the teeth. After only a few deaths, I found that the fight was zap the crystals, then throw all the ammo I have into him while super-long-jumping around to avoid the one real attack he has. Duck behind pillars to avoid getting teleported, and the fight shouldn't take too long."
17146,"Amazing game, gives me a lot of nostalgia"

17151,"Originally played this game for the Playstation 2 within the past decade. The PC version is just as enjoyable. Might be a little outdated. Especially when compared to the superior Half-Life 2, one of my favorite games of all time. Navigation on ladders took some getting used to. Some minor sound issues where the reload animation of the magnum doesn't have audio sometimes. Took me a second to remember how old level design was, like walking alongside narrow ledges in the early lab segments. Still one of the best first-person shooters ever."

17165,i'd leave a long review praising this game for how fun it is but theres hundreds of people who have done so better than i ever could. Seriously its half life if you haven't played it yet you should
17166,"Supa good game, especially for it's time. 10/10 good game!"
17167,"The game is very fun but crashes a lot, save frequently."
17168,What needs to be said? This game changed the world.
17169,It's fun.
17170,"Timeless masterpiece. The gameplay and graphics still holds up incredibly well to today and I enjoyed it like the first time. 

However, I came across a couple of glitches (like one where I kept being stuck inside a pipe after a loading screen or another related to the boss Gonarch) which I can't recall if they were in the original version but I wish they had fixed these for the Steam version."
17171,"Head crab lolz XD 
"
17172,I liked it. Do I really need to explain why? It's Half-Life! Sure it is confusing at times but what would you expect for VALVe's first game?
17173,Half life
17174,"As much as I am enjoying this game, installing it seems to have messed up my Windows 7 window appearances. I.e. translucent things are no longer translucent and a lot of the quality of life things (desktop preview in the bottom right, windows preview by hovering over taskbar icons, etc) do not work anymore. I cannot in good faith recommend that Valve has neglected to update so that it doesn't mess up something the game shouldn't even touch.

Any advice to fix this without uninstalling the game (until I've finished it lmao) would be appreciated"
17175,"A legendary game, a revolutionary game, a turning point for FPS games. A fun experience from start to finish. I mean it's Half-Life, what more do I need to say? The game that introduced us to one of the most iconic video game character, a crowba- jk, it's Gordon Freeman, but the crowbar is also somewhat true. If you haven't played this game yet, I'm just gonna say ""My God what are you doing?"""
17176,It's half life.
17177,This game is really fun and i am happy I was finally able to play a half life game for the first time
17178,"A good action, puzzle, and story filled game!"
17179,"Wow, did this game hold up well in the long run. There's a reason this game is still looked upon fondly. The setting is interesting, the gameplay is fast paced and fun, and the story has that classic Valve tinge to it that makes it extra gripping, while not telling you very much directly. Although, like every game, there are flaws. I experienced many glitches, most of which had to do with getting stuck on random bits of geometry. But, as is well known, the absolute lowest point in this game has to be the final chapter, Xen. Ugly, slow, boring and filled with clunky platforming, and a mediocre final boss to top it all off. But, overall this game has held up tremendously well, even to someone who has only recently played it for the first time. A solid 8/10, maybe even 9."
17180,pog champ
17181,"I know this game is considered a classic, but I had nothing but terrible experiences with it. Between constant stuttering and getting stuck in areas because of bugged lift physics, I could not bring myself to continue playing."
17182,"Honestly Great game, I see why this is considered a classic among PC FPS games. It is an amazing game."
17183,"Look Gordon, ropes!
"
17184,"I played Half-Life back when it originally came out, and loved it.  I decided to play it again in 2020 just to see how well it held up.  It's still good!  Sure, the graphics are bad by today's standards, but since the gameplay is still great and the story is so compelling, that doesn't matter all that much.  If you still don't own this game, do yourself a favor and pick it up.  You won't regret it."
17185,"I played this game when it first was released on CD-ROM. I lost the disk years ago, and just found it here on Steam!!! Ohhh the memories it brings back playing again!!  #thankyou"
17186,IT IS FUN and it is only 9.99$ so buy it now
17187,"Amazing game with a few big flaws, the biggest of which are the on a rail and zen chapters. for the most part, they are boring and confusing to navigate. The rest of the game is fun because of the huge amount of control you have over how to approach situations. I love that you can kill almost all of the npcs, but are rewarded for not doing it.

Outside of the base game there is still an active modding community, which is amazing for such an old game."
17188,"ti's good
"
17189,it good
17190,Pretty good game. Can get a little frustrating but a worthwhile experience.
17191,haha gluon gun goes brrrrrrrr
17192,"forget it, poopy balls"
17193,does my review really matter at this point?
17194,"A classic. I got stuck at some parts, like where you have to shimmy behind a pipe or crawl through a small crack. Those were annoying, because I had no idea where to go. Other then that, the game is great. I especially like the boss fight at the end.

Oh yeah it will also say its running, even though it isn't. The ""Stop"" button on steam doesn't work either. A little buggy, but considering it's age its not too bad."
17195,its just a classic
17196,Classic.
17197,Amazing
17198,"Its a classic, i wish it had achievements but its really nice, just some bugs here and there. 10/10"
17199,"The setting is pretty cool, the level design is kinda bad tho"
17200,"its good and a lot of mods, if you have a really cheap computer like i did then this is great. the mods are huge and expansive"
17201,"Played The Orange Box on Xbox a lot as a kid, grew up loving Half-Life 2 and so far og Half-Life is really good"
17202,"Half Life is a very old game, considered a classic first person shooter, where you not only kill enemies, but solve puzzles as well. I finished the game in Normal mode and the game was fun except for a few things, sometimes it may not be obvious where to go, every once in a while I would have to look up a guide to find out where to go next. ""On A Rail"" very long, very annoying, I did not use a guide for this but I won't judge if you do. [spoiler] ""Nihilanth"" [/spoiler] I just cheesed it, you probably should too. Despite some of the flaws, it's still a solid game, 8.5/10, minus 1 point for On A Rail and minus 0.5 points for the final boss. Good game would play again."
17203,gourd. freem. enjoy game.
17204,great game and it has aged well
17205,"Ok, so when i try to run the game it Only lets me play the Training Center not the game. can you Help me? or is it just not a game that Valve wants us to play?"
17206,Though the graphics aren't what they used to be Half-Life tells an engaging and creative story using shooter and puzzle solving elements. Whether you're a series veteran or a new comer (like myself) this is game will give you a good time!
17207,e
17208,Great game great graphics
17209,"This game is amazing! Everything in it was so good and it still holds up after all of these years. the graphics are good considering the time this came out and the combat is really flawless. Very little glitches, sometimes when loading you will get stuck in place and the only way I found to fix it was by loading your last save which can be annoying depending when the game last saved or when you last saved but not to big of an issue I just encountered it the most while playing surface tension. I don't know what else to say about this game it was perfect. I did get it on sale for $2 but even at the original price it is worth it."
17210,"top  of the line shooter solid story, fun and creative environments, kinda dated on the models but the game play makes up for it, definite a must buy 10/10."
17211,Haven't played this game for 17 years and still enjoyed every second. Hard difficulty is well balanced and every scenario you are placed in still has impact to this day.
17212,It hasn't aged perfectly so sometimes it's difficult to find the motivation to play this game but when i do it's always fun.
17213,"Gordon Freakman

Better than cybersh!t 1077"
17214,"Great game. I thought it would be outdated but only played it because I need the story for Half-Life 2 and I was wrong.When ever I get stuck its not in a stupid way, but because I'm stupid and didn't see a area that I had to go through. I haven't gotten angry with a stupid feature in the game so that's nice. The shoot outs with the military people were always fun having to stratadigize some times. Only problem is that every few minutes ( normally around 20 )  you get frozen but you can just load a save from 1 to 2 rooms ago so that's nice."
17215,Great game! definitely a must have if you are getting into shooters. The only complaint I have is that the server hosting is a little time consuming but thankfully there are usually many open/ empty servers that you can play on.
17216,i think all the Valve games are great and this one's way different from Half-Life 2 or any other game ive played but i love it.
17217,bruh
17218,"It's definitely rough around it's edges, but as the first Half-Life game, it's great for what it does!
This would definitely be on one of the greatest PC games I've played,
plus, being from 1998, it's shows that even back then, PC games could be the same greatness as games on a video game console!"
17219,Literally a scam where is the other half of this games life at? i guess it is called half life but honestly im still looking for the other half here
17220,
17221,I hate this game.
17222,swag
17223,it's not half life source
17224,STAHP
17225,Honestly one of the best first person shooters I've ever played.
17226,"A classic masterpiece.
"
17227,"You can kill your allies in several creative ways. Like shooting them in the head, provoking them to walk into the line of fire of a hostile sentry. Why wouldn't you want to buy this game?"
17228,very good game
17229,"In this game, you play as Doctor Gordon Freeman, a once seem to be a smart bright minded but mute scientist with a PhD in Theoretical Physics, who someday became unhinged in his workplace and became the man behind the slaughter who is responsible for the tragedy that almost destroyed the Earth."
17230,Fun game
17231,Legendary game
17232,"just got a mod for this game and the first thing the nihilinth says when in the boss battle is just ""ssstrrraaaaw maaaan"" slowly and i fucking died"
17233,"Awesome,perfect,thrilling.A MUST PLAY FOR NEWBIES"
17234,"Amazing game, timeless, On a rail still sucks tho lol"
17235,ITS BORING
17236,"not as polished as the source port,but still the enjoyable classic."
17237,Grandfather of the heckin' good game
17238,"really good game its a classic and i picked it up for $2 normaly 10 overall a great experience
"
17239,Just play Black Mesa.
17240,"Game almost as old as me? Why me review it? Because old graphics are beautiful and wonderful. I inifinitely prefer this to Black Mesa. Pet a houndeye, watch out for jump puzzles because they suck. Jumping is the worst part of the game. Protip you can just get off the train and leave most of the time. Drink the sodas too. 
Gordon's horrible terrible little ponytail is what keeps the universe together and when GMan cut it he destabilized everything. F*** you, GMan. You're the devil I think."
17241,"Pros: Legendary FPS games that started it all, expansion packs, mods, and more.
Even now, people are still using this game to create content ranging from entertaining videos and screenshots to total conversion mods.

Cons: If you're playing OG Campaign. Xen was known to have rushed development, it could have been a potential."
17242,i like battnig headcrabs with a crowbar
17243,te amo gordon freeman
17244,"This product is very enjoyable. Although I've only played for 4 hours, I can tell I will like this game. It is amazing for it's time. Although the only criticism I have is that the plot is slow, and it can get confusing at times. So far in this playthrough I give this game a 8.7/10. Good Game."

17264,i shoot guns
17265,"For a game thats 12 years old, it is still a classic"
17266,yes
17267,Have you ever wanted to play as Luigi in CS:GO? Then this is the game for you
17268,It is a really fun game with some horror parts and the story isn't put into cutscenes it happens in front of you while playing and with npc dialogue. I get terrified from the human enemies because they appear and kill you quickly so you have to react fast
17269,it's good
17270,gud
17271,This game is a big MAZE :DD but its fun
17272,"Now one of my all time favourite games. I just can't get enough of it.

Great game all round.
The story is well developed, the levels are interesting and have many different paths to take, but it's still clear on which path to take. It still runs perfectly after all these years and holds up pretty well.
Definitely worth the purchase!"
17273,Fun game if you like FPS's
17274,"Its ight 
"
17275,"There's some poorly designed levels close to the end, and this game shows it's age in some aspects, but it's the first video game ever made so"
17276,great og half life
17277,I love the rudimentary aesthetic of it all. It has a certain charm to it.
17278,"long, hard but good. thats what she said lol
but fr good game buy it or don't"
17279,"Don't get me wrong, this story is still solid and the graphics aren't TERRIBLE, but the gameplay is kinda booty. I don't know if the remake/remaster fixed the gameplay/level layouts, but if it did, play that one instead."
17280,endless fun
17281,"It's a unique and amazing game. It mixes genres like I've never seen before genres like horror, first person shooters and platformers."
17282,old game funny
17283,"Despite being a blatant Undertale clone, this FNaF mod is very good."
17284,"Two words: Must. Play. 
The only thing i regret about this game is not playing it sooner."
17285,"Game isn't that fun for me at all. I got more frustrated with the game then I did enjoying it. I enjoy the second game much better, Maybe because this game is too old for me to handle the clunky controls that make me fall off edges too easily. The aiming in the game is too hard and I need auto aim or l'll not kill anything without taking massive amount of damage."
17286,This game is a masterpiece!
17287,"Absolutely classic game, though I would recommend a walkthrough if you're absolutely clueless like me."
17288,yes
17289,.
17290,yes
17291,good
17292,Seeing the 4 low poly scientist models over and over again throughout the game is amazing
17293,The earth is 4.6 billion years old and we managed to exist at the same time as this masterpiece.
17294,"Pretty solid first entry into the series. It strangely enough is similar in story to Doom 2016 and has a really good gameplay loop on its own. I do think it does drag on a bit towards the 2nd half of the game, but overall it was very worthwhile.

Now if only someone could remake this game with Fortnite assets it would actually be a quality game."
17295,One of the best games on the world. It's chaos still fun.
17296,half life baybee
17297,a gamer's game
17298,"Fun, classic shooter. If you enjoy games like perfect dark and goldeneye, you will love this."
17299,"Fun game. Xen is not the greatest, nor is On A Rail. Other than that, great game, and a wonderful debut title for VALVe."
17300,"Consider this review from  a newer generation of gamers, I've grown up with call of duty as my first person shooter, and for a game that come out 22 years ago, it puts the fps' of today to shame. I've played a few of them, and if you're anything like me, you have too, maybe you're even pretty good at it. Great. Now take everything you have learnt from those games, and bin it. This game is nothing like any first person shooter I've ever experienced. Firstly, the AI are MUCH MUCH smarter than you think, it makes you realize how dumbed down current fps' are to appeal to mainstream audience. Then, you come to the actual game play, this is not a game where you can deploy one tactic throughout the entire game, the enemies flush you out, they make you move, and are tactical. You're not some overpowered person destroying everything in your path, you have to be super efficient with the way you use the environment and your arsenal of weapongs.  I played this game on easy difficulty and I found it fairly difficult, so if you're new to this, might want to consider the difficulty. The game had so into it that at times, I suddenly had an urge to pee (just like you do when you used to play hide and seek as a kid). It's all round just incredible, the gameplay has a lot of variety too it, the story has you hooked, and once you get the hang of it, you're going to enjoy it too. But holy **** is it scary at first, maybe its the old graphics, the demonic looking monsters, or the eerie sounds, but I found it scary. Still, all adds to the experience, and if you're looking for a different kind of fps, this is something to give a go. Now I'm off to half life 2."
17301,"Experiential storytelling is great, preferable to game-stopping cinematics, and allows for a different experience every playthrough. Visuals are audio are very dated, but this is forgivable due to the game's age and interesting storytelling. The only issues that are rather unforgivable would be the lackluster combat and inconsistent movement mechanics, but these aspects are most definitely improved upon in the later entries to the series."
17302,Very good
17303,is still a gold classic for PC
17304,hhhghgngnhhghh halflife
17305,"One of the most influential games of all time. I love it.

17310,"[i]Half-Life[/i] is iconic, and built to last. Still fun to play today, over 20 years later. I recommend playing this version over the remakes to really get the original experience. Never played the sequel, never felt the need."
17311,should be called full life.

17316,SO WELL DONE. Such a good game just try it
17317,This is a game of my childhood. Forever in my heart.
17318,Sadly as much hype as this game has gotten i cant recommend this game. It aged horribly. the parkour is awful and the shooting as well. Hope the 2nd one is better
17319,"I thought I would like the game considering its reviews.  I am fully aware this was innovative for its time.  It may be a bit too brutal for some, but I will review it as I would any modern game. Most of the game is ok.  There are 3 major things that ruin it.

1. Old source engine is a buggy mess.  Constantly getting stuck on things forcing you to reload old saves, terrible walking and parkour physics, bleh. Not much to be done about this one.
2. Nothing about the game is straightforward.  Some people like that kind of thing, some people don't.  In general I would say I like games that don't provide you instructions, but somehow I was reaching some later parts of the game without critical components in my toolkit that prevented me from progressing. In addition, some parts of the game have to be performed PERFECTLY in order to not take damage, which is held permanently until healed.  It has to be more straightforward than THAT.
3. Three words.  ON A RAIL.  Seriously, just delete that level.  Never before have I experienced a level that made me want to hate an otherwise ok game. Who created that piece of crap?"
17320,"Gud game

17346,"Half-Life is an absolute classic game which stands up very well today. It's an FPS that will hand your booty to you if you don't think things through. It was advertised as a smart shooter and it lives up to it. The graphics, in my opinion, are timeless and have a certain charm to them. However, as all games do, this one has some flaws. Many parts can be frustrating for no real reason. It isn't Dark Souls or a platformer where you simply need to 'get gud.' The game is just poorly designed. And in the last fifth of the game I found myself playing it for the sake of completion than fun. I'd still definitely recommend this game to anyone considering it."
17347,Great story and can run at 60fps on a toaster
17348,They don't make games like this anymore.
17349,its good (:
17350,great game 100/100
17351,gorden freeman's origen story (sorry about mispelled words cant see that well)
17352,"Half-Life, a real classic and a big reason the gaming industry has come as far as it is today.

You play as a scientist working at the black mesa facility, when a test goes horribly wrong and aliens start to take over the facility. It is your job to get to the bottom of this and stop any more aliens getting in.
The storyline is great and the gameplay is fantastic, a game worth playing in short.

The graphics are obviously not up to today's standards, but that's part of the charm of this game, reminding us how far games have come.

If the graphics really bother you tho, 'Black Mesa' has recently come out.
It's a remake of this exact game, the storyline and gameplay are roughly the same. It's worth checking out."
17353,Half Life Full Good
17354,"it's half life.
"
17355,This game is old but fun.
17356,It's a hella solid game.
17357,"The game that started everything. A masterpiece by own right. The story is really good and properly settle the base of its own universe. The game is now a little outdated, but still worth to play it."
17358,nice
17359,"While this game still holds up 20+ years after its release, I highly recommend you check out the fan-made Source remake of this game, Black Mesa as it fixes many of the issues this game has.
And if you don't wanna get Black Mesa and wanna experience the game in its original form, then go ahead. The last few levels can get kinda wonky with its phyisics though considering they're on an alien planet."
17360,"The first time I played this game, it was via [i]Half-Life: Day One[/i], because my parents wouldn't let me buy the full game.
This game has impacted my life more than I can ever describe. I could write a huge paragraph about how much I love this game, but there is now way to describe in words how much I love this game, and how much this series and this developer as a whole has impacted my life. I think everyone who calls themselves a fan of video games and even people who don't normally play games should play this game at least once in their life."
17361,An all around classic game that I think everyone should play at some point in their lives
17362,i got this game for free but its no longer free im really sad but this game was a really good game
17363,Pog
17364,"Half-Life is one of the most important FPS ever, which makes it one of the most important games of any genre. Only Doom is more important than it, and MAYBE its successor, Half-Life 2. I played it a lot in the early 2000s, both this and its revolutionary mod, Counter-Strike.

This game, together with Goldeneye 007 for the Nintendo 64, changed FPS evolution, with a greater importance to narrative, and eliminating the stage structure. No more strong superheroes such as in Doom or Duke Nukem 3D: we now have Gordon Freeman, a scientist on an ordinary workday. The whole story is presented from his (or your) point of view, with no cutscenes.

Because there are no stages, the game happens in large, continuous ambients, with a brief loading between areas. However, it is incredibly linear, with few deviations along the way (usually to solve a puzzle that allows the player to continue the game later). This means that there is little backtracking, which is rather nice.

Like most shooters, there are a number of interesting weapons in the game, some of them very creative. Enemies are simple at first, even a little monotonous; later on they become smarter and stronger, as they use more elaborate strategies to kill you. However, the most important aspects of the game are the environment and the gameplay. Contrary to other games at the time, the player is not supposed to shoot everything on sight; instead, he/she must solve puzzles, advance with caution, and face 3D platforming in first person (although these moments are not that interesting, since movements are a little slippery).

Half-Life is a game with a much less archaic gameplay than the first FPS; however, being this a genre that has undergone so many changes over the years, many players may still consider this one a little dated. In fact, some of its cons are still quite noticeable, such as the already mentioned platforming (especially at the end of the game), graphics that have not aged very well (they were very good at launch, but not fantastic), and some episodes that are a little monotonous.

I recommend buying this game. It is worth the full price, which is not too high. Obviously, try to buy it during a sale (Steam often offers it at a high discount).

Some tips that can help those playing for the first time:
- configure the mouse to your taste, increasing its sensitivity accordingly;
- as the game is very linear, it doesn't have many secret areas, so do not waste time looking for them;
- save often, and especially before a platforming segment. Jumping in this game is very tricky;
- watch out for smarter enemies, as they really ambush you. Moving around to protect yourself is a good strategy."
17365,"28 hours..... 28 hours to beat this game from start to finish my God it took forever.

I dont know how long it took others but for me start to finish no backtracking or do overs. It took that long

For the most part pretty good game even if its dated

Story is confusing I had to watch Videos that explain what is the plot. 

very long gameplay LOTS AND LOTS OF DEATHS 

I give it a 9/10 Crowbar bashings I would give it a 10 if the plot was better explained instead of having watching other people explain it."

17382,"Half-Life is probably one of my most favorite games. It is a truly incredible experience, filled with a mix of horror and action adventure. Exploring your work facility while it is under attack was one of the coolest settings I played through when I was younger. There were definitely game mechanics that were dated when I played it, but those were eventually fixed later in the series. This game is simply a must."

17384,haha gun go pew pew

17387,A classic must play FPS. Great plot and gunplay is very satisfying. Graphics have their timeless charm.
17388,Good gamer
17389,"[h1]If I do recommend this game? Absolutely, it's just too good![/h1]

Back in 2002 I discovered Half-Life through a friend's copy of Counter Strike. 
Going inside a moving elevator, on an industrial tunnel, and seeing all the facilities, with its purposes, be it reactor chambers, waste composite, storage rooms, etc. in this massive underground lab, BLEW MY MIND!
I was young but I knew games couldn't handle lighting, liquid physics, hard memory cut scenes. But there it was, Half-Life, bringing to the public a physics system that could do it all (for that time), and, while so, not burning your machine! It was amazing!
Yet, the door didn't open... It was just a demo.

After that, in 2006 I played Half-Life 2 trilogy, Deathmatch, Garry's Mod, heck even Under hell (a great full-mod conversion of HL2). But I never came back to finish the beginning.
Not until 2020, and I'm being honest here: this game is awesome! For shorts:
It‚Äôs great has feeling like a proper game, doesn‚Äôt hold or sympathizes you, it‚Äôs an experience you go through.

And the rest well, try it, there ain‚Äôt noting to lose."
17390,its really fun and the graphics are actually pretty funny because they only designed like 3 npc models to you keep seeing the same guys over and over again
17391,i love half life
17392,Half-life Even though it is VERY dated it's still a good game. The only problem is the HECU's throwing thirteen grenades at me. Only problem. This game made way for one of the best game series. So good that fans waited 14 years for another half life game to come out. This is a piece of history right here if you want to see better graphics and stuff go to Black Mesa. If you want to just go back and play this game from long ago. 9.9/10
17393,good and cheap
17394,half life
17395,Must Have
17396,"The game is balanced and good overall. Each chapter is unique, yet still in the same story. The audio was done well too. I liked the overall player movement, which was smooth and made shooting targets efficient. It's also not just the story that is unique, new mechanics are also introduced throughout the game, making it really interesting to play."

17398,"classic game, a must have played!"
17399,"Half Life is an amazing game which was ahead of its time, the combat is truly amazing and fun. The story is pretty good and interesting. I really recommend everyone on steam to play this amazing game."

17402,Very Very Interesting...
17403,"With what should I start this review? Let me tell my opinion - this game isn't that good to play nowadays. 
If your PC able to handle HL-2 then I fully recommend you to buy it. 
So, why is this so bad for me? 

- ""HECU"" is literally the most annoying thing  from middle to the penult part of the playthrough. 
- Sometimes boring game plot. 
- Unexpected endgame which even didn't catch me.

17411,"Gameplay 4/10 Bad
To say the gameplay is bad may not be doing it justice. However, I had a huge problem with difficulty which in turn effects gameplay. I decided to play on normal and the game was grueling for me. The first 2-3 hours are pretty good. After this point however it takes a turn for the worst. The last 8 hours are really difficult. This is due to a few different factors. First and foremost, there seems to be a health or damage issue where there‚Äôs either A not enough health through base health or through healing stations or B the enemies just do too much damage. I suppose another issue could be too many enemies at once. That‚Äôs the thing after hour 5 or halfway through the game give or take your health will always be below 50. Your just constantly 1 hit away from dying at every single point. It also doesn‚Äôt help that this game has a lot of jumping puzzles. As the game goes on you will find yourself saving every 5 steps. Its just extremely annoying. Now again its hard to say because this is classic valve gameplay nothing wrong with it on paper its just way too difficult for little to no reason. I also want to mention that the game is extremely detailed for a game made in 1998. The puzzles are generally good, and I never really had a problem with them. It‚Äôs just the combat that became an issue.
Plot 8/10 Very Good
The plot at the beginning and ending of the game is good. The middle isn‚Äôt necessarily bad but there‚Äôs a lack of explanation as to what‚Äôs going on. You kind of start randomly going to locations just because someone told you to up until the end where you solve the problem at hand. The story that is there however is good. 
Setting: 9/10 Great 
Black mesa is an extremely cool location. Just endless labs and facility. I don‚Äôt know what exactly it is about it but its so cool.  As mentioned earlier the game is also extremely detailed. It really makes the world feel more interesting.
Music 6/10 Decent
 There isn‚Äôt a lot of music but its okay for the most part. It was really cool hearing certain themes that I‚Äôve always wondered about such as the Valve logo theme on all of its titles. I will say there is a lack of music which does affect the score but as I said the music that I did hear was okay.
Overall 7/10 Good
Overall I would recommend this game. I personally think it‚Äôs a pretty crazy game for the time. However objectively I think its just a good game nothing special. However, it‚Äôs certainly not bad. The best way to describe it is if your sure you want this game you probably will like it. However, if you‚Äôre not 100% just wait for a steam sale where it goes down to like $1.79 which is how much I got it for.

17416,this is a good game.
17417,"Its a good game, but has not aged too particularly well in some areas. The xen chapter is no fun to play at all, but the rest of the game is enjoyable
"
17418,"While I do consider this game as a must play, I have to admit it hasn't aged gracefully. If you can get it on sale and you approach it with some leniency, it is worth experiencing. However, consider buying ""Black Mesa"" (the fan remake) instead."
17419,fucking love it
17420,"[i]Half-Life[/i] is a little rough around the edges these days but it's still a great game overall. You wouldn't think it would retain its eerie atmosphere over two decades later but it does. There's a diverse assortment of weapons that allow you to approach every situation in a number of ways. Plus there's lots of secrets for the observant player to discover. The visuals are the most dated aspect of the game but ultimately they're still serviceable. Other than that though everything feels quite a bit more modern than you would expect. It just shows how influential the game was. You don't need nostalgia to enjoy [i]Half-Life[/i], I played it for the first time in 2013 and loved it. The multiplayer is still active too and it's a good time."
17421,Yes but it steals to much from the game black mesa
17422,"Half-Life is an absolute classic. With an engaging story, interesting enemies, and tons of fun to use weapons this game is a must have for anyone with a Steam library and a couple spare dollars. 

* While Black Mesa does have much better graphics, in my opinion, the original is hard to beat. I didn't mind the dated graphics and even found them charming at times!"
17423,"one of the greatest games of all time really. the single player campaign is memorably iconic and was earth shattering at the time of its release with graphics of a bygone era supplying a great presentation to boot. the 20 year old multiplayer deathmatch scene is still going to this day, with an endless supply of custom maps to play from to this day that also radiate the lawless aura that came with video game customization and modding at the time where you could do anything if you had proper knowledge of valves hammer editor.  it is a good game, go play it. its freaking HALF LIFE dude lmao"
17424,It's pretty fun but something about the graphics resolution dashing by as Gordon Freeman just books it on a modern monitor just makes me feel more motion sick than Half Life Alyx. Still a great game!
17425,It's half life
17426,"What can I say? It's Half-Life. Almost every FPS game released after this game owes something to it.

Unlike many other historically important shooters, such as Doom or Quake, Half-Life's gameplay holds up pretty well in comparison to today's FPS fare, probably because it was so influential that other games since have simply followed its example. The gunfights are an addictive mix of frenzied improvisation and tactical planning, and the game's pacing is excellent (at least up until the unfortunate Xen chapters, which murder the pacing somewhat in its final 20% or so.)

In any case, this game is well worth the $2 it goes down to on sale. The question, then, is which version to buy; the original (as I am reviewing here), the Source port, or Black Mesa. Half-Life: Source is pretty much the same game but with the tradeoff of better box physics in exchange for more bugs and costing five times as much. Black Mesa is a totally different game, and not really my cup of tea; for my money, you should experience the original before deciding whether to try Black Mesa's reimagining.

I'd recommend this game to anyone with an interest in first-person shooters, past or present. It holds up, and for as little as it costs, you're not taking much of a risk on whether you enjoy it or not. Try it out!"
17427,nice game.
17428,"good because my pc runs it and just a good game
"
17429,"Overall great game. Enjoyed it. I love how the movement is. This game had ended the DOOM era of FPS games. Multiplayer is fun as hell.

17432,"I finished story in 8 hours. There's some physics glitch but c'mon, this game made in 1998, it has very good graphics and physics for their times, if you expect something like AAA games, dont play this. In some places I died a lot. And I need to thank to the ""big spidey with big pouch"" thing."
17433,"Half-Life is still one of the best FPS theses days. If you like a good atmosphere and old-school shooters and don't worry too much about graphics, then don't hesitate and take it."
17434,"It's an interesting game that combines shooting aliens/marines, platforming, and story. The story isn't all too interesting and is not ever fully explained. However, the science fiction aesthetic of running around a secret nuclear research facility draws you in. Playing the game now brings back lots of nostalgia for older shooters such as this. The game's age does show and it is a little rough around the edges."
17435,Really good game especially for the time.
17436,Love this game it is a really good game you can shoot the U.S. military and you get a Tau Cannon which is really good weapon
17437,"So I am replaying this game (21 years later) along with the rest of the series before I play Alyx. It's extremely hard to get back into, I first played this game upon near release back in 1999 on my Win98 pc. Which I'm happy I still own the CD. I thought it was one of the most amazing experience I've played then since Mario 64. Fast Forward 21 years later and.......well my memories were nostalgic as is with most old games. Just as many games of yesteryear the controls are very difficult. I think I struggled more with the controls than the actual enemies. I got through  70% of the game until I gave up and activated God mode. You'll want to save before every long jump too as platforming is hard. Still, I give it a recommendation as this is the game that started it all. It's worth a visit if you've never played it. Now that I think about it, I don't honestly know if you NEED to play the game if you can just read up on the synopsis. I've read you need to play it and I had felt the same until I actually replayed the game. It's a trip down memory lane if nothing else. It'll definitely make you appreciate the evolution of gaming, including the sequels. I just wish Steam had a ""Yes, BUT"" rating."

This game is 22 years old, and it is still one of the best games ever made. Before you play any other First-Person shooters, you must play this game. It will allow you to better appreciate the technology that we have today, and it is also one of the best gaming experiences ever created.

While the technology is outdated, it makes up for that with an amazing story, and fun game play.  Even if you are playing this game for the first time in 2020, 2021, or any year after, this game is still something you should experience. 

Note: DO NOT play Half-Life Source, it is buggy and broken.

Play the original Half-Life (You are probably on the Half-Life store page now.)"

17464,"Decent game, took about 16h to beat. Overall: You are a drug addict, quick save is your cocaine. You can set bind keys to quick save and load a quick save. Difficulty ramped up about half way through and then some near the end: didn't seem very linear. Having a health bar makes you live with your mistakes as you progress. A problem when the game expect you are on high HP, but you actually are not. There are better games out there, only play this if you want to continue through the series. And if you are, you won't regret it."

17472,Cult classic. Buy a bunch of copies when it goes on sale and give them to your friends. Then go find a server and have at it for hours.
17473,"This game is great because I feel it appeals to all. Want a great story? Well it's here. Want different styles of combat, most of which using the environment to your advantage? That's here too. Or you can just run up and gun enemies in the face, which is also fine. Seriously though, this game is great and sends you off on a high note, killing the final boss and getting more exposition felt amazing. Would totally recommend. A few issues I had are, since it's an old game, the level design is a bit confusing, so a lot of the time I had to search up a walkthrough to see where I had to go. Also another issue with it being an old game is the graphics, but thats pretty straightforward and not really important. But aside from that, it was great playing this game and I enjoyed it a lot."
17474,"horrid, rancid mess of a game. lets start off with the obviously pretentious graphics that are trying wayyy too hard to be retro and nostalgic for those freaking soyboys who are like ZOMG OLD VIDEO GAMES. the movement sucks (everytime you press e to use you freaking stop), the mobs are a rip off of the alien movies which just flat out suck to begin with (if youre going to rip off a movie franchise at least pick a good one like the marvel movies.) i have no idea how the people who made this game have not been sued for obviously ripping assets from gmod, im pretty sure thats a lawsuit waiting to happen."

Each level is pretty well made and it doesn't get boring with different mechanics thrown into the mix often (Like platforming).

Well worth the pick up."

17537,The game has a old school charm with a large dedicated following.  You may either love it or not.  Graphics are not high tech but comfortable.  The game speed is adequate for average players who do not wish to lose their focus on the fun.  I have been playing this game since around 1999.
17538,"Half Life is a amazing game, played my first playthrough this week and loved it, Zen was not as fun as Black Mesa itself, but however i would recommend playing through it atleast once, i'd say play this first before Black Mesa, AND DON'T PLAY SOURCE. Overall it's easy to see how this game was so innovative and amazing for its time, a enjoyable experience overall."
17539,Very old game but i do recommend for newer Player's If you like old game like me get this also comes with storyline and old fashion models
17540,"Good game, but some glitches where it doesn't let you move on to  the next stage at all"
17541,just glad to play a game that set some precedents for the industry
17542,"An old classic, a wonderful game that still holds up today and its even better if you can put your brain back into 1998 when it came out. 

Pretty tight controls, nice loadout, good enemies, good level design. I wouldnt say its flawless but I find it hard to name gripes for a game like this, besides xen."
17543,"One of the best FPS campaigns I have played in a long time, I wish I played it sooner.  Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new game to play"
17544,Fucking Godly dude
17545,"This was a wonderful game to play took me 4 days to finish but was exciting all the way through especially the different environments and enemies, from it being a horrific mystery at the start to an all out action pack thrill ride at the end it was a very fun play!"
17546,I love it
17547,"Buggy, Loud! unless its important information, Funny when its serious, terrable npcs. a classic 10/10"
17548,i love goldsrc
17549,good
17550,FUN and Made me think
17551,One Of The Best PC Classics...Would Definitley Recommend Playing However If You Prefer Controller controls You May Need to Set It up Your Self Or Use Some One Else's preset Other Then That Great Game Over All.
17552,"love it, i passed normal dificult"
17553,"If You are going to buy it why not buy it during the sale?
It is one of the best games ever created. Sure it is old but it still is fun!"
17554,Nice
17555,"Get it, it may be old, but trust me you'll love it"
17556,The amazing story line allows you to forgive the 1998 graphics.
17557,"Great game!
"
17558,"A lot of old classics fail to stand the test of time. They are clunky, boring, uninteresting, and look like crap. Half Life is not one of those games. The visual style is great for what it is, the gameplay is fun and complex, and it has a very lengthy story. If you have the worst of the worst pc specs and can't even run potato games, I would absolutely recommend this at full price. Otherwise, on sale it is a must buy for the price."
17559,"when im playing half-life im feeling like im a fucking '97s kid after school
this game is amazing, even after all these years
there is so many things to do, there's so many ways to do something, so many buttons, so many doors
it's pretty spoopy game, but ain't no horror shit,
i love it,
marry me, half-life"
17560,"Looks good, I didn't know that they made a remake called Half-Life: Source."
17561,"Play it and play it right, this isn't your regular FPS. Play it slow, listen for your enemy, use all the tools in your arsenal. DON'T RUN AND GUN. Take it slow and not only you will enjoy the game, but you won't have to play it on ten health! Brilliant game, still play it a lot even now!"
17562,"Great game and story, perhaps one of the founding fathers of shooters."

17578,its a great shooter and a classic  i really think its a great game
17579,hello gordon
17580,It is a really good game that has not gone old after 22 years. The FPS type of game has aged really well.
17581,Just a good game

17584,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BUY THE SOURCE VERSION. PLEASE BUY THIS ONE INSTEAD.

BTW OPEN THE SILO BAY DOORS THEY'RE COMING FOR US!"
17585,its pretty fun
17586,"Fantastic story and playthrough. I would recommend selecting the easy difficulty and saving OFTEN! But that may just be me. Overall, 10/10 would play again."
17587,"Really fun game even tho its old

17588,very good

OH MY GOD WE'RE DOOMED!"
17590,Nice
17591,"I spam space bar, yes?"
17592,A must-play game even though it is quite old its mechanics still holds to this day. I highly recommend giving it a try and good luck completing it without a walkthrough.
17593,"Love this game, but the boss fight is an absolute nightmare."
17594,"Overall decent, though notably dated. Worth the price, however, especially in a sale or as part of the valve pack"
17595,Amazing just amazing
17596,"for GOD'S sake, do not buy half-life: source. i made that mistake because i thought source = better. buy this to experience the ORIGINAL and not a cursed, buggy mess"

17603,"This game came out when I was 10. I first played it when I was in my 20's and now that I'm in my 30's, Half-Life is still a solid title. Playing through a classic like this will make modern gamers question what they're playing. Too many narrow platforms and some frustrating weapon aiming just takes time getting used to but hopefully won't destroy the experience. I definitely recommend playing this game before the legendary Half-Life 2 and it's expansions. 1998, is miss you so much! :("
17604,√áocukulumuzda Oynadƒ±ƒüƒ±mƒ±z Oyun :)
17605,"Play this if you can't play black mesa. Or play both, it's great"
17606,"The safety standards of Black Mesa are abysmal.

Bearley any safety railings, Pools of radioactive goo everywhere, not to mention all the aliens running about."
17607,"This is my first time playing a half-life game, and I can say that this game is awesome! graphics don't need to look great to make a game great!"
17608,The Good Old Days :^)
17609,"For many years I've heard people rave about Half Life and how amazing it is. When I was younger, I didn't have a computer to play games on, so I never got the chance to play Half Life, and to find out for myself why it is such a beloved game to so many people. Then one day I saw the announcement trailer for Half Life Alyx and found out that Valve was letting people play Half Life for free in the months leading up to the release of Half Life Alyx and decided it was time to find out what was so special about this game. Starting out, I didn't really know what Half Life was about or what to expect from it. All I'd ever seen of it bits of a speedrun done at GDQ. I had no idea what I was about to get into. 

You play as a scientist  Dr. Gordan Freeman who works in a top secret military facility called Black Mesa. Your day starts with a science experiment, but during the experiment, something goes horribly wrong, causing aliens from a different dimension to invade Black Mesa. Your job is find a way to deal with this issue, using an ever growing arsenal of weapons to progress through Black Mesa to stop this alien threat. Once I started playing, I legitimately couldn't stop. I beat the game in 15 hours, and I think I put in half that time on the first day I started playing. All the weapons feel amazing, and you acquire them at regular intervals throughout the game, which gives you new and interesting ways to defeat your foes. Are you gonna lay down a tripwire to stop the enemy, toss a grenade at them, use your rifle, or just shotgun them in the face? The game is pretty easy at the beginning, but the difficulty ramps up as you progress, with the game throwing more difficult enemies and areas at you forcing you to get better at dealing with enemies while managing your ammo and keeping your health up. Some areas in the game gave me more trouble than others, but I didn't find this frustrating at all. I just kept adjusting my strategy until I found the one that worked. 

In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like first person shooters, enjoy games with a good story, and haven't played this game yet, what are you doing? Buy it. Right now. In no world do you ever regret buying Half Life. This game is a masterpiece and it does everything right. 

Thanks for reading, and Valve, please make Half Life 3. 
That is all"

17619,"Half-Life on release was a monumental game, with cutting edge graphical capabilities, revolutionary storytelling, and fast paced thrilling gameplay which established the now beloved valve software as a major player in the games industry. But if you think that this game has aged like anything but fine wine, you are wrong. as someone who hadn't played half life up until recently, I can confidently say that this game holds up remarkably. Everyone who enjoys FPS games should play this game at least once all the way through. The gameplay is fast paced, and requires a degree of thinking that will keep you on your toes. the storytelling is phenomenal and immersive, never taking you out of the shoes of Gordon Freeman as you watch events unfold around you. The soundtrack is great, though if I were to have one complaint about the whole game I wish the soundtrack would have kept playing a bit longer. I understand that it helps immerse you in the atmosphere by only having the soundtrack play occasionally during regular gameplay, but I feel that specifically during boss fights letting the music linger a while longer would be beneficial to the atmosphere. If you don't own this game already, but it. now. it's exceptionally priced, especially if you buy it as a part of one of the many bundles it's included in."

17628,"Half Life is an FPS game from the late 90s that, surprisingly, hasn‚Äôt aged all that poorly, given its age. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the game looks and feels old, but it is still a fairly enjoyable experience. 
The only real problems I had with it are as follows:
The game will often ask the player to complete platforming challenges, and those can be really frustrating at times, given how slippery your character is when moving at his default speed.
Fall damage is way too high, you can lose more than a quarter of your max HP by falling from heights that usually would not even damage you in other games.
Climbing/Descending ladders can feel incredibly awkward.
The path ahead is not always clear. The game almost never directly tells you where you need to go, and while I do appreciate the lack of handholding, finding yourself in a situation you have absolutely no idea where to go or what to do will not be a rare occurrence, specially in the later parts of the game.
The music in the game might glitch out if you find yourself loading saves often.
The quality of the audio in general is bad, most sound effects and voices sound like they were recorded with a shitty Xbox 360 mic. I‚Äôve seen older games with better audio.
The final boss is not particularly good, since you are forced to rely on a very inconsistent mechanic to get the final hit. 
The game might be a bit too lengthy. While the game will constantly put you in interesting scenarios, the overall simplicity of its gameplay might get you burned out by the end.
Those problems aside, the game can still be pretty fun. The gunplay is decent and the puzzles are well thought out in most cases. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be interested in checking out what might be the most influential game in the PC gaming industry."
17629,"i played this game last year and judging from how i talked about it in old discord messages i absolutely hated it, but now i can only remember the fun parts so thumbs up :)"
17630,"As of recently getting interested into the half-life series, I decided to pick up this game since it was on sale for $2. For being an old game and new to the half-life series, I loved it. Although, it was very challenging for me even on normal mode, and that's my one knack of it. But its prolly just me in general. Either way, loved it."

17661,"now, why tf would i review a that has been out for 24 years."
17662,"I have played this for so many hours without steam, it is such a fantastic game!

It reminds me of the nostalgic era of gaming, when they cared a lot more about the story, gameplay & letting you figure out things on your own by exploring it to the full extent. I miss those action/adventure games where you really had to make a brain effort in order to advance in some stages. Today's games requires higher reflexes & movement skills, but not much from the virtues of patience, solving problems & exploring.

And yeah, without DLCs - you buy a full game!

I suggest you playing it, even if you are way younger than I am (Without consulting the internet - like back in my era) - overtime you'll learn how beautiful is to explore the depth of a story, how sometimes failing isn't the end of the world & it takes an effort to advance.

The graphic was SUPERB for its time, but I highly doubt many would appreciate it. You can also download mode that improves it to Half-Life 2 engine."
17663,classic
17664,"So far, I'm interested into this game, This game I would recommend to all of the people who are new to steam, I'm glad that Valve will be selling their games on Steam, and only Steam, because the Epic games Store doesn't deserve Half-Life, if they have things exclusive to their store, like Watch_dogs: Legion, or Predator Hunting grounds, anyways back on track, this games story is not that long, I assume, probably 2 to 4 hours, the character models in this game have aged well...I might play more, and I might play until the end...or start a new game."

17672,want to know where it all started?  wanna beat headcrabs with a crowbar?  boy is this the game for you.
17673,"Save the game and run, the aliens don't exist if you don't look at them, just run past them, if you die, load and try again.

Don't even care about the laser guns, SHOTGUN is the only thing I need.

Or you can get invested in the story and be all stealthy, planning everything, using all weapons, setting up traps; which would be technically easier and a better experience overall, but who likes that.



Half-Life feels much more despairing and scary than Half-Life 2(except maybe Ravenholm).

The graphics are dated, but honestly I like them. I love the Xen atmosphere.

Great Game 9/10."

17680,Really good game
17681,"ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO ENJOY THIS GAME.
I know this game might look ugly to you because of how outdated it is, but it's not fully the fault of its age,
- I recommend you to turn the resolution to 640x480 on 4:3 aspect ratio, this really helped me because playing on 16:9 makes your movement more inaccurate and makes you prone to falling off platforms, and the lower resolution helps masks the game's textures that were not meant for modern displays.
- If you have a CRT Monitor, I suggest you dusting it off and plugging it in to play games like these, or any game really, not only is it aesthetically pleasing, the graphic translates better on CRT as it is its intended monitor to work with.
- The game is kind of hard, especially on the harder difficulty, I suggest you to bind some of your keys to quick save and quick load, for example
Bind p ""save quick""
Bind o ""load quick""
- Be creative with the game, half life won tons of awards for a reason, the gameplay is really flexible, there are multiple ways for you to tackle a single enemy, shotgun to the face, bounce grenade off of the walls, use tripmines and lure them over with a pistol shot, etc.
I hope this helps because I know how it feels playing this game without knowing these beforehand, it feels bland and wonky. I hope this helps you to understand how the game was meant to be played and how to enjoy it in a today."

The game always had me coming back for more. It has a great story, cool characters, awesome weapons (including the signature crowbar,)  fast paced game play, and a pinch of horror. The story is about a man called Gordon Freeman, who works at the Black Mesa Facility. He was testing an experiment when something went terribly wrong, the experiment caused a Resonance Cascade opening up a portal to a strange alien world known as Zen. So Gordon needs to close the portal. I honestly think that this game is a masterpiece, including it's brothers, Blue Shift and Opposing Force. I would recommend this to any gamers who like classic, fun, first person shooters."

17737,EVERY THANG
17738,A true classic
17739,"Very good game, but I'm sure everyone already knows that. If you don't like first person shooters, you won't like it, though."
17740,"Its not as good in comparison to its sequel imo, but it holds up nonetheless. Graphics are a little too outdated for my taste, but that's just me. If you're looking for a fun retro, action-adventure sci-fi game, this and Half-Life 2 are your go-to games."
17741,Pretty good  game but why not buy black mesa. Also If you are going to buy know that there's motion blur and you can't turn it off.  Black Mesa has nearly entirely same story line except for the Xen and I'm only playing to see the Xen compared  to Black Mesa. Now I understand that this is one of the best games of all time for all it changed.
17742,its a good game
17743,The game is amazing i love the old graphics its such a classic
17744,"Great game, a classic!"
17745,good
17746,I love it but jesus christ is it unforgiving
17747,"The game that started it all. Without this game, we wouldn't be here. Oh the game itself is good."
17748,"Even though it's old, it's one of the only singleplayer games that could keep my attention."
17749,can i see your passport
17750,What happened to the other half?
17751,Literally one of the most amazing games of all time. A timeless classic.
17752,Greatest Series on Steam
17753,very good game. yes

17755,
17756,Half-Life (1998) is an absolute classic. It has aged a bit but it is still an absolute masterpiece. The gameplay and the storytelling are what defined the game and they still hold up to this day. Graphically the game hasn't aged too well but if you're the type who doesn't care about the graphics then that shouldn't be a problem.
17757,really addicting and satisfying after killing a enemy
17758,and i get high with my baby i just left the mall im gettin fly with my baby yeaaahhh
17759,ive never played an amazing game some many times!
17760,"Remind me, WHEN was this game released!? 
It plays even better than modern games, I've expected much worse from such an old game. I expected clunky weird gameplay with not knowing where to go (hi morrowind), instead I've got a game that plays even better than some of modern stuff that focuses on having realistic movement n' stuff. 

I've been kind of hesitant to play old games, but decided to grab HL anyway and I'm absolutely loving it.


edit: gman has a really cool voice"
17761,An all time classic! Will recommend!
17762,I enjoyed playing this but now for some reason the game always shifts to black and I cant ever play it anymore I have tried everything to no avail and I wish there was a way to fix it.
17763,honestly if you love FPS games this is just the game for you.
17764,An excellent game in which you will return millions of millions of times. Because you want to go through it again.
17765,Still holds up

17768,"Half-Life Released in November 19, 1998. E3 1998 
Game Critics Awards for ""Best PC Game"" and ""Best Action Game"".
Perfect game for you if you like old school first person shooters.Half-Life has no ""levels""; it instead divides the game into chapters. Valve released two demos for Half-Life. The first, Half-Life: Day One, contained the first fifth of the game and was distributed with certain graphic cards. The second demo, Half-Life: Uplink, was released on February 12, 1999, and featured original content.Game of the decade definitely for me and gldsrc engine is very good for that time .In Half-Life, players assume the role of the protagonist, Dr. Gordon Freeman, a recent MIT graduate in theoretical physics, and also a recent employee at Black Mesa. After an experiment that goes horribly awry when an unexpected Resonance Cascade (an apparently completely fictitious occurrence) rips dimensional seams that devastate the facility, Gordon must fight to escape the now alien-infested facility as creatures from another world known as Xen subsequently enter through these dimensional seams.And of course i can recommend Half-Life"
17769,Kestane oyun
17770,Legend
17771,"Very nice. Thank you wayneradiotv for reminding me that i too can become Gordon Freeman for the small price of 10 dollars. Fun game, hope to finish it one day."
17772,"Old Classic, found myself shooting everything that opposes me. No living creature can even think before they fall.

Oh and I guess the alien opposition was fine."
17773,"Though it s a masterpiece, its control is far from perfect and there are not enough instructions which make you stuck in a scene for so much time."
17774,Old game with low level graphics
17775,"More than half of my life, I was devoted to this game and its mods.

And used its SFX for videos which boomed to popularity last year. Glad to be one of those who wrote one of the best meme videos made.

Thank you, Valve!"
17776,It makes you feel like adrian shephard
17777,"This game is an amazing spectacle into the modified Quake Engine, GoldSource. This game is a grand thing and was ahead of its time. The only bad thing is that it gets rather poor in Surface Tension and beyond, which is pretty sad.
 But the good thing is, is that It can be modded, meaning you can install Gunman Chronicles, a good GoldSource game that's now abandonware. Or even install Crack Life if you're into that stupid crap that I enjoy in a modding scene.
 In case you're wondering: You can't BHop anymore and you also can't Tau Jump in the Campaign, sadly these were both patched a while ago which is sad. Hopefully Valve makes some sort of alternate version where you can relive the original game without any of the patches from the current day.
 Half Life also has MULTIPLAYER, although it's not big, it is still fun to pit against the many players who still roam the servers! I recommend it!"
17778,"this game is amazing its like a first person shooter with aliens. very fun, I do recommend.
words of wisdom: ignore xen
play it like a theoretical physicist not doom guy its more enjoyable"
17779," A timeless classic

17787,"Honestly a very, very old enjoyable game. I finished it on hard in about 12 hours. The games fire fighting is smooth for it's age, there is a decent variety of different enemies and a great variety of weapons to take each one down. There is a few flaws with this game though, the ladders. Ladders might be the biggest complaint I have, when I scale it to the top I usually ended up falling down to my guaranteed death. And lastly for the final boss is a bit of an annoyance with the constant teleportation. But good game, very nice.

Rating: 8/10"
17788,How much do you still wish to earn on half-life franchise?
17789,
17790,"Amazing game, very fun and lots of cool enemies to fight, there are also quite a few different locations you go to in the game so it doesn't all look the same like other games and you get a lot of weapons to use including some that are very unique. Highly recommend"
17791,its very good like so good
17792,lots of levels. Hard puzzles to solve.
17793,Old Better FPS shooter game

Do yourself a favor and take the plunge.

This is what Valve stood for."

17803,Still fun in 2020
17804,The classic ham and cheese
17805,"it good
edit:it even gooder"
17806,"A bit clunky, graphics are old, platforming suck major ass and it can get a bit confusing with the map layout.
Other than that, it's awesome as hell, and note that I played it for the first time at 2020, so no nostalgia glasses. Every location (especially when you get to the second half of the game) feels different and really interesting. I've been using every weapon (well not the grenades and bombs really) all throughout the game, so none of them are really redundant. It can get kinda hard at times. Graphics are old but definitely not outdated. Near the end of the game, when you get into those weird limbo/space/open kinds of maps it can honestly get worth to stare at for a moment and enjoy the scenery.
I doesn't focus on the storyline much so you could say it is just run 'n' shoot game, but here it doesn't matter at all.
I recommend playing this by 1-2 hour parts before sleep/work/school... You get instant action and relax you need. If you would play this in 5-10 hours span, you could get frustrated and bored.
Bottom of it all, just fuckin' play it. This is like Mortal Kombat of FPSs. 
(omg, '98? These devs must have been out of their minds to pull out a game of this magnitude in the age of mid-psone)"
17807,"is good
"
17808,Best game

Even though the game is legendary and great, i recomend to buy."

17821,This game is so much fun. My first game since I was 5 years old and Im too afraid that time because of the zombies xDDDDDd
17822,"Rarely do you find a shooter from the late 90s that still holds up in 2020. It's community is still alive and well, mostly due to Half Lifes incredible modding scene, you can really get lost for hours with how much community content there is for this game. The ONLY downside I can think of is that the game breaks at higher FPS caps.
9/10. Masterpiece"
17823,ehhh it gud
17824,classic game
17825,"Really good for the 90's. Still holds up today, except for the freaking platforming. SMH."
17826,"Half life changed how video games were made when it came out in November 1998. It introduced story elements past ""Shoot thing, kill thing"" that was seen in classic DOOM and others like it. It pioneered the use of skeletal animation in video games, and without it, we wouldn't have TF2 or Counter-Strike. Its graphics, while dated today, were revolutionary for 1998, and it is a must-have for anyone who plays video games."
17827,veyy goo
17828,Gordon Susman
17829," remember the old saying save, save, save, that jump gave me a bit of trouble just crouch walk to the edge and jump. now after Zen you meet the big boss if you have saved the max ammo in all weapons the go for Nihilanth if not knock out the yellow shards sticking out of the walls, your sent to another level kill the two legged creatures quick, dive in and get ammo quick look out for water creature, keep your ammo one small ledges ammo and health jump into water. other end jump up and out to boss, hide behind rock close to him use arrows shots marked with yellow blood, use 99% of all ammo except rockets, then go for rockets  you must be loaded up wit these otherwise it wont work good luck"
17830,It may be graphically dated but Half-Life is still such a great game
17831,"I have played this game for exact one hour now and I like it.
It's a crazy good game.
I also made a video about it on my Youtube channel:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYJVL7indMQ

This is the 9th episode of the series: Lets play... One hour session. I play every game for exact one hour and then stop. No matter where I am in the game.

I do a lot of game reviews, where I play a game for exacly one hour, no more no less.

If you like a good Classic FPS game with a good storyline, you should play this game!"
17832,"YEET
"
17833,Pretty T H I C C if you ask me
17834,"Half-Life was a revolutionary game at its age. 
DOOM invent FPS, and Half-Life invents story-telling on it.
Playing this game today, it's certainly not easy.
The control is weird and clunky, and the level design is sometimes unfair and no clear enough.
But I still glad I beat it because this is a game that affects all FPS later on. You can even call it ""The origin of modern-day FPS""."

17839,this is a great game
17840,"absolute 1998 classic! not as good as the CD version though, due to no bhopping and speed cap. it's still good nonetheless for regular gameplay!"
17841,"Half-Life is a game I have put off for some time and finally decided to take the time to play it through. The game is not bad besides the random character locks and last few chapters were not very enjoyable. it may be old, but still holds up to today's first person shooters. Half-Life expands on what games have all learned from and used today. It is an amazing example of how much of a leap game development had taken. Half-Life deserves to be played by everyone."

17852,One of the greatest singleplayer FPS games of all time! Remember completing this on hard difficulty back in 2004.
17853,finished the game and accidentally took too long to walk through the portal. Gman nerfed me and i died so i felt kind of bad and went back to the previous save to kill the nihilanth again but the funky 90's techno music didn't stop so i got the fight the nihilanth with it playing in the background. gman even delivered part of his speech over it. sick

17871,As  a 20 year old game it still holds up pretty good. though i didn't like completing the game because of low graphics. but the gameplay was fun. If you want to play the game in 2020 i would prefer you buy the black mesa version.

17879,"This game truly is amazing. It combines action with puzzle solving to create this grand experience. You'd think it hasn't aged well, yet it still delivers the story points and makes this amazing experience."
17880,This is AMAZING!
17881,It has zombie
17882,"run, think, shoot, live"
17883,"It is very overrated. The graphics and ai are of the time which i do not fault, what i do fault however is the s**t level design with the direction of the game uncertain for 99% of the game. The gun play is good but some of the features of the game like being quiet at one point of the game either are half baked or not well explained. Play the remake instead, i haven't played it but i dont think it can be as bad as this. Nevertheless if you can get past the terrible level design then i'd say play it (not to mention it is very cheap and easy to run)

Level Design 3/10
Audio 2/10
graphics 6/10
combat 8/10
replayability 2/10

overall i'd give it 5/10, not terrible but not great either"
17884,"I've played Half-Life just recently, after all the HL3 meimeis and HL2 comments expressing the masterfulness of it's very design. And as a man how has only heard that from the series, I can say that the first game was a quite the surprise. Though I wouldn't recommend playing it in hard if you are in for the story, or in any other circumstance as there is no achievement or in-game reward for doing so, other than a sense of accomplishment and dread. Also, The graphics are very enjoyable for a time in which everything has to have more polygons that the entirety of Super Mario 64. So... yeah, this was a cool gaming experience."
17885,It's a classic and worth a sale price.
17886,A masterpiece.

17894,Still a pretty decent game despite the age.
17895,"Very very fun, takes around 6-7 hours to complete if you're quick. Would probably recommend a skip on the xen part though"
17896,"Half Life is Valve's stunning debut game, which is still great fun to play in 2020. Despite somewhat clunky graphics and some less fun sections, Half Life is an amazingly unique experience. With 10+ hours of exciting, diverse gameplay that focuses on tactical level-solving and combat, Half Life is definitely a game you should play.

[spoiler] I should also mention that if you're familiar with other Valve games, it is really an unparalleled feeling when you hear the iconic Valve intro music play somewhere in the middle of the game [/spoiler]"

17899,"it was gud also imma kid so ""it just works"" as the great tom howard says hes ok"
17900,"While this is not the most appealing game in terms of visuals, Half-Life 1 is still a very great game. I finally got a chance to play this game after being told how great it is for years and I must say that I have enjoyed my time playing this game. I never thought a game from 1998 could play so well and handle itself like Half-Life 1 has. One issue I do have, however, is that controlling Gordon Freeman feels like you're on ice but other than that? It is a great game and I recommend that everyone should play this at least once in their lifetime."
17901,This game is very confusing i have gotten 2 headaches please help
17902,"The original game is what I played as a child you can either use the old graphics or the new ones from 2001, it's a great game and I've beaten it over like maybe 3 times at this point, it's not much but I take a long time on each play through"

17919,"Still worth playing, but the platforming at the end is frustrating and janky.

This is from a time when games were simpler, but this game pioneered integrated narrative.  Despite how simplisitic the game feels today, the level of challenge it offered made me give a lot of character to the unseen enemies (whoever sent the soldiers).  The Valve sense of humor and challenge is well intact here."
17920,"I love this game, it's epic. nothing wrong or broken with it that I have noticed, and I just love the retro games, that came from the early 2000s, or before that!!

I love this game so much, keep up the good work valve"

It was a fun play-through, and I'll probably play Black Mesa too. 5/5"

17951,epic game
17952,"eh, it's good"
17953,"One of the best FPS games ever made.   Half-Life took the established, fledgling FPS industry (mostly consisting of DooM and DooM ripoffs) and turned it on it's head with very high production values and deeper gameplay, storytelling, problem solving and puzzles embedded seamlessly into the game world.

While this is superseded by Black Mesa, which should be played instead of this as it's effectively a full remaster, the thumbs up should stay because it is playable and it should be an example to the many thousands of indie devs who should learn from this example... design excellence, rich content, polish, cutting edge graphics and high production values are what brings success."

17963,"Beat the game for the first time, and wow. I though it's age would have affected my experience but i've never been so envoloped in a story before. Great game, something to beat at the minimum once."
17964,"You're trying to find negative comments, aren't you?"
17965,best game than half life
17966,"In all honesty, the game is not perfect. Even for a game released in 1998, it has problems. The game can drag on when your just walking and WALKING and walking. Something I never had with Half Life 2,  besides the beginning. Though, in all honesty, this might be the best game of 1998. And yes, I know Ocarina of Time was released the same year.

There is no cutscene. You are always in control. When a character is talking, you can walk around and do just about whatever you want. Also, speaking of control, youre never held back. You can kill anyone you want. And, it's satisfying. Truly, it is! If you're bored and want this guy whose been talking for 3 minutes dead? Pull out that gun, kill him. There is never something holding you back in this game, and I LOVE it. Also, not only that, but after you fight someone for a while and finally get that bullet that kills him, it is truly more satisfying than Half Life, because one thing that is truly rare is that they made the enemies, specifically the soldiers, have the same amount of health as you. It's not like every other game ever released, when usually the starter enemy is a lot weaker than you. That's because your both people. And, once again, I LOVE it. 

If this game was released today with good graphics, it can still be great. Except for the glitches. There are tons of glitches I encountered the game. Actually, sadly, this is one of the glitchiest games I have ever played. I've seen multiple cutscenes about to start, and then the NPC disappears. Guns don't work and you have to kill yourself just for them to work. 

Overall, it's not a perfect game. Half Life 2 is MUCH better. But, this is without a doubt still a great game."
17967,"Nice game, but I got stuck in the maze area. Also, the controls are REALLY funky and it takes a while to get used to. Still, great game for Valve's first"
17968,its half life...
17969,I feel like the game spent a long time away from the excitement expecially with the train intro. Never the less great game

17977,i have played this with many more hours but it is nonetheless awesome with some few minor mods and tweaks to a extent for bunnyhopping if you speedrun this game and regular playthrough although for how old it is for me it has aged well and will always be a favorite of mine.

17996,half life yes
17997,WHY DO I HAVE TO PURCHASE IT WHEN IT WAS FREE

18007,yes
18008,One of the best PC games in history. Still as good today as it was when it came out.
18009,Old.. But GOLD!!!
18010,Do you know who ate all the donuts?
18011,"An iconic game. It didn't age perfectly, but it given its age, it is more than decent even today. Consider buying ""Black Mesa"" which is a remake of this wonderful game."
18012,"Overall, this is an excellent game, it looks very good and has a great story. But as this is my first time playing, and I've never watched a walk through before, I had no idea what happened in the game apart from the very basic premise. 

My main gripe, which is in my opinion a big one, is that for a new player like myself with no prior knowledge of the game, playing it and progressing can be difficult at times. Sure, some of the puzzles I should've guessed, but other ones I had absolutely no idea what to do or where to go and would have to consult with a Youtube video to find out what to do next. The game doesn't really seem to give you any pointers, just leaves you on your own to get frustrated at what on earth do you have to do to advance.
For me, this does ruin the game quite a bit as instead of just enjoying playing through the story and completing the puzzles I am frustrated and lost. I'm sure this might be partly to do with the fact that I don't really play story-style games, but nonetheless I think that is a serious flaw of the game.

If you enjoy sci-fi, adventure and action and don't mind getting frustrated often, this is the game for you.

If you're just looking for a chilled out sci-fi or adventure game that is easy to follow, Half Life is probably not going to be as good of an experience as people rave about.

For me, I still enjoy the game, not as much as I was expecting but I am still enthusiastic to play it.

7.5/10"
18013,It's the best
18014,It was not easy to finish
18015,yeS
18016,Gordon Feetman
18017,yeah it's a classic
18018,"Half Life 1 is one of the best fps games ever that i played,the story is very good,soundtrack is very very very good that i fell in love with it. Gameplay is good like for the 1998 it is so good. I recommend this game for people who like older games and to for people who have pc that can't run new games."
18019,It's Half-Life. Yea it's a bit clunky but it still holds up pretty well for a game of its age. People still play the deathmatch which is pretty cool as well.
18020,This game is fun but some parts were difficult. Would recommend.
18021,"Haha, bhop go whooooooosh!"
18022,"A Masterpiece 90s game that defined story-driven shooters. Black Mesa is your go-to for a more modernized experience but Half-Life 1 is a blast regardless, in all its gold source quirks. Play it even if just to get a glimpse of game history. (just don't play Half-Life: Source)"

I've had a blast playing this game. While it is a bit antiquated by today's standards, that didn't change my level of enjoyment for this title. I had a great time solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and working my way through the levels of this game. If you get a chance to play this game, you definitely should."

18057,good shit bruh

18059,"
	The Half-Life game series is arguably the most influential in the PC gaming industry. It starts in 1998, most of the popular games at the time were Quake and Doom. In those games you play as super soldiers. Super hero-like characters with powerful strength. When Half-Life came out, you literally spawned playing as ‚Äúman on his way to work‚Äù. It was a new concept compared to any other game, and even more relatable to the player. You didn't have super-strength, you didn't have mind-control. You were a normal scientist with a hazard suit. The suit, named HEV suit or Hazardous Environment Suit. It was the only real power that the main character, Gordon Freeman had at his disposal. It's a suit that's not meant for war, simply working in hazardous environments. 

	When you start the game, you are greeted with a long train ride to your workplace. You are Gordon Freeman, a man with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. Along the train ride, you witness the advanced AI. You see NPCs (Non Playable Characters) at work, at break and interacting with each other. Having normal human conversations, such as ‚ÄúDo you know who ate all the doughnuts?‚Äù And generally complaining about work environments or equipment failures. 

	You work at Black Mesa Research Facility, a government facility located in the New Mexico desert. It's a top secret facility working on all sorts of super cool futuristic technologies. A massive underground facility with housing, amenities and even their own TV and news entertainment. They have a small security force that works all over the facility to protect it from any failed Frankenstein-like experiments.

	When you arrive at your train stop, you are greeted by a friendly security guard who lets you out of your train and warns you that you are late to work and they are soon going to start a big experiment. Once freed from the train car, you enter the lobby of Sector C. You are then greeted by NPCs who tell you that you are late and must go to the test chamber. Once you have put on the HEV Suit and arrived at the test chamber, you begin the experiment. As predicted, it goes very wrong. You unintentionally create a portal to another planet prompting the native species to invade earth.

	Fighting your way through the facility, you learn that the military has been ordered to cover up everything. They do this by eliminating everyone associated with the failed experiment. When the military fails, the CIA special forces are there to do the same thing. They are even ordered to eliminate the leftover military forces who originally failed. All while this is happening, the player is mysteriously stalked by a man known as The G-Man. A tall pale man in a blue suit carrying a black leather briefcase. Nothing is really known about him and how he relates to the main game, but it's speculated that he plays a major role.

	I rate Half-Life 10/10. It is an absolute perfect RPG with an engaging story. Although at the time it took them 6 years to release Half-Life 2, I was not born yet so it did not affect me! I got to play the half life series back to back and I enjoyed every bit of it! I‚Äôve bonded with many friends over the Half-Life series and even the games based off of Half-Life such as the Counter-Strike series, HL Deathmatch, Ricochet, Day Of Defeat and Gary‚Äôs Mod. All great games that originally started with Half-Life, a game about a man who had a bad day at work.

Considering this game came out in 1998, it still plays considerably well. The game is a little hard at times, so I recommend you bind the quick save button to an accessible button and save often."

18087,"This game is awesome and for a game that is over 20 years old, it still holds up incredibly well! This is such a great game!"
18088,"I bought this when it came out on CD-ROM, and played the game to death in my late teens.  It still has legs, the puzzles are a lot harder than I remember and the levels are challenging without feeling too repetitive.  The atmosphere really draws you in, and the tension just never lets up.  No such thing as an 'easy' enemy either, even the most basic monster can be deadly if your health is under 40.  Look, it's dated in terms of graphics obviously, but don't let that deter you - you'l hardly even think about that once you're about 6 levels into the game.  It's easy to see the roots of the modern Wolfenstein in this game, as well as other shooters such as Prey.  Heck pretty much outside of Doom and Quake, HL is the most influential FPS of all time.   I never really got into Counter Strike, and I'm not a multi-player guy, so for me, I cannot comment on those aspects of the game.  But as a solo player in 2020, HL is well worth your time and money."

18096,"Since Half Life is a classic game that many gamers make a pilgrimage to play it pains me to say this but I've never played a more annoying and needlessly frustrating game in my life. With games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne where being challenging is apart of the experience, Half Life is difficult with the sole purpose of being a throne in my side. I'm currently at Surface Tension, and stuck in that room with like a million trip mines. Every step I take I blow up out of nowhere. This game autosaves at some of the most inconvenient times, it's so easy to die to the point a damn ball point pen could kill you, it has the most clunky controls I've ever seen (I acknowledge that it was made it 1998 but I've played games of the NES with tighter controls) if you fall six inches off the ground you lose half your health, ECT. I'm not even having fun playing Half Life anymore. I'm just playing it to be done with it so I can uninstall it and never look at its stupid, smug logo ever again."
