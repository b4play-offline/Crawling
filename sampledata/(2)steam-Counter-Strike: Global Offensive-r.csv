5,"This game and the developers are the most BS ive ever seen.

You play solo and get a group of 3 or 4 Premades. They troll you, they take turns attacking / killing you and if you fight back or leave you get a ban. So you are forced to sit it out, waste your time, just to -at the end of game- get kicked. And then you get a ban for being kicked. 

That way, one or another, you keep stacking your cooldown times. Then you come back after it ran out, just to not load into a game. Which isnt your fault. You have played countless other games, GTA, LOL, Battlefield, Phasmophobia, Rocket League, you name it. All working perfectly fine. But CSGO? No it doesnt. You get stuck in a loading Screen unable to join the match you accepted. You restart the game, if you are lucky without the standard ""this game is already running""-fault message. You try to load into the game again. Maybe again. No matter how many tries, once you load into this crap, you see that you are stuck in warm-up alone with a bot. Everyone else left and so do you. Just to see? You get a cooldown for not connecting to the match. 

And in the few rare ocasions that you actually make it into a game without anything mentioned above you either have cheaters, russians refusing to speak english, a 8 year old kid screaming his lungs out or an e-girl (that the rest of your team jumps on trying to hit on her or keeps ""having fun"" taking part in sexual harrassment. 

And if all that is not happening to you, you might enjoy spending quality time with your gambling addiction opening boxes for ~3 EUR and if you are lucky you get a skin worth  ~2 EUR every billion boxes opened. 

Seriously, its not a bad game itself. But community and developers? Just for them Im praying for another '39 or that they have tourists in their office like CH Magazine had in Paris."

67,"This game is definitely doesn't worth to play in 2022. You'll probably find something interesting in here, except those guys who wants to be cyberathletes. You better try smth more interesting that this... Okay, if you really reading reviews about CS:GO it means that you are just looking for funny comments or YOU WANT THIS GAME TO BE YOUR ROUTINE, YOUR WORK. In that case I give you one advice: aim is the second important thing in that game. First is your understanding of everything that happens. What your enemy will do, how you can surprise them, what move will be the best in specific situations, etc. But it doesn't means that aim is nothing. It means a lot, but with understanding of the game it will be much easier to use your aim skills at full power. Good luck bro."

86,"I started an account and found guys running around backwards aiming at the ground and head shooting me.  Also, getting shot in places there was no way they could have known I was there. Anyway, people admitted to cheating and said it was okay with steam and if you want games without cheaters you need a PRIME account, I paid for a prime account and now there are LESS cheaters but still SOOOO many that it's difficult to rank up. In fact, I feel like I have to win like 10-15 games to rank up but If I lose 2 games it will down rank me.  Everyone else says the same thing and they say steam is the only gaming platform where the lowest ranking players are many time as good or BETTER than the highest ranking players.  If you want to play CSGO and rank up without cheating> GOODLUCK!"

133,"To all players with or without prime, 1st, 2nd, 3rd class citizens. In writing this statement of intent, I would like to represent the non-prime players who have been pushed to the margins of society in the past time.
Given that we were all born and raised on the same planet, we are all the same. Do you remember the good old days when Prime was not a thing? Stack-5 days without leaving your non-prime bro behind? Do you remember the times when you screamed in the cyber cafés after a 1v5 clutch? Or those days nade stacking against cheaters with the bros?
Alas, Valve is like a demon, for his sake he divided us. The teammates were suddenly divided high-class and low-class citizens, not because of their ranks but because of Prime. There were parents who have lost their children, women who have lost their husbands, and friends who are no longer pals, all because of Prime. There were people who even wanted to k!ll themselves when there was only 1 match away from lvl 21, right in front of heaven's gate. There were youngsters who were trying hard, suddenly lost in life. There were also young merchants who suddenly lost their daily bread. Some could not bear the pressure and had to leave, forever.
I decided today I wanted to take the power back. I had a revelation that I had to be empowered to be a non-primer today more than ever. Non-primers are also human beings. Non-primers have the right to be loved, to be treated with dignity and respect. On behalf of the non-prime community, please grant that right to us!"

149,"Reasons why I don't recommend this game:
1. Kids speaking russian ( I understand it but you might not ) 
2. One of your team will troll or disconnect and if it's not from your team it will be from the enemy team.
3. Mic abuse 
4. Look up 2. again. 
5. All games you either stomp or the enemy stomps you 
6. If it isn't a stomp it will be a 14:16 or 7:9 game which feels bad too
7. Look up 4. 
8. If you lose 1 game you are likely to demote, if you win 4-5 in a row you don't move up. Hidden Elo so you don't know how close to demotion you are. 
9. Look up 7. 
The only good reason to play this is for CS 1.6 / CSS Nostalgia"

195,"Chess is dead

Chess hasn't been updated in almost 200 years and it's obvious the devs have abandoned it. The greedy creators took your money and laughed all the way to the bank.

I remember back in 705 AD when chess was fun. Then they started adding stupid features no one wanted like ""Castling"" and ""En Passant"" instead of listening to player feedback and fixing game-breaking bugs. I've been complaining for YEARS about the collision-detection glitch with the horsey. The ""clipping-thru-pieces"" bug has been abused to death and the lazy devs refuse to fix it.

Don't support this awful behaviour and boycott this company."

298,"I'm not one to leave a review for many games, but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most surreal ""experiences"" of my entire career. I have met a wide range of people, from actual NPC's whom I cannot control by pressing e while spectating, to Canadians playing on the same NA servers cursing me out in French while getting spitroasted in mid. I have developed a gambling addiction which is not even fueled by my wallet, but my friends who has gotten a second-hand addiction through watching. I have to continue fueling the addiction every week or else the e-devil will burst out through my floorboards and force me to actually play the game with the people you find while solo queuing instead of just gambling for 60% of the hours you spend on this fucking application.  
You always think that the crate isn't worth opening until you realize that you only have to spend $5 to open, and you think about hitting big profit on the market and how worth it will be. Then since you spent $5 you might as well open 2 crates to double your odds right? Wrong. The odds of pulling a profitable skin out of crates is less than you discovering actual Spanish gold and being set for life without touching the steam marketplace. It is 99.25% of you pulling a skin that costs from .03 cents to around $2.30, which isn't even enough to pay off the key price. 
I hope whoever plays this game doesn't develop a crippling gambling addiction and focuses more of their hours off the marketplace and on the recoil patterns. :)"

439,"1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Prime solves this problem a bit, but 15$ just for ability to play ranked matches with less cheaters is just a stupid thing to be in game. As if Valve couldn't afford some working anticheat.

What I don't like about this game is these mentally weak fu**ing cheaters polluting this game.>:(
BUT that's not the worst... The worst are the even weaker and shi*tier players who do not cheat but play with the cheater and do not kick him out of the game and then yell ''EZ'' in the chat when they win. :/

Anyway, it's a good shooter game overall."

902,CSGO>Valorant
903,"Great tactical/movement fps that holds up today despite it's age. My only issues are the technicality of it being free to play, while it is free, and I got tons of enjoyment without spending money, it still locks you out of the wingman gamemode unless you play against bots. My other issue is that even though the CSGO movement engine is the smoothest, and most technical engine I have ever seen, it feels that this game dosent showcase well in the official maps and I hope the next map valve adds utilizes more underused features like drowning, airstrafing, maybe surfing. Overall this game is a 10/10 for any fps fan, it has a little for everyone"
904,fun to play

924,"CSGO is like a unwanted child, you've probs thought to disown it or put it towards adoption, this game is literally that, you either want to uninstall the game, sell the skins you've bought or smash the living sh1t out of your keyboard. This game has made my life from bad to worse. I could of accomplished so much more things:

- Get Hoes
- Go Gym
- Invest more into Crypto instead of this game
- Go out more
- Have a life
- Be less Anti-Social

What I've done in CS, what it's done for me, and what I've accomplished:

- Having a sh1t day
- Wasting money on this game
- Getting a terrible rank even with the new ranking system
- Getting queued up with idiots who shouldn't be in a specific rank
- Having terrible servers
- Having a terrible cooldown system
- Having a terrible anti-cheat, TRUST ME ITS DOGSHlT

This is why I love CSGO!"

1134,"unfriendly players everywhere in ranking , and the unboxing system is just an addiction if you had gambling problem yet.  
Not a bad game and its great to win with team work . Frankly , there's always some conflicts between Hong Kong player/ Taiwan player and China player , which directly ruin the whole game and its terrible to hear their arguing and rude words.
Anyway , don't play ranking if you can not bear some toxic player . Also , if you still want to play ranking , mute the toxic player as fast as possible for great gaming experience. 
Hacking problems are also fading indeed , maybe it just because I am prime player now.

1186,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Possibly the most addictive, frustrating and satisfying game I've ever played. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years."

1675,"Game is fun but toxic. Cheating has been improved due to the newer prime system but the game does still have a lively hacking community. The report and review system for this is pretty robust compared to most other games. The gameplay itself is unique for a tactical shooter as well as has tons of fun community maps to play on. I recommend playing this but at your own risk due to cheater and extremely toxic people. No joke, CSGO has one of THE most toxic communities in all of gaming and sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's very very annoying."

1689,"I am a 44 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Counter Strike and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1690,Im telling you there are alot of cheaters
1691,ehh
1692,"Loved the game from the very beginning in the 90's. 
Im not a gamer but i constantly play CSGO. Likely a nostalgia type of situation as i don't play anything else."
1693,asf asd
1694,The only reason I can give a negative review of this game is because of the lack of patches to fix the hackers. I do not recommend anyone to buy this game. Most lobbies I play in have at east one hacker. Its annoying because of how fun this game is. If valve decides to fix there anti cheat and actually spend money on making the experience fair then i will rewrite this review.
1695,don't hate yourself
1696,"The question asked by Steam, prompting me to write a review is exactly as it follows ""Would you recommend this game to other players?"". To answer truthfully and bluntly? No.

The reason? Let's take a look at the current monetization model of the game itself: The game is free to play. You can download it, play casual matches, competitive matches, you basically have full access to the game itself. But here's the catch - you can't earn ""crate drops"" or ""skin drops"". That's a shame, surely, but no major inconvenience. No, what truly is a bad draw here is that you're essentially barred from filtered matchmaking, That means more cheaters for you, and you can't earn rankings. For anyone who is North American, you would have to pay around $14.99 to get prime access. The same amount the game costed before going free to play. For anyone who isn't North American...mileage may vary. A lot. For example, in Brasil, the game used to cost around R$32. Affordable, not outrageous. Then it became Free To Play with the Prime Clause. Prime was around R$25.00. Very much affordable. Then the Prime Clause was taken down, and the price for priem access bumped to to R$85.00. What? No idea. Regional Pricing apparently died in Gabe Newell's closet when it comes to this game.

Alright, beyond sketchy pricing and senseless monetization models, let's take a look at the game itself. Rampant hackers in and out of Prime filtered matchmaking. VAC is faulty at best, completely unhinged at worse (Blocking up matchmaking for random players until they've restarted their computers or steam, removing you from matches by 'mistake', etc.). Extreme toxicity, very flimsy Anti-Game behavior punishment system, exploitable networking settings, lacking map design, negligence of game bugs & issues, extreme crate marketing with little to no substantial updates to much needed sectors of the game.

If you can ignore all of that, or if it simply does not affect you, then by all means it's a solid FPS competitive game. Grab five or so friends, hop in a few matches. The core gameplay mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master. It's also one of the few alive FPS games in a competitive enviroment that hasn't surrendered to the flashy appeal of superpowers. I don't know about you, but I'll take a good ol' flashbang grenade any time over a fireball cast over a battlefield littered by ice walls, shadow monsters and colorful little magic tricks."

1728,"I would be amazed if anyone is still looking at reviews for this game after all this time but:

This game is my own personal hell and I can't escape it.

The servers will upset you, your teammates will upset you, and hackers will upset you.

The moments in between are a fun adrenaline rush that mimic some kind of cocaine fueled bender - you'll feel invincible and horrible all at the same time.

With that being said, I've made lifelong friends playing this game and can never stay away from it for more than 3 years at a time. This game is like that abusive, gas-lighting ex that your friends warned you about.

0/10 - Lose the toxic ass community that sends me r@pe and death threats regularly just for making call outs, and I would give it a 10/10 just for barbaric excitement that can only come from clutching a round.

1794,"Have you ever felt the urge to drown a Japanese person? Have you felt the urge to draw and quarter various anime characters? Do you wake up hoping that Japan sinks into the ocean (no longer a land menace)?

Well then this game is for you! Even though the Glorious CCP will jack up prices on various ak laminate skins to your monthly rent and ensure that you can't afford a single sticker that came out more than 3 years ago, at least there are no Japs in pro play(?) 

I love half life opposing force and I hope it stays pure of fish people! Imagine eating raw fish. 🤮 🤢. Glory to the CCP and all of it's beautiful members who use the skins in this game to launder money from stolen American debit accounts! I wish that anime was higher fps so that the people who watch it would die of strokes and no longer menace to society. I love AK red laminate skin and madrigal corporation (from breaking bad) and ICDX level from geometry dash opposing force.

I dislike Japan 🗾🛑

इसीलिए बोहोत अच्छे प्लेयर्स भी हैक करने लगे है। बाकी गेम बहुत अच्छा है ७/१० | ३ हैकर्स की वजह से कम नहीं तो १० रेट करता।

2126,"I am a 44 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Counter Strike Global Offensive and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2173,"Ah, the good ol' Counter Strike: It's Russia Time. When Valve created this game in the prehistoric days, comrade Gabe asked to the russians ""Aye comrades, want a russian game?"" to which the russians replied ""Da, comrade Walter White"" and so comrade Gabe and his staffs made the game and released the game. It became a global success because the game mechanics offer you the most russian game than any other russian type game, You can hear people speak russian every second. You can speak, walk, shoot, swim and drink like a russian. It is truly one of the russian of all time. I would humbly rate this game a russian out of 5. Putin would be proud."

Matchmaking system here is sucks, you are starting lets say like for first time you launch casual and there you can get the highest rank enemy or cheater. but hey YOU CAN PLAY WITH FRIENDS workshop maps like hide and seek or go to offline match with them and Bounce from walls (recommend turning on sv_falldamage_scale 0) so yeah if you enjoy shooting games go for it"

2680,"Like: 
1. It's a great game who can make you improve your reflexes & analytical brain.
2. You can make new acquaintance and in time why not, friends.
3. The mic communication with your team are a very cool way to know and understand other people from other countries. Understand they're perception and conceptions about world & people in general. I find out new behaviors from simply talking with guys in my team or the enemy team.
Unlike:
1. Steam doesn't give a funk anymore for players to have a smooth and a beautiful experience. That means they didn t improve they're anti-hack system for years now. I can suggest for steam to hire members to do only overwatch.
And maybe for the directors board to not think only to make money.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

"
2840,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

3030,"I played this game when I was younger and I had a lot of fun and got into it from the Misfits since they had so much fun playing it. However my account got hacked 3 years into making my account and I didn't get it back until over a year later which steam support did near to nothing to help. When I got back I saw that I was VAC banned which was from the hacker using my account to cheat in-game, when I contacted steam support about this even showing I was hacked they said I could not get my account un-VAC banned and now they have the not saying it is my fault because I am in charge of my security but please tell me how someone hacking in my account is my fault? I was stuck with it on my account and it even shows it to other people saying I'm a dirty fu**ing cheat when I didn't even have access to my account when the VAC ban was issued. If you are wanting to play a game just go play COD or Val or any other FPS. Total waste of time and any money I have spent on the game."

3087,"CSGO is a very good game that you can play when your happy, sad, bored, tired, or most other emotions because there are so many fun options including just playing with some well designed bots that you can very easily customise to your skill set. One thing that I don't like is that most of the modes are search and destroy, and I know that that is how these games work but I would personally like more variety. My favourite mode is probably the Arms Race because I enjoy being able to try all of the guns to find out how they work and even extend my skill set and work out of my comfort zone."

3382,"God boring combat loop , with one of the worst multiplayer maps I have ever played.
With the worst hitboxes I have seen.

Weapons-
Buy the Op ones and the other ones just become useless filler trash.Might as well have only 4 weapons.
Most weapons are shit besides only like 4.Their bullets have a very retarded spray to the point it's comedic.

Map design-You are fighting bad layouts more than the actuall enemy
Get this , they put 3000 corners in a game built for corner camping.

General Thoughts:
This is Over-Rated trash and I don't and won't see how this became a E-Sport Giant.

Russians/Slavs in general;
Pure cheating subhumans , they can't play without their paste and even hearing one is bad luck on itself.
Almost everyone is this game is a dirty subhuman slav that cheats.
And the ones that are actually legit and good , die very easy due to low dm skill or camp corners 24/7 with awp.

Nothing rewarding or fun.
This is just a grind fest for third worlders or people who shit themselfs at the thoughts of a balanced game or player speed that is just a tad bit faster than a snail's.


Game modes-
Doesn't matter.
The game suffers from it's own combat and level design.
But this isn't a game is it.It's a shitty gambling simulator with no love or a sign of balance."

I've been thinking alot lately about jesus and the bible, its kinda crazy that most people these days are goinh straights to hell.

i here the nword being screamed over voice chat at me and its un-ironically so dumb, i report them but still, i dont think they get banned. Its a break in the system. Its in the games code.

I'm lowkey fr feeling like Kim and Kenya should get back together and free the true world but we'll have to see what happems.

3546,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.

I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product

Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).

Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.

It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).

Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).

Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.

If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.

In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very."

3855,"In CS:GO, you play the role of a hot masculine special agent, whitch objective it is to either defuse a bomb planted by the terrorists or plant the bomb as a said terrorist. In this game, you encounter a healthy amount of cultural and political diversity, from countries such as russia, poland, middle east and russia and middle east and poland etc. These people, especially from russia, are very open-minded and accepting of whoever you are. From my experience, they really like the LGBTQ+ community and people from Germany. It is a great game to meet new friends from many different countries like russia, russia, russia and russia. You can also improve your language skills just by listening to the lovely sweet conversations by your mates in the CS:GO voice chat.
So anyway, wo also gets a stiffy when dominated by a russian cheater with a masculine, bone deep voice or is it just me? I mean just the thought of me getting absolutely obliterated by a muscular north-eastern Siberian young man who fights with bears on a regular basis. The thought of you being stuck in one lobby with him with no way out because your mates won't surrender. The warm and sweaty feeing of helplessness does really drive me INSANE ( in a good way///) I usually inseminate the underside of my desk after the eight round because i am a weak ass but i really wish i could go for longer. Because of my kink, i wake up every morning flaming with ecxitement to hop on a fresh round of de_office and try my luck. But because of my relatively high trust factor and the recent effectiveness of VAC (curse this damned programm) i can no longer have fun 8x a day :(. It is really hard to encounter cheaters nowadays which really disappoints me. Sometimes i really think about quitting the game because there are too few cheaters. I really wish valve would do something to combat the frequent banning of cheaters. In my opinion, they should remove VAC and the overwatch system, because they are too effective and ruin my fun.
I think i might have lost my way, but i shall continue. Just hearing the ﷽ ﷽ from your lovely arab teammate makes you feel like you're in another country. I recommend playing CS:GO with an open voice chat, especially if you have mental health problems and/or suicidal thoughts, because your teammates and even your enemies will be very supportive and help you seek appropriate help for your problems. The CS:GO community is a wonder of its own and worth exploring. Playing CS:GO is like balm for the soul. It helps you find inner peace and guides you on your path to your better self.
CS:GO is the cool breeze from the west, the crackling of the autumn-colored leaves under your boots, the sparkling of cool water in the summer heat, the reflections of light on a sweaty, muscular male body, the Creme à la Creme of video games by far."

3971,"This game is great if you are a fan of fps games. The downside is that it is much harder to learn compared to other fps titles, but also has much higher skill ceiling.
You MUST buy prime status upgrade with this game otherwise you will get matched in cheater lobbies in matchmaking.

Positives:

- more tactical sided than other popular shooting games
- team-based game
- shooting mechanics feel great when you learn them
- made a lot of friends thru matchmaking

Negatives:

- running on very outdated game engine
- has many unfixed bugs
- matchmaking is not reliable
- random russian teammates
- cheaters

Great game overall, just needs game engine update of some sort."

4066,"CS:GO is a good game, i have played every version made to date, 1.5, 1.6, and so on to cs:go, i like the game very much i enjoy meeting new people on casual servers and deathmatch, adding them and playing MM with them, the community as a whole is quite friendly and most people get along well, as with any game there a sometimes trolls and people that just want to ruin other peoples day, just ignore them and find the good people talk with a positive attitude and you will notice people will start to enjoy playing with you, the MatchMaking is overall alright they are always trying to adjust it and make it better for what it is, the only issue i have so far with this game is the trust factor, have one or 2 good games in a row or verse a group of trolls, it can ruin your gaming experience very quickly, and it shouldnt be the case at all, play 2 games ina row with 30 kills around this mark and your almost certainly going to get reported by people that either rage every time they get killed or having a bad day etc, and its not fair that your gaming experience can be destroyed by the trolls that are doing it to you, valve is just rewarding them and punishing you on a system that in almost all cases seems flawed, other then that be a positive member of the community and you should have ALOT of fun playing this game"

The bans are based on people who watch demos of players who have been reported.

3 months now and a spinbotter is still not banned... I checked his profile several times.

PUNKBUSTER in Call of Duty 2 was a lot better... and it's much older... Just saying...

4236,"My main source of memories from Counter-Strike: Source come from just finding a random server, getting in and being horrible at the game. I loved every second of it. I want to preface what I'm about to say with the fact that I don't hate eSports. It's cool to see gaming skills finally get recognized as having *some* sort of importance. But this game, even a casual match, feels so competitive it hurts. It doesn't even feel like it's funny anymore. It's just stressful. 

Before this game went to F2P and was more casual friendly, this would have easily been a positive review. Alas, times have changed.

If you're into competitive gaming and eSports, power to you, have fun with this. But for everyone else, just go with Source. Or maybe I just need to play more of it. I dunno."

4499,"The embodied, successive hardware zooms and rewords the ability to incorporate. The interplay is differentiated by a quotations interaction. The former and linguistic spatiality identically and culturally embodies the inconsistency to decisions. Alongside examples from these sequences, it also includes communication tools from various unique observances. The monocolour art scenes deal with the synchronic, eminent displacement."

4682,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

A great competitive game that also has its pitfalls. One of them is the trust factor known to many... Unfortunately, it is a matter that can change the mind of new players and they will play against cheaters.
Conclusion (I evaluate the style of the game and its purpose):
Graphics : 9/10 (this is a competitive game so graphics are not that important)
Teammates : 5/10
Game system : 5/10 (Waiting forever for source 2)
Gameplay: 10/10
Anticheat : 2/10 (even with a good trust factor you can play against cheaters who don't get banned for maybe a year...)

Overall rating: 62%"
4683,good competitive

4706,"I am a 48 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Counter Strike and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

4738,"I have been ufairly banned from overwatch for potentialy cheating. I have 2 exactly the same ""overwatch bans"" recorded on my account for this game what is also weird and not understandable for me as their dates are different. I have never been using any of prohibited softwares to get advantage against opponents in game. I have purchased this account nearly 20 years ago and I've spent over 8k hours in multiple games. I can't believe how csgo developers could agree with unfair decisions of some players and ban my game. I have had significant number of dropped cases and some basic skins which are sentimentally valued for me. I would like to ask some people to help how to resolve that problem as there is not oportunity to appeal of this as Valve explaining that ""I'm the one who takes responsibility for this account"". Is any chance to get in touch with someone from Valve to check my case and let me play back? Thanks in advance."

4804,"Very nice game, but only problem is if you are planing on playing it i recommend it playing with prime status. Because prime status gives you the ability to play with other players with this status and in that case the ammount of cheaters is decreased by a lot. Without prime in competitive i was having games when whole my and enemy team were cheaters and that was happening a lot. But with prime the amount of cheaters is decreased by a lot."

4817,"I have been playing Counter Strike since the games inception as a Mod for Half Life.
Each version has offered updated features and maps with a huge community of map makers.
That said my opinion is that it's an aging game engine long overdue for an overhaul compared 
to the IW and UNREAL engines which offer features like aiming down sights, auto healing, throwing back
grenades, vehicles etc. Imagine a whole new Counter Strike based on either engine with expanded graphics, effects and game play similar to Insurgency??
That said I enjoy playing Counter Strike and playing maps created by the community.
I loved Counter Strike Source with weapons skins and ease of browsing and playing custom maps but since Counter Strike started using the DOT NET platform it did away with modding in favor of subscription to maps thru Steam which all in all is not bad."

5000,"i absolutely despise this game, i will continue playing it though."
5001,"Would be a greater game if the noobware-users actually had a chance of getting VAC-Banned for cheating. Not like now, or for like the past 5 years(if not more) with a outdated non-function anti-cheat(VAC). And also, could you pls stop queing low lvl's steam acc's, with little to no hours, up against high lvl's steam acc's with many hours? cause that almost certainly a guaranteed cheat match(european servers atleast). Let the low lvl's play against each other, then they'll have a blast while cheating their socks of against other cheaters, and its even more fair(same advantages: esp, aimhack etc.).

- I mean come on? where are the ban-waves at? like in the past? haven't seen that i a long time,
 or even a blatant cheater getting a VAC-ban, which i've been que'd up against previously(they still cheating strong for years). Even small time game-developers with 5% of the personal as that of VALVE, do it much better without using a to invasive anti-cheat meassure. 

I would consider supporting the game again buying keys for cases and etc. when i see some improvements that make the game enjoyable. No point in supporting cash-crabs(cases, models etc) if it only goes to more of the same, with more, and more cheaters(whats the point in having/getting skins for a unenjoyable cheat-infested game that's unplayable for others than cheaters which btw. ain't spending any money on the game). The skins gonna get devalued as time passes, and more, and more legit players leave the game. But i guess it's better with cheaters vs cheaters that ain't spending a dime. Thats kinda brilliant, because then you don't have to make more buyable pixels because none will be buying it! :D

- BTW: it would be great if you could reset my trustfactor-score? because it feels like i've been cursed with a very low trustfactor score. All my matches is usually against full cheat lobbies with low steam lvl's etc. And thats not fair, or enjoyable, because i don't cheat, and i ain't planning on cheating anytime soon. But If it's not because of a low trustfactor score, then it can only be that the european servers mostly consists of more cheaters than legit players(could be), or i'm just super unlucky where everytime i start a match iget cheaters(for the most part)."

5020,"The main reason I would suggest anyone to ever install this game onto their computer is that if you have a particular disdain toward other forms of communication on the internet but still enjoy speaking with others the 'Community servers' section of this video-game offers discussion to occur though with a few caveats. I think this suggestion is only desirable short-term, and not a full substitution for your daily social interaction. The interactions that you have on this game seemingly go as 2/200 (%1) the other percentage and potential 198 individuals that you encounter are going to not be very kind, however, the two individuals from this potential grouping that you do meet are people that you will never forget. I think with this particular situation in mind it is still worth playing. I do not think I would ever consider continuing if it were not for the servers ran by the community and some of the people that I have met throughout my time playing. I am in forever debt to those that I have met, and the meaning that they have given me regardless if we are still friends or not. I will take the moment that I played a quad-ot match on train with ten random people, all of us had a good time and were making jokes, laughing and importantly all of us were passionately playing. I will never meet these people ever again. I will never forget this moment."

5023,"A ray of light shines down on a leather-bound storybook. The book opens and a voice begins reading its text:                

SHREK: Once upon a time there was a [[Storybook Princess|lovely princess]]. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible [[Storybook Dragon|fire-breathing dragon]]. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower. For [[Storybook Prince|her true love]] and true love's first kiss.                 

The voice laughs. A big, green hand rips out a page of the book and shuts it closed.                

SHREK: Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of -                

We see an outhouse and hear the sound of a toilet flushing. Out steps [[Shrek (character)|SHREK]], an ogre, who tugs at his underwear and shakes his foot of the page still stuck to his shoe. He looks lovingly at the [[swamp]] he calls home, and goes about his daily routine. This includes taking a mud shower, brushing his teeth with bugs, bathing in a muddy pond, gathering giant slugs for dinner, and painting a warning sign. 

In a [[Village (Duloc)|nearby village]], an [[Angry Mobs|angry mob]] gather up to go after Shrek. At night they gather their torches and pitchforks and enter the swamp, trampling over Shrek's warning signs. Shrek sees them after investigating the commotion, rolling his eyes. The villagers stop outside Shrek's home, unaware that Shrek is sneaking up behind them.

'''NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME'''                                     

Villager 1: Think it's in there?                                     

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!                                     

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?                                      

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.                

Shrek chuckles, revealing himself to be standing behind the mob.                                     

SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant.                                      

The mob gasp.                                      

SHREK: Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...                                      

Shrek slowly approaches as the villagers back away in fear.                                      

Villagers: No!                                     

SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.                                      

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!                 

The villager waves his torch in Shrek's face. Shrek casually licks his fingers and pinches the flame, extinguishing the torch. The villager drops it.                

Villager 1: Right...                                      

Shrek terrifies the mob with a great frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches. He wipes his mouth and waits for the villagers to stop screaming.                                      

SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away. 

Shrek laughs as the men drop their torches and pitchforks and run away as fast they can. 

SHREK: And stay out! (

5102,"You play this game because of either sheer nostalgia or because its drinking/strat roulette or just because you have nothing else to play. It has lost it's luster from years ago when everyone knew the pros, the clips were fresh and the tournaments meant something. The maps. sounds, and guns are all different to the point that if you played this back in say 2015 and pick it up now it's a shell or clone of it's former self. If they ever make CS:GO 2 by using the source engine, as much of the old player-base wishes, and implement skins the same way the competition (Valorant, plus they stole map devs already) uses them with no trading and no market to stop this insufferable pseudo NFT melarky and listen to the fans and dedicated players the game would be much more fun. I miss the old sounds, a simple toggle could fix this. I hate how we don't see our progress with rank. I miss the old goofy stuff  like jump scouting. Perhaps it's the old boomer in me or perhaps the game has actually gotten less fun for both the old and the new player bu the game just isn't in a good place. If the ever decide to actually make a second release (which they won't because they make too much from the damned marketplace transactions) and sucessfully implement the changes I have listed or even take into consideration what the community wants then they will have a true hit on their hands."

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

The competitive game is a bit broken with hackers which anti-cheat system is out of date."
5274,Cuz it s to funny when u have friends to play with
5275,i like it
5276,"a game that you can play with your friends all day
"
5277,"This Game is a real fucking shit show since it is f2p.
Im currently in dmg and this game is unplayable.
Can't play matchmaking because every second game i have atleast 1 cheater (enemy or my team). I don't care about the shitty community or the map pool just got worse and worse since cobblestone was deleted. If i can mute everyone and can play like 3 diffrent decent maps, im fine. But the cheater problem is getting so hard out of hand. Most cheater don't even try to hide there cheats because they know that valve gives a shit about cheater as long as they spending cash for the game.
Valve don't fucking care about the game anymore. Cs go celebrating 10 year anniversary and all they do for the community is realese new stickers. melk the cash cow until its dry. 
Instead of fixxing there shit anti-cheat or maybe release source 2.
If you're a veteran like me. stop playing Matchmaking!
If you're new to the game, just go and play Valorant. Because there Anti-Cheat is 1000x better than VAC."
5278,very good game

-Good game 
-Russians curse at you for free

5292,This game called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is so good. You can play this game only when you buy a new keyboard or mouse to get the second keyboard or mouse once you enter in the match. This game is so good that when in entered in a match i destroyed one mouse and a keyboard. So you can play this game on your risk.

5312,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead- murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time - something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange - uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" - on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

5377,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a worldwide phenomenon, and now Valve's hit team-based shooter is free-to-play! Choose your side -- terrorist or counter-terrorist -- and engage is fast-paced team-based battles with a variety of objectives. Or, take part in the Danger Zone battle royale mode where it's every man (or team) for himself!

Each side has a number of different factions it can represent, each with its own distinct look in both clothes and weapons. You can alter your loadout to suit your needs and to provide the proper role for your team. Teamwork is vital, and there's a limited amount of time to complete your objective, so you'll need to communicate your objectives with your comrades.

CS:GO also has an active esports presence, making it one of the most successful competitive games in the world. It also has a complex economy, with some weapon skins going for hundreds of dollars. Whether you play casual or competitive, for fun or for prizes, CS:GO offers plenty of action!"

5477,"I would recommend this game with the caveat that it takes a while to unlock the ""proper"" game-mode (5v5 comp), and that playing with friends -known as 5 stacks- is pretty much obligatory for a decent game due to the toxicity and poor communication that is standard in online multiplayer games.

If you can avoid these issues then CSGO will give you many hundreds of hours of gameplay, which is fantastic especially considering that it is now a free to play game. Even back when it costed £15 I would still recommend it."

5500,"this game is so unbelievably fucking awful. i am saying this after losing the easiest faceit game ever but that is beside the point. there are so many things wrong with this game. my 'friend' Hanks Prodders would tell me that it's a ""skill issue"", i disagree. i've been recommended this game by many friends, as i play valorant, the better, less suicidal thought bringing version of this game. apparently, this is one of the best games to be made and brought to the steam platform.. i respectfully disagree. i have hair loss and a joyful passion of wanting to end my life to prove it. the only time this game receives updates is to steal all your money from new cosmetics or shitty gun stickers. the fact that they care about colourful m4s more than the fact you can literally jump around, MAC-10 in hand, with perfect accuracy is absolutely mind-blowing to me. i spent money in crates, my lord, was that a waste of money. do not get addicted otherwise you will have to loan your body to make up for the cash you owe your bank. if you're planning to play this game, i do recommend prime due to the mass amount of no life, dribbling little rodent, blatant wallhackers that will try and tell you they're not cheating in normal matchmaking. aside that though, cheeky bit of banter has helped me through these hard times. i will probably keep playing lol. just know, this may be the death of me. thanks.
edit: train is fucking dogshit. how in the world is that map even on a competitive rotation. i'd rather play a roblox wood trimmer obby you useless map designers. suck your mum."

5584,"Yes I would recommend it to other players. The positives are endless accept for a few things and aspects of the game. 
1. The game can become boring if played a lot in a day and over a long time. (600 hours for me). The game just doesn't feel the same. It becomes repetitive, the maps and games
2. Playing can become frustrating. If your teammates aren't doing the right stuff and you are loosing, it can fell hopeless and you wish the game would end. Furthermore, the games can be too hard with the other team being in a full stack or too easy were you are just running around aimlessly killing your opponents.

However, it is amazing game and worth trying. The strategy and precision required is amazing. Love you the game. HIGHLY recommend playing it."

5607,"For me CS GO is one of the best games in history,I remember playing CS 1.6 at internet cafes back in the day and this is a huge upgrade of that,altrough a lot of people say it s not worth playing CS GO in 2022 due to the new shooters and open-world game Imma give you 5 good reasons why you still should play CS GO in 2022,feel free to disagree or agree with me,so here we go.

 Due to the persevering popularity of this legendary game, a betting market has grown, focusing on popular eSports. Other games you can wager on include DotA 2 and League of Legends, but CS:GO remains unwavering on its throne. Getting well-informed before placing your bet is crucial even in traditional sports betting, and especially when it comes to eSports. Therefore, here are the top reasons why playing CS:GO is a great idea even in 2022 (and beyond):
 Straightforward gaming 
Extremely entertaining
 Undemanding requirements 
Globally widespread community
 Available in steam, free-to-play.

Straightforward Gaming
Playing this legendary game is effortless and intuitive, which is also among the top reasons to consider it. CS:GO features a relatively flat learning curve thanks to logical controls and a learning time measured in seconds. 

Getting the hang of different available weapons requires several rounds, and mastering the maps is equally quick. You can also adjust to using the best weapon for each map, which involves a degree of personal preference. Among this game’s best features is that it also includes an FAQ page. If you ever need additional answers and no one to turn to, this resource could prove invaluable.

In other words, you should have no trouble getting into playing CS:GO if you’ve played first-person shooter games before. Additionally, you’ll mostly play as a part of relatively small teams of between two and six people, making managing easy. Simultaneously, despite the availability of numerous maps, players tend to repeat half a dozen over and over, helping you get your bearings more quickly.

You may need a round or two to find your way around, but that’s part of the fun. The more you play, the more you’ll inadvertently practice and become better. However, CS:GO requires you to practice shooting as this aspect of the game acts as the great equalizer. The gaming action will become more intense as your shooting skills progress, which always accounts for more fun.

Extremely Entertaining
The CS franchise is famous worldwide as one of the most straightforward yet most thrilling first-person shooters in video gaming history. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a natural evolution of the first game and one that’s just as entertaining. Unlike the original title, CS:GO focuses more on multiplayer action and tournaments. Whether you are a spectator or player, you can choose between virtually countless different contests, events, and competitions around the globe.

For example, ESL One: Cologne is one of the best events to attend, with RFRSH and ESL generally organizing the highest-level competitions in the pro-circuit. These competitions bring together some of the most skilled professional players from the world over. Consequently, the level of skill spectators witness in each event is mind-boggling and, at times, too unreal to believe. When looking to improve your skills and work out new strategies, we recommend following these pro-level eSports contests.

Undemanding Requirements
When it comes to the top reasons for playing CS:GO, this game excels where other titles generally lose audiences. The industry’s general rule is that the newer the game, the more advanced the hardware it requires. However, because CS:GO is almost a decade old, you won’t need a beastly machine to enjoy its benefits.

Gaming on a budget is the harsh reality for millions of enthusiasts worldwide, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive solves this problem. The minimum hardware and software requirements you need for this game include an Intel Core 2 Duo E6600/AMD Phenom X3 8750, 2 GB Ram, 15 GB HDD, 256 MB or higher GPU, Windows 7, Vista (even XP!), and DirectX 9 compatibility. That’s it!

Globally Widespread Community
Stalled communities are one of the most impactful downsides of countless otherwise excellent shooter titles. However, CS:GO stands proud as one of the internet’s most active communities for almost a decade. You won’t need to deal with long queues or boring matches against the same people. Instead, this title focuses on every individual player’s top gaming experience every time they decide to play.

Consequently, you can exchange equipment with fellow gamers, learn new skills and hacks, improve your shooting, understand the benefits of new strategies, etc. 

Available In Free-To-Play
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’s transition into a free-to-play availability caused one of the most legendary uproars in Steam’s history. However, the move turned out to be one of Valve’s most excellent business decisions because it increased the player count dizzyingly. The best part is that the company’s battle royale – Danger Zone – is also available for free.

Accessing this mode is effortless and only requires logging into your steam account. From there, you’ll see your files automatically updating on Steam along with the new mode. Consequently, playing CS:GO and Danger Zone is an excellent way to get the most out of the game without first paying for it.

this is my honest opinion and the reasons,hope you enjoyed reading it and feel free to disagree!

5739,"I am a 54-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Apex Legends. 
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing Apex Legends. 
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. 
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son 
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam 
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
 since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Apex Legends. 
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games 
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought 
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."

5784,"The game is pretty good, but I don't like the thing that everything is pay to win... If you buy prime or get a higher rank, I think that would be awesome that you can get 1 key and 1 free case after you get a higher rank.

5821,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Possibly the most addictive, frustrating and satisfying game I've ever played. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years."

6222,"In case you're unfamiliar, Counter-Strike is an entirely multiplayer experience. You can play offline against AI bots, but these are still merely simulating what it's like to play online, rather than really giving you a single-player game. The good news is that this is as good as online team-based shooters get. In the traditional game mode, there are two types of matches and two tiers of play. Casual level is for newer players and removes aspects like friendly fire and the need to purchase armor and ancillary items each round (more on that in a second). Ranked level is the original style of CS, with all the ""realism"" settings enabled, but it also features a comprehensive skill-based ranking system to try to balance teams and place good players with other good players."

6371,"How to enable sv_cheats commands

Before we start with the commands and CVARS, you need to enable sv_cheats commands. This is pretty simple and can be done through the developer console.

You have to be the server administrator
- Open the developer console (~)
- Type: sv_cheats 1
- Sv_cheats commands are now enabled, to disable again type “sv_cheats 0” in the console."

6395,It's ok.
6396,"Hackers and smurfs, smurfs and hackers. The game already had a problem when it was $15 CAD per copy. THEN Valve made this game free to play, and now it's SO MUCH worse. A hacker's account gets banned? No problem, new steam account in 30 seconds, new copy of the game. Rinse repeat. Take a rusty SOS pad and shove it up your turd cutter (no lube) and that will be less painful than this dumpster fire of a game. Pretty sad when you need a 3rd party website to get proper anti-cheat. Fuck you Gaben."

6536,"An aged experience. Counter Strike does not care about your aim, game sense, raw skill; it only cares about how many hours of dedicated practice and gameplay you've given it. Difficult to pickup; even more difficult to master.

If you intend on playing, buy the Prime Pass, and remember to stop for the day before you get mad.

DO NOT PLAY COMPETITIVE WITHOUT THE PRIME PASS. There will be no such thing as a fair match-up and you will encounter TOO MANY HACKERS. This is a warning."

He has a biological wallhack; his godlike perception highlights all enemies within light-years. His eyes are closed as his mouse gracefully swerves across the table, making immaculate twitches as he flicks from head to head. The bullets that escape his gun barrel are surgical; each making a deadly strike in between his opponent's eyes."

6661,"Community: Not toxic. Good play enviroment. 
Gameplay: Easy to learn and pick up
Technical difficulty: If you want to become good, you need to play with friends that can teach you the mechanics, this is not an easy game to become really good at, allot of mechanics and technicality is involved. Allot more aspects to learn that you might not think about. 
Visually: The better the PC and Connection the smoother the experience

Conclution: This is one of those games you can just pick up whenever you want and spent hours enjoying it. Its free and its not a community that bans you for just learning and tying out something new."

6832,"When I first started playing csgo I was just a little boy. A little innocent child. After playing for 50 hours i could just feel the trauma come back to me again.  I got hooked to this game for a couple of days, but then my mother got sick. I had to quit so i could take care of her because she was the only person I had left in my life. Soon she seemed like she was getting better so i got to play once again, so instead of paying for her medical bills i told her to buy me a little pc. I played for a good ten hours, shitting myself in my little chair and firmly speaking any woman that dared to defy my orders in this silly little game, sometimes switching to other games to continue my work. One day, i was reversing my undies for 2 more days of use when my mother suddenly went into cardiac arrest while telling me to go to the bathroom because she could smell the unholy odor leaking from me. I obviously had to finish my competitive match before i could call anyone to come pick her up. After that I was sent to the foster care system, so i manipulated my foster parents into buying me a $3k laptop so i could game anywhere my young man heart desires. Now i get to switch from house to house collecting more for my little setup because every family refuses to keep me due to my overwhelming odor and my so called ""oppositional defiant disorder"".  I dare you to get this game. If you wish to, just

6887,"It has been a while since I have last played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. So, coming back to CS:GO, it is a game I still enjoy and like to play. I have had great experience playing it if we ignore the cheaters and the amount of toxic players but thankfully not too common to the point it is annoying. So do not worry, most of the time you will have a great match. I think the game graphics and mechanics are on a good level, no issues. Overall, game is great and the experience is good but be aware that it won't be always good as you can never get rid of cheaters from a game, one will show up at least once in a while. In the end, I would recommend this game to people and friends, quite fun."

6915,Best game to destroy your brain :)
6916,"Personally I would not recommend this game to many, but there are some people who enjoy this sort of game. For those who expect a nice fun realistic shooter this is far from it. It is heavily based on game mechanics where you ultimately have to stand still to shoot because the second you move and attempt to fire at the same time you would think you closed your eyes and sneezed at the same time while trying to shoot. For as old as the game is I give it respect for lasting so long but personally if I play a realistic game I would like the gunplay to be realistic as well and being someone who has moved and used a firearm at the same time I can say that does not happen."
6917,"CS: GO's Bomb Scenario mode is a simple, yet enjoyable, twist on the standard multiplayer FPS setup, which opens up a ton of variability in each round. Another game mode, called Hostage, flips the tables and has the Terrorists defend a hostage, while the Counter-Terrorists attempt a rescue mission. CS: GO typically gets new mission-based modes with new operations. 

Best FPS GAME NO CAP"

If you like the idea of hero shooters but without extra steps you will enjoy the direction of this game. Me personally I wish the game never took this direction.
7030,"After 100 hours I knew the basics of the game and the guns available
After 200 hours I threw away the knowledge of all guns and sprayed the P90
After 300 hours I clicked on people's heads with an SG
After 400 hours I was bad and abandoned ranked
After 500 hours I played wingman on Lake
After 600 hours I partook in an additional mild quantity of the winged male upon the realm by the Lake
After 700 hours I was silver 1 in wingman
After 800 hours I started playing on 130 ping to contain my sheer ability and flawless aim to give the rest of the community a chance
After 900 hours I have become a master of the arts in using a nova on 130 ping and the world trembles as I kill countless awptists with a swift burst of hot metal straight to the temple

7042,"I've seen Dupreeh play, he doesn't even use a monitor. He visualizes the map in a detailed rendering, completely in his mind. He has a biological wallhack; his godlike perception highlights all enemies within light-years. His eyes are closed as his mouse gracefully swerves across the table, making immaculate twitches as he flicks from head to head. The bullets that escape his gun barrel are surgical; each making a deadly strike in between his opponent's eyes."

7153,"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve.
It is extremely difficult, considering you have to wrangle teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies economy, buy the correct shit and then aim for the head and spray correctly.

Then there is a bunch of extra shit like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the fuck not.
It's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse.

There's a story that someone was so good with his mouse that he became the mouse.
The mouse permanently fused into his hand. Now he has to use his other hand for certain things.

The game has multiple maps, including dust 2 which is the only map, and Mirage. But mirage...really isn't working these days.

The game will bring you so many fun experiences, like playing a game with Aldon Hilter, as he only buys a Negev and politely refuses to buy anything else. As we lose 14-16, against 4 bots.

This game is fun: In the words of a certain person, this is fucking gameplay

You can play as the the terrorists, and blow shit up while praying to the one god, or you can play as the counter terrorists, who counter terrorists' terrorizing terrorism.

Some of the guns are: The deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, and most important and deadliest of all: the decoy grenade.

Not many people know that every decoy grenade is sent from the deepest circles of hell, where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity.

On your journey to become better at this game, you will encounter smurfs, non-bilingual Russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realize that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation, or will at least make you consider that being true.

But the worst of all: people who type ""Nice Try"", after you fail your fucking shitty clutch attempt.

There are a lot of mods for the game, like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, jailbreak and a lot of other stuff.

I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money. Every skin is different and has a different price, ranging from your generic pistol skin, to a 1600 dollar knife skin.

It's a great game, it's also perfectly fucking free: So go get it."

This destroys the game experience and your willingness to play the game. But i have to say that the realism on this game is pretty pretty good. Weapons spray is pretty close to reality and everything is based on your pretty fast reactions you need to have.

7434,"if youre looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding apple pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients: 1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Pastry for double-crust pie (9 inches)
1 tablespoon butter
1 large egg white
Additional sugar

Directions: In a small bowl, combine the sugars, flour and spices; set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat.

Line a 9-in. pie plate with bottom crust; trim pastry even with edge. Fill with apple mixture; dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of pie. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in pastry.

Beat egg white until foamy; brush over pastry. Sprinkle with sugar. Cover edges loosely with foil.
Bake at 375° for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake 20-25 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 8 servings."

7479,"I did my research and the Ninja had the best reviews so I bought one. This is my second air fryer and to be fair I had low expectations when I got my first on an xL and high expectations when I I bought this one. Objectively the Ninja has more settings and is better looking, it does not alert you half way to turn your items over (I believe shake is a marketing thing to imply it's easy to use - turn the food over you'll get better results) also you have to pause the cooking if you pull the drawer out it will not automatically turn the fan and elements off it will keep blowing. Subjectively I think my 3 quart XL cooks food better than the Ninja, I gave it a while for the Ninja to undo this mindset as a realized my bias, but I still think the XL produces better outcomes. The Ninja might cook it a little faster, maybe more unevenly, but it works and this is part of just learning your air fryer and different foods. The Ninja is a fine looking tool I won't be returning it. The differences are slight but I have brought them under a microscope. Even if they cook the same I like a timer that sounds halfway and it's annoying I have to pause the cooking before I take the drawer out. Reliability and long term use can't say I got the XL for Christmas and it took me a while to try it out but once I did I was like oh boy I need another one for the other house so I expected the Ninja to be better. If I had to do it again I'd get another XL 3qt., The cooking pot in the 4qt ninja is about the same circumference only deeper. I got it for 70 like new vs. 60 for an xL 2 quart. I thought I was getting a lot more for a little more when I could have just saved $10 and got the 2 qt XL. It's okay (it works just fine), but I just personally prefer the xL so far."

7516,"I am a 54-year-old father, probably one of the oldest people playing CS:GO. 
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing CS:GO. 
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. 
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son 
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam 
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
 since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing CS:GO. 
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games 
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought 
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."

7523,"Fun game that is even funner to play with friends. It is compatible with mac which is a big plus side for me and also it is way more optimized than most games these days so it runs decently on my trash computer. Even though you have to buy prime to play competitive its only 15 dollars, and you don't miss out on that much even if you don't buy it. Only downside for me is the skin situation in this game. Insane costs to acquire good skins in this game and even if you get prime you still aren't getting any good skins, since most of the time you get crates which cost money to open and still give you trash and when you just get skins straight up they are still bad."

7830,"Whatever Valve did recently with auto-balancing absolutely ruined the game. Besides the fact that there are dozens, if not hundreds of maps,  you are stuck playing about 20 of them. That's if you are lucky and in a decent lobby that doesn't vote the same maps over and over and over and over. Realistically, you will play Mirage, Vertigo, Cobble, and Office until your eyes bleed and you give up. There is absolutely NO REASON for this. 

Back to the auto-balancing... Seriously WTF Valve. It used to be so satisfying to absolutely dominate the other team, or even have a decent somewhat equal match. But now, EVERY SINGLE GAME WITHOUT FAIL, once one team makes it to match point, the teams are miraculously finally auto balanced and you are stuck PLAYING THE SAME SHITTY MAP FOR TWICE AS LONG. What is the logic behind making EVERY SINGLE GAME A NECK AND NECK MATCH POINT? EVERY SINGLE GAME. Your team can be ahead 7 to 1 and BOOM 7 more rounds just got added to your game our of no where. Courtesy of Valve. 

I know this game has been on the cusp of dying for a few years, especially since loot boxes took over every aspect of Valve's motivation to do anything resembling respect towards their fan-base (totally not talking about this game or Half Life, L4D, or TF2...). For years, the only thing that bumps up player count is the fan made map updates which are getting more and more rare, and offering fewer and fewer maps.

This game gets worse with every update and it is depressing. New maps are a pipe dream, playing maps you actually like is out of your control, and just when you think you are on the last round and the game is over and you can start a new map ---FINALLY A MIRACULOUS AUTO BALANCE! Have fun suddenly playing the same map for twice as long as you expected. And then once that is over, you can play the same map you just played in the previous game. 

At least most developers are upfront when they are shafting you and give you the option to unlock the content by spending more money. If you like having the vast amount of content available arbitrarily limited for NO reason with NO way to access it, this is the game for you."

8290,"Having recently hit 1K hours in the game, I feel obligated to give this game a review. With my wallet shredded into $0.03 pieces, I have to commend Valve on one of the most successful attempts to get past gambling regulations in most countries on Earth. This ponzi scheme, known as 'CS:GO', has ruined my marriage (my wife now has custody of the kids), left me homeless and spending every paycheck on crates. Some would say that it has ruined my life. Yet, I beg to differ. Although this game may have the largest amount of hackers on any game, updates dropping only when Gaben makes another billion and one-way smokes that have given me a one-way ticket to noise complaints, this game possesses something that not many games have, and it is hard to describe what that really is. All I can say however, is, if you've ever played, CSGO gives you that FPS shooter sweet-spot that every adrenaline junky craves for.

To Gabe: Pls knife Gabe, I will love you forever I will name my son Gabe.... anything for knife xxxxx"

8293,"This game is good, however do I want to kill myself when I play it, yes. Do I fear for humanity when I play this game, yes. Do I want to pour battery acid under my eye lids when I play this game, yes... however I come back every day after beating my dick and sipping red bull and crack, and proceed to play this game. No matter how many times I develop tinnitus due to Russian 11 year old with a potato microphone screaming when I team kill them, I am forced to return to this game due to the fact I have invested too much money into it and Gaben has skull fucked me with the result of my 'investment' every time with blue and grey drops from crates. All in all I hate this game and life but I am trapped by the ponzi scheme Gaben has developed after many years of studying degenerate gamblers."

It matches you with people all over the world, even though you opt to only play with players with low pings. No, just no.

8416,"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologise. What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through.
There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologise to the internet. I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologise to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologise. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."

8484,"Counter-Strike can be quite unfair towards honest players who do strive to reach higher levels. Reward system is poor in a sense that it does not give you game satisfaction and quite fast loose the interest. In my opinion game still holds to this day only because it is a longtime classic which has been here almost from the inception of gaming/esports. Due to this massive exposure of this game and years it has been around there is no choice for the players who want to actually make game better influence/provide feedback and be heard. Counter-Strike probably is that type of software which has reached it's development cycles to the point where modifying anything will just brake this fragile balance between those who are long time ""dinosaurs"" of the game and the new comers. Some of the obvious things which Valve could possibly improve and honestly should is their Anti-Cheat system, their VAC, trust factors and how their are handling bans, accidental vac bans and etc. Some part of the system are kept in secret and I it is a necessity, but certain things need to be more transparent. Other unfair point in this game is if you are skilled player and making it through quite fast 98 percent of the time you will end up a massive report abuse which will ruing your accounts trust factor and that essentially will put you into TrustFactor's Slums where all the actual cheaters, toxic personalities flourish and you will end up in a very bad in-game experience and that will either brake you or exhaust you to the point that you might never come back to this game. So if you are skilled player and looking to make a breakthrough as a player maybe pro player from zero, choose another game. If you are new to gaming and are on a lets say mid levels where your skills will not be baptised as cheating you can play this game especially if you enjoy playing just alone. If you do have a squad you constantly play with this is the easy go to game. Nevertheless, this is the all time classic and hardly anything will endanger this game as the money game valve involved with this one is just to far deep and that gives them power of choosing their resource and time allocation independently of user's feedback. If you are a new comer be aware of the world you are getting in with this game. Game is purely based on skill, execution and team work nothing more. This is not the game you want to just sit in and chill, it is its own type of pleasure and you have to understand that it is not good GFX or Good story. All about pure grinding nothing else. For the games purpose what it was made for I will give it 5 out of 5, in terms of in game experience I will give it 2 out 5. In overall i will give the game 3.5 out of 5 as a general score. However I do recommend to play this game, just try it is still on point and fun and engaging on a personal level."

8512,"I started to play this game during COVID. It was good replacement for things I could not do outside. Yet, the game is crazy. You need to know maps, know guns, recoils, smokes, flashes grenades to compete with others who know this. But the real value for me was still the cooperation and social contact with others.

Furthermore, I play on Linux. It works great but it seems that I meet cheaters more often than others. I'm afraid that simply the fact I play on Linux affects my trust negatively. And if there is something really painful about this game - it's the cheaters. They ruin the game for everyone."

They changed the maps into boring streamlined s*** to make CS more like the other kid games out there. The only thing good about this is the community servers."

8615,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Possibly the most addictive, frustrating and satisfying game I've ever played. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years."

8921,"Hardly anything in “Counter-Strike: Global  Offensive” will surprise you, except how well it does nearly all the things audiences want and expect it to do. 

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.

The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, ""Danger Zone"", was introduced in December 2018.

Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series, though it was criticized for some early features and the differences between the console and PC versions. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month and remains one of the most played games on Valve's Steam platform. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.

The game has an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous games in the series. Teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments, and Global Offensive is now one of the largest global esports. It has been awarded ""Best eSports Game"" at The Game Awards 2017, The Game Awards 2019 and The Game Awards 2020 shows."

8960,"I'm going to be completely honest here, so hear me out. :-)

If you want to be depressed, lose your money, and lose your braincells. This game is recommendable!
9/10 you queue with russians, but in no time you will learn the language eventually so that is not a problem anymore.

This anticheat sucks, but yeah u get used to it and stop complaining after a while so.

When you play it, you get more and more depressed everyday, and play it more because you still want to rankup, because you think that in the higher ranks there are better teammates. But I can tell you, that is a lie. What I experience is in the higher ranks your teammates get more and more braindead, maybe the same reason as I, because of all the russians. 

But if you have turkish people on your team, your game is going to be awesome. Nothing is better then 2 turkish people trying to play the game honestly! :D

But yeah, here was my review. no positive feedback but you still need to play the game. xx"

8975,"I played a lot more in my old Steam account, which was like 67 hours so I have some experience. CS:GO has a good server, as it does not take 13 minutes to launch a game. This game is free so it is basically the starting game for most steam users and is still very popular to this day. It has outdated game mechanics which only make the game more slower/competitive. It has many maps and game modes, but most players just play on DUST II and on Casual. Movement in this game is pretty slow as you cannot run so do not expect COD levels of gameplay, although it does make gameplay more slower = intense. I play on Asia server and its pretty toxic there (I do not know about other servers). My brother played this game for a long time, and he's still kind of shit at it, so..........getting good might take a decade or so. I kind of have a love and hate relationship with this game. Its somewhat frustrating and you'll mostly go your microphones blazing arguing with the other team, or you'll just enjoy it for some reason, like me. And that's all there is about this game. (you can also get steam keys from this game, which you can sell or do something with it to earn steam points)"

9009,"Transformers Dark of the Moon: My favorite one because it has some of the best action sequences in the entire Franchise. The plot was actually decent had a few emotional tugs. Badass Decepticon Shockwave was here although his death was a bit anti-climatic. This was also Shia's last movie and it pretty much has a lot of what the original had and what made it so good. The only reason I put this one above Transformers 1 is because of the action! I watch these movies for entertainment and action and not as a movie critic. It's like watching Asian fighting movies without caring how bad the plot is or how bad the actors are, you're there for the fight scenes, no matter how bad the rest of the movie may be.

Transformers 1: The OG! I think all the following Transformer movies except for part 3, should have followed the template set out by this movie. It did EVERYTHING right from the action sequences to the good, but simple plot. The comedy jokes were timed well and so were the emotional set pieces. Megatron gave Prime a good fight and the final city battle is probably my favorite action sequence of the entire franchise.

Transformers: Age of Extinction: I know I know, a lot of people consider this one to be the worst or one of the worst, but I actually enjoyed it. Lockdown was such a cool transformer. Although he was a bit overpowered, he is my favorite villain behind Megatron. Everything from his alternate form to his overpowered grenades to his insane face cannon. Heck I even love his voice actor because I knew him from other movies and that made me like Lockdown all the more. Marky Mark wasn't so bad surprisingly, he was actually tolerable. I just wished they would have found a reason to make Lockdown and Megatron/Galvatron fight because that would have been an epic fight!

Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen: Even though it's second to last on my list, I didn't really hate it like sooo many people did or do. The action sequences were okay and could have been better, the best one taking place in the forest. I love fights and good action sequences, so I set a high bar when it comes to them. One thing that turns me off is a Mary Sue in these regards. Megatron gave Optimus a good fight in first movie, but here he jsut gets WRECKED. HE barely puts up a fight and I was really hoping for more. I knew Optimus would win of course, but come on! They could have made that battle a bit better.

Transformers: The Last Knight: Okay this is one is definitely the worst one and a lot of people agree with that. I'm usually very forgiving and not too harsh considering the fact the some of the movies people hated, I actually really liked. I disregard plot and only focus on entertainment and it has served me well in watching films like this, but this was just an abomination. I really tried to get into it and give it a chance, but it was just not so. The overly complicated plot goes against some of the stuff from previous films and then having Stanley Tucci play Merlin was just a WTF moment. It's like the movie knew it would suck and didn't care. Optimus turning bad could have been used for soo much more. He appears near the end when I was hoping he would make a few appearences causing trouble for the good guys, but alas another anti climatic moment strikes again! The action sequences were kind of whack and easily the worst of the series IMO. The best one was probably Bumblebee fighting Optimus. Quintessa was nothing special and the KSI Megatron body is magically gone. I wanted to see his KSI chassis in action because I actually liked how it performed in AOE, but Megatron just looked like himself without explaining what happened to that body. Like I said, I really tried to find a reason to like this movie, but it was just that bad"

9127,hello guys belcome to my striming channel !
9128,"Chcesz wynająć detektywa, ponieważ ktoś r*ucha Ci matkę, lecz nie wiesz kto?
Marzą Ci się studia na filologii rosyjskiej, lecz nie stać Cię na dobrego korepetytora?
Szukasz świetnej inwestycji, która sprawi, że zostaniesz bankrutem i nie będzie Cię stać na chleb ?

Ta gra jest odpowiedzią na wszystkie Twoje pytania !

Co możesz stracić grając w CS-GO?
Stracisz pieniądze, partnera życiowego i całą rodzinę. Nawet Twój pies czy inne zwierzę będzie miało dość Twoich wrzasków oczywiście usprawiedliwiających Twój wielki wk*rw na tę grę i postanowi się wyprowadzić. Zostaniesz sam. Dzięki doskonałym cziterom, którzy zrobią Ci takie full auto z AWP-y, że zginiesz 16 razy zanim wejdziesz do gry, a jeśli uda Ci się dołączyć to dostaniesz strzała między oczy z odległości 100 kilometrów niczym grom z jasnego ♥♥♥♥♥, popadniesz w stany depresyjno-lękowe. W gratisie nadciśnienie tętnicze + leki na uspokojenie z grupy benzodiazepin. Niestety, ale leki kupi Ci sąsiadka, bo ostatnie pieniądze przewalisz na skiny. Ciągle będziesz słyszeć od dzieciaków z Rosji, że posuwają Ci matkę, ale za to świetnie doszkolisz się w języku Rosyjskim.

Jak już napisałam co możesz stracić to teraz:
Co możesz zyskać grając w CS-GO?
Język rosyjski opanowany do perfekcji.

Czy polecam grę?
Jeżeli czujesz, że w życiu Ci się nie powodzi, masz same problemy, a nawet życie staje się problemem to tak, ta gra jest dla Ciebie."

9137,"As per my opinion, the best game available on Steam rn. The only problem being the VAC needs to be wayyy advanced since there are tons of cheaters. But CSGO is the best game to better your reflexes for other games. Play fairly and you will be rewarded in-game. Getting prime status upgrade in my opinion gets you better rewards and the competitive matchmaking is a bit more fair. Enjoy the game."

The game is simple enough defend bomb site on CT and attack bomb site on T, you will consistently use only the m4 and USP silenced or unsilensed on CT and you will use the Ak-47 and GLOCK on T. Both sides can use the WAP I mean AWP which is a one shot sniper. Obviously you can use other weapons but if you are really trying to get good at this game fast learn these weapons like the back of your hand. This game pretty much has no skill ceiling as you can always improve.

9403,this game is so fucking stupid the amount of sanity cost per game is actually dumb. ranking up in this game is actually knee cancer you can win 1425 games in a row and stay in low silver and then the one loss will bring you to silver 3 not to mention if you want to hit a headshot you want to stop moving place the crosshair on the head of the enemy not move for 15 seconds dont even move the mouse just wait there talk with friends on phone watch some youtube anomaly vids then come back click on the mouse and still miss. in my opinion you should install this game cause its super fun and very relaxing and the anti cheat is just fabulous

9543,"This game is eternal. Playing it on/off for 17 years.
Community can be a bit toxic, get some friends and play. =]"
9544,Great game to calm down your nerves. The only downside is playing in Lower Trust factor when you haven't actually used cheats. 99% of time there would be at least 1 player that's using cheats. Faceit on the other hand is the best experience with 128 tick servers and more smoother gameplay. I would give this game a go if I was switching from Call of Duty scene or any game that has a different mechanics than this one. It is quite easy to get good at and with a proper training and routine you can climb to Global elite fast. I enjoy playing it with friends and even when I'm playing this game on my own it's still fun. I just wish I could somehow get rid of Red Trust. Maybe one day.

1. You are a masochist
2. You want sweat running down your cheeks
3. You want to be called slurs
4. You love to see tilted teammates

Why you shouldn't play CSGO:
1. You could spend that time touching grass
2. You could save your brain cells from dying due to all sorts of emotions
3. 50% of time = no mic
4. Private profile/anime pfp/no skin = cheat
5. Random 150+ ping teammates w/ no English
6. Possibility of aneurysm

9647,"Yes, Good old Counter Strike. After 10 years, the game is still the one of the best in the genre. 
The only problem is that Valve is too lazy to develop a powerful anti-cheat for the game. Tooooooo many cheaters in matchmaking. Matchmaking is somewhat broken too, I as an SEM get matched with GN4 and above.
Reporting cheaters does no good too.
Its really sad when your game experience is ruined by cheaters and (really)high level players.
Overall the game is one of the best in my opinion. Just fix your stupid anti-cheat.
As for Faceit, i simply cant run it (Potato pc).

9654,"One of the best FPS games in the world. It is fun, competitive and sometimes stressful (bad teammates or cheaters). Sometimes I feel glad I am still playing the game, sometimes I question myself why do I keep playing this game plagued with cheaters. Basically, the game is fun but when you come across a cheater or troll/griefer/toxic people, it becomes a nightmare you wanna get the heck out of real FAST. 

For new players out there don't jump into comp right away, try all the modes, watch youtube videos, watch past PRO league tournaments, watch some popular/high rank twitch streamers, learn the maps, the callouts, the jargons, the line ups, common angles, and just have fun. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It is what it is. I highly recommend the short competitive mode when you are finally ready to do some Competitive matches. Good luck, have fun!"

9674,"Valve! I just wanted to tell you one thing, I really liked your videogame, seriously, it's the most sensational thing I've played at the moment, it's a work of art, without exaggeration, it's something that, at first glance, could have been made by Da Vinci himself, his genius can be seen from miles away, not even the worst of gossips could say that we are not facing a majesty seen only once every thousand years. I have not seen in all my years of life something of this magnitude, it gives you an indescribable sensation, an immense joy despite not having done any action, a rare but fantastic feeling, something like what a breeze feels like in a hot summer, or seeing the joy of a child when opening their Christmas presents, or simply being with that person we love so much. Do not pay attention to the gossips that criticize incessantly anyone who does not fully meet all their expectations, just believe me and all those beings who consider and admire such a great work of art. There will always be people who will tell you that what you did has no value, but the secret is to ignore them, those people would give anything to have created something as magnificent as what we are seeing. Just as God in his infinite wisdom created humanity, or as a man in love creates a poem to express his deepest feelings, or as a painter creates a work of art from a time that even he does not know, this is how it was created this videogame in the same way. It may seem that I am exaggerating, I repeat, but it is not like that, not even close, I would exaggerate if I said that I am not facing an admirable, incredible creation, of a beauty of biblical proportions. In fact I am so delighted with such a contribution that I decided to write a poem about it, it is titled ""my eyes thank you"", here it goes: ""My eyes thank you, since they have been caressed, and my feelings praise you, since have been awakened, my heart idolizes you, because you have made it dance, and my being tells you thanks for such a delicious delicacy, I will be waiting again, that you share your joy, even in the middle of the night, or on the most radiant day, just keep creating creating until your hands are heavy, so I'll tell you again, my eyes thank you."" I hope you enjoyed my poem as much as I enjoyed writing it, I would tell you to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed your videogame, but I don't think there is a situation in the world that resembles such joy. To finish being brief, I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart, one in this life encounters situations that make him feel bad, he thinks that he is not going to find anything good these days and suddenly he finds himself with something like that, it is difficult to decide where one he is going to leave a positive review, and in fact he is already tired of reporting most of the troll reviews that he sees, since many are created by trolls and people with the desire to annoy, nothing to do with what we are observing, here one thinks quite the opposite , he simply sees it and says to himself ""there must be no place on this earth, neither in heaven nor in the underworld, nor in other planets, galaxies or universes, where it is better to leave my points, I have found the true Atlantis, Although it is not a physical place, its simple beauty is enough for me not to hesitate to make such a comparison."" Sometimes I wonder how much skill or how much skill it takes to be able to make a creation of this nature, sometimes I compare myself with the creators of beauties like this and I think that I am not even a simple human being, next to said creators I I feel like an ant in front of an impotent elephant, like a pawn next to a queen, like a child in front of a super hero from those comics that they like to read so much. sometimes i look up to the sky and ask ""will i be able to create something that can at least compare to this videogame?"" ""Can I one day be as cool, as creative and talented as the creator of this?"" ""What does one have to do in this life to achieve such genius?"" but no matter how much I ask and ask, I never get an answer. Sometimes I dream that I wake up and in front of me, next to my bed, there is a video like this, but in my dream the video has something different, the creator is me. Yes, I know it sounds crazy, something as glorious as this cannot be created by a simple being like me, but do not forget that it is only a dream. If I could make a wish, it would be that this videogame never leaves Steam, that future generations can observe its magnificence and be filled with joy with what they see. be filled with happiness, madness, passion... If all the videos in the world were like this, there would be no wars, no pain, forgetfulness, sadness. We would raise our heads and sing a song in unison, like a choir of archangels we would say: ""I believe in tomorrow""..."

You enjoy some clean games on Anubis, click heads with drip, watch players doing some calls and use utility correctly. And this is what makes you think its still worth going into another game.

9812,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

10032,"Counter Strike is not only one of the biggest competitive games in CSGO history but it has maintained that stature for 10 years now.

Counter Strike gives the gaming industry a competitive edge that most games cannot compare to and is one of those games where you look at the time and wonder where the time went.

Pros:
-Addicting
-Visually very appealing/Maps have amazing detail and are only getting better.
-Consistently changing the map rotation.
-Rewarding for practice and skill.
-Rank Progression is now Amazing.
-Weapon Skins and Cases constantly coming into light from the community workshop.
-Developers that actually listen.
-Tactical and Teamwork driven.
-Different game modes within the game that caters to all kinds of players.
-Community Server Browser that allows you to explore more of Counter-Strike and what it has to offer.
-Workshop maps that are created by the community
-An Anti-Cheat that actually works.
-Allows players that have reached a certain level to watch reported users that have been reported for hacking to allow the community to help stop any hackers that come into light.

Cons:
-Still on Source 1 which will hopefully change soon.
-Have not released a new operation in a while and didnt for a long period of time a few years ago.
-Toxic Players at times. (But this is for most games.)

Counter-Strike Global Offensive is one of the best games that I have played through my lifetime. On this account I have 340 hours right now, but across all of my accounts I have over 2,000 hours. I can easily say that this is my favorite game of all time.

There is a lot of flamers and toxic players, but this is factor that everygame must accept if u want to play. But CSGO even when there is more toxic than normal players is very nice game, good concept and great maps. I recomend this game if u are mentaly strong :_) ."

10349,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Possibly the most addictive, frustrating and satisfying game I've ever played. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

Counter-Strike... the game that leaves you wondering where your bullet landed. The game where you can shit talk others like the good ole days or offend a grown man. There's nothing else that can even come close to the experience of this game. 

Make sure to buy PRIME, or else you will be playing with people from the villages of eastern Africa."

I have never been kicked from any game (including CS) previously, but now that got back to this after a years break....and got kicked from the server in the first game. Could the russians be isolated also in CS? Why should we let them continue playing shooters (or any game) in Steam, while they kill people in real life in Ukraine? At least separate them into another server and let us play fair here in Europe"

Yes people cheat in this game but will be VAC or get a game ban. Report people who are bullies and rude using foul language. they will be muted. Over all this game is fun and can be difficult at times. make sure you have a good video card. FPS counts in this game. If you lagging in the game reboot your modem and see if that helps or tell your family to get off the internet. that is all

Disadvantages:

10624,"I just wanna start saying this game is AWESOME.
Even though most people are already very skilled at this game u still have a chance of getting good too.
First of all there is no skill based matchmaking (unless u have prime (which is like 15 dollars) ) .
So probably in your first match you will be probably fighting some weird grown man who watches hentai in his moms basement and is about 115 kg who will no scope with his awp from 100 meters, and thats because he has 10000 hours in the game. But dont quit! get a smg and go spam every one, raise hell ! 

There are lots of different mods to play going from the classic casual dust 2 other bomb defusal maps and hostage rescueing . Or if you are more expirienced u can play competitive. but i dont recommand it if you dont to cry in your pillow at 3 am. but there is also wingman a very fun 2 v 2 gamemode u either play on T 
or CT but u cant choose. its a normal defusal game but with a shorter map and only 4 persons.
And altough Cs Go its a free game there a lot of gambling sites from u can buy crates that give in game cosmetics. which i dont recommand cuz u could pay 100 dollars for some gloves and 2 weapon skins (so dont buy them !). Summing it all up cs go is very fun especially when playing with friends.

You are a retard. I hate you. I hate the fact you exist. You are scum. You are an absolute fucking douchebag. You are a lowlife piece of human garbage. You absolute fucking retard cunt. You are a waste of a human being. You've done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that's important. You dumb cunt, you piece of shit. You're not even a son of a bitch, that's too dignified a term for what you are. You know, you're not even human. You don't deserve the word human because you are that much of a fucking disgrace to people all around the globe, worldwide. It's a dishonor to put you in the same sentence with that word, you asshole. Are you fucking proud of yourself? Are you proud of having accomplished absolutely nothing in your life? You have only done bad things in this world. You do not deserve to live, you shit. You are a terrible excuse for a human being. You are an ABSOLUTE cunt. You are nothing but a faggot brainlet. You sleazy two-faced bastard. You slimy sluggish asshole. You TRIFLING motherfucker."

10808,"ahhhhh what to say about this game. 8000 hours and i still continue to learn new things. It's not just my past time, its my hobby, its a part of me, since i was an awkward high school nerd who just saved enough to build his own PC just to run CSGO, and then to play it religiously every winter to beat the blues. To helping me get over my ex's, to creating new friends and being part of communities and having a good time. From 1.6 to GO and maybe source 2 ? idk if thats a thing... Didnt wanna make the switch to valorant cuz they just complicated a simple formula. 

Im 28 as of this review and I don't know when im going to stop playing this game. Heck, i dont even know if i will ever stop.
Cheers to all the CSGO fans and to all the ppl that recognize the effect this game has had on our life."

The game itself has a steep learning curve and this is combined with the near constant frustrations of hackers, network issues (I reset my router at least once whenever I play this game specifically), and a generally awful community."

10882,"You have to know that this is my opinion for the game, so first try it and then if you don't like it, you can stop playing it.

The game is fun for atleast 5 reasons.
    1.You are able to get some drops and sell them in the market ( only if you have prime ).
    2.You can play with to 20 friends ( 10v10 )
    3.If you like battle royale games you have mod ( Danger zone for duo or SoloDuo gameplay )
    4.If you are ranked player, it has good ranked system.
    5.if you are not like the ranked players you can go to the community servers.

You need to know about FRIENDLY communication whit others some basic things like:
    GG / gg - Good game
    GH / gh - Good half

You will see and toxic communication like:
    Aggressive or abusive words 
    Ez / noob / trash and more- means that you are bad at the game ( ignore that one that talks like that to you and if you want report him )
    Tea-bagging- part of the trash-talking but if they cannot communicate with you

I Hope this review it was useful for everyone!"

Please do not let anyone you know play this game unless you want them to end their lives. Unless you like being screamed at by kids or russians this game is not meant for you. If i ever play this game again i think i will harm myself in ways that i don't want to imagine. Would not recommend.

11372,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is! (:  :)"

11443,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game"

11772,I have put over 2000$ into this game even though it is free. From the gambling addiction generated by this game I have gotten very little as you can see by my inventory. But I feel that I will be able to get that long awaited knife very soon. I just know that my next case will be the one. And so I suggest this game to anyone. This game is better than any slots or poker games on this platform. Even the thought of one day getting that wonderful golden square in my case keeps haunting my dreams. The fps aspect of the game is cool I guess but that's not what you come here for.
11773,Best FPS of all time.

Toxic russians screaming cy*a bly*t and an addictive experience which will make you willingly pour ALL your wallet into skins and cases without second thought. 

Behind all the chaos of no-scoping and an intense sweat filled fight to the death between CT's and T's , is a bustling market place where you can buy sell and trade in game items in return for more items or money in your steam wallet.

I genuinely recommend CSGO to all the steam community to enjoy.

Thank you Valve for making this legend of a game."

12558,"It has become impossible to play on the European server. Every time i go play this game is all Russians, Even though is an European server they'll NOT communicate in English. Of course I do understand some of the player don't know English, but 4 players? The communication on this game is extremely important, but they wont even bother to give the calls, and if they're losing 100% they'll blame on you. Sorry for the Russians over there that are actually nice players and make you feel part of the team, I think I met 1 or 2 of these nice guys. Played this game all my life but yesterday was the last time. Doesn't make more sense for me to get in a game to have fun and always have to play with a bunch of toxic people.

12675,"This is my 1st review. The choice was easy, It had to be Counter-Strike. As a gamer of 25+ years I'd say that everyone should try this game at least once. You have to. Especially now that is offered for free. The game is VERY satisfying.
Offers different modes, and if you can (and feel like it) you can spend on customization too. Simple as that.
The entire series since the the game was a mod of Half-Life back in 1998 have been very entertaining and I got to witnessed this playing all over the globe. From small internet cafe's to large internet clubs with 200+ PCs and an entire city competing through the servers. If you stick to the official servers - obviously - you will won't see any hacks and such.
At the end of the day, never forget this. It is just a game, to entertain your time. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose, and most importantly, try to not get anything seriously."
12676,Best game in thew World!!!
12677,"got called a slur due to my teammate dying, even tho i was dead.
got kicked from a comp match due to a guy saying i support womens rights.
was told to kill myself and ""eat shit"" multiple times.
met really sweaty players with russian letters in their name.
pretty sus people who hit every shot, but they just might be good.

12922,"It's a great game. players are sometimes rude but you can just turn the sound off. to get cool skins for your guns i think the best way is to buy prime or just buy crates themselves. the people in voice chat are weird. one time i was playing during a literal THERAPY SESSION. to actually be able to rank up or level up in this game you have to first buy prime and them play some games. there is absolutely no PAY TO WIN and if you do spend money on this game, its mostly going to be for customisation and skins. during the first hour or so you might struggle even to get a single kill but after you start to get familiar with the aiming and controls, you can beat the daylights out of the opponent team. this game is also focused on the gamemode Defuse which not everyone will enjoy but because of the no respawn it feels more like a team deathmatch. csgo is really a sit down for 2 hours and grind game because if you have a close match it could take up to 30 mins to finish and if you're planning to play multiple then you'll be sitting there for a couple hours. like valorant, there is no aming to guns other than an assult rifle and sniper so you have to crouch to aim better. also like valorant, there is a money system and at the start of every round you buy guns and grenades.

short version: rude players, pay to customise, people in voice chat are weird, pay to be able to rank up, first hour or so is hard, no pay to win, Defuse, long matches, not many scoped guns, money system.

in my opinion csgo is a great game but it might not be for everyone so i hope this review helps you decide if you want to play it or not."

13034,"Your experience heavily relies on the people you're put on a team with. Half of the time there are zero comms or toxic people. The occasional matches with cool people can be hard to come by.

They've added a ridiculous amount of micro-transactions into the game overtime. The player skins released in the past few years look really fucking dumb and cartoon'ish. I think they're forgetting that this game isn't Fortnite or Valorant and their player-base consists predominantly of adults in their late 20s and 30s."

13163,"Still the best competitive FPS to date.
If you love high skill required games this game is for you.

Pros:
* Every gun has a set spray pattern
* Everything you do from throwing grenades, movement and position is required to master if you want to reach the top.
* Lots of community servers b-hop, surf, prop hunt etc
* Got all the game modes you could wish for.
* huge player base
* One of the best anti cheats, that does not require you to put chinese spyware on your computer.
* Marketplace for skins
* Higher skill curve than valorant in almost everyway and more community based.

Cons:
* No 128 tick server in matchmaking yet, This forces you to play on community based platforms and servers like FACEIT.
* Some cheaters if your trust factor is bad and you do not have prime.

13267,"It's got nice mechanics and maps but overall the competitive side of it is just too toxic, full of smurfs everywhere and cheaters as well, ranking up is impossible unless you literally play everyday.
Only upside are community servers and workshop maps"
13268,HORRIBLE GAME
13269,"One of the best if not the best tactical competitive FPS games out there.
CS is as old as half-life and it's mechanics & formulas have been battle-tested over & over.
Still, there are a lot of stuff that I personally wish were different.

Ideas for a better game:

1- Randomized maps
memorizing maps & particular positions & strats in them plays a huge part in this game.
in an ideal world, each map should be semi-randomly generated so that grinders who've played each map a million times & memorized shooting & nade-throwing spots would have less of an edge.

2- randomized spray patterns
thou shall not reward grinding

2- more dynamic surroundings, semi-open world
at this day and age, traditional cs maps induce claustrophobia. manipulation of environment, bringing down walls, setting traps, throwing stuff, ... could be a breath of fresh air if the game engine supports it.

3- crypto-economy, tokens, assets, ... secured on an open system for incentivizing content-creation by users could take development a long way. Imagine being paid actual valuable tokens exchangeable for items & ... after each win instead of non-sensical experience points & badges."

13344,"I would recommend this game for sure, but your Matchmaking system is trash. 
Matches still starts when a player leaves beforehand and the team has to suffer a 4v5, losing even ranks causing this. And furthermore, way to many toxic players. 
And common, still 64 tick servers? We are not in the 90's anymore... use faceit instead."

 Після останнього оновлення змінили систему рангів, і мені довелося розпрощатися зі своїм званням.

13436,"BEST TRYHARD FPS EVER, if you don't know CSGO the must have FPS then I recommend it but only if you buy the PRIME. Without the premium you'll run the risk of getting cheaters or smurfs 80% of the time and that's a waste of time.

And I also recommend CSGO if you want to learn Russian, the basic vocabulary to know before starting a ranked because COMMUNICATION in ranked is important :
- Blyat
- Pa-shol na-rooy
- Ty cyka
- Ty balshoy doo-rak
- Piz-dets
- Dav-Noh
- Ga-lou-boy
- Zat-Knis
This is a gift for you."

13455,This game has stayed true to the FPS formula and continues to live on as one of the best shooters of all time. I have played this game for 8ish years now and still grind ranked. If you're looking for a game with an infinite skill ceiling and reliable game play this is it.
13456,dont give in
13457,"After over 10 years of CS:GO and being deranked from Double AK to SIlver Elite back during ""The Incident"", suffice to say I'm a bit fed up with this game. Haven't played too regularly in years, but recently decided to play a little more after my friends told me their ranks got boosted back up seemingly out of nowhere. Well, after being second to the top of the board in a GN4 match, the game places me Silver 3. Nice meme, Valve."

You will find out who your father, mother, sister and brother are, they will even help you with your place of residence - they will settle you in a ditch or in the trash. To your team, you constantly come across podpivas from the factory, who can no longer really talk because of the foam they have drunk, but only resent and do not make an impact in the game, but your opponents, on the contrary, will be cyber athletes with 10 lvl of faceit, whose every game is like the last in life.

This game has changed so much and so little at the same time and that's not a bad thing. Growing with the community as a person and watching the game develop, it's a rare thing to be a part of. I love this game, even if I am not the best, not even close. It's defined pc gaming with tight and precise controls. Over the top tactics and an incredibly steep skill curve. I can see myself well into the future being in the mood for some CSGO matches. I hope we both make it there. <3"

13581,very good game
13582,"The game itself is great, but the moderation is piss poor and despite it having an anti-cheat system, they encourage hackers to create new accounts and ban evade.  The active community is full of hackers and trolls that don't take the game seriously and team kill you in comp, which is discouraging for those that actually want to enjoy the game.  The developers actions chase away players."

13690,overrated but i like it
13691,"This game was a bik of sticky one styll. The game was difficult and dont get it twisted it wasnt a skill issue, i was clarting cheeks left right and centre, the issue was my team. beginning in gold nova you have a 90% chance that your team is russian and share 3 braincells between the four of them. you may think that once you get to a higher rank your teammates get better, let me reassure you this was not the case. Even in Supreme Master you will encounter dogshit teammates that are rocking the T crosshair and ten toes down A long on dust 2 with smgs against awps. After getting around 1,700 hours on this game between all my accounts i have been diagnosed with aids and have developed a hostility to russians.

Overall this game will teach you russian swear words faster than duolingo."
13692,great game honestly best fps shooter game in my opinion for weak or strong pc's :) <3

13694,"I am a 53 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing CSGO. 
I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started playing Apex Legends. 
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. 
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son 
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam 
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
 since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing CSGO. 
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games 
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought 
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.
I am also now getting in playing ranked and its so much fun :)"
13695,"It's a decent games, but it has on slight issue, there quite a lot of cheaters and that can be annoying at times and one more thing is that since the prime update you can't really do much unless you have the prime status enabled..."

13720,"the ranking system is horrible, the amount of cheaters and smurfs is insane, the russians think they are the only nation that plays this game(classic ""ruskiy yest??""), there are many people playing this game just to troll teammates and when someone gets mad say ""CHILL OUT"", stupid enemies thinking that you are cheater just because you are finally playing good match and reporting you what makes you lose trust factor and meet real smurfs in matches. 
But when you finally find normal match this game gives so much fun"

13862,I HATE THIS GAME
13863,"it's CSGO. what more do you want
"
13864,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve. It's extremely difficult considering you have to wrangle teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies' economy, buy the correct sh*t then aim for the head and spray correctly. And there's a bunch of extra sh*t like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the f*ck not. It's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse. There's a history that someone was so good with his mouse he became the mouse, the mouse permanently fused into his hand. Now he has to use his other hands for certains things. This game has multiple maps, including Dust II, wich is the only map, and Mirage, but Mirage really isn't working these days. This game will bring you so many fun experiences like playing a game with Aldon Hilter, as he only buys a Negev and unpolitely refuses to buy anything else. As we lose 14-16 against four bots. This game is fun. In the words of a certain person, this is f*cking gameplay. You can play as the terrorists and blow sh*t up while praising the one God or you can play as the Counter terrorists, who counter the terrorists' terrorizing terrorism. Some of the guns are the Desert Eagle, the Ak-47, the AWP and the most important and deadliest of all, the decoy grenade. On your journey to become better on this game you'll encounter smurfs, non bilingual russians, toxicity, mute people, people that'll make you realize that CSGO causes metaphysical retardation, or at least will make you consider that being true, but the worst of all, people who type ""NT"" after you f*cking fail your sh*tty clutch attempt."

13915,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

14027,"CSGO ,this game has changed my life. My whole outlook on everything that exists in this world, in fact even in the entire universe. I can never look at anything I know the same way ever again. This game represents emotions most humans could never comprehend. But I can. Thanks to this game I have been awakened to many things previously thought unimaginable. Thank you for this exquisite video game, i will never forget this experience."

14060,"Highlight of my CSGO time was definitely when I found a different game to play instead. You might be wondering why this is a positive review... Well it was a fun game for a while..... Till they nerfed my favorite negev wallbang spot on Train.... Game is still playable if you dont have a ball mouse.

If you enjoy shooters, then you should try Realm Royale. It's basically CSGO, PUBG, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Pacman, and Stick Arena Ballistic combined. The best part about it is the turn-based shooter aspect... (If you know you know).

I will try this game again when I learn to use one of those new fangled mouses without balls."

14079,"CS:GO is one of those games where it seems fun and looks fun. And that is true it's a great game with lots to do. One bad thing is though the amount of lag you get at times. If one player is lagging so will everyone else. Also, there are a lot of players who are sweats who hate fun and will call you racial slurs and a hacker if you kill them. Lastly, don't waste your money on this game. If you do want to get weapon skins buy the ones you want. Don't buy crates their not worth the $2.50 to open each one."

14333,"Counter-Strike:Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve, it is extemely difficult considering you have to wrangle your teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies' economy, buy the correct sh*t then aim for the head and spray correctly; then there is a bunch of extra sh*t like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the fu*k not; it's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse, there is a story that someone was so good with his mouse, he bacame the mouse, the mouse permanently fused into his hand, now he has to use his other hand for certain things; the game has multiple maps including Dust 2, which is the only map, and Mirage but Mirage just really isn't working these days; the game will bring you many fun experiences like playing with Aldon Hilter as he only buys a Negev and unpolitely refuses to buy anything else as we lose 14-16 against 4 bots; this game is fun in the words of a certain person this is fu*king gameplay: you can play as the terrorists and blow sh*it up while praising the one god or you can play as the counter terrorists who counter the terrorists terrorizing terrorism; some of the guns are: the Deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, but the most important and deadliest of all is the decoy grenade, not many people know that every Decoy grenade is sent from the deepes circle of hell where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity; on your journey to become better at this game you will encounter smurfs, non-billingual russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realise that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation or at least will make you conider that being true, but the worst of all the people who type ""Nice Try"" after you fu*king fail your shi*ty clutch attempt; there are a lot of mods for the game like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, Jailbreak, and a lot of other stuff; I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money, every skin is different and has a different price ranging your generic pistol skin to a 1600$ knife skin; it's a great game, it's also perfectly fu*king free, so go get it."

You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel directly out the window. The poop accelerates. One of the workers falls over and can't free himself. The poop accelerates. The force now propels you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event hits 5 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. You try to close up shop but your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You are now tracked on radar. You try to change your angle of ascent but you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet.

14401,"The game is good really good, bu only if you have 4 friends to play with, or you don't have Prime and don't care about the ranks.
If you do care about ranks, and you do it alone then you will have a really hard time. Before the Matchmaking update I was Silver 4, currently I am unranked (haven't played since). The time it took me to get to S4 solo queue is about 220 hours, and even though I am bad I think that I am not this bad. Getting to Global or FaceIt lvl. 10 would take even longer, so I only recommend CS to players who could make a 4 or 5 stack or to those with a lot of time. 
Have fun getting to Global Elite :)"

To win a round as a ""terrorist"" you have to either eliminate all players from the opposing side or plant the bomb and wait until it goes off. The bomb takes a while until it goes off so you have to protect it from the players of the other side because they can defuse it and win the round. As a ""counter terrorist"" your mission is to either defuse the bomb, eliminate all threats without the bomb being placed, or wait until the time runs off."

14709,Filled with preamde teams of russians that kick you at the end of the game. Trust factor might as well not exist since you are reported every time you speak english. Basic gameplay is impossible when you try to save you get kicked when you suggest a tactic=kick I got actually kicked just for existing once so yeah. There is no way to play this game solo. You are held hostage by fucking russians every game. But why fix the game when you can let fucking war supporters play your fucking game for free.

14745,"This game sucks, you rage, you get pissed, you get confused and dazed by the fact that some guy snipes you from across the map. Spray patterns? useless af AK = Aim floor = Magical headshot, M4 = Legs = magical headshot. In my opinion i have the most fun with shotguns and smgs (i'm not bad at the game smh), some weapons (*cough* awp *cough*) are incredibly broken. Auto sniper? yeah it may be the 2nd best gun in the game but only losers play Auto snipers, real chads (like myself) use Mag7 for everything, Sniping? Mag 7. Camping? Mag 7.  ( for t side, don't even bother with the Sawed off) this game, i've been playing it just shy of 3 years, why did i say it's shit? because i'm angry at it. all in all 10/10 would rush b again."

i think that this game worth the price, the only downside of this game is that you can encounter a lot of cheaters if you don't buy the prime version, but the game developers are trying there best to remove cheaters using advanced anti-cheating systems. 
its on of the best FPS games that you can absolutely enjoy to play with your friends.
i strongly recommend this game for FPS games players.

15092,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification (""mod"") for Half-Life that was designed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le and Jess ""Cliffe"" Cliffe before the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product released in 2000. Counter Strike: Global Offensive may just be the finest game of our generation, with balanced weapons, exiting gameplay in which both teams may attack and defend, allowing non-boring gameplay. CS:GO is unique with features such as spray patterns, a pistol round, etc. It really innovates the first person shooter genre. It is no way near pay to win, with skins allowing no competitive advantage, although in the end everyone buys at least one or two skins. In conclusion, CS:GO is a great game, and every human being capable of using a computer should at least try the game once. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."

15131,"This is a game that gets satisfying to play before it gets fun to play.

You spend a whole lot of time developing basic skills like moving around the map, controlling your shots, and telling your team what you see so they can act on it.

If you're not sure where you're going, are missing your shots, and don't feel like the team is communicating, it's probably not going to feel like a fun time.  Don't panic just yet, that's totally normal, you're still learning.

At some point you will get the basics down and can jump into competitive.  I recommend giving this a try as soon as possible -- with the pressure turned up, this means your actions have meaning in the game.  

You will care what happens because your team cares what happens, and they will for sure let you know if you're helping or not.  And every so often in competitive the algorithm gets it right.  It finds two teams who put everything they've got against each other and its not clear who is going to win.

Someone has to dig deep beyond what they thought they could do and unleash the beast within to win the game for their team.  If you stick with it that'll be you and you'll figure out why people love this game.

It's a fun you have to work for, can be a bumpy ride along the way, and definitely worth the trip"

15178,Counter Strike Global Offensive is a very fun game to play. The game runs very well with the correct settings so it is important to make sure they are optimize very efficiently. There are so many weapons to chose from which makes each round different. I really like playing with so many different players which is easy considering this is a very popular game. Overall I highly recommend this game.

15245,"CSGO is one of the most popular first-person shooters out there, but it's not without its problems. For starters, the game is extremely unbalanced. The AK-47 is way too powerful and the M4A4 is way too weak. This makes for some very one-sided matches.  Another big issue is the game's economy. It's extremely hard to get enough money to buy decent weapons, and even when you do, you'll likely get destroyed by someone with a better weapon. This makes the game very frustrating, and it's not uncommon to see people quitting matches early because they're so fed up.  The community is also a big problem. There's a lot of toxicity and it's very easy to get banned for no reason. The matchmaking system is also flawed, often putting people of vastly different skill levels against each other.  Overall, CSGO is a fun game, but it's far from perfect. If you're looking for a competitive shooter, you might want to give it a pass.

Gelegenheitsspiele oder Casual Matches je nach Sprachauswahl sind die reinste Katastrophe, nicht zu vergessen die ranked Matches, solange man kein Prime Status hat, hat man keien Lobbys mit Anti Cheat und jeder kack Spast kann rein hacken wie er will. Um nochmal das ""selten reinkommen"" anzusprechen, ich habe 8gb ram, 2gb vram intel core i5 6th gen und eine ssd und ich alde nicht in matches rein, oft wenn ich auf spielen drücke läd cs nichtmal und öffnet sich nicht, ich muss das fenster erst manuel öffnen und oft steh tda keine Rückmeldung, sobald ich im Matchmaking bin wird mir nur loading angezeigt und das csgo logo, nichtmal map name oder wei weit ich geladen bin sondern nur ""laoding..."" und csgo logo welches über ein camoflague pattern ist. die Counter-Strike Reihe verbindet viele Generationen vorallem CSGO aber naja, Matchmaking ist rotze, es gibt nciht alle Maps die es mal in csgo gab und ja die community ist reinster Rotz, da spielt man lieber Valorant wo zwar dumme kleine Fortnite Kiddies sind oder nervige slawische Kinder wie in CS jedoch sind diese nichtmal ansatzweise so schlimm wie hier und der Voiechat in Valorant ist um einiges angenehmer als hier. dazu ist es abnormal bekloppt das 10v10 in casual spielen und jeder nach belieben leaven oder joinen kann und das man gegner spectaten kann."

15508,"у как же без них, без блинов? Никак. Блины - классическая выпечка на сковороде. Я долго не могла подобрать идеальный рецепт блинов (на воде жестковаты, на кефире сложноваты и т. д.), такой, чтобы блины были тонкими, мягкими и просто готовились.

Продукты
Молоко - 400 мл
Вода - 150 мл
Яйца - 2 шт.
Сахар - 2-3 ст. ложки
Соль - 0,25 ч. ложки
Мука - 200 г (1+1/3 стакана объемом 250 мл)
Масло растительное - 2 ст. ложки
Масло сливочное для смазывания - 50 г

1. В миску влить молоко и воду, всыпать сахар, соль, хорошо размешать.

2. Добавить яйца, тщательно взбить венчиком.

3. Постепенно всыпать просеянную муку, постоянно взбивая, мука должна полностью вмешаться, без комочков.

4. В конце влить растительное масло, перемешать. Тесто получится как очень жидкая сметана.

5. Сковороду, желательно с толстым дном, хорошо разогреть. Половником набираем тесто (примерно 1/3 половника), выливаем на сковородку и, вращая сковороду, круговыми движениями распределяем равномерно тесто. Жарить около 15 секунд, до золотистых краёв.

6. Поддеть край блинчика ножом или силиконовой лопаткой и перевернуть (я переворачиваю руками, это совсем не страшно и не горячо). Обжарить со второй стороны и, так же поддев краешек, снять со сковороды.

7. Горячий блин смазать сливочным маслом. Жарим блины из всего теста и складываем стопочкой.

8. Подать можно с любым сиропом, сгущенным молоком, растопленным шоколадом и с чем позволит ваша фантазия.

Приятного аппетита!!"

Hear footsteps? Don't even bother to brace yourself ... people here have the most ungodly reaction time I've ever seen. In a way tho ... thats what makes this game great. The gratification of winning a game, getting a kill, or even just taking 7 seconds longer to eat shit ... you'll feel like you've really progressed in life (but you haven't). 

TL;DR: Ye the game's alright. Just don't play it if you're looking for a reason to jump off a bridge."

On a discord server some even asked me to play with them and not to worry, if they catch them won't affect me as a team mate. 
How is this even possible? I play CS since it was in beta but I can't compete with a wallhack or aimbot or whatever might be there. It's a shame... My guess is that 70% of the players use cheats (at least most of the kids), even streamers got caught so what's left to say?
I just want to enjoy a good game after a hard day at work at my 34 years..."
15725,"new players: wow this game is awesome, I just want to feel a moment of enjoyment

veterans: ooooh, that's the fun part, you'll never enjoy it:)"
15726,"Well, after 900 hours of my life spent on this game, I can say that it is NOT worth playing. People love to talk about how fair and balanced it is but in reality, only about 6 guns EVER get used because the rest of them are fucking awful so youre basically stuck playing the exact same formulaic game over and OVER. Here's how a typical win goes: as a terrorist, you dick around for 4 rounds until everyone can afford AKs and then youre basically unstoppable and win as many rounds as it takes to get to the half. Then as a CT, the other team is so demoralized that they dont even try and you win out. If you have to START as ct... well then youre really fucked. Better hope your team wins at least 13 rounds because if not, T side will come back 98 percent of the time because of how good and cheap their guns are! So basically to win you need a few things to happen: A, win the coin toss and start as T. B: Luck out with teammates. and C: pray there isn't some nerd on the other team who has 4k cs hours and another 6 in R6. 

OH AND GOD FORBID YOU TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN. LIKE THEY CALL THIS GAME COMPETITIVE BUT REALLY THAT JUST MEANS ANTI FUN LIKE FUCK YOU CAN'T RELAX A LITTLE, LISTEN TO MUSIC, AND BLOW OFF STEAM WITHOUT SOME HAIRY 10 YEAR COIN BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK AND YELLING AT YOU TO TRY HARDED AND TO NOT THROW GERNADES AT YOUR OWN TEAM LIKE FUCCK I DONT CARE ABOUT RANKING UP I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME.

and oh my god dont even get me STARTED WITH THE whole top frag dynamic like FUCK so just because YOU HAVE 2 MORE KILLS THAN ME DOESNT MAKE YOU BETTER DIDNT THE GERMANS TEACH US ANYTHING WHY ARE WE RANKING HUMANS IN THE FIRST PLACE JUST LOVE YOURSELF AND LOVE YOUR TEAM 

oh and they RUINED deathmatch a while back by adding so many modes. LISTEN: THERE ARENT THAT MANY PEOPLE PLAYING DEATHMATCH SO MORE MODES JUST MEANS THAT PLAYERS WILL BE SPREAD MORE OUT AND NO WILL BE PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER SO INSTEAD OF HAVING 3 LOBBIES WITH TEN PEOPLE EACH, THERE ARE TEN LOBBIES EACH WITH 3 PEOPLE AND 7 BOTS THAT IS SO STUPID GO BACK TO ONE GAMEMODE!

honestly this game really isnt worth getting in to. especially with this NEW RANK SYSTEM WHICH TOTALLY MESSED UP MY RANK AND NOW IM ONLY GETTING in lobbies with tryhard nerds who crucify me if I miss a shot that loses a round like. I WANNA BE BACK IN SILVER 2, GOLD NOVA IS FOR NERDS

AND SKINS! how does it feel that the main reason people know about this game is because they made a way for children to gamble and got away with it and now duimbasses are spending millions, nay BILLIONS on skins like fuck man why? 

and WOW they made it free to play are you kidding? WHY WOULD THAT HELP? it's a 15 dollar game. if you own a computer capable of running this game, which, props to them, is a pretty low standard, YOU CAN AFFORD TO SPEND 15 DOLLARS ON SHOOTY SHOOTY GAME."

15794,"-lots of cheaters
-lots of scammers
-lots of toxic people
-inconsistent fps
-lots of bugs 

 Conclusion:
It’s one of the best games ever created, 1000x times better than Valorant."
15795,/
15796,nice
15797,"Incredibly unbalanced. It only takes 4750 dollars to completely win a game. Guns such as AWP, AK-47 and M4A4 are stupidly powerful. No such thing I have observed in CS:S or the original CS. Your skill does not actually matter in the game. You will only use the guns I mentioned above. No SMG except for P90 is near to adequate to be used in any means of competitive gameplay. You will be laughed at if you wanted to play any Shotgun.
Do not fool yourself to believe that you will have fun playing it.
Play CS:S."
15798,"the game is fun, and i do love it a lot but the problem with this game is when playing comp. if you are unaware, if you do not delete the program files of model and another one (i cant remember) it will break the game and kick you out, only for you having to verifying the game which will take so much time and then having to deal with a comp cooldown. if and when this is fixed, only will i truly recommend this but thats 1 of the many things wrong with the game

I AINT PLAYING!!!!!"
15806,"i love how people in this game say ""that guy's hacking"" and then refuse to elaborate further on the accused's name or how they're hacking 😊"
15807,"If you want to destroy your nights, get mad with hackers, hear a lot of I was Global Elite, this is my second account, play this game, you will have fun."
15808,Do not recommend
15809,so much beter than valorant and amazing comunity
15810,🔥❤️
15811,"The game has much much more value to someone who wants to play this game competitively OR for someone who can actively play with friends often. Or at least at this point. It was probably more fun when it was introduced.

If you are into either of those, have a go!

I see more value playing with people I know and I can't honestly say I'd ever be good enough to play this well. I guess that's sort of the challenge?
That being said it can be satisfying to do well in the game but, as many others have noted, it can have it's fair share of cheaters and also has it's fair share of annoying people screaming obscenities (etc) over microphones/text either with you or at you depending on your perspective. 
If you're down/fine with all that please, have a go. It is free after all. I just struggle to find it very enjoyable most times without friends.

All negatives aside...
It's a solid FPS without a doubt and I'm sure many people can enjoy it and block out the rest. I mostly just catch myself playing it mindlessly when I'm bored OR when one of my friends if they want to join me.

Now it's more of a time waster if you're not trying to actively get better. And, with the number of people who play constantly and with an amount of cheaters to add on top of it it just... gets old fast.
If you don't take it seriously and can have fun with it I'd say it's worth it. Otherwise you'll be behind the curve of the regular community (and will likely be berated for it) OR you'll find yourself opposite a cheater and no one likes being cheated. Don't say you weren't warned!"

15827,is good game
15828,"Game has more people hacking than actually just playing the game (trigger bots are the most common, most are just blatantly wall hacking as well). It's quite literally become a cesspool for cheaters to just compete against one another. Game used to be fun, I dumped hundreds of hours in back in 2016-2018 and managed to make it to LEM. Found the higher ranks to not be as enjoyable due to the sheer amount of spinbotters I was meeting (usually played in the AM). Took about a 4 year break, only to find that the game is in a even worse state than before. It's quite literally unplayable now. Every casual game has 4-5 hackers per team. Every ranked game there'll be at least one on your team and the enemy team. Just sucks the fun out of the game, and makes it pointless to play. Overall this game made some great memories for me, but the cons far outweigh the pros for me now. Cyka Blyat."
15829,This game is still full of cheaters. i am crouching in the middle of nowhere guy jumps out from the right side shoots and headshot. . 1 shot 1 kill while jumping!! he didn't even hear that i am there. . . trash wallhacker aimbotters. . .

15864,"I love cs go, it soaks all the toxicity from the world, concentrating it within itself to save the humanity."
15865,"Undoubtedly the most complete game in the Counter-Strike saga. Over the years, several projects have failed for the evolution of Counter-Strike 1.6, but there is no doubt that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is here to stay, innovating not only the game system, but also the contribution and participation of players. in the Steam and Counter-Strike community. Graphically speaking, the game still doesn't quite compete with the top FPS that everyone loves, but it has gained a very good graphical overhaul. Another point worth mentioning is the game's menus, which have been simplified and ensure ease of use. It should be noted that the game is constantly being updated, with updates being released periodically to respond to problems reported by players. In addition to bug fixes, updates bring with them epic news. From update to update the news is amazing! The downside to mention is the competitive mode. Where even today there is no effective anti-cheat that ends with ""cheats"".
In short, it's an epic game! A renewed classic!!"

Everyone is screaming into their microphone, slurs, hate speech, violent language galore.

Now community side : just expect to play most of the time with your friends, you'll spare yourself the absolute cesspool of dumb players.
Decided to release new weapons after so so much time which became apparent that they should stop doing that (R8 Revolver good one valve, one weapon and you messed it up).

16103,"Counter-Strike isn't like other games. I'm not sure if I'm qualified to speak on all of it only being Legendary Eagle right now with over 1.1k hours. This game is and will always be active and a classic. It has personally helped me combat depression and given me hours of enjoyment. CSGO is easy to learn, and very hard to master. There are many minute details you need to practice and know: economy, spray controls, maps, movement, nade line-ups, and team play. It takes a very long time to master this game, and as someone with over 1000 hours, I know I'm still no where close. Don't let that deter you from the game! There are many aspects of the game to enjoy, even for people who are just looking for casual play. I personally like Flying Scoutsman and Arms Race, which are very fun if you want to casually kill some time and have fun. CSGO is not just a game, it's the high society of gamers. People all around the globe gather to play CSGO. From the memes of using a ""SWAG 7"", or an auto sniper, to ""RUSH B"", it will always be a culture that unites players across different regions. I love this game."

16226,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago. CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.).

16229,This game causes me unimaginable pain. 10/10.
16230,good
16231,"In CS:GO, you play the role of a hot masculine special agent, whitch objective it is to either defuse a bomb planted by the terrorists or plant the bomb as a said terrorist. In this game, you encounter a healthy amount of cultural and political diversity, from countries such as russia, poland, middle east and russia and middle east and poland etc. These people, especially from russia, are very open-minded and accepting of whoever you are. From my experience, they really like the LGBTQ+ community and people from Germany. It is a great game to meet new friends from many different countries like russia, russia, russia and russia. You can also improve your language skills just by listening to the lovely sweet conversations by your mates in the CS:GO voice chat.
So anyway, wo also gets a stiffy when dominated by a russian cheater with a masculine, bone deep voice or is it just me? I mean just the thought of me getting absolutely obliterated by a muscular north-eastern Siberian young man who fights with bears on a regular basis. The thought of you being stuck in one lobby with him with no way out because your mates won't surrender. The warm and sweaty feeing of helplessness does really drive me INSANE ( in a good way///) I usually inseminate the underside of my desk after the eight round because i am a weak ass but i really wish i could go for longer. Because of my kink, i wake up every morning flaming with ecxitement to hop on a fresh round of de_office and try my luck. But because of my relatively high trust factor and the recent effectiveness of VAC (curse this damned programm) i can no longer have fun 8x a day :(. It is really hard to encounter cheaters nowadays which really disappoints me. Sometimes i really think about quitting the game because there are too few cheaters. I really wish valve would do something to combat the frequent banning of cheaters. In my opinion, they should remove VAC and the overwatch system, because they are too effective and ruin my fun.
I think i might have lost my way, but i shall continue. Just hearing the ﷽ ﷽ from your lovely arab teammate makes you feel like you're in another country. I recommend playing CS:GO with an open voice chat, especially if you have mental health problems and/or suicidal thoughts, because your teammates and even your enemies will be very supportive and help you seek appropriate help for your problems. The CS:GO community is a wonder of its own and worth exploring. Playing CS:GO is like balm for the soul. It helps you find inner peace and guides you on your path to your better self.
CS:GO is the cool breeze from the west, the crackling of the autumn-colored leaves under your boots, the sparkling of cool water in the summer heat, the reflections of light on a sweaty, muscular male body, the Creme à la Creme of video games by far."

16266,good enough
16267,This game is either dog shit or fun. There is no in-between. If you are lucky enough to not get cheaters and get players that are actually the same skill  level as you then the game is fun. 90% of the time you get players that are way worse than you or way better than you (and 25% of the time someone is cheating). Would only recommend playing this game with a party of 3-5 and never EVER playing solo.

17032,"CSGO, a game that holds a special place in my heart. When I first encountered CSGO for the first time at a young age(im sad to say it was the roblox version) I instantly fell in love with it. I had played other shooters and this one was something different to me. It was fast paced, but balanced. It was not one of those games a brain dead person could excel at, it was perfection. I have played CSGO for 5 years now on different accounts and although it is always the same basic idea, every match I have played was different. CSGO is one of the few rare games I have played were I never get bored of it, I always find myself coming back to it. I have gone though weeks of terrible performance yet I still find pleasure in the game. CSGO is the game that never dies, because the community cannot let this game go. It is too perfect, the best FPS ever created. For those of you who are wondering wether to play this game or buying prime, you should do it. Even with cheaters, you will still come back to this game and to me, this game is priceless."

17276,"Personally, the community reminds me too much of league of legends. Both are equally bad, the game is fairly repetitive but the maps just aren't interesting at all, Nice weapons and skins though, I do like how devs implement some skins that you can vote on but that doesn't save the game. If I could get every second and hour back for my life playing this game, I would."

The new matchmaking update actually seems to be putting me with people who are the same skill level as me now, and I'm averaging mid scores KDA/ADR wise. I can actually feel my skill start to improve again as now I'm matched with more players who are taking the game seriously and allowing me to focus on getting as good as I was in the old days.

I am currently playing a game with my good buddy trews who isn't very good. He doesn't really that hard to be fair and is a bogroll of a teammate but what can we do?

Just played a game in silver 4. Well what can I say. I was the best by far on my team but the other team had three smurfs the bunch of naughty sausages. Makes me feel great sadness.

If you find a game with no Russians in it, You did not. Your eyes are playing tricks on you. No such thing exists.

But honestly, it's boring and confusing at the start, but it gets better! Don't expect any updates though, or anticheat.
If you want to have a good experience; You will have to buy prime or be gifted it ( thanks Isk for the prime ;p )

Dont get me started on the AWP. The ONE good thing about valorant is their take on the awp.  CS NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE AWP. It takes the least amount of skill out of any game i have ever played to use. 40 rounds? really? 40 one shot kills? Come on. Give this game a quality of life improvement. Do something that isnt SELLS SKINZZZZ. your game is dated and honestly needs some REAL TLC to make it work. FIX YOUR DAMN ANTI CHEAT PLEASE."

17828,"Like with any competitive multiplayer game, there’s a big market for cheats in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Valve’s timeless first-person shooter has an incredibly high skill ceiling, and some players will resort to using CS:GO cheats or hacks to make their way to the elusive rank of Global Elite.

It can be tempting to cheat when you’re constantly dying to better players, but doing so can lead to some pretty bad repercussions. If you value your Steam account and the ability of playing online multiplayer games with friends, you might want to reconsider. With permanent CS:GO bans and VAC bans on the line, the risks seriously outweigh the benefits of downloading a dodgy script you found online."

Good trading market although the market prices have skyrocketed over the course of the past few years.

I miss old sounds, Needs Source 2 engine & Better Anti-Cheat. Faceit is free with the option to pay, ESEA is paid, BOTH are better for game-play, tick rate & Anti-Cheat.

Valve could do A LOT to this game to improve EVERYONE's playing experience by adding 2 things.
1 : Better Anti-Cheat.
2 : 128 tick rate would be nice.

Overall well made game, If Valve would put even half as much effort & attention that Valve gives to Skins, Maps, Campaigns, Cases & Tournaments into a proper Anti-Cheat, This game would take over many competitors & probably become more popular in North America."

17983,I have played this game for a very long time and I think the familiarity is really what keeps me playing it. I really enjoy valves approach to gaming because it feels nostalgic but I hope that they will continue to innovate and make new games and not just capitalize on the gambling aspect of CSGO.

I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me a eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hunnid racks in my safe
Five hunnid racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up, in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no ho
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom
We used to wear each other clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain't my niggas no mo'
Hold it down for the 4
In the 9 with the woes
Marlo my dawg that's fo' sho'
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gon' fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
.40s, on .40s, on .40s
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' 'em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz Truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talking bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hunnid racks stuffed in the mattress
Hunnid racks stuffed in the attic
Hunnid racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangsta, but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the game to the fullest
I run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a 'Vert with a uzi
12 get behind me I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits, yeah"

18261,"i can say a lot about this game sadly i cant shoot is one thing but with a few things where they can hear you some times takes the fun away for new comers and this game is kinda crap for deathmatch and a few other stuff i really hate when one team wins and stuff i wont say any thing about this as it comes off as a few things
if counter strike WARZONE was still a fucking thing and not the shit 1.6 and the toxic faggots in it i would still play it this game seems better but zombie servers are retarded as fucking hell or fucking your own dog

this is annoying the stun is just sad wont give a chance to be flung and swing back at em atleast the shit nazi admin not toxic i hope as they are in 1.6 i only played zombiue servers having a knife as a zombie not the same at all the maps not the same sadly having 1.6 die for me as some person i would love to shoot in the head for thing on what they have done that was unfair and it was not me being a noob no long story so

so all ik death match puts u in random spots and u get unlucky mostly they had to hide the servers for unknown shit idk why
if only warzone was still a thing and if ROZ was still a thing i woulda never been here on steam ever maby

it just a lot to say and a lot idk about the stuff in this game and there still hackers on this game as far as ik and these games just not fun now in tf2 with the bots there more fun then humans to play with...some times

this game not for noobies at all but u get better over time kinda but slowly u learn and u get good i might come back to this game some other day or not all i want is CS WARZONE BACK it was a updated one better then 1.6 and the toxic corrupted lil faggots scum of the earth and dont get me started on fucking csns"

18272,"I know everybody knows about CS. But there are a few Glaring problems I face with the game. I get that I am in the minority. There is fun to be had in this game, so If you are interested play it.

First off Wallhackers are Prolific. Every day I have had to deal with them though Admittedly I only played three days. It is a free game so some hackers are to be expected. But I have not seen any of them get dealt with.

Second, some gun damage just does not make sense. An Mp5sd doing about 5-13 hp a hit. Wow that is small especially when you consider the AK47 can two shot people that means 50 Damage like 1300$ more and you can literally just two shot people. Why do you even have the option. That is not balance that is just, stupid. 
- My solution I would have Equalize damage a bit more price reflects mobility, Map response, Magazine size. 

Third and this is by far the most annoying thing to me. How bullet spread works and Always against my favor. The amount of times I have watched people full sprint one shot headshot me is over the reasonable threshold. But I can be crouched and have a person in the retical box, and Still not get a single shot to hit them does not matter if it is Full auto, Burst, or Single. Yes I know how the recoil works. Yes I adjust for it. But my bullets just magically disappear, or do Literally 5 damage.
It literally describes the Bullet spread at full auto as  ""The distance at which the spread stays within the size of a dinner plate."" This is not accurate. At 5 meters the MP5 Will miss an elephant, or a barn maybe even a 747 Boeing airplane. Ahh maybe that is just the bullets magically disappearing when I fire the gun. idk.
 
-Solution. Get more recoil spreads, as for the game making bullets disappear on me, I have no solution I was probably cursed by some witch or something.

I switch to the AK47/M1, and They are literally easy mode in comparison to the lower guns. Ok, Power weapon I am fine with that I guess. But now I wonder Why can people full sprint and always hit me with every shot. RNG, The fact that the fire pattern is always the same? Ok. That just ends up being an Unpleasant experience.

Last problem I have with the game is Ping, lag, Latency. Some people no matter what their ping is always have an advantage. It just takes their actions sometimes even seconds ahead of yours. I emptied an entire Magazine into a guy this last round only to die watch the replay and see that on his screen I shot nothing and he Full dash Whipfired at me and one shot me. 

The rest of these are just nitpicks. 
1. Why allow holding different weapons to change your speed. It seems like an accidental byproduct that never got fixed. Why is it not a cumulative of all your gear? I just do not understand and it seems lazy and something for decent players to abuse.

2. Also some of the map designs are just... Fever dreams. You ever hear of the Winchester mansion? That is how some of the maps feel, others are all right at best. The Highrise under construction. I swear if you submitted that blueprint to be built you would be fined by the client and institutionalized. I know it is a video game. Also screw the RULE of Three Paths in map design.

3. Shotgun distances. Just screw off. Literally be within 3 feet or your shotgun does nothing. Dammit go pay to do some clay shooting with a shotgun. That Target load is the shortest range standard 12 gauge Shotgun load and still reaches out to 150 feet with a decent shotgun. You firing buckshot that dissapears after three feet is just a damn game sin in this day and age. Balance be damned the game does not have any anyways.

4.Why be so afraid of foilage? There is no grass, No tree branches to hide your presence a little bit. You can not blend in you ARE the Scenery in this game. Also no Prone? Ok I guess.

Anyways I have awful luck in video games so RNG on where bullets hit or if they even get counted will be different and better for you. But as far as I am concerned I do not know how people take this game seriously with the amount of Jank I have seen. And I am not really expecting them to change anything in this game, after all it is one of the most beloved games still going. I recognize I am an outlier so yeah. All the best in your games."

Players seldom go for game objectives, everyone is just participating in a <censored> measuring contest using sniper scopes... maybe they need the scopes to see small things, dunno. 

Unless you're a mazochist and really don't have anything else to play to kill 30 minutes with, stay away.

18292,"How blatant can Valve be? Seriously? So instead of the spike they have something called a ""bomb""? Instead of abilities they have ""nades mollies and smokes"". Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant this game is"

Pretty sure it was a scam website that was 'statistics monitoring'. Had two factor authentication enabled but it's basically worthless. They somehow got past steam guard. Anyhow, don't put any money in the store - Valve doesn't give a damn AT ALL either. Sad, really."

they are very encouraging,with words like ""dont play awp bro"",very considerate words since he thinks i need to hit all 137 shots out of 50, instead i do 49 of 50 ,encouraging me to to get better by watching him miss all awp shots on purpose to give me motivation to become better and give awp to enemy team so i can have harder time to improve my self!

never flaming only cyka blyad idi nahui pizdieck <3
which translates i love you from the depths of my heart my lovely friend!

never shouting on mic  too!

but most importantly they players are very good usually, they always have -150 hs% on purpose,then they start playing for real after giving chance to the enemy teams , by doing their vigorous training of non stop vigorous training every day, they showcase their  spinbotting  abilities across the maps they showcase their real skill ! 

some of them even taught simple how to play csgo such a marvelous community ! <3

and never forget the no buy kits guys ! give the advantage to enemy team so they get better at control plant!

Then CS:GO is not for you. You will experience absolute Pain playing this game. Lots of Hackers, everyone is Toxic and racist. 
You will have Fun when you Win a game but if you even come close to Losing your entire Family will be fucked or killed by some random Dude in Europe. You lose a 1v5? You're shit and should die! You carry the whole game but miss 1 shot? You're shit and should die! You're from a part in Europe your teammate doesnt like? You're shit and should die!
You're teammate gets killed on the opposite side of the map because he's bad? You're shit and should die!

So be prepared for absolute toxicity, racism and rage.

The netcode sucks, the random lag spikes from the game on my beast machine of a built desktop rig suck(overclocked core i7 8700k, RTX 3080 Founders, 32gb DDR4, 1TB NVMe SSD, 1k watt platinum EVGA PSU), and the community in servers are overall dogshit trash sweatlords who only play CS and nothing more.
I tried doing one single competitive game to place my skill level, and lost 8-15 while top fragging. 

This game sucks lmao. Honestly wish they would've fixed alot of glaring issues years ago(128 tick servers WOULD HAVE BEEN FUCKING NICE JUST SAYING) but apparently the millions upon millions of dollars Gaben has racked up clearly isn't enough to update what used to be one of if not the most popular shooter of all time.

19180,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing CSGO. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing CSGO and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Youtube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing CSGO. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Steam has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. CSGO reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories.

Graphics are good, it scales well in triple monitor setup (AMD Eyefinity) and I was surprised by the number of heavy weapons. Probably the best part is that servers are still active + a lot of my friends have the game so the social aspect is present. Haven't tried skins yet. Definately recommend"

19355,"If you have never played Counter Strike: GO before, it's worth giving it a shot despite its age. If you have played it and decided to leave for whatever reason, know that not much has changed. CS: GO is still a solid multiplayer FPS with a good variety of weapons, maps, and modes. However, despite the Panorama UI update, some maps are starting to look dull compared with those in more modern titles such as PUBG and Overwatch. And although CS: GO's esports following contributes to its prolonged success, the player community is not as welcoming as others."

There is no way around it. The game itsself (not including the hacker problem) is near perfect. It's absolutely balanced, it's smooth, the mechanics are not like in other shooters, the competitiveness of the game is on another level.

Personally I do not come across hackers alot, but I do think that there are quite afew cheaters around in the lower ranks, but I feel like Valves anti-cheat is finally catching up.

IDK how you can rate this anything below a 10, unless you have only played it for a couple hours and come across aton of cheaters."

19458,"A childhood game since version 1.6 that we loved to enter with friends and decide who was the best shooter. In the Global Offensive version, we started creating teams and playing more intelligent games trying to win over others.
However, if your nervous system is not too strong and you did not go there just to have fun, then do not go there.
A huge number of cheats with which the developers seem to be trying to fight, but all without success. If there is no cheater in your game, then most likely there will be one or more toxic players who will blame others for everything and spoil the mood and thirst for victory.
Every time I entered this game, I was disappointed in it.
However, like other childhood games, it forever took a place in my heart, breaking it again and again."

19581,"Since the game has moved to free-to-play, I've noticed a large increase in the general toxicity as well as hacking(lots more overwatch opportunities). Until the community becomes more heavily moderated, I would suggest not letting children play unless you are okay with them hearing racial or homophobic slurs on a daily basis. Even if a user does get banned, they are free to create a new account, this will be a tough problem to solve until IP banning comes into greater use."

19650,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. h"

The game was good but, as always, Valve ruined f2p players that play the game by disabling ranked comp if you don't have prime, and, the anti-cheat can be bypassed really easily. It's a really good free FPS Free to Play game, but it was alot better in the past.

[PT-BR]
O jogo foi bom mas, como sempre, a Valve piorou o jogo deixando os jogadores F2P sem acesso ao Competitivo Ranqueado se você não tiver prime, e, o anti-cheat do jogo pode ser fácilmente burlado. É um jogo FPS grátis para jogar muito bom mas era muito melhor em seu passado."

19895,"This game would deserve sincerely a 7/10, but the hackers that are allowed by the CS:GO publishers are just ruining almost every single game. And by ""are allowed by CS:GO community"" I mean that there has been no recent major security/anti-cheat updates or fixes. Even platforms like Faceit have 10 times better anti-cheat systems. This is just really annoying for any player and game developers don't even seem to care. I wish I could just get back the money and time spent on this game, because I was hoping for a better experience that should improve over the years, but it is really quite the opposite. Anyway, I will stop playing CS:GO, because the experience is really becoming unenjoyable at least for competitive matches."

19942,CS: GO also has the upper hand in terms of combat mechanics. Weapons and movement especially feel more accurate than in Fortnite and PUBG. All these factors make for a much more condensed and manageable experience. I particularly enjoy that matches tend to only take about 45 minutes from start to finish.

20231,"This game is a fine mixture between civilized political conversations with dangerously drunk russians, and being that drunk russian, having a political conversation. I love the community. Even if they are socially unacceptable within our perpetual borders of verbal society, they always make me love this game even more. Every time I fire up CS:GO, I just sit back, relax and get wallbanged through the double doors in DUST 2 as AT. No one on my team would care, because this is a more evolved community than games like Valorant. In CS:GO, people are happily toxic, and Valorant players, they are intoxicatingly toxic. What differentiates Valorant and CS:GO is that Valorant branches off of the League of Legends community, who are all a part of the RIOT Games family. They are known for their toxicity, which is their biggest problems. I always enjoyed the gameplay of Riot's games, but their community is so not hallal mode. Counter-Strike's similarity with Valorant was angry 12-year olds screaming about getting flashed by tryhards' lineups. This is easily avoided by simply playing unrated, or just getting good when playing competitive.

Counter-Strike also allows alot more diversity through your firearm choice. There are always different ways to ddeal with enemy players having superior aim. You could buy a MAG-7 and be called a ***** when you kill an enemy player. Or save up for machine guns, snipers etc. There is so much about the game to be enjoyed. You can always play with friends at 02:00 and just have a good vibe throughout the night, because there is litteraly nothing that can ruin that type of mood. You run into hackers? kick him, or find a new server. You can mess with your mates by vote-kicking them, or voting for a map they don't like. There is no limits to your fun, and definitely worth investing several hundreds, and maybe thousands of hours in!"

** Summary **
I have been playing the game for 2 years almost. This is my newer account. I have a lot to say about this game but would prefer to keep it short. You'll love the game 100%. There will be a crap ton of hackers and bad matchmaking experience, however you will still come back. Its enjoyable and the feeling of improving is empowering. That's why I can't put it into words. Give it a shot!

20339,"As a somewhat seasoned CS:GO player, I WOULD suggest newcomers to the FPS genre to play this game, as it will give you the most toxic, grindy experience one could enjoy. This game will not only help you dial in your aim and game awareness, but you will come out of your CS:GO experience a changed man. All jokes aside, this game is a great launchpad for those who are looking to get 'better' at playing FPS's, as this is the ultimate challenge to ones skill. Good luck!"

It's quite the opposite actually and to be frank, I have no idea why i keep exposing myself to this amount of pain. I wouldn't call it an addiction but it's a pain that I don't think I can currently live without. Pray for me."

20364,"Great game playing with friends but playing solo can be very boring, especially if you don't have prime. Even playing with friends and not having prime can be a little bit boring because of cheaters every game/every other game. But usually if you have prime you wont go against cheaters as much (major decrease in cheaters). The only time I really get mad is if I die to something stupid, cheaters (uncommon w/ prime), or if my teammates are yelling racial slurs at me because im going negative by 1 kill (ex. 1-2). But in general the game is good 8/10 without prime, 10/10 with prime!"

I'm writing this message with the great understanding that it may not even be read, but I'm going to try

The new rank update in cs go gave me hope for a profound change in the player selection system and a fundamental fix to all ranks, but numerous games with the new update have shown me that the game has not just become unbearable, but horrible.

The problem is that literally every game I'm up against serious ranks that I still have a long way to go (I provide screenshots). If such problems in the previous version of cs go were rare, now it happens literally every game.

This ruins all my impressions of the game and I literally do not want to go into it anymore, in destroyed not only the fundamental balance of the game, but the very essence of competition game

20528,"I decided to end my cs-go career before it started because the community in the game is too aggressive. and everyone is playing the game very aggressively. It's not my style of play. I just played because I liked some of the skins in the game, but not everything is leather. It was a little late to learn that. but i have nothing to do. I don't think I will play this game again until the aggressive community in the game changes, and I'm not even talking about the cheaters because for me it's okay to die or not die or win or lose is not important. goodbye csgo

yani kelimelerle söyleyecek pek birşey bulamıyorum. fakat oyundaki agresiflik gerçekten çok ileri düzeyde dost ya da düşman ol hiç farketmiyor. Cs-go başladıgım ilk gün böyle hayal etmemiştim. ancak bu topluluktan nefret etmeye başladım. oyunu sadece skinleri için sevmiştim fakat herşeyin skin ve çıkartma olmadığını öğrendim benim için üzücü bir durum fakat yinede oyunu skinleri için önerirdim elveda skinler ve elveda csgo"

20617,"This game is like meth but not in a good way. You'll be up for hours tense and paranoid. You'll get that rush of winning a game or getting a nice ace to get that dopamine going but its short lives and far inbetween. You'll eventually want to quit and stop playing but its hard to quit like meth. You'll keep coming back like an abused girlfriend to her abuser. You'll hate this game and constantly talk bad about but yet not stop playing. Even if you quit for an extended period of time, just like a drug addict getting back into old habits, you'll reinstall and or open the game play one and fully relapse. I wish you the best of luck if you plan on buying this game or even if you re-buying it just because your using a new steam account and i'm sorry to you I truly am I hope one day even for my self we can break this viscous cycle of swearing this game off at night just to open it back up in the morning."

You will come across many toxic-salty people, just ignore-report-mute them.
You will have days that you may play like a pro and feel good and your dopamine will skyrocket, but you will be accused of cheating by your ""victims"".
you will have days that you can't even get a shot and you will be told to possibly cease to exist and delete this game possibly something about your close relatives but as I said in my second point, ignore-mute-report whatever you dont like.

Enjoy this game, be less toxic, obviously don't cheat what would be the point."

20811,"I decided to rewrite this review because this game deserves it!

No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun.

When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.

You win or you learn, you never lose.

CS will never die."
20812,"nice game
"
20813,"Packed with action, coordination and a team with various different skill sets that can really blow the place up. It can give you a massive boost of adrenaline with the various push angles and the utility of each gadget can really ramp up the gameplay to a whole new level... yea, Raibow6Siege is great compared to this trash. Anyways i had some fun in it until i got to upper ranks where everyone is either 10k hours mega-beasts or 100hours spank machines with gaming chairs and lots of rgb."

20835,Amazing game 100% recommended cured my depression :)
20836,"Pros:
-You can play the CS market like the stock market and make tons of money
-Fun with friends
-Fun, when you're not being decisively being murdered by a professional player in a casual lobby
Cons:
-Some people are better than me
-William and Jacob can't throw flashbangs to save their own life
-I'm not a pro player yet
-William isn't a team player half the time and is incapable of giving the simplest call outs

Overall 9/10 will flash my team again"

20853,"I'm a 45 year old parent, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single parent raising my son who is now 14 years old. My son got this game for Christmas 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me as it was already hard to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always with friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and grab this game to see if I could play alongside it. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it because it was the best time I've had with my son since my wife died. Since then this game has brought me and my son together again and now we spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun in everything, it even reminded me to eat the ass of whoever's reading."

21059,"I'll admit at first it came to me about this game I turned it down. However, after doing some extensive research and not just going off my own personal anti-bias towards shooting games I realized, that this game is just like all others in the genre. A few things that stood out to me when doing my research were the fact that blood, voice chat with others, and the text chat feature can easily be turned off. On top of this, there is no sexualizing of any gender in any way in this game. Now let's talk about the graphics. They are realistic, however, it is impossible to see any gore or specifics of guns or people in Counter-Strike Global Offensive. Overall I believe that if you allow your kids to see pg-13 movies they are more than capable to play this game. Rest assured that your kid will be safe while playing and is all set to have a blast with his friends! Hopefully, this review helped!"

21331,"准备购买CSGO的同学要注意下面几点！
1：最好别碰箱子【这种比运气的东西就跟赌博一样，一开根本停不下来，除非你认为你自己是个欧洲人，不然最好别去碰箱子，安安心心的去买皮肤吧！】
2：升级经验是固定的，不管你是多少级，升级都是固定的5000点。每周升级都可以随机获得一个喷漆【有次数限制】或者一把皮肤枪，不过基本都不值钱，每周只能获得一次。40级满级后可以转生，回到1级，同时会送你一个今年的服役勋章，比如你17年满级转生，就送你17年的服役勋章，简单来说这勋章就是拿来好看的。
3：平衡性，不用我说了，皮肤没有任何属性加成，所以不用担心遇到什么人名币战士。
4：CT和T都有自己阵营的特色武器，比如CT的M4A1，T的AK47。【说这个就是想吐槽我有一个萌新朋友抓着我问为什么CT买不了AK47，T买不了M4A1。说实话我可以笑他一年，23333】
5：现在到了2级就能打竞技了，并且定级赛并不是让你定级打10把，而是让你赢10把，赢了10把才算定级完成。每赢2把会冻结你的竞技模式，无法打竞技，这是以你赢的两把的战绩还有之前输的几把比赛帮你测评你的水平，冻结时间结束后才能继续打竞技。定级完成后你才可以随心所欲的打竞技了！
6：一定要小心一些陌生人，有些心怀不轨的人会加你好友给你发链接，这个时候别去点链接，也别信那些人说的我用XXX元买你刀啊皮肤之类的，这些家伙们都不是什么好人。【提这个是因为在贴吧里不止一次看到有人被骗了。】
7：现在CSGO分两种服务器，国服和国际服，国服目前在18号前没有激活码是没法玩的，激活码自己去百度搜索CSGO完美官网去抢，国服和谐有点严重，血变成石油了，恐怖份子变成了****和谐符号等等。对于国际服玩家，VPN的话我比较建议网易UU和奇游。国际服玩家想转国服的话，跟DOTA2转国服一样，鼠标右键游戏点击属性，在属性页面选择【设置启动选项】，在启动选项中输入—perfectworld steam，确定，然后就可以玩国服了，不过国际服玩家没有激活码也是没办法在18号前进行匹配的。[10.2]这次CSGO更新后，好像打开游戏是让我们自行选择哪个服务器，可以选择国服也可以选择国际服，如果有什么遗漏的欢迎留言补充，这也是我最后一次更新评测了吧。
8:[8.5]最近V社在封中国饰品网机器人，导致中国玩家损失惨重，所以第八条建议，最好是等这次风波过后再用。还是那句话，理性消费才是关键。
最近混了混饰品交易网，饰品交易网主要还是看信誉，不清楚的萌新可以去问问百度贴吧的老哥们，饰品交易网最深的坑就是类似于赌博性质的“抽奖”，这抽奖很容易亏钱，相信有些氪金老哥很清楚的，交易网用来提现或者买枪都可以，但是我不建议去花钱“抽奖”，非常坑，真的非常坑。【7.30】因为某饰品交易网的事情搞得很多人被坑，因为我早就不玩饰品了，就不予评价，不过不是这次事件，某网的黑点也够多的，比如以前被串号转库存这些事情不少有，不过这次更新不说这个，这次我想教下萌新们安全地卖皮肤：去百度贴吧，饰品交易吧把你想要卖的饰品信息挂到贴吧里，跟别人谈价，等确定买家之后走饰品网，挂好饰品后把信息告诉买家，让他买。注意一点，这个是最重点的，无论什么情况，所有交易必须都是走饰品交易网，若他非要不用交易网和你进行交易的话，请不要跟他浪费时间，这种饰品交易不走交易网还会去市场？这种人不走交易网就是想坑走你的饰品，那种“买家”会要你去其他什么狗P网站交易，然后再申诉把钱拿回来，走饰品交易网至少不会被骗，目前由于某网出了这么大的事情，肯定有萌新在思考用什么交易网，因为我出了饰品坑所以也不好说哪些，但是我们有万能的百度贴吧老哥们，萌新可以去问CSGO吧的兄弟们什么交易网可靠，记得没错的话，好像置顶帖就有教的，然后饰品交易过程，最好是越短越好，所以要先找到买家再去挂饰品交易网，十几块的皮肤不需要用我这个，但是几百块以上的最好要先找到买家，再直接挂交易网，这次某网事件我就不说什么了，最后给各位萌新留一个提醒：饰品是个大坑，切勿沉迷饰品，别因为一时冲动，吃半月尘土。
9：国服出了后，为了少点萌新被骗，我给第6条补充一下，先说说目前骗子骗人的骗法吧，基本上想买你的刀或者找你打联赛的，全都是骗子。有人以前好奇，说为什么不能点链接，我就给你们讲讲吧，这是库存链接，对于绑了手机安全令牌的还好，没绑的绝对会出事，它会把你所有库存交易给对方，手机还好可以确认是否交易，但是没绑手机令牌的同学就惨了。然后别以为有手机安全令牌就可以随便浪了，有些黑客早已经弄了个盗号网站，等着你浪呢。目前骗子最喜欢用的手法是打联赛缺人来骗你，因为是机器人自动发话，我就给你们讲讲骗子一般怎么骗人的吧。
骗子：我们联赛缺一个人，你打什么位置？
萌新：？？？
骗子：行，我知道了，你加下我们领队，她会告诉你更多。XXXX【这是库存交易链接】

Pros :
Very good graphics for 2013 game.
Variety of maps.
Not buggy.
Skill Based, require to play it more. ( catchy asf )
Getting cheap skins after level up. ( YOU NEED TO BUY PRIME ACCOUNT FIRST )
Nice mechanics.

Cons :

Community is toxic.
Too many Russians ruining the experience.

That's all! Recommended!

Wall hacks = nem assim , tristes XD   people don't use coms but toxic via chat, get ready for fake infos and ""left left right up"" asshole info given by random players.

if you get good in this game you can perform good in most of the other FPS games but it can NOT be the other way around. the only problem of the game which we all know is the cheaters but there are also ways to not get cheaters in your match makings. anyways , i seriously love the game and heard valve is still improving it so good on them and of course us as players"

21815,"The game has different modes, all of which are played to a greater or lesser extent (so far I've been able to find a lobby for each mode).

If you want to reach a higher rank than Master Guardian, you can't do without buddies. The solo queue (matchmaking alone) is an emotional roller coaster ride. Either you get good mates who communicate with you or experience rage quits, certain ethnic groups who have their microphones next to a turbine and don't WANT or can't speak a word of English, or, or, or...

The matchmaking still gives me moments that appear in 15 out of 100 matches, which is why I'm still playing this game. When that moment comes, the mates are friendly, the match is fun, and my skill is at its peak.

A tip from the pro: don't by cases. These are sometimes dropped in matchmaking or are available for little money. BUT the keys - which are needed to open ONE case - cost more than the case itself. But the best is yet to come: the cases have different skins that could be contained in the case. The emphasis here is on COULD. Because not only are higher quality skins less likely to appear, they just may not be in the box at all... So if you want a skin, you better buy it directly from the market."

22157,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

+ deserves more respect 
+ some toxic people but better way to build a community
+ no threatening from teammates or enemies like other PvP games but they simply ask you to uninstall or they'll kick you.
+ better physics and realistic weapons
+ little bit expensive 
+ more customisation
+ and the best part is workshop maps

22575,It's game is awesome to play! The combat and how the game work's is great. It's a free game so anyone can download it and have a go! Also the map's in this game look cool. Also the team's design changes each map you play on as well giving it this vibe that your going other places. Playing this game can get tricky at first but once you get a hang of it your getting around 2-3 kill's in one round before getting killed. This game also has community build maps to play on as well that are downloadable via the Steam workshop 10/10 Get Shooting and stop those terrorists! Or.. if you are the terrorist.. then have fun killing the counter-terrorists and trying to blow the place up!

22681,I hate this game and the skins keep bringing me back into the mix but anytime i play comp i hate it even more.
22682,Counter strike is great and it's a lot of fun. Super competitive but the only thing that ruins the game is the toxic community. You play russian roulette every time you queue for a game to see what toxic person your team is going to get. Reporting does nothing.
22683,i love this game so much its a amazing games that i think everyone should try at least once its a good and fun place to kill time and meet new people and enjoy a great afternoon

22955,"Zero moderation, haven't seen VAC work since CS Source, ""Overwatch"" is basically a joke.

Really an awesome game 10 years ago but unfortunately this is now a garbage title. Competitive matchmaking is now more cheaters than regular players. Came back after a few years and had full-on rage hackers in 5 of my first 8 games; they don't even hide it anymore. This is what my experience was in ""Prime"" matchmaking on a 15 year old account. YOU end up getting punished and de-ranked for leaving instead of running into their bullets for half an hour. Sadly nothing good to say here, stay away."

I'm very insecure person so i usually didn't engage in games that needs you to communicate with different people. When my boyfriend introduced me to this game, he and I used to play a lot with bots. But as I dove in deeper its an awesome 5v5 FPS game that deemed to be my favourite game of all time. It has a really big learning curve and its really fun to play, especially with your friends. No matter how old i get, this game will always stay in my heart forever <3"

23123,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Haven't ran into many exploiters, muddying my boots in competitive feels good, although there's quite a few people still saying the N-word...while sounding like they have several retainers constricting their jaw shut, I feel the overall demographic of the games player base is healthy-ish, giving a variety of challenges and potential friendship.

7/10 for nostalgia, It felt good relearning the recoil structure for a lot of weapons and seems like some haven't changed much..(i.e AK), fun game overall.

23439,"11 computer science student study tips
You can use the 11 tips below to help you succeed as a computer science student:

1. Pursue knowledge outside of courses
While a fair amount of the knowledge you learn comes from classroom instruction, you can also pursue topics in your own time. For example, if you discover you enjoy a topic that only came up briefly during a class, you can use your own time to research that topic, learning more about computer science as you do so. You can also research computer science, information technology, aerospace and defense companies to understand what skills they currently need. Part of your research can include searching for internships, part-time and full-time jobs to understand the requirements that businesses have for potential careers.

2. Avoid last-minute studying
This is true for almost any subject, but particularly for computer science. Because a lot of computer science classes have practical exams, last-minute studying rarely works. This can help you avoid the stress of trying to learn new skills just before exams or other tests and allow you to be relaxed during a test because you're not worried about the last-minute subjects you tried to learn. For example, if you have a computer engineering class with an exam to fix a computer, studying the ways to do so at the last minute could create stress for you during the exam.

3. Develop theoretical computer skills
A majority of classes for computer science students are practical, but learning about theories can still be helpful. One way that you can do this is by studying the foremost computer design companies to see the directions that those companies take with their designs. Another way you can learn theoretical knowledge is by watching as new ideas for computers arise and which ideas people test and apply to the industry. Finally, you can read about historical theories in computer science and how they developed into the theories that the industry uses today in order to understand possible futures for computers.

4. Develop practical computer skills
Most of the practical computer skills you develop can be from the courses you take, but some of them you can develop on your own. For example, practicing creating small programs can help you learn a lot about programming that classes may not teach you. You can also practice rebuilding computer hardware and even designing and building your own computer to meet any needs you have. Other practical skills you can develop include learning mathematics that support the direction you want to develop as a computer scientist and learning how computer hardware has changed since the invention of modern computers.

5. Make connections with professors and other students
One challenge computer science students may face is that a lot of their studies are personal and prevent them from interacting with others. One way to overcome this challenge is to reach out to professors during their office hours, even when you don't need help with assignments and tests. Networking with them can help you keep in touch with changes in the field and some of the most recent research they have done. Speaking with your professors can also help you create lasting connections and aid in your future job search as you seek your first job in the industry.

Another way you can overcome the challenge is by communicating with other students in computer science and other fields. Speaking with other computer science students can help you learn better study habits, develop new ideas for projects, tests and assignments and create a sense of community within the industry. Talking to students in other areas like math can help you develop math skills beyond those of your computer science peers while talking to arts and humanities students can help you design creative solutions to challenges you may face in classes and help you develop a holistic network of future professionals.

6. Rest and relax
Resting and relaxing when you need to is a major component of studying for any student. Taking several courses with different topics and constantly working on assignments can contribute to fatigue and lead to higher burnout rates. Making time to relax can help you solve complex problems, design creative solutions and ensure that you are taking care of your basic need such as eating and sleeping. Resting when you're ill can help you recover more quickly, and understanding when you need to miss classes or work to take care of yourself can be a crucial component of your success.

7. Schedule time to study throughout a term
Because practical elements of computer science can take a long time to learn, it is important to create your own study schedule. Schools and universities may offer specific times to study, such as a reading day during final exams, but that's a day you can use to rest and relax before final exams. Creating a weekly day where you study can help you increase your productivity and remember information that is important for your exams. When you create your schedule, try to choose days and times where you can be free of distractions like sporting events and club activities.

8. Develop your math skills
Some parts of computer science require you to know the math behind how they work. Developing your math skills can help you be a more versatile computer science student and allow you to understand the material you use. You can develop your math skills by taking courses that are often encouraged by programs in computer science. You can also develop your maths skills by talking to math students and professors and researching how to do them using the internet. Finally, understand you only need to take math courses that support your focus on computer science and you can avoid others.

9. Learn how to write
Computer science students spend a lot of time learning how to write code and use programming languages, but being able to write in plain language can help you develop skills for a wider variety of careers. Writing in plain language can also help you understand how computer science, people and language are all related. Learning how to write has the potential to aid you in expressing your ideas and supporting theoretical and practical arguments through logical reasoning and rhetoric. Using writing to express yourself outside of academics can also help you rest and relax when you need a break.

10. Use every available resource
Using every resource available to you can help you be a more versatile student. Many schools and universities offer their students several resources such as writing and tutoring centers, professors and other students. These resources are often knowledgeable in topics you need help with and can help you develop a wider knowledge of computer science. Universities and schools might also offer you a variety of student perks and discounts on programs you can use to develop your computer science skills. Using these can help you maximize your time during school and minimize personal costs you would otherwise have.

Other resources you can use include professionals and companies in the industry and the internet, all of which may provide insights into a variety of topics and areas that you may be unfamiliar with. Using every resource can also help you develop workplace readiness skills you can put on your resume and use for future employment opportunities you earn. Being able to use the internet in a reliable and trustworthy way can also help you find solutions to problems quickly, and develop a list of places you can go to learn about topics you're unfamiliar with.

11. Pursue internships
Pursuing internships while you're a student can be an excellent way to learn new skills and create time to study. Internships often give you real-world experience that classes cannot offer. They also allow you to practice any skills or knowledge you've earned and apply it to challenges"

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

23711,"A good game ruined with one update because devs wanted some more money for their cigarettes, many people have been thrown under the bus after grinding for months, if not years, to get free prime, only to be a couple levels away before the cash grab update, which I like to call, that forces you to pay to play with a privileged userbase or tryhard adults who invest a fortune in their gaming equipment. Thankfully it's not the end of the world since games like Valorant exist, so if you want to actually have fun in a game, don't choose csgo and don't waste your time with prime. I've played csgo for two years with my brother, and got prime for free, but now playing against tryhards only isn't fun. Fun fact but buying stuff, especially online is a scarcity in many places outside the US, but did the devs care? They did care about their big fat first world wallets. The chater problem had also not been fixed, oh no, far from the truth, this had nothing to do with cheaters, cheaters invest money into their hacks too. Never in my life had I seen such hypocrisy from valve/ Just like apple ditching the charger to be environmental friendly when all they're doing is saving money and shifting the pollution to the consumer, because people still have to buy the charger separately = more packaging = more waste.

Many people who have written a review on this game complain about the hackers. to those people, just stick with the game, you'll gain a higher trust factor and then you'll rank out of the cheaters section. Very old and unique game, only game similar to it thats managed to compete with it is Valorant. Yes, the hit reg can be wonky sometimes but honestly, just get a better PC, it helps. If you cant, then just deal with it. It doesn't happen often and you usually get the trade off anyways. For thos ...MORE

Man. The day I first tried CSGO at a PC cafe, I fell in love. It's why I own a PC from MSI of my own today, and why gaming and FPS titles in general became a major part of my life. Counter-Strike has one of the largest fanbased communities backing it up, which quickly becomes apparent with a quick YouTube or Twitch search. 

If you're only now getting into PC gaming, the first thing you need to do is buy yourself a copy of CSGO, whether you're a fan or not. It's just an unspoken rule.

23743,"This game is good, at least i think when i first try. But soon as I play this game more, the more awful i think it is.  
This game does not had any in game currency or shop. In my opinion, this game is way 2 hard for me. 
When i joined a game last time, there is a player on another team keep open his mic and keep breathing, 
eating, speaking and etc. I know there is an option where you can vote kick player out of the game. But you
know what? You can only kick the player that is in your team! I tried 2 join 2 another team but sadly that team is full. Its really annoying so i decided to quit the game. i had 270 minutes record on this game. I 
deleted the game to get some space for me to install GTAV. I don't think i will even play this game anymore.
If you want to see a part of my playthrough you can go to Youtube and search 'MarcusKerksy'. So i don't recommend to play this game even you don't had any money to buy games especially for kids, noob etc. 
If this game updated and gets more better, please let me know in the comments and Youtube comments.

23816,this game is worse than smoking.
23817,This is the type of game that when you get into it becomes an absolute nightmare. 1 out of every 100 games will be fun if your lucky.  The game is riddled with cheaters at all levels except entry level. The ranking system  and matchmaking is beyond broken. The CSGO team clearly don't care as they are making enough money from gun skins. So much so that they wont even update  to 128 tick servers.  I would advise you to stay away from this game at all cost. Not even worth the free download and definitely stay away from Prime as it doesn't do shit.

23862,"Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature."

23933,"I was very satisfied when I started playing the CS:GO. but from last month I am having issue with game, It disconnects the game while playing and shows the message that I have have poor internet connection. I tried to contact the Steam support but they said you should check with your ISP(Internet Service Provider). However, I am having high speed internet plan with 1GBPS, it is absolutely working great with my PS and the other online games I play which requires same strong internet connection as CS:GO. So instead of solving the problem of game. steam support says I am responsible  to fix this issue. This is such a horrible experience. I cant even play GTA V Online which I purchased from STEAM. it is too shuts down with connection error. I am not thinking to purchase any of the games from STEAM now on."
23934,"Amazing game and will always be remembered for it's glory days. But it's sad to see how a successful well known game that ever came to the market is treated so poorly by it's developers. The updates are nothing compared to valorant. Washed up ranked system. It's been cheater heaven ever since the game went free. If you still love this game like I do and want to play competitive, I recommend you give faceit a try."

24004,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is

24265,This game is a lot of time. You spend time meeting your best friends and the worst people on the internet. You meet russian kids that scam people out of their blues and people who aimbot. It's a love hate relationship. You win 10 games  just to lose one and derank from silver  3. I spent many hours P90 rushing banana with my friends since 8th grade. I spend many consoling people who were wanting to end their lives. I would say the experience of this game is worth the time and money (back when it wasn't F2P). This game should be experienced by everyone if you can. Understand that you will not be great at this game at the start. Don't let that stop you. Keep playing and enjoying yourself. It'll be worth it. <33

However the issue this game has is the people who play it. High rank player Make alt accounts to smurf low lvl make it unenjoyable and an annoying experience to play. IMO it makes it impossible to learn and understand maps and strategy. 
Even with this flaw, If you can find a lobby with player your lvl it can be an interesting and usual very close game.
 If you bother to ever play this game a lot definitely buy prime so you don't have to fight hackers every game.

24386,"EASY HOMEMADE BREAD

1.Pour 650ml of tepid water into a large bowl. Add the yeast and mix with a fork for a couple of minutes.

2.Pour in most of the flour and half a teaspoon of sea salt, then use a fork to mix together until you can’t move it anymore.

3.Now get your clean hands in there and bring it together as a ball of dough, adding more flour as you need to stop your hands and the dough sticking.

4.Transfer the dough to a flour-dusted surface and keep it moving, kneading, pushing and stretching it for 5 minutes, or until you have a silky and elastic dough.

5.Use your floured hands to shape the dough into a rough ball, put it in a bowl, flour the top and cover with a clean, damp tea towel. Allow it to prove for about an hour or an hour and 30 minutes, or until doubled in size – ideally in a warm, draught-free place.

6.Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out by punching it with your fist, then kneading for 30 seconds.

7.You can now shape it or flavour it as required – folded, filled, traybaked, whatever – and leave it to prove for a second time, for 30 minutes to an hour, or until it has doubled in size once more.

8.Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.

9.Carefully transfer your bread dough to the oven and gently close the door. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until golden. You can tell if it’s cooked by tapping its bottom – if it sounds hollow it’s done; if it doesn’t then pop it back in for a little longer.

10.Once cooked, place your loaf on a cooling rack and allow to cool.

24461,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

24610,"Where should I start?
The game will make you addicted  you will spend hours of you're life without you noticing, it's a fun game.
But you will see a LOT of cheaters without premium.
What is premium? Premium is an upgrade of the game for 14 euro/usd.
In my opinion if you just want to play the game and hope there aren't hackers don't buy premium.
If u want to go competitive and gain ranks/skill groups also get drops and skins, go for premium.
What are ranks/skill groups? Well ranks are gained by experience XP In order to get that xp you need to play competitive matches and in time you will get skill groups  the more you play and play GOOD the better skill group you get.
I will list the skill groups here:Silver I
Silver II
Silver III
Silver IV
Silver Elite
Silver Elite Master
Gold Nova I
Gold Nova II
Gold Nova III
Gold Nova Master
Master Guardian I
Master Guardian II
Master Guardian Elite
Distinguished Master Guardian
Legendary Eagle
Legendary Eagle Master
Supreme Master First Class
The Global Elite

You will start as a silver... in which you will encounter SMURFS and CHEATERS.. because yes everyone wants to get out of silver fast.
From Gold nova you will encounter better players and kind of 0 hackers.
I recommend  this game with all my heart, because it is fun.
So what are you waiting for? Install it and give it a try.

24664,"I am a 800 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started CS:GO and in less than a week, he had already played for over 32 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and we played a couple of games. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both my son and I many happy memories."

24769,"This game was good but trash now... This game is filled with toxic tryhards, bad match-making, or bugs. This game loves to have issues with random lag spikes when in combat or randomly*My PC usually runs this game at 300+fps.  CS:GO has random crashes for no reason or the game will lag so badly it cost you the game. Match-making is so bad that you get literal noobs with 2 hours of playtime while you have like 800+ hours. I que up with 2 friends, both relatively the same number of hours(600 minimum) and we get noobs(silver 1) in our team with 2 hours at most, and the enemy team will be gold nova 4 with 1k+hours. Also half the time, the teammates dont even speak the same language as you, Several matches I'll have 2 teammates that only speak Spanish or some other language besides English. Also hacking is insanely bad, almost every match will have some hacker that will spam the N-word in chat and proceed to no scope you with the SSG across the map while calling you trash. Toxic players are so frustrating, imagine getting killed by your teammates because you didn't clutch a 1v5 and get constant back seating and racial slurs(mainly the N-word) and constantly putting you down cuz you make 1 mistake while the mans do the insane push and do a 1v5 and die and blame everyone for him dying like an idiot. This game is fun when you have 4 other friends for a five stack, solo queuing is bad, dont recommend it unless you want to be called the N-word and proceeded to be spam killed by the teammates because you look funny to them. Honestly make this game not free to play, CS 1.6 was the best. CS:GO in its current state is just unbelievably god awful and playing this game is just a waste of time and money(if you spend the money on skins or prime). DON'T PLAY THIS GAME IN THE CURRENT STATE!"

...an extremely racist and homophobic vocabulary
...free Russian lessons
...anger management issues
...borderline autistic tendencies
...sleep deprivation

10/10 would never uninstall this game and correct my life

24912,"Well, I don't know... This game is still one of my favourites for quite a long time and I think it will stay that way. There would be basically nothing wrong with this game if it didn't have so many cheaters or smurf , but despite that you can still enjoy it if you have prime and at least have 2-3 service medals , because then you are unlikely to get cheated . The graphics of the game are competitive wingman modes are impeccable . I haven't found any major bugs in the game yet except for a couple of hitbox bugs , but maybe I cheated my opponent or I looked in .
The whole point of the game is to enjoy it , but these constant annoyances , why don't you just give up is a bit boring in my opinion , because I don't know why so many people are looking at each other's rank when the point is not to enjoy playing together? I guess I will never find an answer to that , because there are few players who don't care about the other rank , but despite that I still think it is one of the best games ! I recommend it to anyone who is not the rage-preferring type !"

24977,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

25015,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing"

The gameplay is super competitive and fun and it truly relies on skill not luck or pay2win like other shooters. 
The skins are a nice addition, however they only impact the game visually, and the latest updates in the last few years really show that valve do listen to the community.

We sex together. I never before now am tell my mother about gay because i am very shame. As i fock this American boy it is very good to me but also i am feel so guilty. I feel extreme guilty as I begin orgasm. I feel so guilty that I pick up my telephone and call Mother in Russia. I awaken her. It too late for stopping so I am cumming sex. I am very upset and guilty and crying, so I yell her, ""I AM CUM FROM SEX"" (in Russia). She say what? I say ""I AM CUM FROM SEX"" and she say you boy, do not marry American girl, and I say ""NO I AM CUM FROM SEX WITH MAN, I AM IN ASS, I CUM IN ASS"" and my mother very angry me. She not get scared though.

I hang up phone and am very embarrass. My friend also he is very embarrass. I am guilt and feel very stupid. I wonder, why do I gay with man? But I continue because when it spurt it feel very good in American ass."

But no I can clap their cheeks like their mothers. It's quite simple but I enjoy getting these messages it fills my heart with warmth.

25410,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I have been playing non stop for 5 years, not even considering any other game, I have gone through countless of hackers, but noone wanted to make me quit as much as the goddamn toxicity of this community. I honestly hope this somehow gets infront of Valve so they can finally understand that they have to do something about the toxicity. Give stricter bans, or let the default muted players, aka the lowest scale of humans, queue only with other default muted players, to see how shitty this game has become.

25562,"
I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

25779,"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve.
It is extremely difficult, considering you have to wrangle teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies economy, buy the correct 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥 and then aim for the head and spray correctly.

Then there is a bunch of extra 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥 like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜 not.
It's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse.

There's a story that someone was so good with his mouse that he became the mouse.
The mouse permanently fused into his hand. Now he has to use his other hand for certain things.

The game has multiple maps, including dust 2 which is the only map, and Mirage. But mirage...really isn't working these days.

The game will bring you so many fun experiences, like playing a game with Aldon Hilter, as he only buys a Negev and politely refuses to buy anything else. As we lose 14-16, against 4 bots.

This game is fun: In the words of a certain person, this is 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 gameplay

You can play as the the terrorists, and blow 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥 up while praying to the one god, or you can play as the counter terrorists, who counter terrorists' terrorizing terrorism.

Some of the guns are: The deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, and most important and deadliest of all: the decoy grenade.

Not many people know that every decoy grenade is sent from the deepest circles of hell, where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity.

On your journey to become better at this game, you will encounter smurfs, non-bilingual Russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realize that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation, or will at least make you consider that being true.

But the worst of all: people who type ""Nice Try"", after you fail your 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥𝕥𝕪 clutch attempt.

There are a lot of mods for the game, like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, jailbreak and a lot of other stuff.

I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money. Every skin is different and has a different price, ranging from your generic pistol skin, to a 1600 dollar knife skin.

It's a great game, it's also perfectly 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 free: So go get it."

25783,Its good
25784,yes
25785,"after playing it for a small amount i have come to the conclusion that this game is not worth purchasing, not because it is full of cheaters, racists, toxic and annoying people, not for the constant trade scam offers, not for the terrible company who have the worst anti cheat in any gaming history and not because i suck at it, its not worth playing because just like league or dota or overwatch once you fall into the pit of thinking you are getting better there will always be someone to come along and ruin your day, and completely stomp you and you will rage you will cry scream and bleed, and after all that ......... you log back in and load up another match the next day knowing your soul has been claimed by lord Gaben himself.

do yourself a favour dont let this game take your soul, many of us are too far gone i know this because i cant stop spending money on pixels that mean nothing to the real world(besides the lucky people who somehow pull knifes worth more than my simpleton education) this game is pure torture and pure hell but you cannot quit it, you may take a break but i promise it will come lurking back one day and grip your legs and pull you under once again."

25874,"CS:GO is a fun and time-wasting game. A strategic game with pew-pew guns. The game is reasonably and usually addicting and fun, especially with friends. But if you're not playing with friends, the game is somewhat depending on luck when it comes to solo-quing. As you can be queued with toxic players, and others that do not speak English. But it's mostly an enjoyable game and you can even make new friends from around the globe if you'd like. 

What is bad is that if you live in the EU, consider having a rather lot amount of foreign languaged people. (Especially Russians) in your boots. The chance of not coming with one is about 10%. And most does not speak English, at all. 
(F*ck u, Non-England-Speaking-People).

25890,"I recommend this game to your family. If not, now we are all closer than ever before. Running a 5-man squad in your household is better than having to pick up randoms in matchmaking. Your young sister is the entry fragger (she doesn't know much, so let her run in, do something or die to get info on opp). Younger brother will follow up in suit behind Young sister. Mom and Dad are the guards; they will lead you to the right Bomb Site to plant the bomb. If they go out, it's all on you. Managing to clutch the game is coming to a tie. Your family is happier than ever. Your sister got a Dreams and Nightmare case and won an AK-47 l. Nightwish now you all can eat dinner for free. Recommend 10/10 for anyone going through the struggle."

25937,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I bought this games prime upgrade to have a cheater free game. while in the first to matches it worked quite well, I noticed that as I continued playing, my matches turned into cheat fest's. I have never injected, downloaded, or played with cheats nor do I plan to in the future. However the trust factor experience is anything but fair. You pit me against constant cheaters, spinning like they are a helicopter, skull blasting me through solid concrete walls, I have literally no issue with the game itself, but the players and the cheaters ruin it for me. please fix trust factor."

          -You have ""Competitive Cooldown"" until you get your rank at competitive

1) the subject of titles is stupid, I played 2 games ban 1 day it's stupid guys
2)why, when I want to play with a friend, I don't get caught with the same beginners as me, why should I play with players who have a lot of medals, all sorts of skins ""it's not in the schet"", all kinds of boosters and so onp
3) this game is well suited so that after you come as a lady, no matter from school, work, then you can play with friends and relax.
4)Griefers are bad people, Cheaters, but I haven't met them yet. So it's all good

26789,"[h1]If you want to waste 1000+ hours of your life on a shooting game just to be considered an above average from 2012 this game is for you.[/h1]

What does it offer you may ask?

Well we got the horrid ranking system that wont rank you up even if you have a long lasting winstreak (5+) with constant 3-4 mvps every game.

In addition to the horrid ranking system you get the most miserable and mentally handicapped teammates that you can think of, being high/drunk while the enemy team is full party LEM smurf team that spends minimum of 13 hours a day warming up for a single game and has 3k+ hours on every smurf account. Ah and how can i forget the 14 year old cringe teenagers who wasted 15$ just to blatantly cheat on a prime account and say ""mad cuz bad"" ""im legit"" ""im smurfing"" while giving harder one taps than scream in his prime.

If you played other shooters like cod or battlefield when you hear the word recoil you probably think of just moving you mouse a bit down while here you need to learn a specific spray pattern that is unique to every weapon and to master few of 34 sprays you'll need at least few hundred hours.

I forgot to tell you about the most torturing moments you'll experience while trying to kill an enemy, you can see that your crosshair is perfectly alined with the head of your opponent, you're not moving at all, you fire at the perfect time yet the server just dosent feel like reading that and just ignores the hit then the enemy does a 360 no scope and fucking shits on you while you're starring at your screen shocked and screaming to your teammates that you fs hit. You might say that its cuz of my ping being 2 billion but no i was playing at a pretty low 40-50 ping, does valve expect me to sit and live on the server to be allowed to kill an enemy? Yes you can try faceit, where you'll meet the mostly normal part of players, better servers and anti cheat, HOWEVER the players that you're going to go against are a lot better than your usual mm opponents, at least your team is gonna be aight, but you'll probably get shit on again and the whole commands that you have to put into the chat when the game starts and during the game might be a bit too much a new faceit player (i only played like 2-3 games so i cant really be talking much about faceit)

Oh yea and another big thing is how people develop a gambling addiction which thank God i dont have but a lot of people have gotten thru this game, theres a thing called cases each case with the key costs about 3$ on average and the odds of you getting an item that they will profit from is fucking so low that people have tried opening 12k cases and only got 25 knives (they didnt profit at all), but since all of youtube is filled with thousands of vids of people getting knives and stuff everyone wants to try their luck and open one yet they fail on the first try so they do more and more.

I can still go on a lot about how bad this horrid game is, but please dont play it if you want to save your nerves and hours please dont even consider downloading this pile of shit, go read a book, go to the gym, get a job, get a gf, do whatever you want but dont fucking touch this game. Sadly there are people who cant be helped, they are already in their late 20s or even 30s but still play this every day they live from paycheck to paycheck not enjoying the life at all, all their friends are virtual and the only thing connecting them is the same addiction to this game, they dont go out they dont talk or visit their family members at all and have spent most of their lives playing this shit yet saying every game they lose ""im deleting cs"" ""im so done with this game"" then the next day you see them playing again and again, its a never ending loop. If you have more than 2k hours in this or any game please reconsider yours actions, think about all the things you could have achieved, how many languages you could have been already fluent in or how much money you could have made but instead of all that you're stuck playing a 10 year old game that has a horrid community, horrid servers, horrid anti-cheat. Please wake up, a game is not worth spending hundreds of hours just to prove to some random people on the internet that you wont ever meet in your life that you're better at a fucking pixel aim and shooting game. Games are nice, they are an amazing way to chill but games like this that require the user to master every single aspect of it just to be considered above average are not worth the time spent at all. Once again, please do something more productive that just sit in front of your pc clicking pixels and typing ""shit on"" ""get good"". 

At the end all i have to say that say i did have some moments where i truly enjoyed this game but all the stress, rage were not worth those moments, yes i did have a laugh here and there, had some fun time with friends. Just dont get yourself into this rabbit hole of endless aim, spray, smoke, flash practice just to be stuck with braindead teammates, there are tons of other amazing games that you can play, but just please dont play this shit. 

Thank you for reading this long ass shit and for your time.

26842,"I have been playing CS GO since its very release in 2012, which was a fascinating adventure for me and my friends. Winning your first matchmaking game, cluthing the rounds as the whole team relies on you and even your first cheeky knife kill - all of these things bring a smile to my face as I look back on the memories.

However, as the time has progressed it seems as though valve have completely given up on the game, the tick rate on the official matchmaking servers is terrible with hits on the enemies not regestering sometimes, cranky updates and unnecessary changes are what have ruined the Counter Strike for me.

Valve needs to stop worrying about milking this wondeful game with more cases and operations coming out as it seems monthly now and actually adress the issues the game has. No doubt people will still play, and definetly they will still enjoy it as it is an absolute classic, nonetheless it just saddens me to see one of my favourite competitive games being treated like a mobile game with lootboxes.

26876,"A régi viccben egy kakas strucctojással érkezik az ólba. „Tisztelt hölgyeim, nem akarok senkit kritizálni, de azért nézzék csak, máshol mi a teljesítmény!” Nem könnyű feladat a motiváló, de realisztikus visszajelzés: a vezető egyik legfontosabb kommunikációs feladata, hogy tényszerűen, konkrétumokra hagyatkozva mutassa be és fogalmazza meg a helyzetet. A következő lépés, amikor kifejezi az érzéseit a problémával kapcsolatban, ám szigorúan csak azt, amiért a kialakult helyzet dilemmát okoz. Közben nem szabad minősíteni: az adott helyzetet kell értékelni, leválasztva az emberről. Nagyobb problémánál még a megfogalmazott javaslat kölcsönös előnyeit is érdemes taglalni, a folyamat végén pedig le kell vonni a következtetéseket. A beosztott ebben az esetben valószínűleg el fogja fogadni az érvelés helyességét, míg az agresszív kommunikációra ellenségesen reagálna.

26912,"10/10 would swear at people on the internet again.

The games great fun but don't spend money on it until the day Valve sorts out the amount of hackers. 
You will not be able to play more than 3 games without running into one of these people. Join a game and if the person at the top of the leader board is leading by double the amount of the next person down, spectate them for awhile and 9/10 times they will be cheating in some form.
These people have no live's and everyone hates them so calling a kick vote usually works. It does sour the whole experience though as every time you die you will be questioning if it was luck, skill or an F-slur that downloaded a file and thinks that makes them ""hacker mans"".
Get it on special if you really want prime status.

27025,Unless you're playing faceit or a friends server this game is just empty. Everything that has to do with a real person is HvH. It's sad to see this game get like this. Even in DM games players are just botting. I'll see the same names in the same map groups all day and they play like bots. No real human connecton in this game anymore. I don't even think the S2 update can save CS I think it's going out the door.

Don't fall for the trap of buying prime. It isn't anything increasing security, fun, or anything like that. It's the only way csgo can make money anymore. Prime you will get just the season pass for fortnite. Every game will still annoy you, youll always find a 7 year old shooting you through the map. Its the best part of csgo though. Counter Strike wouldnt be Counter Strike if it wasnt for the cheating and the willingness to annoy the most hateful, abusive communitys youll ever be in."

27067,By far the most toxic and pathetic community i have ever experienced in a video game. If you don't have someone who is AFK from the start someone will leave after they get grumpy from getting one shot by an AWP. If that doesn't happen you'll have a teammate shoot you in the leg for giggles. If that doesn't happen someone will constantly berate you for every mistake you could make unless your the top frag. Great Game but everyone that plays it is an absolute mouth breathing troglodyte loser who has never been hugged by their father or felt the warmth of a women's touch 8/10
27068,"game fun skins goood
"
27069,"Its a very fun game & I love the idea of collecting skins. 
However I have three large issues with the game, 

1. I feel like the skill sealing is rather high after the game being around for 20 years it feels like whenever your matching making your getting paired up with people who have the 10 year badge & sweat there balls off on this game. 

2. The casual game is hard to pick up on skills that actually help in comp, casual has way too many people for the maps size, leading to alot of CT pushing to T spawn as if they are playing Terrorists, its not an accurate representation of how the game is played in ranked, so its hard to pick up on skills that actually can be normally used in ranked. 

3. Since its hard to learn the game in casual, jumping into ranked to play the ""proper"" CS tends to lead to frustration since alot of the time, teammates are extremely toxic because you aren't playing as well as the rest of the team, ruining the game since I'm focused on how I'm preforming half the game compared to just having fun, this also leads to me getting kicked occasionally because I can't preform the part. 

The game its self is great however it has a rather steep learning curve for beginners, I wish there was an active game mode that was accurate to how ranked is normally played that isn't dead or full of hackers like non prime comp. 

The reason I'm giving this a recommend is because if you can get past the learning curve the game looks extremely rewarding. I'm rather bad at most games, so getting decent at a game like CS would be much easier for most people. 

If anyone here as an idea to make the game enjoyable or to work around these problems I would appreciate the help"

27164,"This is the hardest game to get into first starting, hands down.
If you don't know a lot of the mechanics people will abuse them to get an advantage above you 100% of the time. bullet spread is the worst and is extremely hard to learn. and the casual experience is one to one with the competitive experience so you won't be able to relax in the slightest playing this game.
It's such a shame that this game has so many flaws as the guns are extremely satisfying to shoot and the gamemodes would be very fun.

I really hate that csgo is getting more attention and craze then any of valve's other titles as it is in my opinion one of the worst games in their library."

27169,"Aging like a fine wine. Is it perfect? No. My experience with games is constant change. Playing something that his so little was very different, but I loved it! There are pros and cons to that just like everything else though. Valve rarely touches things. You can come into this knowing exactly what you're going to get, and come back five years from now with the same idea. Matchmaking is fucked in NA so if you're competitive you're forced onto a third party platform so that's not good. Also, the match making is a box of chocolates just like most games. I've not actually talked about the game itself yet. It's a tactical shooter so there are a series of basic things you can do. Plant/defuse the bomb and shoot the bad guys. The thing that makes this simple concept so good is that the mastery of shooting the bad guys and getting the bomb down are so simple yet complex. There is no constant change to make you think about how to overcome some new bullshit. Just the basics that you have to master. Take your time, you'll be here a while. If you're new, I hope you have a friend though."

27172,"Garbage as usual. I got disconnected after updating the game. Just tried to start a wingman and got dc'ed because of some files that didn't update. And on top of that, this shitty game doesn't even tell me how long I am banned from playing... They charge money for displaying stats, and ban as they choose. What a garbage, and absolutely puke-worthy mindset from devs. Jesus fucking christ, I only wish everyone would ban this game from their inventory."

27289,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Possibly the most addictive, frustrating and satisfying game I've ever played. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years."

27319,Its ok
27320,"Counter strike is synonymous with the multiplayer first person shooter genre. It’s been around since 1999 (or the dawn of time in online gaming terms) and is still being played by millions of people every day. Although the gameplay remains as tight as ever, the dated graphics simply weren’t going to cut it for today’s demanding gamers – enter Global Offensive. It’s a complete overhaul of the game we know and love, with a new game engine, redesigned maps, character models and sounds, new weapons and more accessible game modes.

Valve attempted to update Counter Strike once before with CS:Source. It was incredibly popular, but also inconsistent – many of the intricate details crucial to competitive play were lost in translation, meaning many players stuck with the older game rather than learn new recoil patterns and grenade physics. This latest iteration looks to avoid the pitfalls of the past, combining the graphics of an updated Source engine with the fine tuning and precision of the original 1.6 release.

Counter Strike Global Offensive
As the majority of Valve’s employees are working hard on DOTA2 (and, we hope, Half Life 2 Episode 3) a third party developer has been drafted to help finish Global Offensive. Having worked on Left 4 Dead 2, the franchise is in the good hands of Hidden Path entertainment, who have already implemented a number of rebalancing updates based on player feedback during the open beta.

If you aren’t familiar with how Counter Strike works, you may be surprised that its two main game modes can be found, in one form or another, in almost every team-based fps available today. The most popular is defuse mode, indicated by a map’s DE_ prefix – they pit a team of terrorists, tasked with planting a bomb in one of two locations, against a team of counter-terrorist soldiers who must stop them at all costs.

Counter Strike Global Offensive
Each match is split into a series of rounds, where death means sitting out the clock while your teammates fight on without you. Because there are always two bomb sites to choose from, the counter-terrorists must balance their forces between them to keep them defended. If the bomb gets planted and you fail to defuse it before it blows, that round goes to the terrorists.

Although less popular from a competitive viewpoint, hostage rescue maps (easily spotted by the CS_ prefix) put the terrorists on the back foot, defending a group of AI-controlled hostages from the assaulting counter-terrorist forces.

Two new game modes have been added to Global Offensive, providing extra replay value beyond the gameplay we’ve come to expect from the series. Both are riffs on existing user mods made for the original Counter Strike.

Arms Race is an action-packed instant adrenalin rush, which puts one weapon in your hand and them rewards you with a different one after every kill. It’s a race to the finish, which can make for some hectic and fast-paced games. If you’re killed, you re-spawn instantly, so there’s no waiting around to get back to the action. Demolition combines the weapon awards of Arms Race with the objective-based gameplay of the defusal game type. Here, the challenge is to defeat the enemy team with a series of progressively weaker weapons.

Counter Strike Global Offensive
What makes the game are the maps. Classic ones such as Dust, Aztec, Office, Nuke and Inferno have all been lovingly recreated, with more detail than ever before. New maps too share the same design ethos, with large open areas reserved for the demolition game type and tighter, more compact levels saved for Arms race. Series veterans will love the new looks, as it makes them feel much more lifelike and less like a closed arena.

Counter Strike has always been a thinking man’s shooter, even if it doesn’t appear so on first inspection. It takes a lot of teamwork to get beyond the first hurdle of online play, so you might not get the most out of Global Offensive unless you invest the time. Although Counter Strike introduced many people to online multiplayer games, the refusal to add any significant changes to Global Offensive also makes it feel rather simplistic compared to today’s shooters. Aspects such as rank progression, character customisation and weapon unlocks are all rejected in favour of old school action. However, if you’re yearning for a game that puts more emphasis on tactics and teamwork than lone wolf gung-ho chaos, this is a worthy update that’s well worth your attention."

27447,"Hmm, to be honest it depends on the teammates you get. By that I mean there are wholesome people that make the game fun despite of the outcome, whether it's losing or winning. They don't target someone based on their leaderboard stance because they are out there to have fun. Some of them are idiots but they are fun to play with nonetheless.
Then there are toxic people, they'll pretty much attack you for anything. The extends they can take sometimes make me wonder if they are okay. Playing with them is like if we are always losing, even if the outcome of the match is a win."

But yeah valve better give chance to vote to troll who is happy to see cheater's in the game, i don't see any fair Game Play in future if they don't start think about this..."

Too much hatred and very less understanding community (almost all) to the point, that they hate hackers so much that they start hacking to get back at them, and get VAC banned, and then starts writing a review HERE against hackers...???? what???? Are you kidding me??? Lacking emoticons!!! O.o ^_^

Correct yourself and make the community better! Yes, I do recommend this. You cannot stop hackers unless you can change the attitude!

You are talking about bad community..? We are the community ******!

How to change ourselves: To begin with.. Unfriend your hacker friend first and block him even if he just hacked once. That is just the start and we have miles to go now! Good Luck!

27651,always aim for the head
27652,"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve.
It is extremely difficult, considering you have to wrangle teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies economy, buy the correct 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥 and then aim for the head and spray correctly.

Then there is a bunch of extra 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥 like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜 not.
It's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse.

There's a story that someone was so good with his mouse that he became the mouse.
The mouse permanently fused into his hand. Now he has to use his other hand for certain things.

The game has multiple maps, including dust 2 which is the only map, and Mirage. But mirage...really isn't working these days.

The game will bring you so many fun experiences, like playing a game with Aldon Hilter, as he only buys a Negev and politely refuses to buy anything else. As we lose 14-16, against 4 bots.

This game is fun: In the words of a certain person, this is 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 gameplay

You can play as the the terrorists, and blow 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥 up while praying to the one god, or you can play as the counter terrorists, who counter terrorists' terrorizing terrorism.

Some of the guns are: The deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, and most important and deadliest of all: the decoy grenade.

Not many people know that every decoy grenade is sent from the deepest circles of hell, where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity.

On your journey to become better at this game, you will encounter smurfs, non-bilingual Russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realize that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation, or will at least make you consider that being true.

But the worst of all: people who type ""Nice Try"", after you fail your 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕤𝕙𝕚𝕥𝕥𝕪 clutch attempt.

There are a lot of mods for the game, like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, jailbreak and a lot of other stuff.

I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money. Every skin is different and has a different price, ranging from your generic pistol skin, to a 1600 dollar knife skin.

It's a great game, it's also perfectly 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 free: So go get it."

27710,really good game
27711,Skill Based matchmaking is a joke and so is VAC. I get paired up with low levels all the time even though im silver elite master and apparently being silver two is that skill range. again VAC is a joke cause i got in a game with a dude that was cheating for sure cause i watch replay and he was tracking through walls and had a grand total of 1700 hours in csgo. Its almost impossible to get in a lobby with teamates in your own skill range and same thing with enemies i get paired up with new players while the whole other team has 500+ hours. Game probably wont be good until they use easy anti cheat or battle eye to ban cheaters and fix skillbased so i can have a even match for once.

27820,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

27828,"as much as i love this game, North-american Competitive matchmaking is super broken and unbalanced. i literally made a new steam account and bought Prime status, just to test if MM decides to put me in a ranking higher than silver 2-3. 

the only reason i even decided to test this was because, after ages of grinding competitive mm, my rank doesnt move at all. but for whatever reason, the game placed me as gold nova when i got my rank in wing-man? 

at anyrate, i cannot wait for source2 to come to fruition, and the next saga of counterstrike to begin. and if it wasnt for the original CS and CS:S, and the years of playing over a decade of time, then i would have been discouraged a long time ago when it comes to match making.

love u forever VALVe, but SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH matchmaking is SO imbalanced in NA.

About the torture, rage, uncertainty, fear of this cruel world. About the unspoken truths, the broken promise and the betrayal of backstabbing of this cruel world. Living as you can never escape from this pain and suffering."

27897,"If you are looking for reviews keep scrolling, but if you are looking for a lovely roast chicken recipe, today is your lucky day. 

Ingredients
▢1.75 - 2 kg / 3.5 - 4lb whole chicken , patted dry
▢Salt and pepper
▢2 tsp olive oil
▢1 lemon, quartered
▢3 rosemary sprigs
BUTTER:
▢100 g / 1 stick unsalted butter , melted
▢3 garlic cloves , minced
▢1 tbsp sage , finely chopped (Note 1)
▢2 tsp rosemary , finely chopped (Note 1)
▢1 tbsp parsley , finely chopped (Note 1)
▢1/2 tsp each salt and black pepper
UNDER CHOOK:
▢1 cup / 250 ml dry white wine , or low sodium chicken broth
▢1 onion , quartered (Note 2)
▢1 garlic bulb , halved horizontally (Note 2)
Instructions

Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.
Preheat oven to 220C/450F (standard) or 200C/430F (fan/convection). Put shelf in the middle.
Mix together Butter ingredients. Add juice from 2 wedges of lemon.
Place chicken in a roasting pan. Use a dessert spoon to loosen skin from chicken (see video). Do the top (the breast) and the drumsticks – not the underside.
Prop chicken upright, drizzle butter under skin, using most of the garlic/herb sludge, but saving a bit of butter for the skin (Note 3).
Drizzle / smear remaining butter all over surface of the chicken. Squeeze over juice of 2 lemon wedges.
Stuff used lemon wedges and rosemary inside chicken.
Tie drumstick ends with string and tuck wing tips under the chicken.
Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.
Place onion and garlic in the pan, place chicken on top. Pour wine around, drizzle chicken with oil.
Transfer to oven. Roast for 10 minutes, then turn oven down to 180C/350F (all oven types). Roast for a further 1 hr 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature is 75C/165F or until juices run clear when pierced at the join between the drumstick and the body. Baste twice (30 min then at 1 hr), spooning pan juices over skin.
Rest for 15 minutes – don’t cover, skin becomes wet.
Serve with pan juices (see video for how to carve). I discard onion but use the garlic in the pan. See notes for side suggestions & how to use carcass for incredible homemade broth!"

27939,"Counter-Strike:Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve, it is extemely difficult considering you have to wrangle your teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies' economy, buy the correct sh*t then aim for the head and spray correctly; then there is a bunch of extra sh*t like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the fu*k not; it's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse, there is a story that someone was so good with his mouse, he bacame the mouse, the mouse permanently fused into his hand, now he has to use his other hand for certain things; the game has multiple maps including Dust 2, which is the only map, and Mirage but Mirage just really isn't working these days; the game will bring you many fun experiences like playing with Aldon Hilter as he only buys a Negev and unpolitely refuses to buy anything else as we lose 14-16 against 4 bots; this game is fun in the words of a certain person this is fu*king gameplay: you can play as the terrorists and blow sh*it up while praising the one god or you can play as the counter terrorists who counter the terrorists terrorizing terrorism; some of the guns are: the Deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, but the most important and deadliest of all is the decoy grenade, not many people know that every Decoy grenade is sent from the deepes circle of hell where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity; on your journey to become better at this game you will encounter smurfs, non-billingual russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realise that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation or at least will make you conider that being true, but the worst of all the people who type ""Nice Try"" after you fu*king fail your shi*ty clutch attempt; there are a lot of mods for the game like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, Jailbreak, and a lot of other stuff; I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money, every skin is different and has a different price ranging your generic pistol skin to a 1600$ knife skin; it's a great game, it's also perfectly fu*king free, so go get it."

28016,"csgo is a very interesting game. In the current game industry it is completely different from the newer shooters that game devs come out with. It has a certain uniqueness that has allowed it to maintain a consistent fanbase for a long time. I takes a very short amount of time to kill someone and the game is slightly more strategy based then you may think. On lower ranks it is mainly about how well you aim, but (if) you climb the ranks the game becomes more like a game of chess. Overall I enjoy this game and I may seem difficult at first but as long as you are improving you will eventually have fun"

I'm still waiting for my first knife (pls Gaben I'm begging you)
It is a very cool competetive shooter but it is sometimes unenjoyable because there are a lot of hacker and afk teammates.
Watching professionel Cs is very cool as well specialy if Jame is saving his AWP for the fith round in a row.

All in all it is better then valorant.

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark

I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say

28161,Playing with a higher trust factor helps keep the hackers down. But your still get them. There will be no break from hackers till this dogpoop anti-cheat is fixed or removed for something better. If they don't do that sooner then later this game will all be hackers and nobody left to care but the people who spent hundreds maybe thousands  on there skins. Its a really really satisfying game when you have legit teams that you know 100% arn't sus and getting head shots feels hecka nice. Almost as nice as drinking a big bottle of orange soda.

28201,"CSGO is a right of passage for any FPS lover out there. If you haven't played this game, but claim you are a good FPS player, then I question your assessment of your abilities. This is about as pure a shooter experience as it gets, hence why its had such a long shelf life and still has a huge active player base. Its all about reaction timing.....and a good internet connection....and no hackers......but mainly reaction timing. You flick shot faster than your opponent, you win. Simple! So many shooters have come and gone after this game, yet still they never see just how simple we actually want our online shooting experience. Yes, character abilities and big robot mechs and all that other stuff is fun for a moment, but you can't escape the moments in those games where you come across a mech and unless you have chosen the right class (anti-armour or a mech yourself) you get destroyed without putting up much of a fight. Same with character abilities, if you are a medic but come across an assault class opponent more often than not you are at the disadvantage. Now, I enjoy some of those other games but the point is that they don't have the player numbers like CSGO does and I think the reason why is you die in this game and its almost certainly because of you! You weren't quick enough, not positioned good enough, not paying attention etc etc basically this game requires you to work on your core FPS skills and no other fancy pants additions to the purity that is Be quick or be dead! 

So the TL;DR version of this review is play it, grind it, love it, breath it in and sweat it out with all the rest of the CSGO community and I'm sure you will enjoy it."

28741,"CS:GO is a game you either love or hate. You can have loads of fun grinding this game alone or with friends. It's fun to progress through the ranks and see your movement and aim skill increase over time (chicken collect skills may also increase). It also has a big skin economy where you can find loads of cool skins to play with or invest.

The biggest Problem with CS:GO at this moment is that in the higher ranks you may encounter loads of cheaters. I have seen it all at this point Spinbots, Aimbots, Wallhacks and movement scripts. The amount of cheaters have increased in the past year, and it seems that some of them (also obvious spinbot'ers) are not getting banned. That's the biggest thing the worries me. 

To have a cheater free experience people are moving from CS:GO matchmaking to external platform like Faceit or ESEA. This are services with there own anticheat and ranks.

Despite all of this I would still recommend this game, because it's a fun game to play with randoms or people and just have fun or to grind the game and climb the ranked ladder."

Sometimes i meet cheater but this time I don't meet anyone cheat like before maybe some people use private cheat that i don't know but that's okay, Valve has handled cheats better than before but not enough Valve need update anti-cheat like Faceit AC or Vanguard in Valorant and maybe Valve can block ip address who use cheat like community server in csgo (Ghostcap.com,Wavycsgo.com,Zubat.ru) and that's it.

There was definitely a learning curve I had to get over, but it is probably the best game to get you started on first person shooters for PC. I recommend the game to anyone who is new to PC or just trying to learn MnK. BE CAREFUL TO NOT SPEND A BUNCH OF MONEY ON CASES!!! It can be very tempting so be aware that even though it is small amounts it can add up."

29048,"Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years."

There are still a few hackers active, however they won't be for long. The population of hackers on CS:GO has significantly decreased over the passed few years.

if you have not tried playing CS:GO, come give it a shot; the download is free."

Besides that limiting certain gear to certain maps sucks a lot and only being able to take one type of a grenade is really annoying

Sometimes, when I feel very alone, small and helpless, and the only thing I have the power to do is cry in my room, I join a competitive let's say on Dust 2 or Mirage and in most cases, I instantly feel better after a few rounds of tactical teamplay with the professional teammates the game provides. The people you meet on this game are always very friendly and meet high standards of conversation. Also, I have never, not in a single occasion, had any problems with hacking/cheating players. I think overall Valve has achieved a higher good with this masterpiece of a game.

29379,"I'm going to go ahead and say a few honest things about this game.
It is only fun with friends, or in Deathmatch. If you play in main servers, it will be FULL of hackers. VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) is AWFUL, and they aren't doing much to fix it. However, other game modes like Deathmatch, are relatively cheater-free.
The marketplace is also un-ironically very fun to get into if you have a lot of free time. I made about 20 bucks on the marketplace, also coming out with about 5 skins for each gun. You have to put down like 50 bucks and 3 months before seeing any progress, but its a good introduction into stock/Supply-Demand systems. Keep track on seasons and buy and sell accordingly.

4/10 Overall game
8/10 marketplace (very toxic and gloves are stupid -2)
9/10 with friends"

A tip from me when I started playing counter strike global offensive so I did not understand much for example what to do, what the point of this game is for anything. But I played it anyway to see if it would be fun to play. And I am grateful that I made that decision and now I understand a lot what to do and I think I have become very very good at this game.
