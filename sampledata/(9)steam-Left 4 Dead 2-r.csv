3,perfect
4,"let me be perfectly clear here, this is a masterpiece of a game, it is 100% worth the money, just be wary of the very toxic online community and if you can play with friends. but that isnt why im leaving a negative review
the reason is that out of the blue the game decided to stop launching on steam at all, i have tried restarting steam, restarting my pc, verified game file integrity, checked for windows updates, etc, NONE of these measures have done anything meaning this game no longer works and i have no f#cking idea why and how to fix it, steam support has not been helpful at all
if anyone has idea's on how to fix this issue feel free to comment here, until i can actually play the game i payed for again this review will stay negative."

10,"I am a 49 yo dad, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 18 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2019 from his cousin, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had over 70 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character (Louis) and started playing but I was too old for modern technologies so I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and we also spend time outside the house together as well. unfortunately in 2021 my son got COVID-19 and we lost his battle. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything and Those we have held in our arms for a little while, we hold in our hearts forever. Left4dead2 has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.."
11,"When I started playing this on Xbox when it came out its super fun especially with coop, on PC its even better because of mods so it can be customized to your liking."

76,"In retrospect while I may have been greedy and optimistic for something new, in a comparison Back 4 Blood would have never stood a fucking chance against this thing. Please watch ""Back 4 Blood proves Valve carried Left 4 Dead"" on youtube by Crowbcat. Not only will it show you just how much of a bland, awful mess of a game Back 4 Blood is, it will make you reappreciate how ahead of its time this game was. 

Remember when Valve would just up and make some of the best games of all time without barely even trying? Those were the days."

I managed to ride 2 roller coaster so I was able to get 2 new games. They were the original Ghostbusters game, and Left 4 Dead 2. I absolutely loved this game, so simple (at the time), and amazing with friends. As the years go on, this game stays being a masterpiece. My friends always talk about what makes games great, and we all keep saying that even the most simple things can satisfy the most picky gamers"
106,"You either gonna have time of your life, or get cyberbullied. 10/10"
107,"One of my first Steam games and my go to coop game for years. Steam must not have been counting hours in the early days because there's no way I ONLY have 127 hours in. Coming back all these years later I have to mention, the game still holds up well. Graphics are good, the Hard Rain level is still incredibly impressive and I feel like it really needs an award for being the best Zombie Shooter that's ever been made. Don't get me wrong, Killing Floor 2 is really really good but it just doesn't have the same intensity that this game provides. Not sure why nobody else has really been able to master hordes of enemies that go down easy but its obviously the best way to do it. I always thought it was weird how quickly they came out with this sequel and then, nothing. Apparently Back 4 Blood is its spiritual successor and after replaying this I'm going to have to find a copy of that game and give it a try.

Another thing I was happy to find upon replaying this game is that the modding community has been going gangbusters over the last decade. It's pretty awesome to see Duke Nukem, Spiderman, Ashley Williams and Harley Quinn running around as a team fighting zombies together. Really not much else to say, playing with other people is far more enjoyable but not required and aside from taking med kits way before they need to the AI is pretty good. Plus the price is right, there's really no reason not to give it a try. Note L4D 1 is also really good but this game has all of the levels and characters from that game so there's really no reason to go back to the first one."

What matter is that this game is so timeless, that you can still compare it to games made today (2022) and it throws punches. I wish there was Left 4 Dead 3 on VR or something. Because this franchise just works."

156,funni game :D
157,"the best zombie game ever made (to me).
yeah cod zombies exists, but this one has always just appealed more to me.
you can team up with 3 of your friends and just go hog wild.
the gameplay/control feels good, as usual for valve games.
all the missions are fun in their own right, and there wasn't one that i hated.
the game looks good to this day, despite this game being over a decade old at this point.
and that's not even all, there's a shit ton of mods you can get from the workshop, like custom skins, to straight-up new missions!
i cannot recommend this game enough if you are yearning for some co-op games to play with your friends. it's already pretty cheap normally (10 USD), but during sales where it's 2 USD? I cannot recommend it enough."

173,gg
174,One of the better zombie slaying games :)
175,very many yessers
176,"Lasagna and Garlic Bread. I recommend
"
177,good stuff
178,"Yeah, da good game."
179,"Left 4 Dead 2 is easily one of my top video games, ever.

The campaigns alone are such a joy to replay countless times again and again. And once you're bored with those, you can search the workshop for some incredibly well made custom made maps. They can be difficult at times but that's one of the reason to play them since they pose challenges different from the base game. Other modes to choose from like PvP and Survival are there for you as well. Wanna shake up the rules a little? Activate a couple of mutations to spice things up.

Even if you get bored of the regular dark, moody look of the game, the workshop is there for you to turns things all kinds of weird. The workshop offers all sorts of cool, cute and hilarious cosmetic changes to props and models that just make the game that much more amusing. Wanna turn your teammates into anime girls? Go right ahead. Wanna beat zombies to death with a giant lollipop? I can't say for sure, but you could probably do that too :p

Since this game is over a decade old, there are some things here that wouldn't fly with today's standard of games. Badly smoothed maps will cause your character to get caught on the stupidest, smallest of shit that will often times result in you getting killed if you're running from an enemy. Subpar A.I teammates will never fail to let you down when you're pinned by an enemy and they won't hesitate to burn themselves alive in a fire and make you watch. It's hard to overlook these flaws but remember that this game came out in 2009. Standards were much different back then. Is any of this going to change or be improved? No. Valve have got better, newer things to worry about.

However, that shouldn't discourage you from playing this masterpiece. I've had hours and hours of fun alone and with friends, enjoying the wonder of killing zombies. Left 4 Dead 2 has etched itself into video gaming history as one of the greatest games on the face of the earth. It's not even expensive. Give it a go.

Oh and don't bother with Left 4 Dead 1. It's obsolete."
180,very fanny game yes buy for you and friends play much very good
181,"I have been playing the Left 4 Dead series since it first came out and is a dear childhood game to me. It has always been a great experience, even with the issues and annoyances. Being able to mod it on Steam in a way that is extremely easy makes it even more fun with friends. I will always recommend this game to people."

183,yes

185,Still Fun after over 10 years of Zombie killing

188,"I am a 97 year old pet owner, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single caretaker to my labrador, who is now 2. My dog recently downloaded L4D2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my dog, as he is always outside chasing the neighbours cat or just watching twerking videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my dog for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my dog since my paint stopped drying. This game has ever since brought my dog and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my dog many happy memories."

198,"I definitely don't share all these enthusiastic reviews (98% positive). Since this game came in late 2000-s, I don't really think these graphics is bad or something like that. It still looks good enough not to have your eyes bleed. It also runs smoothly on almost any system regardless of vram

The main question is: what's the point of playing it now? We already have some games like WWZ and b4b, and the only reason why they are dead is lack of modding. L4d1/2 has it's best benefit- fuскing huge base of modders content. Yet it's not the feature that must attract people in game
This recoil and weapons just feel like woodsticks with some fire and obsolete sound's (same as in cs:go) 
Maps... They are simple and straight af. They may feel interesting first 1-3 times played, but after that- no sense in re-running them again and again (even having ""gReAt DirEcToR fEaTure"")
Coop? It's shit. Random dudes always act as if they're fockin tired of every shit they do. And for some reason all their anger is being outpoured on you (play bad? - get fucked. Ask for help?- get fucked. Mic is off?-get fucked. Mic is on?- get fucked)

So. Only reason to play it now js moddable content and friends. This game is really obsolete in almost every way."

221,"Phenomenal game, amazing co-op experience, fast & engaging gameplay, endless replay-ability with the help of workshop mods. This game is legitimately a no-brainer. If you still haven't played Left 4 Dead 2, you're seriously missing out on one of the best zombie games ever made to this day (imo).

I adore this game, have many great memories with it both on console and on PC. Get it."
222,"Left 4 Dead 2 is not a perfect game, but it's far from a bad one! In fact, it's quite the journey, and a 4 player masterpiece that will likely outlive several Live Service games."
223,fun
224,nevr ending fun
225,BEST ZOMBIE GAME EVER
226,"amazing game its a classic worth a try 
"
227,fun game
228,"To put how I feel about Left 4 Dead 2 in a nutshell, it's an insanely fun co-op game that can be enjoyed solo, which is something not a lot of co-op games can do. Also the workshop support makes the whole experience ten times better."
229,"This game can be funny, overly horny, super serious, or vanilla. The best horde shooter to this day, even though Valve still can't count to 3."
230,Good Zombie game
231,"1 is better than 2, Reason being is In Left 4 dead 1 You can see your legs if you look down, in left 4 dead 2 you can't even see them, In left 4 dead 1 you can walk over the ledges, in left 4 dead 2 you can't even walk over ledges, The AI in left 4 dead 1 is  sometimes better, the AI in left 4 dead 2 is not great they just follow you, In left 4 dead 1 Whenever there is a special infected It will the play the music, in left 4 dead 2 it's delayed and sometimes silent, In left 4 dead 1 The It has Ragdoll physics like if a survivor dies or falls off, In left 4 dead 2 The survivors don't even turn into a Ragdoll even when you fall in water your body just sinks, i know a lot of People in the comments are going to say Well I think 2 is better than 1 because in left 4 dead 2 you can install mods, just to clarify I don't like to see mommy milkies, It's your opinion if you like Left 4 dead 1 or 2."
232,The fish approves.
233,this game pretty good i dint find anything bad about it.

265,"I originally got this game from my friend who wanted it for garrys mod content(then realized how fun it was) it was an amazing time and helped give us something else to do now here is my review:

This is a fantastic game where it is cheap with tons of content. I am going to go through each seperate part of the game which makes it so good

Graphics:
As for all old Valve games for its time this game looks wonderful (however blood and gore in zombies is overdone quite a bit such as a pistol shot causes there leg to explode or top front skin to disappear)
The campaigns are well made graphic-wise and The atmosphere is just...wow

Requirements:
Can run  on most mid machines sometimes on low tier but the crazy scenes will cause lag

Gameplay:

Absolutely fantastic. The entire point in the campaigns is really go from point A to point B but its well done.each campaign has a certain amount of parts each part a point  A to point B except the last part which has a special goal(such as survive a certain amount of time or fuel the engines)then they end.There are around a dozen campaings an hour each and are easily replay-able There are a ton of guns and other weapons to find and choose from as well as different grenades.The most interesting part is the fact that there are 4 playable characters and extras(because your friends can take the place of some and unless you activate something that disables them)will become AI'S which will help you.The zombie hordes go from a few to a couple dozen to what feels like HUNDREDS which gets REALLY confusing and difficult.

Story:

This is A game mainly for its gameplay the story however is not worth it it gets confusing and ends abruptly but the campaigns from both 1 and 2 are in here meaning you get double the content
  
Community:

Dont look in the community it is BEYOND toxic and the Online co-op is filled with cheaters modders and players who will kill you and leave you for dead because you accidentally damaged allies while blinded so just play with your friends thats all you need

Conlusion:
Great game recommend to all players but CAUTION PLAYERS WHO ARE SENSITIVE TO BLOOD OR INTENSE LANGUAGE AVOID THIS TITLE"

so be humble,..if you good, it doesn't mean you better than other
it's mean you have responsibility to carry or help other

Although, it's not the best welcoming community due to veterans having a tendency to kick new players due to their knowledge of the game, but the replays, unique runs because of an AI Director, crazy mods you can install yourself like the Shrek Tank, memes gone to the L4D Universe or even, anime mods! I really recommend this for new and squad players. You don't need gems, or in game currency to buff your character, the game is balanced by everybody. It all comes down to cooperation, there are servers that buff up the game. I've played this game since I was a kid and this is one of the games I will never get tired of."

455,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.

511,"I would absolutely recommend playing this is you were a fan of the games on the Xbox 360! 
I had all of the achievements for this game when I played it originally and working to get them again has ben a fun, nostalgic challenge. :D

The main downside is that since this is on Steam, there are a lot of hackers/griefers which can immediately ruin your experience due to aim botting, speed hacking, etc. 

Outside of getting achievements or playing online with friends, I would say to try and avoid playing the Versus game modes unless you're okay with dealing with random cheaters.

Regardless, it's still really fun and the option to mod stuff is always neat!"

[*]- Not the friendliest community[/list]

[b]Total:[/b]
An excellent cooperative action game for 4 players (and more - on modified community maps), in which you can have fun in the company of friends / casual acquaintances.
A lot of maps give you the opportunity to try yourself in a variety of scenarios, from classic difficulties to a real apocalypse, when several dozen Tanks attack you at the same time.
Unfortunately, sometimes the game is spoiled by the players themselves - which deliberately destroy the allies.
The game is recommended for the acquisition and passage of a fun company."
539,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game even all these years later, it's always fun to jump in with some friends and play the campaigns, and the amount of workshop support in this game is insane too, you can make anybody and anything into basically whatever you want.
The only bad part about this game in my opinion is the Versus gamemode (Which personally I play alot of) because around 70% of the community are very toxic people that are not welcoming new players."

577,"I used to think this game was nice when I was younger.
After playing it years later, I came to the conclusion that not only this game isn't as nice as people remember, it actually sucks a lot.
The maps are terribly designed. The game itself is supposed to have a linear campaign, but the maps are too badly designed for the player to know where's he's supposed to go. Only after a lot of trial, hitting a dead-end, turning back and getting swarmed, you'll come to understand the maps and actually have some enjoyment from it. ""Just adding more zombies to the maze"" isn't a solution for difficulty escalation either.
Having to play your entire game to only then have fun playing it is a very bad design choice.
I used to like this game, now I regret buying it for my friend. It sucks ass and only now I came to this conclusion. This game has clearly been made lazily.
Screw you, Valve."

I felt like there's nothing much more to it innit its just a very old game that everyone has or knew about it.Anyways its a shout buying this game only when its on Steam Sales or else its not worth buying the full price. :) -BIG.D-"

611,"Love this game. Used to play it in my local computer shop back when I was a kid. Now here I am, still playing. (I CAN FINALLY PLAY IT ALONE I WAS SO SCARED OF THE WITCH AND THE TANK WEDLKHEJWL) 

When I saw it on sale, my eyes and my wallet went wide open. 

10/10 The nostalgia and the (kinda) easy game mechanics made this teen like shooting games 👌👌"
612,"My team was winning, not by much...a couple hundred points. The other team had quite a few ""questionable"" shots. Through a wall the instant you spawned as a Boomer, killing you while charging straight at them even though there was very little breathing room, picking a Hunter out of mid air with pistols at a crazy distance... (They were by the tent at the beginning of dead center 2 and they managed to pistol kill a Hunter trying to get away by pouncing down the street. Hunter was near the police car down there.)

Whatever. Spectating them looked as though they were always getting headshots, but they *were* missing from time to time. All of them grabbed pistols and sniper rifles whenever they got the chance.

Scores stayed pretty even until the finale of Dead Center. My survivor team played first and we managed only 5 cans. We had a NONSTOP horde. I literally mean nonstop once the finale started. To our discredit, we did play kinda sloppy.

Anyway, 5 cans. We figured they'd need at least 8-9 to beat us.

Cue their finale. No zombies. I mean...none. It was like the Last Man on Earth mutation and I'm not exaggerating either.

But the kicker was...

When they all noclipped and flew up to the top of the mall out of reach of any of us on the infected side. Nick flew to a gas can, poured it in, and suddenly, they had 13 cans in. Full points. They all flew back to the car, and they won the round. It happened in a matter of seconds.

Why are people such losers!?
Fix this game, VALVE!!!

End of rant."

(download the shrek tank addon, it replaces the tank with shrek and it plays allstar by smashmouth during the fight)"
621,"This game is a classic Xbox 360 first person zombie shooter. Very enjoyable with and without mods. Easy to mod through the steam workshop, makes customizing your experience much easier in the long run. Personally this is a game I've put at minimum 1,000 hours into between PC and Xbox and the additions of game modding, character modding, and even sound modding, has helped keep me coming back to play over a decade later. I recommend the Tank Run lobbies especially (in the mutations tab) because in times where I was not able to play with me friends, I found new ones in there. 10/10 game. Even though it's barely had updates in the last few years my enjoyment has not faded and I'm sure any newcomers to the game will also feel the same if not similar!"

833,amogus plays when i heal
834,Still one of my favorite co-op shooters of all time. Prepare yourself to fight against the horde with friends and npc's. It can be very challenging at times where you'll need to rely on your friends to help you. If you want to have a relaxing and fun social experience shooting zombies then this is the game for you.
835,You gotta love it when you throw boomer bile and a hoard of fall guys swarms it then you get strangled by goofy all while senator armstrong charges your friend and a tank that looks like thanos kills the rest of you off.

859,good
860,"I grew up playing a lot of Left 4 Dead on the Xbox 360. It's nice to come back to it after all these years have passed. It's a great game. The only reason you shouldn't have already played this...is if you didn't have a PC or Xbox during the time. Still in 2022..this game is great. Also, playing it with mods has added even more fun to this already great game. Was more than worth the money. 

My only issue with the game (Which might not be an issue with others.) is that it doesn't come with splitscreen built into the base game. My sibling and I were trying to relive the L4D days while adding mods. It's great there are even mods to fix that issue. 

tl:dr 
It's Left 4 Dead. You should know what it is...you shouldn't be reading reviews. You should be playing it. No one should even have to recommend this. lol"
861,this is one of the zombie games of all time
862,"great game, classic multiplayer fps"
863,ppc
864,The modding comm is the best part of this game get already
865,There's a suitcase full of pistols and money~

877,game good
878,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a classic 4 Player Co Op or Solo Zombie Survival, the Normal Modes you go Point A to Point B and in the final level of each stages you have to survive, or played Survival to time how long you can last.

Thanks to Workshop the Game have more replayability time and time again, you can change the models, sounds music and etc. Getting tired of same old L4D2? no worries just boot up Workshop and explore the Addons world.

in a nutshell L4D2 is a great game to play with Friends XD"

935,"The game has multiple options you can choose.

Survival, Campaign, Versus ETC.

The difficulty levels are fairly balanced. But one problem is each difficulty has a friendly fire percentage that makes all players angry.

One advantage for this game is that it has ALL LEFT 4 DEAD 1 MAPS COMBINED WITH LEFT 4 DEAD 2 MAPS. So you do not even have to download Left 4 Dead 1 because this game has just the maps for it."

This game is incredibly broken in its final state, which is a total shame since this game used be a GOAT. Patches appear to have ruined this game."

993,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

1000,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

I hope you know that.

Walter, Junior...

you're my big man.

There are...



There are going

Happy Birthday.

Look at that.

That is veggie bacon.

Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol.

You won't even taste
the difference.

What time do you think
you'll be home?



Same time.

I don't want him dicking
you around tonight.

You get paid till 5,
you work till 5, no later.

Hey.

- Happy Birthday.
- Well, thank you.

You're late... again.

There was no
hot water... again.

I have an easy fix
for that.

You wake up early,

and then you get to be
the first person in the shower.

I have an idea.

How about buy
a new hot water heater?

How's that idea?

For the millionth
and billionth time.

- Did you take your Echinacea?
- Yeah.

I think it's getting better.

What the hell is this?

It's veggie bacon.
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

Not me.
I want real bacon.

Not this fake crap.

Too bad.

Eat it.

This smells
like Band-aids.

Eat... it.

So, how's it feel
to be old?

How does it feel
to be a smart ass?

Good.

Eat your veggie bacon.

- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

Chemistry.

It is the study of what?

Anyone?

Ben.

- Chemicals.
- Chemicals!

No!

Chemistry is...

Well, technically,

chemistry is
the study of matter.

But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

Now just...
just think about this.

Electrons.

They...

change their energy levels.

Molecules.

Molecules change
their bonds.

Elements.

They combine
and change into compounds.

Well, that's...
that's all of life.

Right? I mean, it's just...
It's the constant.

It's the cycle.
It's solution,

dissolution, just over
and over and over.

It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

It is fascinating, really.

Chad...

Is there something
wrong with your table?

Okay.
Ionic bonds...

Are you done?

Ionic bonds.

Chapter 6.

And 2, 3 makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

Here's your receipt,

and hand this claiming disc
to your car wash professional.

Thank you.
Come again.

He's not coming.

He said he quits.

I'm gonna run
the register.

Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

I'm shorthanded, Walter.

What am I to do?

Walter?

What am I to do?

Hey, Mr. White!

Make those tires
shine, huh?

Oh, my God.

You would not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

Mr. White...

from Chemistry.

Surprise!

Happy Birthday, Dad!

You're so very late.

Really, I'm serious,
Skyler.

I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

You look awesome.

She's not showing
at all, is she?

She's showing
a little.

Carmen, this is
my sister Marie.

- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

Glock 22.
It's my daily carry, okay?

I mean, unless you're talking,
what, plus, B-plus loads,

you can forget
the 9-mil, all right?

I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

Yeah, the way you shoot.

If you're gonna
bring a gun,

you gotta bring
enough gun.

.40 caliber.

- This is awesome right here.
- Nice, isn't it?

Dad, come check
this out.

- Yeah, I see it.
- Come on, take it.

Check it out, Walt.

No, no,
it's just heavy.

That's why they hire men.

It's not gonna
bite you, all right?

Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up,
listen up, listen up!

I'm gonna give a toast.

A little toast to my brother-in-law.
Come here.

Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin,

but we're not gonna
hold that against you.

Because your heart's
in the right place, man.

Your heart's
in the right place.

We love you, man.
We love you.

Everybody!
To Walt!

Na zdorovje!

Na zdorovje!

Hey,
turn on Channel 3.

At which point we apprehended
three individuals

and placed them into custody.

I'm proud to say
the outstanding

professionalism
of my fellow agents

at the Albuquerque
District Office

resulted in
a substantial amount

of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.

Were any shots fired?

No, ma'am. Our agents took
the suspects by surprise.

Damn, the TV does
add ten pounds.

Ten pounds?

Hey, sit and spin.
Both of you.

- Hank.
- What?

Sorry.
You didn't see that.

So charming.

This is clearly
an ongoing operation,

one which was
well organized...

Hank, how much
money is that?

It's about 700 grand.
That's a pretty good haul, huh?

As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

But that's unusual,
isn't it, that kind of cash?

Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

It's easy money...

until we catch you.

Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

Get a little excitement
in your life.

Well, someday.

Which one's this?

That faux-Lalique vase

I picked up
at the Super-Swap.

How's it doing?

I met my reserve,

and there's still
two minutes.

What's up?

You tell me,
birthday boy.

Oh, hey, so what's up
for Saturday?

Car wash.

Bogdan says
he needs me.

Until what time?
Noon? 1-ish?

Probably 2,
more like it.

And then what
after that?

Actually...

I was thinking
of driving

up to Los Alamos.

The visitor center
has an exhibit on...

It's really supposed
to be...

- You're not gonna paint?
- I'll paint.

It's just that this...

part of this exhibition on the...

Mars Rover
photographs are...

The detail really is just
supposed to be amazing.

It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

I mean, the sooner that
back bedroom gets finished.

And I'd do it myself, except
you said you don't want me

- standing on the stepladder.
- I'll paint. I will paint.

What is going on
down there?

- No, it's just...
- Is he asleep?

No, It's nothing.
You know, just...

You know,

we gotta be careful
about the baby.

Don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

We are just
doing you tonight.

So just close your eyes.

Relax, and let it...

- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

There you go.

That's it.

That's it.

There you go.

Keep it going.

Keep it going.

Keep it going.

Keep... Yes!

56!

This is so embarrassing.

I am fine. Honestly.

It's just some bug
going around.

First my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

It's just like
a chest cold.

Could be some
low blood sugar as well.

I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning, honestly.

Hey, listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you just...

drop me off
at a corner somewhere?

No. Sorry.

It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

Take a couple
of deep breaths for me.

Is there anybody you want us
to contact for you?

God, no.

Lean forward for me,
would you?

Mr. White,
are you a smoker?

No. Never.

Why do you ask?

Mr. White.

Mr. White?

Yes.

You understood what
I've just said to you?

Yes.

Lung cancer.
Inoperable.

I'm sorry...

I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

Best-case scenario,
with chemo,

I'll live maybe
another couple years.

It's just...

you've got mustard
on your...

Right there.
Mustard, there.

Right there.

So my records show
that I paid it,

and I certainly don't
feel that we owe any late...

All right.

Well, I'll check
with the bank

and maybe the post office,

if they lost it or something.

Yeah, let me look
into that.

Okay.

Thank you.

Did you use
the MasterCard last month?

15.88 at Staples?

We needed printer paper.

Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

Okay.

So how was your day?

Oh, I don't know.

I don't know.
It was, um...

It was fine.

Come on. I'm shorthanded.
I need you to do some wipe-downs.

- Come on.
- What?

I said I need you outside
to do some wipe-downs.

1025,"""Alright, let's put on our game faces. They're comin'!""

This in-your-face, “apocalypse in action” scenario is further bolstered by the addition of vicious melee weapons like crowbars, axes and katanas. Regardless of how good you are, at some point there’s gonna be a wall of zombie flesh up in your shit, scratching and pounding without rest. Normally you’d have to shove them back, shoot and turn to help your friends out. Now you can swing blindly and chop these guys into bloody stumps. Seriously, the blood and gore are much, much nastier this time around.

The amped intensity, combined with new guns, items and infected, would have made for a strong successor. But Valve didn’t just push the “sequel” button and give us the same shit on a different day."

1050,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

1350,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

I got back on this once I got a gaming PC (literally bought the bundle yesterday), and jeez did this game age so good.

1437,"Just hordes rushing at you ALL the time. 

You can only carry one weapon (+pistol) and the hundreds of zombies charging at you mean you need something that fires incredibly fast. So most weapons are useless, you need SMG/AR. I guess with more than one player you might split roles and have some fun coordinating... maybe? , but solo it's plain boring."

"
1484,"This game is the pure definition of fun! As a long time player of Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 I can say it is worth the money. After playing this game for 11 years on Xbox it was still a blast every time I loaded into a match, The characters are very memorable too! I can definitely say that this game is a masterpiece just like Half Lifes 1 and 2 . And this game is definitely better on pc, you can add so many things from the workshop that keep the game fresh and feeling new all the time! I'll give it a 10/10, be sure to buy it and play it with friends."
1485,"really good game to go from point A to point B while killing zombies with a lot of replayability as no game is the same as the last , very chill game , fun and can be really interesting with mods and add-ons . also needs a lot of focus and team coordination for advanced and expert difficulties .

1546,"This game is a classic! I've been playing since the original Left 4 Dead was released on Xbox 360. The computer version is best only because you get all of the DLC maps with it. It makes a world of difference, as well, when people are actually team players and help with the game. 3rd party servers are the coolest and really make the game interesting. 

10/10 - Will always purchase and play"

The workshop adds so much variety to the game and it definitely makes the gameplay more fun. Also, L4D2 is always on the list whenever there are sales going on and it is highly recommended to buy it during sales"

1636,"Sadly, I do not like Left 4 Dead 2. Unlike most Valve games, Left 4 Dead shows it's age from the get-go. The graphics are poor, the gameplay is boring, and the best parts of these games is simply the mods and modding community. Without mods, this game would be nothing other than an extremely over-praised tech demo."

1880,"zombi, very fun game i recomen"
1881,very good game
1882,"Fine. 72/100 is what I’d give this game. It kinda' matches my achievements percentage. I don't need any more achievements from this particular game tho, since the rest is competitive ones and I don't play vs-modes in games.
      75/100 for the Fun and variety - let's grab the weapons and let's roll, let's crush the zombies, the Shotguns, the Tank, the M60, the AK-47, military sniper, molotovs, hell, yeah...! 
      89/100 for the Community - players, mods. Most players are good people, at least they play well and behave adequately. There are trolls, but it's rare. It is one idea more frequent than usually though, this game has versus and games with it have times bigger count of trolls and I mean, you might encounter those even in solo & coop games, but this is just the way it is, ehh. Mods are fine, everyone can find s.th. for himself, would it be just some cosmetics or hard-modding. I use just like 1/1000 of the mods of the workshop, but this is just what I need. If it was for the global conversions & custom maps, the 89/100 assessment 'd be like 40-50/100 tho. I mean, Valve have failed to balance the game well, what to say for just some rookie ""pro-player"" modders?
      44/100 for the difficulty balance (58/100 for coop & 30/100 for solo) - with the madness that special infected can cause, game simply loses some value, especially when it comes to jockeys and smokers, that totally mess up with the gameplay. You can be dragged and smashed, pulled, pounced, cornered, entangled, ridden till death, thrown out-of the map out of the nothing, overwhelmed and so on. Trust me, just start with easy, then normal, after that advanced, and aaafter that expert and mb other game modes. This really isn't the type of game you want to keep playing solo all-the time as well. I wonder, why, instead of fixing some glitches that help bypassing the madness of this game, don't you, dear L4D staff go fix those friendly AI and mb give them some more advanced capabilities, like being able to use melee, instructing them to stay/follow, use grenades and such? Huh? Why should I use mods for this thing? Come on, you can do way better with your updates. In fact, what kills the balance partially comes from the vs-mode. Devs try to make game more-balanced for all (solo, coop, vs), which kills the balance of each one separately. If the game had no versus mode, it would likely feel better.
      50/100 is what I'd give to Steam's counting playing hours. Seriously, I have 300-400 hours overall and I am tired of my afk-time during solo & menus being counted as playing hours, ROFL. Wake up, Steam, is it Valve doing this?
      88/100 is for Picture quality & beauty - it is very good for a game with those years (It's from 2008-L4D1 and 2009-L4D2)
      70/100 is for Options & basic tweaking - they are partially fine, but there are some important features lacking. Why the hell should I randomly be sentenced to play as a female character??? They could easily avoid that and create more characters/change game lore a bit, so that I can always chose what to play, I am a boy, damn, I don't want Rochelle/Zoey. And why can't I tweak light properly, I don't wanna be blinded by sun rays. FPS-options are mostly fine tho. And trust me, remove ALL film grain. It is garbage.
      67/100 for the Sounds & music. Believe it or not, the 33/100 I take away is mainly for the survivors talking trash. Even worse, there are mods like vox, which allows players to trashtalk at will via character quotes and spam cries, blabbing, taunting, lying and whatsoever and with such a mod in the hands of trollish people, game becomes worse. There is a mod that mutes every single survivor separately and you can use just subtitles, but even it has some sharp weaknesses and issues.
      With the above being said, playing this game with 100+ ping is an innaturally bad idea, so press that tab button and if the connection isn't fine in the borders of 20 seconds, you'd better either fix your internet/stop all downloads & uploads, or just instantly leave the game. Not kidding, I mean, this game might seem irresponsive at times even when you are hosting, not to mention when ping is high. Pushing the shove button/cutting melee leading to nothing is typical, you still might be downed from a hunter, hanged by a smoker, ridden by jockey and more $h1t like that. Funny, isn't it? Or well...is it?
      For now, I can give L4D some pause, playing it less intensively from now on and play some other, better games. Might do some Realism- & Mutation games from time to time, but can delay that as well. Game isn't too hooking. It's mediocre for solo and between fine and good for coop. If it wasn't for the community of players, game wouldn't be as ""progressive""."

2042,"The game is a classic that stands the test of time, though that could admittedly be nostalgia talking. Graphics remain beautiful; the gunplay feels smooth and offers a better degree of tension than Back 4 Blood; the carefully crafted animations and degree of environmental interaction make the world feel more alive and ""real"" than many modern games. The fact that it can run so well on modest (by modern standards) hardware just makes it a no-brainer of a buy."
2043,zombie
2044,good good
2045,That's ten bucks and about 160 hours of my life I don't even want back.
2046,"One of the best zombie games hands down. I find myself coming to this game all the time if I'm bored or if I have nobody to play with. The game offers a singleplayer option but mainly encourages multiplayer and teamwork over all else. It is genius how they get the player to play cooperatively and be a good teammate. Sure, there's gonna be the occasional person who knows all the strats and just runs ahead and quits anytime they die, but usually people are very helpful.

This game does zombies differently than other games and it is one of the only zombie games that seems to try to make things interesting. It presents itself as if you were playing a movie, and these movie details are found everywhere, the poster loading screens, spotlights, and overall the somewhat cheesy zombie flick feeling. However, this game is anything but cheesy if you ask me. Most zombie games focus on either action or enforcing a feeling of vulnerability, Left 4 Dead does both. For the most part you are seemingly an unstoppable killing machine to the common infected, mowing down several zombies in just a few shots, but that's why the special infected exist. The special infected are the main show in the game, they designed either to savagely tear your health away shockingly quickly or they are designed to separate you from your team. All of them are completely counterable on your own, however the massive hordes of zombies and the other specials around will likely catch you off guard and prevent you from countering them.

The map design in this game is excellent and very smart, it carries the typical valve principle of combining realistic areas with otherworldly scenarios, in this case it is a road trip from Savanna Georgia down to New Orleans. There are 6 campaigns, each of which are divided into about 5 or 6 separate short levels that are usually quite diverse, and all of them are pretty interesting and usually have some kind of overall theme or gimmick. 

Dead Center is the introduction and also the most forgiving campaign, giving you any weapon you want halfway through, The Passing is a short but sweet sendoff to the old L4D1 survivors, Dark Carnival is generally the most iconic campaign with the most unique assets and memorable setpieces, Swamp Fever is... a swamp, Hard Rain is a testament to valve level design by travelling through several notable areas and returning through them in a hurricane with different routes to avoid being slowed by the water, and the Parish is a continuous series of tests of what you've learned throughout the game as well as a masterful display of storytelling.

Left 4 Dead 2's gameplay loop is very fun and replayable with the randomize weapon spawns and the powerful game director AI that changes the levels on the fly to adjust the map to your performance, giving you usually enough, but not necessarily generous either. I would recommend this to anyone who loves zombie games and also loves extremely fast-paced gameplay."
2047,worth the Price Imo
2048,gud game
2049,I'm not really sure if I can recommend this game yet to other players because I have only played around 1.5K hours to date and need to spend a bit more time checking it out! :)

2052,"its a good game my friend told me to buy this game before his anime waifu died and then we played and we killed all the zombies and it was very fun and my friends fetus son who has 10000 hours on csgo really likes this game and plays 10000 hours of csgo and this per day and he loves it, i'll pass this game on to my children when they are still in the womb, i approve!"

2115,"I am a 14 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 2. My son recently started playing L4D2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to download this game and to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

2136,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him.

2165,"I have a tendency to try to 100% a game before making a review stating how much I enjoy/enjoyed it; and I can proudly say I did so prior to creating a final opinion on Left 4 Dead 2 as a game.

Left 4 Dead is probably one of the best FPS games I've played through In a long time. It is heavily teamwork based, ensuring that you must have good communication skills with your fellow team-mates if you want to be successful in any map you play on regardless if your playing as a survivor or infected (versus). The game is able to keep this cooperative play style while remaining entertaining and keeping you actively doing things; such as gathering cans in scavenge, watching out for enemy players in versus, or just trying to survive as long as possible in survival.
After obtaining all achievements and gathering almost 150 hours as of reviewing this, I can safely say Left 4 Dead 2 is a genuinely solid game and I will continue to play it because of such.

I've played it for many years, with tons of different friends over the years and it never gets old. Especially when you go play DBD and see Bill there, it brings back all that nostalgia I had in my younger gaming years. Props to L4D2 team for having such success, even so many years after release."

2203,this game is fun I don't recommend you give this to children but story mode is a bit fun just don't join online games they kick people out alot so most preferred is single player but it ain't my choice to pick if it is horrible or if it is good try it out for yourself and see if you think it is good. but part two of this is not what you wanna hear it is fun but never go online the people are rude in games and if your host they kick you out and someone else is host who does that to someone left 4 dead 2 online needs to go down or this game is not gonna be worth playing for.
2204,good game

2246,imagine owning a steam account and not having l4d
2247,moooooooooooooooonkey
2248,You can kill zombies and can mod the game to play as many different characters from other media. First time I  got to play as Sally Acorn in a videogame :)
2249,pp
2250,excellent
2251,Have you not played this yet? Go buy it. I think it's one of the best zombie games ever made.
2252,"bad
"
2253,"In a move to improve the graphics quality as well as the totally cinematic gameplay, L4D2 comes out swinging for the fences with new bosses and maps for a fast-paced zombie fest, sure to entice even the most ardent fan of the genre. You now must own them both! It's an incredibly fun sit down to go through both games sequentially once in AI mode, if not first to familiarize yourself with the content. IMO, disturbing the Witch after being told to NOT do so is a favorite! Don't stop aiming for the head!"
2254,mm game good
2255,"been playing since it came out, like 10 years lol
"
2256,what that tongue do
2257,THIS GAME IS BUSSIN I TELL YOU HWAT

2259,"This is the only game im gonna review. and what can i say? This game is a cult classic back on 360 and its still fun as hell, even better on the pc with the workshop and the infinite content you can explore. On top of ALL that you can see all the anime booba in the workshop 100/10"
2260,addicting!
2261,a great horde shooter
2262,"This is the perfect zombie shooter game. It is an old game, so there aren't that many servers, and the ""addon"" community is rather lewd, but you can always count on this game to give you a good, fair, fun, frantic time.

My only complaint is that third party servers don't have a separate server browser so you can join servers with ridiculous plugins when you just want to play normally."
2263,"its good
"
2264,"This is the best co-op shooter, the rest can pack up and go home."

2282,"Surprisingly good, reminds me of George Orwell's novel 1984"
2283,"Campaign is fun with friends, but they should really increase the brightness in certain areas. Yeah it's a zombie survival scary game but some places are just straight are blacked out and you can't see anything which is so annoying. Overall, pretty fun but gets boring after continuous playing."

2300,"This game is so good. Zombie model was good i like it.
"
2301,"lifelong game full of memories of friends laughing, getting mad and roasting eachother. always a top 10 game in my book and will continue to make memories
"
2302,"Where do I start?
The gameplay, the atmosphere, everything is perfect. From the level design, once populated areas are now run down and filled with infected. The only evidence of humans existing are the abandoned cars, cluttered rooms at disarray from panic, frantic scrawlings from other survivors on walls, makeshift safe rooms, rotting corpses, and many, many posters depicting the spread of the green flu. All this plus more adds up to each level feeling very memorable and different.
Sound is everything too. The music perfectly matches what you are experiencing from the eerie tones after leaving the saferoom letting you know there is no turning back, intense and all over the place music each level has when being surrounded by infected, the frantic and dizzying sounds of being covered in bile perfectly matching the fact that the bile has blinded you and you dont know what's happening, to the ending jingle after reaching a saferoom filling you relief knowing you made it by the skin of your teeth. And not to mention the ambient sounds like the mumbles and punches of nearby Infected infighting, to the chatter of your teammates, the screeches of an upcoming horde, to the crys of each special infected.
I could go on forever about this game, there is so much to love about this game that I simply cannot explain well enough here. This game would've been the best fucking game in existence if it wasnt for the jockey, OMFG THE JOCKEY FUCKING SUCKS SO MUCH, HE HAS INFINITE HP WHEN TRYING TO KILL HIM YET WHEN PLAYING HIM ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO LATCH TO A SURVIVOR. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IVE SLID OFF OF COACHES GIANT FUCKING MILKDUD LIKE ITS WAXED. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST FUCKING THING IN EXISTENCE 
9/10 do reccomend!
"
2303,This is truly legendary. 10/10.
2304,Its a good game...worth the money and there is a lot of stuff on the steam workshop that we can use on the game to make it more fun to play
2305,Boomer goes boom
2306,Yes
2307,thrilling and good for coop playing
2308,"its Left 4 Dead 2, need i say less"
2309,absolute must-have for people who love zombie game's
2310,epic and worth it
2311,"I bought this game when it was 1 euro and it was worth it!

This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns.
You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan.
You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.
Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play. Left 4 Dead 2 features intense violence, blood and gore (including decapitation or dismemberment of zombie-like creatures) and some strong language."

2315,"holds up amazingly for a game that came out in 2009! great graphics, amazing story, dynamic cast of characters and a diverse arrangement of weapons to use. if you haven't played this game yet then i pity you because this is one of the most well made games of the 21st century. Valve knows how to make games and they know how to make em good. can only hope Left 4 Dead 3 will come someday (back 4 blood doesn't count, that was just a soulless cash grab)"
2316,yes
2317,All time GOAT it was fun in 2009 and still amazing in 2022

Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

2480,BROOOOOOO THIS IS SO GAME
2481,best gaem
2482,if you dont like this game im not saying you shouldnt be hit by a car
2483,"This is easily one of my favorite games I played back on Xbox 360. The premise is simple, shoot zombies, complete objectives, shoot more zombies, repeat. I got this on sale and it was worth it. I sank so much time in this game it isn't funny. Being able to now play with workshop stuff in this game makes it that much better.... and a bit laggier. That being said, I won't parrot what has been said dozens of times already so don't sit on this, you probably won't regret it. Also, this game is pretty much the only L4D game you need because it already has all of the first L4D content included at no charge, so you're getting both L4D games. 9/10 for me!"
2484,Very good zombie game 10/10. Would be a one man cheeseburger apocalypse again.

2490,"I gave thus thumbs down, as it looks very much pay to win (or pay until you realized you've been had). The UI links you to the shop everywhere and prices are insane, given how many tokens you need to finish the game. The game has very little content, and you should be able to get through that content in reasonable time, without having to pay more than $5 at the most. As it is, you need to invest thousands of real time hours or pay $1000+ to get through it, which just sounds like a scam.

Enough about that. The game is free to play, so feel free to try it out yourself. You can play through a lot of the limited content without paying anything. You just need to know when to stop, and be able to ignore that you can't get the best staff and the best club upgrades.

The game is kind of split in two. In one part you're doing a shift in the club. Where all you basically do is: Click on drinks to make drinks, give drinks to people to earn money. Get helper to bring you more drinks from fridge or clean a table. Order strippers to do strip shows. Once you buy private boots you open up the possibility of giving customers lap dances when they request it too. That's it. As you upgrade club you get more customers, so you need to click more, and as you get more staff and upgrade them so they move faster you need to click faster. So in that fashion it's sort of Space Invaders in a strip club context. Just that there's never game over. Errors just mean your income gets less than optimal, so it's no big deal. Especially when you get on a bit and money is basically worthless because everything costs tokens instead. As time goes by, the only way to get tokens is through levelups, so a shift is basically about getting as many stars as possible to level up as quick as possible, meaning strip shows and lap dances are your primary goal, and earning money a secondary goal.

The second part is upgrading the club through money and tokens earned. To begin with, most upgrades cost money you earn in game, but once you get to level ~40, almost all further upgrades just require tokens, and money becomes pretty useless (Apart from a few high prices money sinks opening up later) This second part would be much more interesting if you knew more about what upgrades did, so you could make informed decisions rather than upgrade on instincts.

The game is pretty much about levelling up. That is, get stars from strip shows and lap dances until you level up. To begin with you'll level up every 2 shifts, and at level 50-60 it seems this starts to slow down, and you may need 3 shifts to level up. At level ups you get some rewards. Mostly money and tokens, but sometimes also unlock a photo, get access to an extra staff member, extra booze or get one XP for a staff member. At levelups you also may trigger some small story conversations.

Initially, you can get some tokens from achievements, but these are once only events, so once you have gotten the easy to get ones, that stream will shut. The free spin of the wheel gives hardly anything, so you're pretty much locked to the rewards you get on levelup as time passes. You can earn more stars as you get better staff and upgrade club, but you need more star points to advance too, so while awards increase with each level, due to the extra effort to get to the next level, the rewards feel fairly constant.

Grinding tokens from level ups is fine, if you can stand the grind. Not being able to get all the upgrades when you dont pay is also ok. But the real issue, is the lack of goals. There's a limit to how many hundred shifts I can handle just to see the story progress a bit. When you open up a dirty picture, that feels like a reward, but as you have to pay extra tokens to actually unlock it piece by piece, you feel like you rather need to invest in club/staff upgrades, so they are easy to skip, and then what are you playing for?

Also feels rough to grind hours to get tokens to do an upgrade, and then you buy a gacha in hopes of getting access to better staff, and waste 55 tokens to get a staff upgrade of a staff member you're not using worth 1-2 tokens. Or you pay 75000 to upgrade the club, but all that changes is that the club seems to have a second floor in the overview picture, but nothing in the club actually changes. And a lot of the upgrades within the club have no written or obvious in game effect. Might do nothing for all I know.

Some suggestions for game changes to make it better:
- When you unlock photos or other lewd stuff, don't require tokens to access it further.
- When you pay for gacha and get an XP point, at least get a full level so you level up. I have yet to get a staff member that is level 2 at level 60.
- Allow you to buy tokens for in game cash, so cash still feels useful.
- More story points. More sexy content. (That doesn't cost you tokens)
- Reduce token requirements, and especially reduce rate at which costs increase. And drastically reduce prices of tokens. Are you really expecting people to buy tokens for $1000 and feel ok with it? Using $5 on this game, should give you all you need to see all the little content there is in here.
- Animations that don't require you to press the mouse x100 per second while watching it.
- More events and stuff to handle in the shift. Fights with bouncer? People that don't behave in private dances (opportunity for more lewd content)?
- More information on what the club upgrades actually does.
- Why have a ton of chairs, tables, stools and bar space, when the club will never have more than 15 customers at the same time?
- What's the effect of improving stuff like floors, walls, lighting, ... ?
- What will future level ups give you as bonus? Is there a random element here? Will some bonuses be ignored if you bought them before you got them?

At level 40 I pretty much unlocked everything I could with reasonable speed with the money/tokens you get from playing. Further playing is a very slow grind to get very little and virtually nothing changes. At level ~60 I got very let down after spending quite a few levels to get $75000 to upgrade club, and noticing no difference at all. Have not seen a single extra bartender or bouncer, all the new strippers I get access to are worse than the ones I already have, and getting beyond 5 max is getting very pricey on tokens. Not to mention trying to upgrade pornstar/legendary ones.

Think I'll put this game on hold for now.."

2520,"If you're looking for a chance to expand gameplay via the wonderful world of mods, then you should get this game, install what mods you want to add, and viola."
2521,"    Left 4 Dead 2 is chaotic compared to even its predecessor, and while the novelty shock value of the game’s premise has worn off since Left 4 Dead 1, the new zombies and crescendo events definitely make up for it, bringing a whole new brand of panic to the experience.
   It's better than the first game, then. The biggest achievement, however, is that Valve - who are known to take their time - have managed to put such an enormous wealth of content out.
 Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't just add a few new levels and features, it fiddles and increments a formula that few thought needed changing in the first place. The team have managed to infuse their sequel with the exact same kind of nuanced creative energies that usually takes them years, and in doing so they've made last year's accomplished Left 4 Dead look like a simple mod in comparison."

2596,"Left 4 Dead 2 is quite something else. I am blown away by how simple a game can seem on the outside but be so greatly complex and well crafted that its repetitive gameplay loop can feel so addictive. The combination of the atmosphere, characters, dialogue, the story told through basic text and small chatter between the cast, the infected, music and map design really create an experience that cannot be replicated. There is a reason why Back 4 Blood never really took off late last year. You just can't match what Valve and Turtle Rock Studios did all those years ago. in addition, the Game Director was so ahead of its time for the amount of variety and outcomes that produce off its reaction to the current campaign. I truly believe that the game director really is why I can come home after work and still enjoy Left For Dead 2 playing the same campaigns a decade later."

2633,"Good with friends, mediocre at best without them.  
This game's innovative, (adaptive difficulty, physics, teamwork, etc.) but those are just the details.  The main core of the game is still just shootin' zombies and occasionally being the zombie.  
It gets boring after a while."
2634,"Extremely fun! The main campaign feels a little short but its very re-playable, and this game includes the campaign from the first one so it feels more worth your money. Not to mention the modding community, which adds an entirely new element to an already great experience.

tl;dr If you can't decide between l4d1 and l4d2, get this one. It's got all the stuff from the first and more."

2659,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

[h1] Definitely a game you should have in your collection [/h1]

Left 4 Dead is a very old franchise. Left 4 Dead 2 in particular is one of the valve's best thing happened. A 14 year old game still has the calibre to bring your pals together over a co-op match and have a blast. Scream, laugh, swear, shoot and lastly whack the zombies. However playing with random players online might give you a blunt experience, because people dont usually talk much at least in L4D2. So it's best played with your friends, buddies, pals, girlfriend(s). . . . maybe ex(s) be the zombie and whack em? Sounds fun eh!

As per story line, it has a very decent setup from L4D to L4D2 with good continuation. Once its completed [b]Zoey, Bill, Francis, Louis[/b] ||  [b]Ellis, Coach, Rochelle, Nick[/b] these names will be stuck in you. You will definitely miss the moments, you can play it over and over. But you know you can't really unplay it to play again like fresh memory.

Lastly this game received an updated on 24th September 2020 named ""[b]The Last Stand[/b]"" which features the L4D survivors, pretty great to play it again with your friends in co-op. 

Lot of modes and mods are available on workshop, I believe that's the thing hauling the game's player-base till date. At some point you wanna invite your friends over on co-op again in the name of survivors but behind you wanna quickly switch to infected and surprise attack, and the look your friends will give over it will be worth enjoying and lot of ear cancer over the discord that's understandable. 

I would say its: [b] 9/10 OVERALL [/b] 
Definitely recommended 👍

2703,"TLDR - A sequel so good it makes the original obsolete.

Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best co-op shooters I have ever played. While you could play co-op or versus with random people online, playing with people on your friends list is (in my opinion) a far better experience. It contains of of the content from the first game (levels) while including new weapons and infected."

2811,"I got nothing to complain but this game is too good, but I'll give you a cheesecake recipe.
There will be 2 parts of ingredients, one is for meringue and other one is for the cake batter

For meringue, you will need:
-5 egg whites
-1/4 tsp cream of tartar (or vinegar or lemon juice) 
-1/4 cup (50g) fine (granulated) sugar (Not Confectioner sugar)

And for the cake batter, you will need:
-5 egg yolks
-8 oz cream cheese (1 bar) 
-1/4 cup (55g) butter 
-1/2 cup (125ml) milk 
-1/4 cup (50g) fine (granulated) sugar 
-2 tbsp (15g) corn starch (magic ingredient) 
-1/4 cup (34g) flour

**note that you can add additional toppings like strawberries, confectioner sugar, fruits of your choice, honey, matcha powder, etc...

So, the preparations, there will quite long but the reward is the best.
Separate 5 beautiful eggs. Place the egg yolks in a bowl, and the egg whites in a mixer bowl.

1. Firstly you will need to place the butter, cream cheese and 1/4 cup of fine sugar into a pot over low-heat. Allow the ingredients to melt, and mix together into a beautifully smooth batter mixture.

2. Remove the pot from heat, and add the egg yolks into the batter mixture. Mix well, but gently.

3. Add the cornstarch and flour. Once again, mix well. Clumps should disappear.

4. Add milk and optionally vanilla extract or other flavors of your choice.

5. Mix well. The batter should be smooth and liquid-y. You won’t have to strain this mixture. (See video)

6. Set aside the batter as you beat the egg whites into stiff peaks (see below for egg beating tips.)

7. Pre-heat oven to 330F (or about 165C-170C). Prepare a bain-marie by putting water in a deep rectangular baking pan or dish. Place into the oven.

8. Prepare baking pans— with these ingredients, you can bake one 8-inch cake or two 6-inch cakes. Line the bottoms of the baking pans with circular parchment paper, and the inside sides with rectangular strips of parchment paper. (Not wax paper.)

9. Once you achieve stiff peaks, place some beaten egg white into the batter and mix together.

10. Repeat the above step (step 9) two more times.

11. You don’t want to over mix the batter. Pour the batter into the rest of the egg whites and mix together using folding techniques. You don’t want to over-mix or under mix. If you over-mix, the cake will not rise. If you under-mix, your cake will be uneven. The egg white will float to the top and you’ll have a meringue-like cake at the top, and a dense cheesecake at the bottom.

12. Pour the well-incorporated, but not over-mixed batter into the baking pan(s).

13. Bake bain-marie style for 25 minutes 330F (Depending on your oven, you may have to adjust the temperature.) If your cake is not rising, your oven temperature is too low. Raise by 10 degrees.

14. After 25 minutes, your cake should rise. If it has not risen yet, allow it to stay at the same temperature and give it time to rise (or you may have to raise the temperature). Once it rises nicely, crack open the oven door slightly and keep it open for 10 seconds (approximately). Lower the oven temperature to about 245-265F, depending on your oven, and bake for an additional 45 minutes. At this point, there is a possibility your cake may crack if the oven temperature is too high.

15. Allow your cake to rest in the oven after baking for about 10 minutes.

16. Remove from the oven. Be careful and use oven mitts as needed.

17. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the cake. Place a plate over the cake and parchment paper. Flip the cake upside down so the top of it is now the bottom while resting on the parchment paper over the plate. Remove the cake from the pan by sliding it out, or gently shaking it out.

And there you have it, a fine delicious cheesecake at the plate for you to eat, or throw it to your cat or at the jockeys. Feel free to decorate it with anything you like (I put hand grenade as the toppings)"

2822,It’s not a matter of “will” you get kicked but “when” you get kicked.
2823,"Left For Dead 2: The Perfect Sequel

 After the success of Left For Dead, L4D2 follows that perfectly. Just by purchasing it, you gain access to all campaigns from its predecessor, plus additional content through different game-modes such as Versus, Survival and Scavenge. The campaign is one of the best zombie experiences out there and hasn't been replicated anywhere else...
 The core gameplay is synergy, working as a team to get from point A to point B, and while it sounds simple and ultimately is, the gameplay is perfectly replayable. Never has killing zombies been so euphoric, and games such as World War Z and Back 4 Blood fail to keep that same gruesome killing experience.
 Overall, this game is way too good to ignore. If it's on sale, it's a must-have. 10/10."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. h"

2880,"Barely played on PC but i have spent countless hours of my childhood playing on the xbox 360. 
It's a must play."
2881,its a really good game created by god himself
2882,LETS MURDER THOSE MOTHER TRUCKERS
2883,good
2884,good game zombie boom boom
2885,killing zombies in this game is fun :)
2886,"Im going start off by saying this is one of the best co-op games i have ever played.

All of the campains are linear yet have a lot to explore, there are always nooks and crannies worth checking because you might find something useful.

The Ai for all of the enemies is great to, it actually feels like a zombie apocalypse. and on the topic of enemies, each of them are very distinct from each other from their design to their mechanics.

And we all know about the Iconic core cast of Elis, Nick, Coach, and I guess Rochelle, shes definatly the most forgetable but still an interesting character.

I like the item assortment too, pretty much all weapons are viable its just about how you feel like playing or what you want to use.

And now with all of the L4D 1 campaigns I think this game has almost doubled in worth. If you want to experience L4D how it was intended go ahead and buy that seperately.But if you dont care about that and just want to play the maps with the updated L4D2 mechanics this is the best way to do it as it comes with the game.

other than just some minor problems like it feeling a bit repetative over time I'd give this game a solid 8/10"
2887,i have played this on my xbox one and ti was fun and now i have a pc and i can put mods
2888,this game is better with mods
2889,"you actually spend more time modding this game than ACTUALLY playing it, alongside nmrih best zombie game i've ever played."
2890,if u like zombies just download it lol
2891,Left 4 Dead 2 will always be a game you can come back to to replay and it was the best and last game of its kind sadly. This game is fun and with mods can be so much more fun and hilarious. I loved it for the Xbox 360 and I still do it just kicks a**. Let's give this game a 9/10!

What are you wating for?
Go kill some zombies..."
2910,"Got this game for free in 2013 for Christmas, and it still remains as the best gift that Steam has ever given me.

Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best multiplayer based shooters/survival games of all time, every gun and weapon feels fantastic to use, each item serves as a lifeline for different situations, and the skill ceiling is so high that I have 100+ hours and I still have mechanics I haven't learned yet. When it comes to replayability, L4D2 easily lands in my top two. No matter how many times I load up the same maps, I never get tired of them. The RNG system is not only extremely well balanced, but also makes it so even when you are playing the same map it is still a different experience every time.

This is also not including the ENDLESS amount of mods that have been developed and released on the workshop, leaving ample opportunity to tailor your own personal experience.

This game has been out for ages, I don't need to sing it's praises all that much but I would be a fool not to at least leave a review after receiving this masterpiece for free!

TLDR; one of the best multiplayer based shooters to ever grace the planet and i like da funny mods"
2911,ye
2912,pew pew zombie hahaha
2913,best zombie game out there
2914,who would play this for 100 hours
2915,good game
2916,Good game
2917,"No other game still does zombies quite like L4D2 - always gonna be timeless fr

Picked it up on sale again after 7-8 years and it's some of the most fun I've had while gaming in a while. 10/10 recommend to anyone who's a fan of zombie stuff and co-op games in general - plus the fact it can run perfectly on my high-end but kinda avg laptop warms my heart. Controller support the cherry on top fr"

2979,"I am a 44 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
2980,"It's Left 4 Dead 2, you probably already own it, it's like two bucks whenever there's a sale.

All time classic of the horde shooter genre. Pretty much the definitive example of it to the point that here we are 13 years later and games are still ""left 4 dead but..."". Is it deserving of this status?

Yes. Yes it is. It's an impeccably balanced game with a broad amount of content. Every element of it just clicks into place perfectly, the special infected all have different niches that work together in ways that are never ""There was nothing I could do"" levels of unfair like some of the other examples of the genre. There's no mechanical bloat, there's no classes, just  ""Get from point A to point B as a team"" and sometimes that's all you need. The narrow focus is a strength in this case because it never gets in its own way. There's no meta player build requirement because you're playing four fundamentally identical goofs.

It's just a well put together way to murder zombies for a few hours with friends or randoms. But probably not bots because that's just a bad time."

Bad stuff, honestly the real complaint I have is, while playing solo the enemies practically ignore you're AI teammate's and go exclusively for you making tank fights a drag. But other than that it a great game. Would recommend."

3112,"The best co-op campaign shooter bar none.
"
3113,Left 4 dead 2 is one of the best zombie shooters out there. i like everything about this game including the unique characters and the great level design. This game also includes lots of different game modes and includes the Steam Workshop so you can download mods. I recommend this game.
3114,A game that ages well and a game that brings back nostalgia of the good old days when games weren't rushed and we were well made
3115,very good

3118,"Учителят Логан е бил известен магьосник и кралски член на Габровската драконова школа, преди да стане неумрял преди около сто години. Псевдонимът му произлиза от гигантската шапка, която носи, като тя напълно скрива лицето му; той я ползва, за да блокира шума и погледите от околните, за да може да фокусира мислите си. Оръжието му някога е било обикновен калкулатор, използван от магьосниците в Габровската драконова школа, но оттогава е станал много по силен калкулатор поради продължителната употреба с течение на времето. По подобен начин неговият халат обикновено се носи от сираци в Габровската драконова школа.

На Логан се приписва, че е разработил, наред с други, магьосничеството на душевният калкулатор, което се споменава многократно в легендите и се казва, че е наравно с мълнията на могъщ вожд Gari. В опитите си да достигне до Сливенската Порта, къде е вероятно да получи достъп до архива на Лорд Андре и неговия огромен запас от безкрайни наркотици, той е затворен в крепостта в Севлиево, където за първи път се сблъсква с Избраните Лайнари."

i would recommend this game to other players."
3128,brootal
3129,"A timeless, enduring classic that Valve was generous to give me for absolute free one Christmas. It is hands down the best co op zombie shooter that ever was or ever will be in my opinion, and the fact that it still has such a large community after all these years is a testament to that. Both casts of L4D1 and 2 are so well written and have so many interactions that even almost 100 hours in, I still hear new dialogue and reactions everytime I replay a campaign. Once again, a masterpiece that delivers on every level."
3130,pay now
3131,Awesome game but I dont have enough space for other games :( unless i wouldve kept it installed
3132,Pure entertainment with a little bit of frustration
3133,"It's a good game.

3160,"Fun characters, fun settings, gritty (in a good way) music. L4D2 is amazing and will always be timeless, and it even comes with the original. This one is a little more goofy than the first, but it makes all the more better to play with friends. Incredibly fun to master and full of tons of little tricks. This made my friend's and I's 2020 summer, and a lot like TF2, it's a very good game for just picking up every once and a while to play a campaign or two."
3161,youve a gun and theres zombies angry zombies. whats there to say

3170,"mmm yes very good much wow
"
3171,basically I like killing things and this game gives me an outlet without my family having to suffer anymore than they already have.
3172,boring valve game
3173,awesome game would recommend if you are bored
3174,"This game isn't boring at all. I can play this forever. With big support of the community workshop this game is even better. You can put Patrick skin on boomer, and it will be hilarious. In my opinion 10/10"
3175,"It's been 3 years since I've last played L4D2 and I have to say, it's still fun as hell as I remembered"
3176,greatest game of all time. Hope is never dies. 10/10
3177,cool zombie gaem
3178,"Incredible game. Single player is already fantastic, but mutations add a lot of spice to the gameplay as well. Not to mention, the entire multiplayer aspect is extremely engaging, where that'd be campaigns, versus, or scavenge. TL;DR get this game because it's good and yeah."
3179,"play EVERYTHING in vanilla and then go dabble in the mods. bring friends to crank up the fun.
its left for dead u know whats up"
3180,i kill zombie
3181,"I haven't played it much so I can't say a ton but its pretty fun. Definitely takes some getting into things before it becomes fun.

I find the guns to be too loud, I get that its kinda realism, but its a video game about zombies, and games like csgo have alot better equalization, Even some of the silenced guns aren't much more quiet than the others. There should be an easier way to change the gun volume or at very least the dynamic range so its easier to hear other sounds at a realistic level without hurting your ears after playing for awhile. This obviously does depend on how much dynamic range your headphones naturally have, but that makes the option even more important. You shouldn't need to be an audio nerd to not go deaf using certain headphones. I can't imagine how much it would hurt to play this game using the m50x with no sound filters."
3182,"i love the mod
"
3183,"i was left for dead, for a second time"
3184,This game is insane. I'm sad I've only just now played it for the first time.

3192,it gud
3193,"Screw you Volvo, break your stupid ""can't count on 3"", coz its lame and expired joke, make L4D 3 !!"
3194,This game made my childhood 10/10
3195,This is very fun with friends if you like shooting zombies.
3196,"This game is THE BEST zombie shooter, others might have more advanced mechanics or better graphics, however this game has charm, Complexity and Clarity. Other games might have you do Stupid puzzles that take either a brain dead amount of thought, or are crazy hard and almost force you to look up a guide. 

The only puzzle in this game is how to deal with the eldritch abominations that are the infected. you can learn to melee a hunter right out of the air as it pounces you, or listen for the coughing of the smoker and find where hes hiding. Learn how to kill a witch without it going crazy at you.

the characters are charming too, coach is a one man cheese burger Apocalypse, nick is the jackass rich guy, Ellis is a redneck mechanic who calls helicopters ""whirly birds"". Rochelle is the Kind hearted reporter who knows all about the infected. then there is the returning cast of left for dead 1 characters, Bill the Vietnam veteran with an attitude, Francis the biker who thinks the zombies are vampires, Louis who is cowardly yet optimistic. and finally Zoey She is supportive and friendly to her fellow survivors.

Left for dead 2 comes with brand new levels! make your way down a hotel, and through a mall. run through a sugar mill to get some gas and while you head back it starts flooding!, exciting settings such as new orleans make an appearance. and you still get to play the original left for dead's levels! and now even the old levels have brand new melee weapons witch replace your pistols and are very risky yet effective!

Overall i recomend this game to any fan of shooters or zombies! its Great experience no matter what!"
3197,good
3198,"Excellent game with tons of replayability. Regardless of group size, Left 4 Dead 2 stays just as fun everytime"
3199,Very fun with friends. 8/10.
3200,"A really good survival horror game, the first one is amazing, but this is absolulety the best, multiples modes of game and some improvements that definitely, they make it the best of the 2."

3253,"Game never gets old, you just need friends to play it with first."
3254,"Of all the games I've played over the years this game continues to be one I come back to play regularly, it has almost, if not, infinite replay value and is tons and tons of fun with friends. Whether you may decide to play vanilla or mod it to hell and back, it's a game that never gets stale and boring like a lot of newer games of this generation."
3255,i have to say this game has been around for a while and i still prefer to play this over many other zombie shooter games!
3256,"Ever since I first played this game on the 360 with a friend I was in love with this game. The gore, the guns, the zombies, it's just so simple. Like getting to point A to point B could be repetitive but that is shadowed over by the intents, face-paced action and the dialog of the interactions with survivors is just funny to listen too. Even though it is fun to play solo this game is best played with friends. How ever you play this game it is still a number 1 for me. Also it kills the time as well so yeah, pretty convinet. Also the mods for this game are great and also can be a bit...weird but let's face it we need a little bit of weird in our lives...And zombie slaying fun...And a cheeseburger apocalypse...And the one time Keith and Ellie posted a review for a game on this site called steam...Wait a minute...

In all seriousness this is a game I highly recommned for anyone to play."
3257,it good
3258,"I like this game because it is the sequel of an interesting concept of the first game but there are isn`t some stuff like from the first game like the NPC`s and you got no feet.  Other then that it is fun and brings some levels and some extra from the first game or you need the first game for the first game levels in this one, idk.  Target demographic is T."

3265,"This game is pretty good. It's a game that can make me love it, and at the same time hate it. Honestly this is a perfect game even tho it gets on my nerves sometimes. Its a game that I can easily play on a very bad laptop that has like 4 gigabytes of ram and a very bad graphics card. It's pretty enjoyable when you have a good team that isn't just going to bunnyhop past you whilst you're getting pummeled by a horde of infected.. Is it worth buying? Yes,of course it is lmao, If you haven't already go ask your mom for her credit card and buy it right now and play it until your ass starts to hurt from the amount of time you've spend sitting down playing this Masterpiece.

3300,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Unlike the Xbox 360 version there is actually a Last Stand campaign, you can play with mods, you can still play online with people today, and you actually get an achievement for completing the Cold Stream Campaign. I wish they would of made Left 4 Dead 3 instead of Back 4 Blood."

But playing on pubs is a bit like finding yourself in some manchild daycare center.
I advise playing on normal difficulty to avoid getting teamkilled but even then if they can't kill you, they'll annoy you with voice line spam or just shoot at you intentionally at random. Doubt valve will ever do anything to address this so just bear in mind."

So i started to do it in secret, i was scared to shit by the intro theme, the trailer as we speak of, since then its the game i always've been playing, i love L4D with my life and its my escape from reality. It never dies, i hope someday Valve can count to three to make L4D3! :D"

3405,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.

3406,"There are still small bugs. But, overall good story. Graphics are handy even in low pc specifications. Looking forward for more maps and characters in the future."
3407,This game is a blast 10/10. Would Mod again

3413,just kill :D
3414,The game is fun in Single player but the multiplayer part is Shit it is still a fun (in Single player)
3415,"After 174 hours of gameplay, i still find extremely well made maps, weapon skins and other add-ons for this game that makes it interesting and fun to play all over again. while it always boils down to ""shoot infected, carry gas from point A to B"" and ""try to outrun a horde of infected and your ever decreasing healthbar"", there are always twists that keep this game alive and worth playing. truly unique and a masterpiece done right."
3416,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3429,"I made my infected run from me
"
3430,"Можливо для свого часу гарні відгуки, але на сьогодні вони вже дуже застарілі."
3431,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you

Where I play this game to my heart's content. It has all the joys in the world packed into one soon to be 17 year old game. Its been 17 years and there has literally been no better game than Left 4 Dead 2. I remember on February 20th, 2014 I lost my copy of Left 2 Dead 2 and I cried for 7 hours, 32 minutes and 05 seconds until I cried so hard I threw up all over my what was then carpeted floor. only to find it in my kitchen after I threw up.

3494,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

A Zombie Survival Game from 2009. The game features 4 survivors in a zombie apocalypse who have to fight through hordes of zombies to get to the safety.
Its impressive how great the game mechanics and game design are. The maps are huge and detailed as compared to other zombie games. Also, being able to get custom stuff from the Steam Workshop, makes the game even more fun."

'Yon ay ang maging isang ganap na Mentally Stable person na nagagawa ang gusto nang walang halong doubt at mayroong self confidence. Pero bakit ko nga ba ito sinasabi? Wala lang. Pero ang importante, may sinabi ako. 'Yan lang ang mahalaga. Nasa sa'yo na kung bibilhin mo ito o hindi. Magtiwala ka lang sa iyong sarili. Alam ko na kaya mo at ako ang pinaka-unang tao na magiging proud sa'yo. Sana'y maging ayos ka sa pang araw araw. You matter and everything you've done is worth it."
3587,"Great game even though it's old. The best way to play it is with mods. Specifically mods that change the way players, guns, and zombies look. This will make the game very funny and a whole lot better. Even if you don't use mods though it's still good."
3588,"Wow this was extremely disappointing. All the games I've played were backfilling as the zombies while the humans zipped to the next checkpoint. Everyone was yelling at each other in spanish and the hit detection sucks! Then you switch teams and get obliterated in 30s every time! Your teammates get creamed so badly that they're constantly ragequitting and backfilling. You'll get no less than 10 teammates quit/join per round. Don't even get me started on the griefing, or that ubiquitous gay guy that spams the chat with ""im gay haha im gay haha im gay haha"".  The community is dogs*I**.

What a waste of 3 bucks."

3825,"This game is still active with players after nearly 15 years, though be careful of what lobby you join or game server you get into. You'll always want Official Dedicated servers when in multiplayer modes to avoid extra nonsense, and do be warned, players can upload any image or gif they want and make it a spray in the game. You will see all kinds of things that you either never seen before, never want to see again, or actively search on a daily basis. If you're playing the game to focus on the game, you won't really notice any of the extra distractions."

3874,"Ahhh yes:) Left 4 Dead 2. One of those classic games that stand the test of time.
L4D2 really is so special that I dedicate my first review to this beauty in my nearly Ten years of having Steam.

Several reasons for L4D2 being such a time-piece in my opinion is being 1.Budget-friendly, 2.Minimal CPU-requirements, 3.TONS of skins(add-ons), 4.Quick Game-Lobbies, etc. ... 5.WHO DOESN'T LOVE BLASTING ZOMBIES TACTICALLY OR BRAINLESSLY?!?! *pun intended* 
Literally been enjoying the SAME amount of fun no matter how many years in between of playing it!
Definitely a must have in almost any modern day 2022 laptop/computer."

It's the perfect game to play with friends
On the phone with friends, I said
[i]""There's a zombie in front of me! Throw the grenade!
Save me! We barely made it!!! Let's gooo!!!!!""[/i]
How happy it is to say this and enjoy it

[h1]You can play the level of difficulty you want[/h1]
I want to praise this system a lot in this game
If you set it to an easy level, just kill the zombies, clear the game, and you forget that time passes
If you're ready, you can also choose ""very difficult"" and position each other
Playing tactically is also incredibly fulfilling.

[h1] Endless add-ons [/h1]
Everything you imagine is in the workshop
What if the zombies were Minecraft? What if the character changed to Macho Man or if I became SpongeBob? You can achieve all this

I brought this game because of that YouTuber “VanossGaming” playing L4D2 so it caught my interest and thought it was fun so I brought the game!"

I've been playing this game since 2009 (Ignore my 6.8 Hours on Records, i've been playing it on Internet Cafe)
The game was fun back in the day, like the whole internet cafe playing it on LAN Connection, Zombies mode, Normal ones, etc.

Playing this game over and over and over again over the years hasn't made me bored yet from 2009-2014, but looking at it right now.. Bring back a lot of memories.

Surprisingly there is still a lot of people playing the game, Let the game never dies boys.

But it's like 10 bucks a su-sho in one of them places, so Keith figures, ""Hey, how hard can it be to roll up some raw food in seaweed,"" right? As it turns out, it's hard. Now, they say experience is the best teacher, and experience taught Keith that if you ever eat three pounds of raw chicken, it kills you. Now luckily, Keith's brain went into self-defense mode and started shutting organs down to head the chicken off at the pass, and the doctors were able to get 'em out before his heart stopped. But to this day, Keith has no sensation in his right foot, and he doesn't recognize his own brother Paul no more."

3929,Left 4 Dead is the greatest zombie game on steam. The reason Left 4 Dead is so good is because teamwork is NOT OPTIONAL  if you wander of without your team you will learn not to do it again after around 30 seconds to 1 minutes and that is why Left 4 Dead is so good. (And also the steam workshop is a great part of left 4 Dead is great)

I can see why the first part got dead, its cuz this one released after a year, and it got more improvments such as : variety of weapons, more special zombies more game modes etc.. I would recommend this game if you are going to play with friends to enjoy it fully as u can, cuz most of the playerbase is toxic when they see new players ngl 70 % of the times i join online i see people raging at new players lmao
Apart from that the game still holds up in 2022 and its fun and active + its fucking 2 euro on sale.

3982,yea its proper scary theres zombies and witches and bigguns (fat skaghead will) and it gets proper scary and that. leo is relaly handsome and smart and he picks me up and he hits me with chanesaw but helps me after and will eats all the meds and all the pain pills and all the stuff we need beczause he cant fill his giant valumtuos gut. all in all do i recomend left dorf rdead two yes i do yep
3983,okay lets get everything in order left for dead 2 is a cracking (wicked). but we must go through bad to get to the good. Its boring when youve played to much even more boring with a so called bookworm named will (ew nerd) but ellis improves it with the super cool slime funky jokes (what a joke!!!!!) fat bags appear everywhere silly skinny crying milfs are hard to take out(bitch) so little prick called nick that cause me a whole lot of problems and ellis with his epic hero scream into the face of battle so do i reccommend you left for dead 2                           no fuck off

3994,"To me Left 4 Dead 2 is a game you can replaying it when you wanna kill some zombie. Killing zombie is not the only thing you do all the time but rushing to the save house and helping you team found the special infected zombie made the game a little hard. All the time, you will get hope you won't let your friends/bots left for dead. 
The story is okay, the bad thing about it was you mean you play all 4 or 8 character conversations and look around the map to found other story conversations. 
Anyway, the only thing that made this game still fun is the there mods in the game that fans made in the workshop. Go check it out, because you can change almost anything and there fans made maps too. Enjoy~ c(l.lc)"
3995,it's 2022 and this game is still amazing very good runs smooth and it's practically a steal for this price who would have to be crazy not to get this game. throws me back to the good old days.

4012,noice game
4013,"I remember this game through my siblings eyes and always loved the characters, campaigns, visuals, and the fun chaos between the players irl. And now that I've gotten to play myself, I'll you tell that I wasn't just reminiscing about my experiences through rose tinted glasses. L4D2 is simple to pick up for anybody, even for ones that don't play games. And with the main aspect being the Co-operation between players, more experienced players can easily guide newer players through the game without having to carry them or leaving them to fend for themselves (or complain that ""the noobs"" are just holding them back but it's not the games fault). Another plus is the replay value. When starting out with the game, you easily pick the mechanics and glide through one of the campaigns you're playing. But as you get better, the less supplies that given to you and more hordes are thrown at you, all in the same difficulty. And this is all thanks to the game's director. The Director Basically controls what happens during the campaign based on your performance. If you're breezing through the level, supplies will be scarce and more hordes and special infected your way. It might even send in an extra tank! But if you're struggling, more supplies will appear and there will be less infected. This is all because of the director, giving the game a fresh and new experience each time you play a campaign. This isn't even going into everything else like overwhelming amount of attention to details, The map designs and the modding community just to name a few! This game is cult classic and will leave a legacy for future generations as one of the best to stand against the passage of times while leaving the others......

4100,"Insane amounts of fun just from playing on console. When I got it on PC a whole new world of modding opened up to me and completely refreshed the experience. This game goes on sale so often for just two or three dollars, you'd be insane not to buy this game. I'm sure there are mods that even disable gore or just make the game less violent in general if gore and blood in general isn't your thing but cooperative shooters are. Heavy emphasis on ""cooperative"" because you absolutely need your team in order to survive, unlike most other cooperative shooters, unless you're the less than one percent that can complete the last human on earth mode"

4181,"Merriam-Webster defines the word perfection as, ""an exemplification of supreme excellence"". I define perfection as, ""Left 4 Dead 2"". This game does not ever come within the vicinity of anything within this very universe that is dictated as ""perfection"". I have played many games in my time on this planet. Left 4 Dead 2 is physical proof that there is a god."

i mean the campaigns are pretty good, theyve got some valve references n stuff, they even added in l4d1 so you dont even need to buy that, i mean if you want to then its alright, but when theres like 2 games in one i think its a greater deal"

4194,"[b] (note: this game was gifted to me i could have a bias cause i like getting games for free) [/b]

[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]
The game is well, what it says; A zombie shooter with 5 new expansive campaigns, with a story to play through. Some complaints I have is sometimes the witch gets triggered for no reason or the game just summons tons of tanks on me unexpectedly during Zombie Hordes.

[h1] The Story [/h1]
I can't really comment much on it as I haven't payed too much attention to the story (because all I wanted was just ""The funny zombie shooter with co-op and versus"" which well, is what the game is), but why does Whitaker want Cola so badly in a Zombie Apocalypse 💀💀

[h1] Other stuff [/h1]
Now, Here's my favourite thing about the game: [b] The modding community. [/b]
There are [u] TONS [/u] of funny mods that really just makes the experience more fun and stupid (especially in a voice-chat with friends), Such as Sans from UNDERTALE as coach. 
There are mods that just give you infinite first-aid kits/other helpful items if you suck at the game that much. 
And if for any reason you wanted Quagmire from Family Guy over the tank, then there's a mod for that, too.

My only complaint is that there are lots of 18+/NSFW mods which i'm not gonna delve into for obvious reasons.

[h1] Verdict/Final result [/h1]
Recommended. The game is very fun with friends, i'd say it's 13+ (though I think I have the cut version so maybe 15-16 would be prefered(?) ), and make sure you're careful when on the Steam Workshop for the game."
4195,the best co-op there is!

4216,"This game is masterpiece.I bought it for  under 2 euro,and i am amazed.The game has so many cool and  realistic things like:
- you can see sometimes zombies vomiting
- if you shoot zombie in the leg,while it's running,the zombie will jump and then will fall on the ground like a bag
- windows don't break with one bullet(or maybe only sometimes)
- if you shoot zombie in stomach with shotgun,there is a chance that his organs will fall of the stomach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The campaign is amazing.Every mission is connected with the previous one.
Multiplayer modes are also fun.Mutation is one of the best gamemodes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I recommend this game 100%. 
You will have so much fun if you play with friends

4245,"Rimane negli anni il gioco meglio fatto a tema Zombies. 
Certo il single player dura quanto una peta nel vento e ok, ma si guarda il co-op e versus.
Millemila mappe non offy da giocare, purtroppo su server moddati, ma il godimento è assicurato.
Si compra ad occhi chiusi con buona pace del tempo di gioco.

4329,"Great game! I really like the aspects of specials, the sounds and music they have, and weapons! I really suggest mods for it, but it is not neccesary"

4331,"SO im just sitting there right? And then my girlfriend walks in. Keep in mind im playing this game. She then starts to get closer. Not only that, but she has that look in her eye. SO then she crawls over to me. and gives me gamer support! Crazy right?"

4333,so first off balls second off among us
4334,"I have to say: When my friends tried to convince to buy a 12-year old, source game, I was sceptical at first, but after playing for a while now, I have to say, it is quite fun to play with friends and mess around.
The game itself, is nothing that special anymore for todays standard, but with the workshop, making it incredible easy to modify EVERYTHING in the game, it feels like a new experience, everytime you boot it up.
An essential game for every Steam user. (probably. I'm not an expert, stop reading this review and play this game)"

4382,"This game is very fun, has a lot of gameplay, and easy mechanics.  Although, this game is not easy at all.  It gives the player a challenge, which is what most look for in games.  This game gives you a lot of content, endless fun, and is even multiplayer, so you can play with friends.  This game is one of the best and is definitely worth the money."

4394,It's a fun mow em down styled game where zombies are the main focus! they did an excellent job of making the different weapons feel fun and also the spread of ammo on the map! weather you are taking zombies on one at a time or getting rid of a giant horde the satisfaction of mowing them down does not seem to go away. good way to make you adicted even if you only play one chapter of the campaign at a time you are drawn back for more.

4518,"Left 4 Dead 2 is proof that sometimes, less is more. No skill trees, no leveling system, no loot mechanics, and no card nonsense. It's just you, three other chucklefucks, and a ton of zombies. The special infected provide plenty of incentive to stick together, but splitting off to scrounge for that extra bottle of pills or medkit is legitimately enticing too. The AI director keeps things fresh even on the same campaigns (which is a good thing because people LOVE No Mercy, Dead Center and Dark Carnival) and of course there's the modding scene. Because if you haven't mowed down hordes of teletubbies as the cast of Madoka Magica using a cat as an SMG that is reloaded with chin scratches, have you really lived?"
4519,it says I have to buy it after I got it for free please fix and I already have it downloaded.

4540,"Imma be real with you. I'm not a big zombie fan. I actually hate the zombie-apocalypse genre altogether. I can say with complete confidence that I love this game. Yes, there are a bunch of gross zombies trying to kill you but this was a LOT more fun than I initially thought it was going to be. For a game that was made back in 2009, the fact that this game is still fun to play is a testament to how well crafted this game is and I cannot stress how much you should buy this game. Even get a few friends to buy it so you can play it together. It's especially a blast when playing it with friends!"

4592,"Would strongly recommend. Very easy to run, very good gameplay that keeps you coming back for more, and an amazing multiplayer experience. No doubt worth every penny"
4593,top tier community maps
4594,Honestly this game is very fun to play with friends. Also the sheer amount of mods that make this game just straight chaos.
4595,"This is a game that has aged incredibly well despite it being a 10 year old zombie game. Between the popular modding scene, fast paced and exciting gameplay, well done horror elements and robust modes, its no wonder this game has hardly slowed down since release.

The reason Left 4 Dead 2 still has not been topped despite having a shinier, more polished pseudo reboot in Back 4 Blood is because Left 4 Dead 2 already mastered the art of being simple but endlessly entertaining. This is not to say L4D2 is a mindless game, however, it is not necessarily complex either. You and 3 other survivors. whether they are bots or real people. need to race to the end of each level in a campaign in order to survive against hordes of basic and special infected, the latter which can be controlled by human players in a head to head mode. This sounds like it can get boring and repetitive quickly, however, due to an AI called ""The Director"", games can dynamically become harder and more intense depending on what has been happening during the campaign. This makes campaigns somewhat different every time you play. This is in combination with good level design that gives both humans and infected opportunities for strategy and victory, but also the variety of special infected that, if played right, can seriously cripple the humans. Levels and campaigns are continuous and tense tug of war battles between both parties that are always exciting.

This game is like a diner in town that serves great food that you've eaten since you were a kid. The food isn't fancy, but every time you go, it never gets old and is always a great spot to go to with friends."
4596,I really enjoy the game and how everything works. The mods do get pretty 18+ sometimes but most of the mods work and function properly!

Put simply the feeling of helping someone or being helped, especially when its not expected, like peeling a tank off someone or going back against odds to pick someone up during finale. 
That is what makes this game so fun, when it throws at you more than you can handle alone then, teamwork emerges even in pugs."

4665,"where do i start, where do i start...
If you are a adult or parent reading this review to find out if this game is good for you/your kid, then listen closely.

yes.

very much.

this game is 4-player cooperative shooter, and not like the generic ones like cod or overwatch where you are SUPPOSE to work together and instead you end up running off and competing to get the biggest kill streak because ""It doesn't matter if i lost, i racked up a huge KD.""
because when you put those players into left 4 dead 2?

they're going to die quicker than it takes for you to say ""no"" to someone asking you to buy a fidget spinner.

so if your getting this game for you and your friends, or you and your kid. go for it! this is one hell of a fun game for families and friends. it'll teach your dull little youngling that ""running away and showing off how cool his stunts are"" the lesson he needs to learn. ACTUAL. TEAMWORK.

if your worried about it getting boring? throw that thought out right now and listen to me. because you'd be crazy to think this is boring (i've played this for 10 years on the xbox... haha...)

first of all (if your playing on pc), you get access to 14 campaigns, around 40 mutations (which are basically modifiers of the campaigns that either make them more fun or make you scream in fear because your running away from 10 tanks), a well made versus mode (just dont play online first, because the community is a little unforgiving if you havent gotten any experience with versus mode), scavenge (which is basically endless but with a twists, you and 3 other people have to scavenge out for gas cans to make sure the time limit you have til the round ends keeps going, there could be up to 14 - 36 gas cans and if you find them all, you get the maximum amount of points, but dont just go running out there while not expecting anything, because your up against a team of 4 who are playing as special infected, if the time runs out, it counts the total gas cans you collected. then switches teams so that its you as the special infected, trying to stop the other team from getting more points.), and surval and survival versus (basically endless + endless mode but formatted like versus).

and ontop of that, have you heard of the workshop?
the workshop is a community page linked to most source engine games. (such as gmod, tf2, ect.)
it allows someone to make addons (basically moderations) to the game.
dont worry, it doesnt mean you have to know anything about modding, the community has done it for you.
in the workshop you can download custom campaigns, survivor skins (this time for free entirely and not for vbucks or something), gun skins (not just a dumb paintjob, but a whole new model such as turning the pistol into buzzlighter.), ui changes, ect.
Basically anything, and the way you do this is you find the addon you want. click on it, scroll to the green subscribe button, and click it. yeah, thats it.
no coding no exporting no unzipping, nothing. just click the green button and your game installs it for you.

oh and if your wanting a description of everything

SFX:
oh my god never before have my ears experienced so much pleasure when shooting zombies.
the gun sounds are the most realistic than every game that has come out since Left 4 dead 2.
the music ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo its so good, halo levels of good.
map design is finer than a perfectly cooked meal for gordon ramsey
characters are possibly the best quality about this game. i wont spoil anything, but they have some of the most realistic characterization in a game yet, maybe not higher than 2 other games but, its wayyyy better than the 18 trillion games behind it.

basically, i think its rightfully fair.
to say that left 4 dead 2
is indeed
a masterpiece."

With the fall off of this games popularity there aren't too many players left. I have even tried downloading mods to make the game either more laughable or more terrifying. Yet I still can only play for about 20 minutes before i get burned out at the games simplicity. The game was fun. It used to be the best thing to hop on and meet a new friend on the xbox 360, but those days are over and this is one of the games that went with it, unfortunately."

Just having everyone gather around for a squad deathmatch in real life is enough to remind me of why I love this game. I’ll never forget sitting on my couch in New England and getting my ass handed to me by two kids, there wasn’t a place I’d rather be. I’ve played with friends from all over the world, the people you play with make all the difference."

4880,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a 4 player first person shooter where you and 3 others must cooperate to survive a horde of zombies. Or you can play alone and suffer with the NPC's. The gameplay isn't too bad and can be quite fun at some moments. It doesn't get ""boring"" until you've been playing for a very long time. 

The zombies can vary from standard zombies to zombies that spit acid and pin players down. I DO have an issue with some of them though. The Smokers, Hunters, Jockeys, and Chargers are all zombies that can pin you down and confirm a kill on you if you team doesn't help you out fast enough. This can get extremely frustrating when you split from the group to grab part of an objective, or when the NPC's fail to help you out.

Getting pinned is an easy confirmed kill if you aren't near your team at all, and it can get quite annoying when you barely survive one pin, just to get pinned again a split second after. And these enemies are littered ALL over the place, making it a pain to go anywhere thats remotely far from an ally. Though I guess you could make the argument that it helps ""team play"", which I guess it does, but it still isn't too enjoyable to need to be saved over and over again.

I give this game a, uh. Hm. I don't really have an object that defines this game that well."

4891,"This game is really great, if you have not already given it a try for some reason then you should totally do so. 

From game-modes like the standard campaign to versus, survival, mutations, etc. There is endless amounts of fun to be had. 

Another great aspect of playing the game has to be the workshop mods. The workshop mods allow for even more entertainment value to be relived in runs.  

Playing this game with friends has to be one of the most fun things you can experience in a multiplayer game. 

I have about 157 hours put into this game so far, and with that being said I recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun zombie game out there, you will not regret your purchase."

Its my 2nd favorite game"
4929,"if you have not played this then where the hell have you been? brilliant game play, always a new experience with different players, lovable characters with a lot of personality stuck in a zombie apocalypse, great replay value and if you get bored of zombies chasing you check the workshop for endless amounts of mods, maps, game modes, maybe get chased by cheese burgers stuck on the titanic or something or maybe a mod where the cheese burgers run from coach. (would like to see that) end verdict: highly recommended worth every penny."

5226,One of the best Zombie shooters you can buy
5227,COACH waton rico te amo
5228,game gud
5229,"Great game, the graphics are great, the levels are great and the charectar designs are finominal
"
5230,"""I have not... come this far... learned so much... struggled so long... played this hard... to DIE NOW!!!..."""
5231,cannot sex tank :(
5232,its really good with funny mods
5233,
5234,This game is fun to paly with friens and watch tnheam suffering with thiose zomebiese3 :D
5235,"10/10 game, played on the free weekend at first, was so fun i had to buy it"
5236,among us mods!
5237,!!!
5238,Really great zombie game
5239,basically shooting zombies for hours
5240,"Valve, get out of your crib, time to make half-life 3 which you never fricking announced, i doubt you started working on it, i am expecting source 3, WITHOUT D3D9, SOURCE 2 USES D3D9, STILL!"
5241,fun asf with the boys
5242,A very large selection of mods.
5243,"This game is ""Overwhelmingly Positively"" trash. If it were more than $2 I'd feel cheated."
5244,"cool game, u can shoot vapers"
5245,Best zombie coop game. Nothing has topped this masterpiece yet.
5246,Insane in the membrane!
5247,watched my friend get tackled off a roof and splat.
5248,people suck
5249,This game is great to spend hours doing if your bored its super fun to play there's so much you can do you never get bored and i met my best friend on here
5250,cool + epic + hot + noob
5251,"good but i can only play a bit cause i got the free thing so idk about whole game
"
5252,"It's pretty good if you like fps games , Zombie Games and etc...
I would recommend this game due to it has multi-player this game will be perfect with your friends."
5253,scary
5254,"Over a decade old and the game' s graphics hold up, online community still going strong. Includes campaigns for Left 4 Dead 1 so no need to buy that one. Well-balanced co-op as long as teammates work together, 80 percent of humanity are down right idiots so... you are warned. PVP is toxic with many try hards with over a decade of experience. Great game to make friends though as long  as you stick with co-op. If you are a loner stick with singleplayer, bots are not totally useless. The Director (AI that adjusts difficulty) can be a whole menace sometimes, will divert some lone zombie to come hit you as soon as you try to heal and will have you get focused by special infected if you are doing too good, watch out for that."
5255,Along is its prequel these games still hold the mantle for 1 of the greatest zombie games ever created.
5256,I like this. Zombies fuck me everywhere at every side. Yes.
5257,"Is good
"
5258,love it to play with friends
5259,I'd bottom for Ellis.
5260,"Very epic game 10/10

Before I played I installed a lot of mods, so here's how it went:I entered a round as Brian from Family guy in a team with Super Mario, Yoshi and Crash bandicoot escaping from a horde of fall guys and elmo while beating them with the ""Short Circuit"" from tf2. First up we escaped from a burning building (In which I got lost 3 times), and then we went to a mall and escaped in the car of Sniper TF2 (In which we all died 2 times).

Very epic."
5261,the best
5262,"fuck yes. buy this game and play it with your friends.
yes you'll have a lot of moments where your fren calls u dumb cuz u didnt save him or some shit-
but all the other fun and epic moments just make those dissapear lmao
def worth it."
5263,noice
5264,the best zombies game
5265,burger zombiew fbaioeyhrfgtpsdf ayoye
5266,toxic community but worth it in 2022
5267,"I still see zombie, I still shoot it"
5268,"Quite fun, especially with friends.
Surprisingly enough has an up-to-date feel considering it's over 10 years old."
5269,Will always be a classic! We NEED a 3rd game... not this Back 4 Blood garbage. I love this game it's by far my favourite <3
5270,its fun until you get fucked by a charger or a horde
5271,"good game
me like
"
5272,all I have to say is nostalgic. this game will never be left 4 dead
5273,"Still the best zombie game. It's showing its age in 2022, but is great for jumping into and cranking out a half-hour campaign with friends, or even on your own sometimes. Versus mode is also great if you seek a more tactical edge to the gameplay."
5274,zambie

5282,"in my testing time i had alot of fun, especially with mods since there are a variety of them so you can create the biggest shitpost ever. very good game"
5283,This game is bullshit and I hate it.  I can't wait to play another couple hundred hours.

5290,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a timeless classic which still holds up extremely well with it's newer competitors. Playing through all campaigns from start to finish would only take you a day or two, but it's replayability means that sinking 100 hours or more into the game is almost certain.  I have probably played the Dark Carnival campaign 15 times since I brought the game and am yet to grow tired of it.

The graphics and audio are pretty average, nothing to get excited over. However, they don't hinder the game in any way.

This game is beginner friendly, with the bots proving very helpful in the easier levels. Although, if you play on advanced or expert, the bots become a huge disadvantage, you're better off playing online. The community has some toxic people, as do all communities, but in general, is very welcoming and kind.

Aside from the standard campaign mode, there are specifically online modes such as scavenge and versus. Although I enjoy the concept of versus, the infected are quite difficult to control in comparison to the survivors which can be pretty frustrating.

The one BIG drawback I would say about this game is it can be pretty buggy at times. Especially if you're an achievement hunter. Multiple times I've been playing with friends where they've got an achievement and I haven't for seemingly no reason. It can be pretty frustrating especially if it's a long winded achievement.

 Overall, this is one of my favourite games. Whether you're in the mood to grind for achievements or just play casually, this game will appeal to you. At the time of writing this review it's on sale but even if it wasn't I'd implore anyone to buy it since it is 100% worth the price."

5304,Amazing
5305,This game is very fun with mods I'll recommened
5306,"For the longest time I've always loved this game from the eerie tone of the game the silence of just standing still. The game sets the tone for action, creepy, and the heart racing rush of non-stop zombies coming your way. i highly recommend this game for the ones who love zombies, action, creepy setting, and of course GUNS!!"
5307,been playing since launch. Still holds up all these years later
5308,yes
5309,its sus
5310,"still holds itself up ,no other copies like this get to it's level ,I want to be proven wrong"
5311,Can’t believe I’m just now trying this game! I love it!
5312,A timeless master piece that is asking for a sequel. Even without one though mods keep the game refreshing
5313,i used a furry r18 mod where it puts furry yiff everywhere. i regret nothing.
5314,A masterpiece of a game
5315,Zombies go BRRRRRRRAIN
5316,mods make this game poggers
5317,"A great game, in it's own right.  Infact a rite of passage into gaming in this decade.  The game as standard has plenty to offer; but when you've overplayed it and getting a little bored, you can then ""mod it to death"", and play it all over again.

Ideal Weekend fodder to play with a few friends into the wee hours with a wee shandy and a  bowl of Haribo jellies, and big packet of crisps!"
5318,best game ever once everything is just anime
5319,Yes
5320,I've seen my brothers or uncles play this game...now i finally get to experience it.... FUCKING LOVE THIS.
5321,"fun to troll your friends

5322,ikill zombie yay
5323,"Still amazing even after years later, you can play this game over and over again and it still feels fresh, especially with all the mods you can easily install. This game is definitely worth buying."
5324,I haven't played it much but it's such a fun game it may be worth buying!
5325,"IT IS A MUST BUY, I wasn't sure about it for a long long long while but with the free weekend I played and then after playing the first campaign part with some friends I bought it immediately. It is a must buy especially if you have friends."
5326,"If I had 4 friends who liked this game, and who were actually available to play it when I also wanted to play it, I'd play this game. But I don't, and I don't like dealing with randos. I also hate stupid limited cheevos....which is exactly why I got the GOOD GUY NICK cheevo today, to put on my Showcase and remind me of one of the many, many things wrong with cheevo hunting.

That said, I like watching people playing this game online with their friends. Fun vids over the years. And watching that charity 100% cheevo marathon was cool. So, in all, I guess I recommend people play this game? It's well made-ish."
5327,"Cool
"
5328,I can't wait for the times when they will start using this game as an example for 2020

5348,Cool game to play with friends.

5364,"I've been playing L4D2 since it first came out which is why I have 4051.1 hours on it.  Fun game, lots of community made maps/campaigns/mods available, some good, some not so much.  

Definitely will keep you entertained if this is the genre that you like.

Shame they decided to kybosh L4D3.

Hopefully, the community will continue to put out new campaigns for old timers like me to play.

I encourage you to try L4D2 while it's free if you haven't tried it yet.

Cheers! Lock and load!"
5365,"helps me forget about my crumbling life

I love this game, honestly the most fun with a plethora of versatility in mods and campaign missions."

5372,"old but gold

shows what valve could do when they wanted to make a good game, looking forward for new games from them

would recommend a group to play it with"
5373,"This is probably my favorite PC game of all time. I love the combination of drama, comedy, and fear. The setting of rural Louisiana is very cool too--and I'm from that area! I keep coming back to L4D2 every year or two. 

For the zombie genre, this game is perfect. The controls are smooth, the level designs are all unique and interesting, the challenge scales itself somewhat as well. The ""director"" feature makes replays dynamic and keeps a player on his toes. L4D2 has some daytime zombie levels whereas L4D1 were all at night. I think my favorite level is The Bridge--that final scene is just so crazy!! I love replaying that one.

When buying this game, one also receives the Left 4 Dead 1 levels, which is a great game in itself! Overall, it's an incredible value!"
5374,especally with mods
5375,very good
5376,Fills the void my dad left
5377,I turned into a furry and shot a zombie.
5378,screamed so hard at a witch my voice went and caused me to gain a heart condition
5379,great game with a lot of replay value especially with all the mod support and custom maps the community makes.
5380,"Loving this game, it's pretty fun."
5381,"The second FPS game I ever played, first being L4D. Grew up with this game and it's quality, still a really amazing game. Excellent to play with your friends, especially if you want to pop some heads with a shotgun or run through countless zombies with a chainsaw only to get thrown across a portion of the map by a tank you could've sworn you were able to take on solo with nothing but your misused gardening equipment and a shot of adrenaline."

5451,Left 4 dead 2 will always be a masterpiece.
5452,why is this game
5453,"Basically the best zombies game I ever played, the game mechanics are well designed. So far I'm been playing from a long time from past accounts, as I'm playing with my friends and working on the campaign with my friends we are doing really well I honestly love this game, this game brings fun into the genre of zombie apocalypse. With the game ""No Room in Hell"" that was fun for some time but not as good as this game I think as I'm playing ""No Room in Hell"" I love the design of healing but I would not have the turning into a zombie stuff it just brings more death than finishing the chapter.. Personally, get Left 4 Dead 2....



Personally, Boldurr."
5454,"Great gameplay, mostly god awful fandom attached to it. :)

The amount of weeb garbage in the steam workshop makes me want projectile vomit like a boomer. The flashlight attached to you can barely light a room, much less help you see. And remember when I said god awful fandom? Well there are plenty of awful random nobodies that join public lobbies, that join only to make your gameplay experience insufferable. (Quick side note: the amount of plagiarism and art theft in this community is disgusting.)

Also, Versus mode is objectively the worst mode in the game, it's so one-sided I swear it was designed to attract the most toxic, racist, and judgemental S H I T H E A D S to join those lobbies and make both sides suffer. My recommendation: Download a lot of your favorite mods, replace your crap ass vanilla flashlight with a useful flashlight mod, avoid public lobbies like a plauge, create a private lobby for your friends to join you, and actually have fun!

Final verdict: 9/10
Random nobodies who like to make other players suffer with no justifiable reasons: 0/10 :)
Also Zoey and Zoey simps: -10/10 :)"

1, 2, 3!

There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn
I know your type: tall, dark, and dead
You want to bite all the petals off of my head
And then eat the brains of
The one who planted me here
I'm just a sunflower but see
Me power an entire infantry
You like the taste of brains
We don't like zombies
I used to play football
Road cones protect my head
I have a screen-door shield
We are the undead
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn
Maybe it's time to reevaluate
I know you have a lot of food on your plate
Brains are quite rich in cholesterol
You're dead so it doesn't matter,
Instead we'll use this solar power
To make a lawn defense at any hour
I like your tricycle
There's butter on my head
I'm gonna eat your brains
We are the undead
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn"

5469,"I have a crap laptop that can't even run TF2 without intense lag.
So you'd think i can't play this, right?
Wrong!
This works smoothly, and the game has lots of ragdolls, particles and other stuff but they don't impact the performance.
The game itself is the best zombie game i've played (After the masterpiece that is Half life 2)
And you'd also think that you'd get bored since there's only 12-15 campaigns?
nope, all of them are timeless especially when you're playing with other people.
Buy this, it's cheap and even cheaper on a sale (usually 1.09$ on a sale)
Valve games are masterpieces.
Side note : Don't buy Left 4 dead if you want to save money, Left 4 dead 2 has both games in it."

5534,"1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
6 oz chocolate chips, I used milk chocolate – semi sweet is good as well
1 tbsp milk
1 tsp baking soda
8 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature
2 tsp vanilla extract
1.5 cup gluten free flour, I used King Arthur Gluten Free All Purpose Flour Measure for Measure – with xanthan gum
1 large egg

In the bowl of a stand mixer, place the paddle attachment and begin to beat the room temperature unsalted butter. It will help when you then add the light brown sugar and the white sugar to the bowl. Mix them together for around 5 minutes on a medium high.
Scrape the sides of your bowl and make sure everything is incorporated. Add the egg and beat together for around 3 more minutes. The mix may look a bit curdled however it is totally fine. Add the vanilla extract and the milk and beat for 30 more seconds.
Add the gluten free flour and baking soda. Toss in the chocolate chips and mix until the cookie dough comes together. Place parchment paper (or a baking mat) onto your baking sheets. Make sure they are a few inches apart (if you do not place them a few inches apart, then you may end up with one massive cookie when you bake them).
Take your prepared baking sheets and use a cookie scoop to scoop the gluten free cookie dough balls and place them onto the baking sheets. Roll the cookie dough balls if you feel they are a bit off with their shape. Place the baking sheets in the fridge or the freezer for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 f and when it reaches the appropriate temperature bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. They will be a nice golden brown on the top. If you are worried that they are not quite done, lift the cookies and if the bottoms are golden brown then they are likely done. It may be that your oven rack is just too low.
You can allow them to cool completely on the baking sheet or transfer them to a wire rack to cool. You can store these cookies in an airtight container on the counter for 5-7 days or in the freezer for 3 months. If you freeze them, then you can bust out the best gluten free chocolate chip cookies whenever you have a craving over the next 90 days!"

5548,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5561,"This game, is hands down the best zombie games out there.
This game is one of those zombie games that are actually original (and fun), if you have the time and money to purchase this game then do it. Trust me, your money will be worth this game.
This game has it all: Survival mode, Campaign mode, Versus mode, Realism mode (if you favor a challenge when playing campaigns, Scavenge mode, Survival Versus mode, and even more special gamemodes.
And if you're a fan of Counter Strike, they even got the guns from the game (AWP, MP5, Scout, Krieg 552 (SG 552). Not only that, but the game is super easy to mod and the creativity of the workshop is crazy. Would you like to kill infected zombies with grenade launchers and chainsaws? Or, do you want to kill infected zombies with a Pepsi can launcher that is loaded with mentos, Of course you do!
Like bro, you can play the Resident Evil games on L4D2 through mods, though it won't be 100% accurate to the game for obvious reasons.
I hope this review was good, and persuaded you enough to think about purchasing the game if you haven't already."
5562,My dad has played this game since launch without mods. what is wrong with him
5563,I  really L4D2 i played it many times and with mods it's fun
5564,I have no comments. This game is the best. Bought it for just a dollar. WORTH IT!!!!

5618,"Left 4 Dead 2 is purely an amazing game with good characters, good gameplay, great level design, and overall a lot of active players to this day. It's definitely worth getting this game."
5619,Still one of the best games I ever played.
5620,"Left 4 Dead 2 is not a game you ever stop playing, you just take a few years to remember what reality is actually like until you delve back into the insanity of a modded Left 4 Dead game. I spent about 4 years taking a break from the hustle of playing Pc games, but when i finally jumped on Steam again, the first thing I wanted to do was to return to playing Hentai games. The second thing I wanted to do was get back into this masterpiece of a game.

If your worried that this 13 year old game might set your PC alight and kill you and your neighbours in the explosion, dont worry, the game still looks pretty good by modern standards circa 2022, yet even that guy who crashes playing Morrowind while talking shit about how great his PC is because Rakesh at the Dell store told him so, can play this game.

The game play, is well designed. After playing the game for a hundred hours or so you will learn how the game works, how zombie hordes spawn and how they are completely different from regular zombies. Every special infected has its own sound cue to let you know when they've spawned, I dont remember what half of these sound like since I've modded them to play Brittany Spears, or the less horrifying Ear rape of a monkey man sticking his penis in my ear. For reference anything under Expert difficulty is meant for children, are you a child? Im hope not. Why are you playing this game? I feel incredibly sorry for you, and I'm sure your parents will take full responsibility for your impending developmental issues.

The community itself, is incredibly hit and miss. I've had games with incredibly nice and sociable people, which as an introvert is an incredibly uncomfortable experience. I've also had games of expert with people who started screaming at me that committing suicide on a 3rd down is an optimal strategy, and that I'm effectively gimping myself by not using the defibrillator early on, for its 50/100 permanent health, and that instead of playing the game I should consider the rope.

In summary I give this game a very good score. It reminds me of the days when we had a variety of fun games. Before the fall of the Roman empire, which sent us tumbling into the dark ages, an era of technological decline. Where the only game we have, is Dark Souls"

5705,"STEP 1: ASSEMBLE BREAD INGREDIENTS
You’ll need warm water, granulated sugar, instant OR active dry yeast, salt, vegetable or canola oil and flour. That’s it!

STEP 2: DISSOLVE THE YEAST AND ACTIVATE IT BY PROOFING
This is a simple process that takes about 5 minutes. You can see a picture below what yeast looks like when it’s proofed. It’s possible to kill yeast if you use too hot of water, so aim for slightly warmer than luke-warm, or about 105°F. Combine warm water, yeast and 1 TBSP of the granulated sugar in your mixing bowl. Give it a quick stir and then let it sit for 5 minutes. You’ll begin to see the yeast puff up until it covers the entire surface of the water.

STEP 3: ADD REMAINING INGREDIENTS AND MIX
Add the rest of the sugar, the oil, salt and flour (You can use all-purpose flour OR bread flour!), then mix using an electric mixer until it’s well combined, about 2 minutes. You can mix by hand but it will take longer.

STEP 4: KNEAD THE BREAD
You might be thinking, “Wait! It’s already mixed!” Ha! Not so fast! Going through the process of kneading bread dough is crucial for bread with great texture. Kneading dough allows gluten to form which enables dough to rise better, be lighter and fluffier. you can knead by hand or with a mixer. I use the dough hook on my mixer and knead for 7 minutes. If you knead by hand, you’ll want to knead for 10-11 minutes, depending on how consistent you are.

STEP 5: FIRST RISE
Place your lovely smooth, elastic bread dough in an oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a clean towel. I think plastic wrap works better because it traps hot air inside and thus, my dough requires a shorter first rise. Be sure to spray the side of the plastic wrap that will touch the dough with oil!

If your house is cool, your bread will take longer to rise. In the wintertime when my house is cooler than normal, I like to turn the oven on for 2-3 minutes, then turn it off and let the bowl of dough rise in there. The oven traps the heat for a longtime and it’s the perfect atmosphere for rising dough.

STEP 6: PUNCH DOUGH AND SHAPE IT
Punching the dough down quickly releases any air pockets that have developed and helps your bread have a more consistent rise and texture. Shape your dough by rolling it gently into a ball and rolling it 2 or 3 times on the countertop so that the ball is more oblong. I usually punch down and shape the dough quickly, then place in a greased bread pan.

STEP 7: SECOND RISE
I like to do my second rise in a warm oven that’s not turned on. I turn the oven on just before I punch my dough down, then turn it off once I place the dough in the oven for the 2nd rise. It’s really only on for a minute or two, which is fine! The second rise will help shape your loaf of bread and takes about 30 minutes.

STEP 8: BAKE THE BREAD
You’re nearly there! Bread bakes for about 30-40 minutes. You know what I do to make sure my bread is perfectly cooked? I use a digital cooking thermometer! Fully cooked bread will be 190-200 degrees F. Bread recipes that include milk will need to cook until 200 degrees, but since this one doesn’t, I take it out once it reaches 190 degrees. The top will be golden brown.

STEP 9: COOL THE BREAD
Cool baked bread in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then overturn pan and turn loaf out onto a cooling rack or folded towel to finish cooling. If you leave the bread in the pan for much longer than that, you’ll steam it, which may cause some parts of your loaf to go soggy. No one likes soggy bread!"

5727,This game is a great fps online game! Definitely recommend if you like shooter online zombie games!
5728,"Well, this is a grate game. One of the best horde shooters out there only challenged in its aria be PayDay2. One of VALVe's grate works! And LFD2 is completely worth the price at 10$ but as for all games on steam wait for a bloody sail.

HOWEVER do not discount LFD1. You may say ""Well actually, Left for Dead 2 has Left for Dead 1 in it so it makes the original obsolete to buy."" And to that I say, Not exactly. LFD2 has the maps but, well you can think of the comparison easily as this.
| Left for Dead 2 is a better game mechanically wise, Content wise, balance wise, and variety wise.  |
| Left for Dead 1 is a better game as a experience, Its the same thing between Portal 1 and Portal 2 |"

5752,"Left 4 Dead 2 will turn 13 years old in a few months and it's (somehow) still one of the best and most accessible co-op shooters we have.
It's easy to learn how to play, even your mom's old work laptop can run it and I'm certain most of your friends already own the game.
You can play co-op or versus with random people online (usually we have around 10k to 30k people online at all times) but playing with people you know will make the experience way better.

Left 4 Dead 2 has all the content from the first game and a bunch of extra stuff, by the way. You don't have to buy both if you want to experience everything.
I'd say the game is definitely worth the full price but it does get on sale (75~80% off) all the time."

5831,"With extensive mods to upgrade textures and lighting, provide additional character models, replace the music, add features to the menus, and more, it gets much fancier than the default install. 

I could really wish for a mod manager a la Conflict Catcher 3: toggle and save sets of mods, troubleshoot via a combination of binary search and internal database of feature interactions & common mods that may interfere with each other. Also, as seemingly low-hanging fruit, it shouldn't mark mods as ""conflicting"" when they have copies of the same readme.txt or other non-game file.

Would be fancy if hordes would always seem to come from somewhere. They should spawn away from the players. Currently, they can spawn in a room that was _just_ inspected by a player who's still in by the doorway and while the room has no other way in or out (doesn't have breakable walls, doors, or windows aside from the one next to the player).

Maybe a hard-mode setting so zombies are drawn to more sounds, like gunfire and speech?"

Unlimited zombies just rushing you. Some people might like that. I think its stupid. If a zombie touches you you can not move until you kill it.  normal is fun but the changes from normal to advanced are too much so it goes from boring to almost impossible.

It's satisfying, fun, engaging, and addictive, and that's all multiplied by 10 if you play with friends. It seriously doesn't get any better than this."

5980,this game is really sattisfying
5981,very nice game
5982,"I wish I had the time to tell you everything that this game offers, how it is worth the buy in every way, and the amount of joy it has brought me in this review, but that would take so many years the world would end and would be 1,000's of paragraphs long. It's the perfect zombie game with fun characters, a good amount of maps, and an amazing amount of weapons. All of this with a still quite frequent player base. Buy it if you have the money, you wont be disappointed. I only really like to write reviews for games I'm truly passionate about, and that includes this game."

5999,i recommend yes
6000,"This is one of those classics that needs to be on your list of games played. 

Whether you like zombies, FPS titles, intense moments and challenging gameplay, you will find it all in this title. Both the first and second Left for Dead are classics and in the same way that CSGO still holds up in today's gaming scene, this easily stands up to that level of scrutiny. Game mechanics are smooth, work and the missions are straight forward in theory but special infected and hordes complicate them. Playing with friends is where this game really shines and provides so many funny, intense and butt-clenching moments that the recorded hours on steam don't do it justice as I played this for hundreds of hours on console. You can play as infected as well as survivors, you can invade other players runs as the infected and cause terror. You can solo queue, but that is a varied experience because you either get players who are speedrunning the levels or those who want to stop and fight everything and cause hordes after hordes to show up. This can be fun if you have played this game over and over, much like the individuals looking  for the chaos, but I think you are better off getting friends together for this one because the A.I. is not helpful at the best of times and as this relies on your fellow survivors looking out for you, its a major issue. But this is a brilliant zombie game and a definite recommendation from me!"
6001,"Its fun but there's lots of blood, the zombies will attack you from behind, infront and more. Its a good game."
6002,uh good gaym
6003,It's L4D2. You either love it or you don't.

"
6008,"Left 4 dead 2

A game where you realise there's mods... Then get jumped by cloaker from Payday 2, while being chased by shrek."
6009,"This is easily my favorite game ever. 

Pros:
- Probably the best co-op game play in all of gaming; rewarding teamwork and game sense over aiming and reaction time. (Aiming and reaction time are certainly rewarded just not needed)
- Simple and responsive controls but very high skill ceiling
- Very challenging on high enough difficult but it never feels unfair
- Tons of campaigns which are (mostly) unique and well designed
- Great game play loop that stays interesting for hundreds of hours (even on single player)
- Fantastic creature design both visually and thematically
- Engaging story and unique personalities for the survivors
- Satisfying animations and sound design when killing infected
- AMAZING soundtrack
- One of the best modding communities and a built-in mod installer made by Valve
- Great game for speed running

Cons:
- Some campaigns are really bad (crash course)
- Terrible survivor AI (can be improved slightly with mods)"

Used to be good with GOOD friends... then good friends moved on. Married.  Life. 

Then kid randos appeared who would pretend to be friends, wait until the very end of the game where y'all fighting to get on the chopper, boat whatever to freedom and kill you or blow the ending for 'fun' totally wasting your time.

After that happened like 9 times out of 10, I quit... Guess I moved on too, so the new childish generation could take over.

Never to return. Such is the  multiplayer 'internets' now ..."

Easy to pick up with a lot of difficulty options, extended content on the base campaign and mods to make it even better. For the price, amazing value. Pretty much kicked off the modern 4 player coop genre. Can be a bit repetitive as time goes on and requires a real team effort to succeed.

6228,"I have to say that this is probably my favorite game to play with other people, even those who aren't ""gamers"". It's really easy to understand and it's not overly difficult (unless you play on the highest difficulty settings obviously). It really never gets boring. The characters are hilarious and the gameplay is very solid. The zombies are zombies (and with plenty of variety too). I don't think there's a single person in history who has regretted buying this game. There just can't be."

6241,"who doesn't like ravenous hordes of zombies
"
6242,"Kill all sons-a-bitches, that's my 'ficial instructions"
6243,"This game is a masterpiece. I can think of very few games that come to the level of replayability like Left 4 Dead 2. The campaign never gets old or at the very least you're not easily bored by it. The weapons also feel and sound great to shoot adding to the quality of the game. The special infected are also very creative and can attack in their own unique ways; they are also really fun to play as in versus. One MASSIVE issue I have with the game is the Workshop. Jesus, I swear almost everything you look for on the workshop is filled with NSFW content. Other than the few issues I have with this game besides the NSFW stuff in the workshop, this game is amazing."
6244,I like the part where you kill zombies and dislike the part of friendly fire
6245,it has zombies and srsurvivors its 9.99
6246,"great zombie survival game, just get this instead of back 4 blood the playerbase is still alive and it's so much fun and way less expensive than back 4 blood"

6248,"Very epic. I love shooting zombies with Ena, Sam and Max and edd from Ed, Edd and Eddy.

6265,"A legendary game in which you will come alone and leave with friends.
A game on which more than one generation has grown up. And all this is said about the only Left 4 Dead series

Let's start with the fact that I was familiar with this game back in very ancient times in the year 2012. And then from every iron came about this game. The game has not been updated for a very long time, and is not being updated, but it is supported by players, releasing modifications in the workshop, new maps, new wrappers for characters and weapons, etc."
6266,one the the best fps games i have played
6267,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

6283,"Nobody told me this game has zombies in it, honestly pretty fucked up, I thought this was an island survival game. Beat my dad out of a fit of rage, fucking amazing game though"
6284,"there are reasons that why i play this game, because you can play up to 24-25 players on some co-op servers even after 12 years it still have amount of players, which makes back 4 blood inferior because they're only good at micro transaction cards plus l4d2 has workshop, so this is better and i really recommended it."

6292,GOOD GAME:)
6293,Played this masterpiece of a game since it was released. And after 10+ years I am still able to play and have fun and not get bored. Who wouldn't recommend this game.

6307,"Left 4 Dead 2 is simply brilliant, especially for a game released back in 2009. Loads of content with accessible and fun zombie slaying gameplay. Full workshop support that covers every nook and cranny of the game. Charming characters and varied environments. Built on the Source engine (a positive point itself). There is just about no reason that anyone shouldn't have a gem like this in their Steam library.

Highly recommended."

6315,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6381,"Left 4 Dead is all about survival, no matter what mode you're playing. The L4D games are about staying alive, your objective is to stay alive for as long as possible. With that in mind, there is some general advice that will help you through any situation:
1. Always keep moving. A standing target is an easy one to hit.
2. Work together with all 3 teammates - never go off alone.
3. Conserve ammo and supplies, only using when necessary."

6417,"Bought this game due to attention brought up in Back 4 Blood's launch and I'm happy to report that most of the aspects in this game have aged to perfection just as others say! -I fell for this game quick along with a majority of the vast communities that revolve around it. Note that for 1) The versus mode can be a little bit toxic as expected on a 10 year old game and that 2) I have yet to play Back 4 Blood so I can't really compare the projects myself. Anyways for the price point, the amount of content offered from the community and versus is huge!! -It's no wonder players can rack up as many as 1000 to 5000!! hours from this experience as it's just that fun and that replayable! So buy this game on sale or on the store page right now -I really don't care as it's very generously priced and have already purchased this game for many of my online friends"

6437,"I was surprised by the amount of story, which is conveyed mostly by the characters talking to each other throughout game play. There's really nothing I can add that hasn't already been said. It's worth the Overwhelmingly Positive review score :0)"

Definitely worth the 10 dollars."

"
6495,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6499,wow that was really cool
6500,10/10 cause you can pindown Nick as Ellis
6501,"If you don't want to read everything: I personally loved this game. It was really fun to play with friends, the mechanics are fun to play with, and all the gamemodes are great to try out. Overall a great game despite it's age.

Honestly I'm not much of a fan of shooter games in general, but L4D2 (and L4D) surprised me with how good it was. For me, the teamwork aspect of the game is great. Working with others to complete the objective properly, and also to warn others of special zombies that might be around, is just a great feeling in my opinion. Although this game is quite old, it still holds up quite well as both a standalone game, and a game to play with friends. I recommend playing through the campaign, and to also try out all the other gamemodes too."

6686,"I am a 54-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Left 4 Dead 2. 
I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing  Left 4 Dead 2. 
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. 
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son 
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam 
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
 since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Left 4 Dead 2. 
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games 
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought 
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."
6687,the dreams game is like a big monkey
6688,"You kill zombies and trashtalk with other people when all talk is on so its pretty much fun,chaotic and toxic but overall i highly recommend to play this game to pass some time and play cool ass custom maps and funny addons and cool addons too"

6707,"13 years later, no other game has topped this on what it does.  Closest would be Vermintide, though that one focuses more and fantasy and melee.  
This game is timeless.  The mods, the gameplay, the characters, the memes, and just the general fun of it all.  It's still a simple game.  A gauntlet through hordes of zombies to get from A to B.  A simple concept that works so well.  One that has stood the test of time.  I'm surprised not enough games try to follow this simple concept, with very few exceptions.  Sure the graphics aren't as great as games today, even back then it was simply acceptable.  But that's the thing about source games.  They're good enough.  You'll always find yourself replaying this from time to time.  You'll always go through the workshop to tweak the game to your very liking.  Like I said, timeless.  I'm afraid, if they ever make a Left 4 Dead 3, it won't be as great as this.  Here's to another decade."

6814,"this is one of best co-op video games of all time and also one of my most favorite games to mod through the workshop. 

imagine hearing joe swanson witch cry his lungs out while peter griffin boomer goes 'mehehehe' nearby. as you shoot snoop dogg smoker, a thick cloud of smoke bursts into the air and the 'smoke weed everyday' sfx sounds off. in the distance, your friends yoshi and big smoke are battling pepsiman trying to save dr. doofenshmirtz from the clutches of the Nostalgia Critic.

what has this game taught me? there is no god or devil, no heaven or hell. just the world we have made for ourselves."

6827,iy fun
6828,"I grew up on L4D and L4D2 expands on fun concepts and fun characters in a way that is engaging but not overcomplicated. Though I much prefer the first game because of nostalgic bias, the second game adds plenty to make it stand out on its own. The new zombie classes are more of a mixed bag (Jockeys are more mind numbingly annoying than actual problems, while Spitters if used correctly in the Versus mode can change the tide of the entire game) but the new areas are done well and the characters are written charmingly. Get this version if you want to play both games, get the original L4D if you want the full nostalgia factor, but overall L4D2 is a good game without being too far into or out of the shadow of its predecessor."

6860,gran bought it for me Christmas 2009. I was 9 years old and played it on my parents PC at the time. I was terrible at it and didn't play it often because I was absolutely terrified of it. That night I couldn't sleep at all and thought everything that moved  was a zombie. My family reassured me that there were no zombies and that if any broke in we had a shotgun so we would be safe. My family then put it near their bed and went to sleep to show me it was close by if anything happened. Later I still couldn't sleep so I went into their room and took the shotgun so i would feel safer. As I got back into bed with it in my hands my gran must've heard a noise so she came into my room. I got such a fright that I blew her brains out with my shotgun thinking she was a zombie. My parents ran in and saw the horror of my gran sitting there. I have never played the game since. RIP granny 1700-2009

DO NOT play versus mode if you don't have thick skin. People playing versus mode are GFuel snorting crusty keyboard elitists who sit on their thrones of swamp ass and kick any player who makes a minor mistake during gameplay. This is more of a problem playing as a survivor, but the infected aren't safe either. The solution is to just play with a friend who can vote against the kicks, but you still need thick skin to play with these people because they will drag you through the mud.

I still highly recommend the game though, it's great.

EDIT: Upon further examination, I have realized I am a whiny little bitch and need to git good."

6962,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a prime example of a true classic. It holds up today and it will hold up in the future. The same can be said about Valve's past titles. I bought this at least over a dozen times over the years and I don't regret any money spent. Endless fun, tops replayability loop, memorable characters and mods give so much. If you've never played $10 is easily worth it. The fact that I get so much more out of this game over a fully priced $60-$70 one today speaks volumes. 

So where the FUCK is Left 4 Dead 3? With Half-Life: Alyx I pray we see more VR games from Valve in the near future and I HOPE it's L4D3. I'd buy a headset instantly in such a scenario. At this rate however, I doubt we'll see it. Can't have high hopes."

7001,"It a great game co-op
It fun and easy to pick up
But those for just campaign
The thing is Versus mode, the worst part is people they were so many toxic, racist, selfish player, troller, and no care no game player.
And yes i already meet all of that player they always do what they want but never care how other people feel when see some such of a bitches player. And rage quit for didn't get what they want and made the game unfun to play. The best versus is the perfect versus game that don't even have these types of player. And don't care about the score game but what i care is fair game even if my team have a newbie i was ready to teach them how the game work and how to find the most fun points of this game."

7016,"The game itself is great BUT the community is playing from the release and even if they don't exploit the $hit out of the game (which is a quite rare case) you still won't stand a chance against them. And if you are playing in the same team you will get kicked. Don't buy it, there is no place for new players.

UPD. Yeah, if you have at least 3 friends you can play campaign in coop. and if you happen to have 7 friends you can play in versus mode, buy without thinking. But if you don't have any - meh"

7029,"Oh man, a review! Hoho, boy do I have one for y'all. Hey, I ever tell you about this one time my buddy Keith and I popped open a couple of beers and was playin' Swamp Fever Chapter 2? Yeaah......turns out- map is a reaaaaallllll piece of shit. Like some Mexican dude was on our team right? This dude. I mean, ho man! Not to get rude or anything, 'cause that's like bad karma and stuff- he wasn't the brightest tool in the box. Yeah, he wasn't going around settin' any world records or nothin', 'cept maybe bein' the world's dumbest teammate! Heheh, anyway, we were crossin' mud and bones to get to this giant jet plane that crashed like a couple of days ago and all of a sudden we hear this big dude in the distance...and when I saw him, I swear on MY LIFE MAN, this thing couldn't be less than the size of a truck! Man, Keith and I, we were mowin' down this guy with our rifles kind of like the movies, you know, and as we were doin' it, the Mexican dude rivera47302... pulled out our ONLY molotov and threw it at that son of a bitch! Now, I ain't no chemist but this map has all this water and stuff and that's just bad news for fire, you know? So Keith thought'd he try startin' a votekick to boot that guy off our team, but he totally left! And right as he was in the menu- I get SMOKED, yeah, and my buddy Keith gets humped on by this little dude! And the AI? Didn't even help or nothin', she just walked straight into the big dude like she was gonna kiss him on the lips! Haha!!! Accordin' to Keith, that was the worst time of his life. Ho man, at first it was funny, then it got sad, but then it got funny again...ho man...."

7085,"Personally, I consider Left 4 Dead 2 as the best party FPS to play with fun and delight. The base aim of the game is pretty basic: survival and rescue from the zombie hell. Also, from the side the game is simple too. However, the game's micro mechanics are made with passion. In addition, there are a lot of game modes make you not get bored for hundreds or even thousands of hours. Still one of the best multiplayer survival.
Don't forget to bring your friends along to have the best experience. Totally, 10 out of 10"

7119,"The funny zombo game where you can turn every opponent into a catgirl, and turn buff zombies into Shrek with ""It Has To Be This Way"" from Metal Gear Rising playing in the background. Yes."
7120,"This game is just one of the classics, man. And when I first picked it up, it really stood out to me because even at the time of it's release, (somehow it's gotten worse) there were soo many awful zombie survival games that were coming out and this game was really just a dime in the rough. The only problem I had was how quickly it released after the first but nevertheless, it stuck with me as a masterpiece. I love all of the characters and their individual little quirks. The gameplay is so utterly smooth and thanks to the director, it always fits your style and skill. The gore and gibbing physics in this game are so brutal and satisfying that I usually need a change of pants once I'm done playing. The score for this game is phenomenal and every sound effect fits perfectly. The multiplayer and co-op aspect of this game are so beautiful and are the #1 reason to come back for more to me. I mean there is nothing better than just getting three of your buddies and yourself to play the campaign with each other and just have a good laugh/time. Certain parts of this game can be a little icky, the main thing that sticks out to me is the AI companions if you're playing single-player, they're never helpful enough to ever want them over a real player. Another thing is sometimes the level design can be a little to linear, and I mean it is rare but sometimes it occurs that your in a very slim place and you're getting absolutely destroyed and you just feel cheated. And on the flip side a few time the level design can be too expansive and open and leave you confused, lost, or even bored, but that's also rare occurances. This has to be my top game to sit down and play while listening to slow, sludgy as fuck heavy metal and is really a childhood game to me that I grew up loving and still do."

7162,"In short, it's an easy playing game that does not get boring. Enemies spawn and come from different locations every time, even if playing the same level, and there are always more than you think which keeps you on your toes. Missions aren't incredibly long and offer neat maps to explore. Also, the Witch and similar enemies are a cool addition which make you slow down and plan when facing them.

Plus, there is tons of aftermarket content to download from Steam (Dimmsdale Dimmadome hat, for example) and there are some fun maps to grab as well.

 One thing: Survival is incredibly tough. Be prepared."

7164,This game kicks ass.
7165,shoot zombie
7166,so goooododoodododododododoood yes so good
7167,"On sale for $2, it's a steal. I played it back when it first came out on console, and it was good. Great pacing and action. The combat is good, and with friends a great game to have. Live is a little janky but hey overall a good game."
7168,"I installed 100 mods and the game was a fucking shitshow this is better fun than any game in 2022
"
7169,ayo we got a boomer

7175,gg. one of the pinicle games of my childhood that made it great!!!
7176,"Broke my friendship, shit game, shit rng, shit team, I do not reccomend this shit game. Do not play this, it will suck your soul and break your friendship."
7177,"Amazing game, been a fan on the 360 as long as I can remeber. I now play it on PC and its amazing due to the dlc's being free, the crazy mods/campaigns you can do, and how you can have fun overall,, except for versus but yeah the game is worth 9.99 and still to this day one of my all time favorites."
7178,"Best coop zombies game i have ever played. melee is on point, callouts are great, weapon diverity is very wide and i love the story they got going. been playing since 2009"
7179,"gud
"
7180,"I don't think I need to reinstate how good this game is, but I will.

This game is so bloody (literally) good to play with friends, even when solo you can have a blast by playing with the AI or even with the crazy mods, in what other shooter game can Jack Cooper from Titanfall 2 fight a buff Minecraft Steve with a comically large spoon while Payday 2 music plays?

The characters are fun and memorable, and the amount of unique dialogue keeps me coming back to see what funny stuff they say next. The campaigns that have changes in the layout are the best, like Dark Carnival and Dead Centre. Let's not forget those infected, from the Smoker to the Tank these dead bozos ooze with not only character, but also mystery fluids I dare not touch with a barge pole.

Oh yeah did I mention this game has mods?"
7181,it veri fuen
7182,boomer <3
7183,"mindlessly shooting zombies, pretty cool when you are high, drunk or bored"
7184,"God damn, this game brings me memories on the 360. A masterpiece indeed!"

7186,"An Amazing Game. Ages well with time, like fine wine. 10/10 would play again."
7187,I like it.
7188,"many years back when i was a kid i would remember me and my dad playing this on our XBox 360. Now I'm much older and have my own copy on Steam, its still as wonderful as I remember it being. The Characters are memerable the teamwork and campains are solid. and the mod support gives me more fun than I've ever had playing it on console!"

7260,"“I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.”"

7334,Left 4 Dead 2 is a game that likes to shoot fast and loose from the hip. Its feels frantic and wildly unrefined - as a new player its likely you'll find yourself shooting erratically in to a crowd of zombies and hitting nothing except your teammates. And they'll hate you for it - but you'll have fun nonetheless.

7407,Sepiks Prime Perfected cast an even greater shadow over the city. With his destruction our fallen devils will grow weaker. But we must stay vigilant. The Siva are crafty and they'll find a way to survive... they always do
7408,Good shooting game!!
7409,"i like the game, but i cant seem to get high gore settings enabled on the game, because when i kill zombies they fade away and they don't lose limbs. this doesn't make sense as my friend has this game too, yet they can play with original gore settings. pls fix this. btw i didn't find or change any gore settings, it was on by default."
7410,only problem is that the workshop has a ungodly amount of nsfw
7411,ye
7412,"2014 playing the parish spamming the jukebox trying to get re-your brains to play, playing all the l4d1 campaigns with the boys, 10/10 indisputable dont try"
7413,Coach is cool
7414,"One of my favorite games. Played this on steam for a couple of months and I can understand why players prefer playing this game on PC rather on Xbox.  With or without mods, this game is still fun. Playing with mods can get irritating with sometimes the game crashing randomly, but playing custom campaigns are cool."
7415,"Sort of hard to review, because ultimately you're just running around shooting zombies, but the ""running around shooting zombies"" concept is executed competently enough that it's decent anyway. I'd say it's worth playing if you have nothing better to do, as it goes for a cheap price and is fairly stable.

The loading times were awful on HDD, but a fresh install on SSD improved them somewhat. Keep that in mind if you're playing this."
7416,i want homelessmonkey to make a better version of the molotov!!!!
7417,This game is still very fun after 13 years because it aged like fine wine and with an active online playerbase you'll be able to find matches very quickly. Recommended for people who are looking for some online zombie action or an singleplayer experience with the campagin mode.
7418,"This game is like, THE, classic zombie shooter. It's disappointing that the team at Turtle Rock didn't live up to the hype for their next attempt."
7419,fun game gun go shoot shoot

7438,Game very good when u replace all the zombies as big titty anime girls.
7439,if you're a loser and have no friends dont play this
7440,zomgie
7441,this is a really fun game it was a good time of playing 4 six hours
7442,I used to play this game on the Xbox 360 all the time!!! I missed playing it and thought. Hey why don't I just buy some old classic games that I love. And I came across left 4 dead 2 I seen it was recently updated. I was so shocked this game is still being updated and cared for. Such a nostalgic feeling
7443,Play with friends and also have add-ons/mods enabled and you shouldn't ever grow bored of this game seriously it's so much more fun this way give it a try if you haven't yet there are many options in their workshop to choose from.
7444,"I played this game and the first game when i was a kid and loved it then and still do, the community update this game had is amazing and if you need to play a game to ease your mind and have a laugh this is it."

7458,"erm i liked it when the zombers went ""RAEEEIGHGHH"" really adds in the whole experience of being in a zomber apocalypso. Now on about cottage cheese, Cottage cheese is actually one of the best snacks of all time but you have to get it jusssssttttt right. If you don't, then the zombers will come after you. Anyways you don't want it too be too milky or it'll taste more like liquid but you also don't wanna have too much chunks of cheese or else it's just balled cheese. But yeah 9/10 cottage cheese and 8/10 left 4 dead 2. It's 8/10 because i see no significance of the 4 in the name.
Let me know what your guys opinion on cottage cheese is in the comments.
Thank you"

7470,"If you are looking for a chaotic zombie game to play with friends, then this is the game for you. 

Versus mode is easily the most played gamemode and most enjoyable if everyone stays in the lobby and doesn't leave. 

Survival maps are also really fun if you have time to waste and want to get that Gold Medal. (Most modded maps are good too!)

Mutations are also enjoyable if you are trying to spice up the game for yourself."

7525,"This is a game I've only picked up recently, but I do enjoy it quite a bit. The mechanics are pretty straight forward, nothing too crazy about it, it's just a squad of 4 people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, in the setting of a series of movies. (kind of meta if you ask me), plus this game pretty much has all of the stuff from the first Left 4 Dead, as well as having its own maps and modes. One of Valve's finest games, imo. Play it if you haven't already."

7579,penis is a very good substitute for egg whites for making most cakes
7580,"is it still worth the buy?

YES 
only if you have friends to play with though, this game is fun but can get quite old if playing solo for too long, mods help make it for fun for longer but it wont last you forever unless you have friends"
7581,"The fact no one has made a better or even updated version of this type of game is a crime. I've loved the game since it came out and it's one of those unicorns that only gets better the longer the game has been out. 13 years later the servers are still up and work perfectly. Matchmaking is quick. Starting a lobby and hosting is the easiest of any game out there. Just purchased it once again for this platform. 

No one could ever regret spending $1.99 to get this much quality content."

7710,"Rating:★★★★★

Left 4 Dead 2 Is possibly the MOST immersive zombie game I've ever seen, I mean the attention to detail within the timeline that it was made is honestly insane! now it's not as immersive as your tell tale walking dead, or resident evil, but it's definitely fast placed, and wildly fun with friends. I think my favorite part is the thriving modding community, personally I have 2 mods posted myself which is recommend you check out! but other than that, yeah 100% recommend to someone who needs something to keep them busy for a few hours"

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game for forty minutes.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
7724,just play and have fun !
7725,Great game
7726,it is a classic nothing else to say!
7727,you can shoot w*men

7732,This game so good nice very nice good good yes yes i like it
7733,Zombie peter griffin
7734,"Loved this zombie game from the 360 and still love it now. With the workshop, the game can be as wacky as you want it too which makes me love it more. A great game by yourself but definitely better with friends (and mods of course)."
7735,good
7736,otis from barnyard
7737,I really like this game  And my opinion is that this is very VERY. Good.
7738,Workshop mod makes it so the hunter causes me to experience an IRL Shia Surprise. 13/7 would reccomend.
7739,"It's a pretty fun game to play with your friends. So if you're looking for a multiplayer shooter to play this would be a good choice. If you have no friends then you probably shouldn't bother, since this game is designed with four people in mind."
7740,blaaarghhhhhhhhh need left 4 dead 3 real fast rn

7747,"cutting open zombies with a katana is satisfying
but if you install mods...

you can cut open big smoke zombies with a red katana idk i didnt read the workshop mod"
7748,"Nostalgic game, plenty of addons for you to subscribe, with a lot of stuff that satisfies most of us based on our preferences and likings. Its a very fun game especially with friends, hop on for some games and laugh as you get charged or mauled to death, or maybe even triggering an alarm car. Great value, and workshop is always updated with plenty of new maps and mods, so you wont get bored so easily. Just be careful when playing versus as there will be toxicity in almost every game you join. Rating: 9.5/10"
7749,One of the best game for beginners in fps and enjoyable game for aim training
7750,KIMOJI!!! feel like Orgasm just because the fun you get from having fun with friends and no worries in the world

7841,"Now I've played this first person apocalypse survival shooter when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and it is still a very fun game to play especially with multiple people! I cannot tell you how many times I've been jump scared by a horde of infected even when I knew it was coming. Don't even get me started on the soundtrack, it gives this tense feeling that you could be attacked at any second from anywhere. The voice lines from each character is amazing, from them introducing themselves to quick banter/down time chats between each other during the campaign. I would definitely recommend this game to someone who wants to play a first person type of game that involves zombies!"

7846,This game just never dies. GOAT zombie shooter game 100000/10.
7847,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
7848,"Mommy Witch pins me to the ground and 1 shots me.

7849,A zombie-fighting classic :D

7852,i love this games 10/10
7853,"God I love this game, I modded Waluigi, a Kangaroo/Orca, Mr. Krabs, and Blaziken into the game, and it's hella fun"
7854,"This game stands the test of time, it wasn't until Back 4 Blood released that I realized all the subtle ways Left 4 Dead 2 makes you more immersed within it's world.

The characters are dynamic. A lot of the environment is destructible. The music is client side and changes depending on what is currently happening. Zombies are damaged in unique ways given how and where you attack them.

Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece that STILL reigns as the must-have-staple of the zombie genre. It's a classic for a reason."
7855,i like this game a little bit

7989,"this is a great example of what a team based game should do. What I mean is that this game is focused a lot on teamwork and callouts for special infected zombies. If you are spread out then you get taken out one by one and lose. If I could offer advice, stick to doing campaign with friends because randoms are very competitve and angry if you mess up. 9/10"

8046,"This Game Right Here, Is A Flawless Masterpiece, Im Gonna Describe Everything It Does Right And What It Improved.

Improvements

1 - In L4D1 They Didn't Have Gibs Good Enough To Make Actual Realistic, Fun And Satisfying Experience While Killing Zombies, So They Added Red Mist Only And Just A Little Bit Of Gibs From Explosions Not As Much As The Sequel, In The Meantime L4D2 Improves It.

2 - L4D1 Makes The Special Infected Look A Bit More Casual, L4D2 Adds More Details And Decaying To Them. Example : L4D1's Smoker Has Less Blisters On His Face And His Clothes Look More Casual And Cleaner Like The Jacket Looking Considerably And Noticeably Green, While L4D2 Gives Him A More Decaying Look, More Blisters And A Bigger One At That, And They Remove The Jacket And Make The Shirt Have A Decaying Look And Feel To It And Has Dried Blood All Over It And Is Shredded, Similar To What They Did To The Hunter, In L4D1 He Had On His Arms Tape But Then In L4D2 He Now Has Barely Any Tape And More Decaying Skin And Little Blisters.

3 - L4D2 Adds 3 More Special Infected : The Charger, The Jockey And The Spitter
The Jockey Helps Taking Other Survivors To A Hunter/Charger/Smoker Or Even A Witch
The Spitter Is Similar To The Boomer But Instead Of Bile/Puke Its Acid Which Instead Leading Zombies It Creates Acid That Injures The Survivor And When Dead, Has Acid Coming Out, And May Even Serve As A Quicker Kill Like When A Hunter Is On A Survivor The Spitter Spits At The Survivor Taking Extra Damage And A Faster Death.

The Charger Can Charge Onto Others, Hence The Name, Hes Useful For Charging Others Out Of Windows Or Places That When Survivors Fall Into, They Die, Similar To The Windows Or Balconies In Dead Center, And Swamp Fever's Deep Lakes, Including No Mercy's Deep Water Or Buildings.

The Good Things :
They Punish You For Going Away From The Team, Because Special Infected Have A Much Bigger Advantage Similar How A Hunter Finishes His Time On A Survivor Who Abandons The Others, If One Latches Onto You You Cannot Take Him Out, Similar To Smokers And Chargers Spitters Also Help To Kill You Faster.

Sometimes The Team Have To Sacrifice Someone To Continue On.

And Final But Not Least, There Are Certain Things You Use To Get Yourself Out Of A Life Or Death Situation 

1 - Being Able To Slash The Tongue Of The Smoker Pulling You With A Melee Weapon Before Being Dragged Onto The Ground.

2 - Being Able To Kick A Hunter In The Process Of Jumping On You Before It Latches Onto You (Can Also Work With Jockeys But Their Faster, Better Reaction Time Is Needed),

3 - Kicking A Boomer Away From You Before It Pukes And Shooting It While It Doesn't Explode Near You Too.

(Those Are The Only Things I Know About  Avoiding Life Or Death Situations, There May Even Be Alot More I Missed).

Bonus : Comparison

L4D2 Has A Much More Stabilized And Optimized And Satisfying Experience, And Most Maps Take Part In Day Time And Is More Strategic With More Expansive Ways For Special Infected To Hide
L4D1 Offers A Horror Experience That Actually Does A Good Job On Jump scaring Players From Dark Places
And Most Of The Maps Are During Nighttime

And The Maps And Textures Have Lots Of Details And Past And Future Comparisons.

8054,"good

8055,"Pretty solid game for it's age. I just wished Valve make a successor game for L4D series, cause by doing so they'll do a justice to this series. But you know Valve can't count to three, jokes aside this is very good game, especially when you play this game with your friend. The fun you'll get will surely be multiplied. So yeah 4.5 out of 5. Nice!"
8056,Doesn't go old
8057,```aaaaaaaaaaaa
8058,buyed this game to play with friends but realised i dont have any

8065,"definitely fun playing online, i'n surely no one gonna do something mischevious to me"
8066,"The game itself is good. I would recommend this game if you are going to play with friends.

The online community however, is very toxic towards new and casual players. 

You will get votekicked for no reason in multiplayer, and there is no way to report or mute harassment from text chat."

yes, it's my favourite zombie game ever."
8079,meidc
8080,"my ""parents"" disowned me because i was yelling about how valve should make L4D3 at 3am... 

i also modded the game so much and now i don't even know what it's about anymore -- i just have a bunch of angry cartoon ducks running at me while dr. eggman, hugh neutron and waluigi help shoot them down

10/10, would recommend -- (nick my beloved <3)
get it with your friends, and play together! every steam library needs L4D2 

this game heavily emphasizes on co-op gameplay, and so it is best played with friends with voice chat on. although you can still play it in single player (where the rest of the team will be controlled by ai)

if zombie and/or shooter games aren't for you just make all the zombies donald duck, even if you are just make all the zombies donald duck, it's worth it either way,, 

JUST GET THE FRIGGIN' GAME ALREADY!!"
8081,"zombies/shrek tank, anime tiddies. yes"
8082,"definitely one of the best horde shooters of all time, basically the king of the genre. A lot of replayability due to the director and the hordes upon hordes of mods in the workshop which can make the gameplay all the more fun."
8083,gnome
8084,hehehe shoot zombie with shotgun... zombie no more
8085,"This game is very timeless. Although I have an issue with Versus, being that players there will votekick you if you try to be a smartass or a simple, small mistake especially in positioning. However, it's still a great game overall and you will have a good time with your friends. 20/10 would recommend, my favorite characters were Coach and Louis. Louis with his screams are godly, peak voice acting honestly."
8086,"Left 4 Dead is still going strong in 2022, and shows no signs of stopping.

Valve learn to count to 3 and release Left 4 Dead 3 on Source Engine 2.

8088,SPOOKY CLOWN SCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARCE MEEEEEEEEEE!
8089,nice
8090,"You better not come on here rappin

Dont come on here rappin im stackin makin it happen"
8091,"Amazing game, completely filled with nostalgia. Definitely the best zombie game on the market. My only complaint are add-ons automatically re-enabling themselves on launch."
8092,"from the first game, to the second, i've been a fan since age seven; my heart full for the blood and guts, the horror, the guns, etc. all up my alleyway. i've loved l4d2 for as long as i can remember; and i cannot see myself growing tired of this game for many years to come. the amount of times you can replay it, find easter eggs, new knacks, tricks and such, brings out the little things, making this game fun. i've made the most beautiful memories and have had the most memorable times in my life, just through this game. it's dear to my heart. 

the graphics aren't bad at all for a 2008 game. there's some kind of charm to l4d2, whether it be the well-done soundtracks, campaigns, survival and versus gameplay; i continue to find joy in getting on and playing a match or two. i've met so many cool people here. the fan base is insane, and i've genuinely enjoyed the interactions i've had (aside from the griefers, but to be expected). the workshops are by far my favorite, which add little tinkerings and such to the game, which make it even better than before. so much talent displayed through these items.
please do get ahold of the general basics of the game. play through all the maps, grow familiar with them. there are so many people who play, and do not understand much, and ultimately, suck balls just w/o trying. especially on versus maps, if anything. at least have enough skill, and gradually get better at the game. it is cheap, and allows so much, provides quite a bit. l4d2 is still such a competitive game, and holds value to most who play on the regular. 

honestly, i do recommend this game for any zombie apocalypse enthusiasts, who enjoy first person shooter games, with the ability to play online, with friends; and of course, if they aren't extremely heavy on spectacular graphics. the gameplay makes up for all of that, and the memories made are for a lifetime. take a spin, and see how it makes you feel. :3 <3"

We enjoy trolling together and eating burger king while we play. We tell other kids how poor they are while we smash our fast food. Life has been much better since the wife left us to achieve her dreams dancing at the ""Lusty Adventures"". Even with all my overeducated snark and large bank account couldnt keep her around. But my little jerks and I have Left 4 dead. We spend part of our day gawking at zoey and wish she was the mom around here. Duel wielding some guns and dishing out meds whenever one of my little goblins mouth off in real life. 

Do I suggest this game? Why ofcourse. It has helped shape me into the undeserving prick that I am today and you can be too by playing Left 4 Dead 2."

Granted, I am also using a PS3 controller, but I find the game borderline impossible to play. The stick sensibility is super finnicky, and even at the lowest its still difficult.

I know this will go onto empty ears, but damn I'm sad to play the same and then just straight not be able to."

8295,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8431,"If you don't have friends to play this with, I don't recommend getting it. It's not really built for single player. I haven't tried the multiplayer because I have no friends to play with so I can't speak for that. I got a refund after about 10 minutes, I learned the hard way that there really isn't anything to do by yourself."

8445,"one time, i decided ""hmm, today i am going to buy and then play the hit zombie first person shooter 'Left 4 Dead 2'
so, i went into quick play and started a match.
everything was normal, until i realised someone in the game had a really weird looking profile picture, and i thought to myself, 'hmm, that is quite the strange profile picture'.
and then, i realised they were hacking the game so that every round their zombie kill count would be 69.
this game is a masterpiece and the community is awesome. 10/10 would play again"

8478,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

This game is unique in it's experience because it is ALSO a puzzle. I think the safe-house checkpoint system is one of a kind. 

And heres why I love it;
This has been and will always live in my heart as my favorite game. When this came out in 2009, my mom bought it. As a young gal' I loved zombie related anything. I played this game for 7 years straight at least once a week, until I graduated high school. I still play this when time allows because it's a great game."

8639,"Being a 2008 game, it has the best gameplay needed in a zombie shooter game. I got this game for Rs. 69 in summer sale and I think it is totally worth it. I am loving this game playing with my friends in co-op. There are a Variety of guns and explosives and the level designs are really enjoyable and gives thrill vibe to the match😍🔥 And the main thing is that this game still has the server after 14 years in 2022.

8693,Very Fun Zombie Shooter! Great casually and the mods are insane
8694,It has been 13 years since the release of this game and it's still one of the best zombie mode games.If you like to play zombie mode games i strongly recommend you this game.
8695,gud game
8696,"Blood, Gore, Drama, ROMANCE!!, this is the best game to play darling"
8697,"Whether you play for 20 min or 20 hours at a stretch. L4D2 is amazing. So much fun, adrenaline and monster annihilation. It actually has a bit of a ""per chapter story"" and you want to help the characters survive, not only playing with friends (which is excellent!) but on your own. Even though my account indicates only 28.2 hours of play I have played much more offline in a single player campaign mode. It is the epitome of a zombie/monster game. Quick if you like, or take your time. But beware, if you take too long to explore, they will come for you. Relentless, screaming, disturbing hordes of flesh ripping, in your face demons. What more could you want?!"
8698,zombies
8699,fun multiplayer
8700,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to read this review. My thoughts and my view do not represent or dictate anyone else's view but my own. I purchased this game recently in an attempt to believe that I was going to have fun and enjoy the game. However I have come to learn as I have played the game that the monsters and zombies that are in the game are completely unrealistic they have rigorous health and that the physics and the Dynamics and the reality of the game is complete b*******. the zombies in this game can kill you with one hit or they can knock you down either way but yet if you have a semi automatic gun or a 50 caliber rifle and you shoot one of the zombies or the charger or the tank nothing happens it just like nothing. I understand when developers won't to make a game and they create a game for enjoyment and content purposes but there has to be an equal chance for both player as well as the game itself. Let me put it this way and I'm going to say this very frankly. My 4 year old son would rather go outside and eat dirt rather than play this game. my grandmother would rather experience death than play this game. My dog would have more enjoyment licking his own ass than playing this game. the best thing that the developers can do for this game is just a simply take it off the steam Workshop because it is not enjoyable, it is very unrealistic, there is no equal balance between player and game. And it is horribly made"
8701,favorite game
8702,pro
8703,"eh, it's alright."
8704,funny man shoot zombies
8705,yea

8709,One of the best zombie games out there! 11/10
8710,I can become an anime girl that shoots
8711,"Good game, even better when it goes on sale, which (if I remember right) is often. Witches and Tanks are creepy and anxiety inducing for me, but I can deal with it.
I don't like the PvP, players can get really toxic and that I can't deal with, but good thing I prefer PvE.

10/10 Would play Zoey and Nick again"

8719,Best zombie game ong
8720,"the best first person zombie shooter in the world with a great plot, weapons and characters. they game is played so well and fluid for being released in 2008-2009 and the graphics are better than alot of games from 2010-2017.  

(if i had to complain, its because you cannot aim) 
otherwise a great zombies game!"
8721,"game ini sangat mengontol, A proff So gud and tasty"
8722,"One of the last and few good co-op shooters to not rely on player progression or RPG systems. There's no unlockables, no carrots on sticks. It's all about simple joys, short term goals, and your own mastery over the game. You simply choose a campaign/gamemode and hit the ground running.

On the flip side... the game is plagued by many annoying mechanics, exploits, mouth-breathing bot AI, and one of the worst pub experiences of any game. That being said, you can mitigate most of these issues by playing with friends and/or using mods.

There was a time when zombie fatigue and 100+ hours had me loathing L4D, but after seeing so many other co-op games come and go, I've come to appreciate this one's remarkable staying power."
8723,Genocide
8724,"As in the style of any other average steam review of being super vague, this is a pretty fun game. Everyone's experience is different depending on what add-ons are used. In my playthrough, you get to play as Big Smoke, Woody, Pepsi-Man, and ENA. You have to fight your way through waves of Minecraft zombies while also looking out for such enemies as Gaston, Sandy Cheeks, Asui Tsuyu, Wario, some dragon loli, and the Nostalgia Critic. These main enemies will hinder your progress, but isn't too overwhelming and causes some short but intense games. Beware of two other special enemies, Terry Crews who throws old spice rocks at you, and a bitch who claws you to death. Overall definitely worth the $10"
8725,Can't wait for the 3rd game!
8726,Pretty fun
8727,classic but not more classic than cs 1.6 zombies servers
8728,Kill zombie is good
8729,"Great game, if you like shooting zombies and chaos modding communities, then your gonna love this game, not only is the community servers are always active and alive unlike COD: Vanguard, they also pump out cool addons and such for your entertainment needs and chaos filled journeys. You will actually have fun playing this game due to it being so addictive, I recommend playing with pals for more chaotic experiences, also check out the other game modes to spice up the game-play. Other than that I give the game a 10/10, personal bias but still fun and you should definitely check this game out."
8730,e
8731,This game I feel like is the perfect way to do a co-op shooter where teamwork is REQUIRED. I played the console version most of last year up until this week and it feels so crazy and fun to play. Best zombie game I've played in years!
8732,graet game vary fun and fuuny
8733,Excellent zombie shooter that outshines even newer horde shooters in terms of ai and gameplay

8739,"this game is very fun but you almost need 4 friends with the game willing to play. the bots are kinda fucking stupid.
"
8740,"On VS, everyone just rushes and assumes you have 200 hours of gameplay, knowing each and every map, they do not wait and when you go down and it's up to yourself to get back up...... wait that's not an option. I'm not even exploring I'm just trying to keep up. Play the campaign online, very fun and learn every map before jumping into versus. I'm by no means saying everyone is like this but it only takes 1 bad apple to spoil the game."

I can be duke nukem with yoshi and Pepsi man helping me shoot minecraft zombies. Then I realise I'm low on health so I whip out a steam deck and start doing the gangman style to heal up. Then I Rochelle (the character I forgot about) yell ""SEXUAL PREDATOR, RAPIST"" When a jockey walks by. Then whenever I hear her say ""EMO"" ned flanders comes and beating the living shit out of me while bass boosted in the end is playing. As i die I hear lullaby of a dead man and contemplate life. 100/10 would recommend"

8799,"This game has provided many years of entertainment for me. I first had it on the Xbox 360, and now on PC. The console version was a very fun experience, but the PC version is even better. Everything about this game is perfect, the lore, the gameplay, it's just excellent. I love this game with all my heart, It is not just any zombie game out there, it is Left 4 Dead, an instant classic, when you say the name, everybody knows, and everybody loves it, I am one of those people, and 12 years later, it's still a healthy populated game. This game will never die, it's just invincible."
8800,best fucking game
8801,Where's Left 4 dead 4?
8802,nice
8803,"Kill zombies, kill bigger zombies. Survive for a long time, escape. A good game if you have no friends, or some friends. Well rounded weapons, with a good community to play with online."
8804,this game is very fun to play with your friends specially when you are bored
8805,Did I ever tell you about the time my Buddy Keith drowned in the tunnel of Love?
8806,Lor bang
8807,OK
8808,"This game came out 13 years ago as i'm typing this and its still one of the best zombie games of all time. Whenever i play a first person shooter like battlefield, call of duty, insurgency sandstorm, team fortress 2, counter strike, etc... It always felt to me like i was never working or supporting my teammates, like everyone in the lobby was playing as a individual running around doing their own thing. This also applied to me when i played battle royals because the most amount of teamwork your going to do is revive someone and make call outs.But left for dead was special, because the game was DESIGNED around teamwork. Sharing your healing supplies, reviving your teammates, getting saved from  special infected,  protecting your teammate who got boomed, and that's just the start! Ironically ""left for dead"" is one of the best examples of a team based game. Sure, maybe a 3000 hour player can bunny hop his way through every map without taking any damage all by himself but most players are going to have to stick together to survive because of the mechanics turtle rock studios and valve have implemented.

Now just from that left for dead 2 would be a good game but there is a reason why people can put so many hours into the game and still enjoy it and that is because of the director. the director is a AI that controls the zombies, health and ammo pickups, and can make changes to the map based on the current situation, status, location and skill of each player. For example lets say that you play the same map twice with the different players. The first team you played with are good so the AI director spawns more zombies and less medical supplies. But on second play through you get stuck with bad players. so The AI does the opposite, it spawns in less zombies and more meds. This is just a simple example but there are so many things and variables that this AI can change that playing the same map over and over again will still have a new experience to enjoy. 

Now just from that left for dead 2 would be a great game BUT WAIT THEIRS MORE! Special infected are zombies that have become mutated and now have special ability's. These zombies have became the corner stone of the left for dead franchise because they are the biggest factor to why players need to stick together. There are 8 unique special infected all with their own unique ability's. 4 of them are what i call ""Pinners"". They are named hunter, smoker, charger, and jockey and if they successfully pin you ( GET IT?????) you wont be able to escape without your teams help. There are 2 support infected, the boomer is a bloated zombie that throws up on its victim (doesn't that sound nice?). You will have impaired vision and a horde of zombies will spawn and come for you. The spitter stomach spits acid that can be used as area denial or help do more damage on a pinned survivor. and finally there are the 2 boss zombies, the tank and the witch. The tank is a big hunk of meat that has a large amount of health and does a lot of damage with his ranged attack  (literally grabbing the concrete off the ground and throwing it at you) and his melee (bitch slapping you so hard you propel 20 feet). And finally the last special infected: the witch, she wont attack you unless provoked and can be avoided entirely, if she is startled however she will rush after the person who startled her, unless she is killed she will one shot them to incapacitation or death depending on the difficulty.

left for dead 2 would be a amazing game already BUT NO THEIRS MORE.
The writing, the map design, the character design, and the small details adds so much personality to this game. There are 8 playable survivors that you will quickly learn to love, their names are Bill, Zoey, Francis, Louis, Coach, Rochelle, Ellis, and Nick and each one of them is unique because their of their character design, voice, personality, and their own animations. Simply asking multiple players their favorite character will bring varied answer due to the amazing writing,voice acting, and designs of each character. Just trust me when I say that their dialogue can bring a smile to your face. The maps are vastly different from one another ranging from a carnival to a airport, a hospital to a swamp, a large city to a flooded town. each map brings a new atmosphere and they are all masterfully design for human and zombie players to enjoy. there is also another director, the music director, it will play music depending on the situation that you are in, so if your fighting a big horde of zombies you will have intense music playing. if a special infected spawns they will have their own unique music cue,and if a tank spawns in you will hear its distinctive music track.

And with that should explain why- THEIRS STILL MORE, JUST ONE MORE PARAGRAPH I PROMISE.
Besides the main campaign there are multiple side modes in the game, but I'm going to be brief for their are a bunch of side modes and i don't want to stretch this review any farther so i will only talk about the most popular ones. There is survival where you survive as long as you can in a small part of a map. Mutations where you can choose between a bunch of random special modes such as having only tanks spawn in or having a rocket jumping grenade launcher. and the most popular side mode where i put most of my hours in is versus mode, a 4 vs 4 mode  where one team tries to get as many points as they can in a chapter while the other team stops them by playing as special infected and try's to kill them. after the round ends the teams will switch sides and after that round is over it will go to the next chapter till the end.their is also the community workshop where you can download mods that can change character models, add more maps, change weapons, and much, much more.

Now this game is a masterpiece don't get me wrong but i do have a few nitpicks with it. There are still small bugs that you can find,the game does not get nearly enough updates as it used to. the player base is what I describe as a bunch of angry, edgy, lonely, and horny teens being as toxic as they possible can be. And lastly the game can lag a lot depending on the host of the lobby. And that's it, that's all of the nitpicks i can think of for a 13 YEAR OLD GAME.

with all of this in mind, that is why left for dead 2 is such a masterpiece.

thanks for reading.

9244,"So I (19M) was sitting in the Living room watching Morbius. My parents(senior citizens) visited to come check on me. They caught me watching Morbius and they got very upset because I have been through phases like this before. I convinced my mother (55F) that Morbius is great, but my father (56M) disagreed. So I yelled ITS MORBIN TIME and may have beat the living shit out my father. My mother(idiotic) then said YOU DID THIS LAST TIME DURING YOUR NFT PHASE so then I plunged her to the depths of Tartarus. My sister (19F) and her friend (18F) saw me and then tried to run so I yelled OH NO YOU MORB'T and morbed so much they died. I at this point, had almost become God. I had blown up my house and set on fire to get rid of the evidence. At this point I, (20M) have been running from the CIA, the FBI, the police, the Secret Service, Interpol, the UN security unit, Disney S&P, and Google Maps. I have almost reached the final phase of morb. Soon my original being will die off and I will morb in the final morb. I morbing regret morbing Morbius. Oh morb. Im gonna morbing morb myself. Morb this. Morb it all.
TL;DR I killed my dad over a movie and ended up internationally wanted."

9253,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

9267,i need left 4 dead 3
9268,"It's still awesome even over a decade later, and beats out a lot of current competition in the co-op shooter genre. The campaign is still really fun to play through, as well as the versus mode, and past that there is workshop stuff that adds heaps more content to play through. Highly recommended."

If there was a  more true game like this i would play it would not recommend 100% and more unless you have friends to play this game with. Do not buy unless you have friends how want to do this game with you."

If you have completed all the campaigns and have nothing else to do there is mods to give you some more things to do. Playing with friends gives the best experience in any of the campaigns.

9591,"Pretty easy to get into and never gets old.
Communication is super important and for the most part, toxic players are dealt with swiftly.

Although I do only recommend you play this game casually in a co-op setting. VS gets pretty toxic and kicking new players for making mistakes is very common. If you wanna power through that anyway, good iuck to you.
Casually this game rocks. Just turn your brain off and spray."

9607,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

9724,haha brr
9725,"Even if this is made like a decade ago, this game still slaps and age like a fine wine.."
9726,Nostalgia! Harder than the XBOX 360 version? Damn I love it!!!
9727,This game is a masterpiece.
9728,"This game is good with the graphics and functions, the fact that its made in 2009 its mind blowing. Though as expected there are very small bugs and glitches, like when a smoker grabs you through a fence gate and you get stuck in the gate and then get softlocked. But overall its not disappointing and worth the price."

9738,"A long time ago when I was a kid I started playing with the second part of Left4Dead, and I'm very sorry about that( After all, the story of the characters crosses with the first part, I advise you to start playing it with it!
Still, the game from Valve is not worth missing, even if the game is more than 10 years old)"
9739,better than B4B
9740,"i've been playing since i was a kid but that was all off steam, and even to this day i love it and will play it every day"
9741,shot down 2000 dark latex creatures as the doom slayer with a Hyperbeast AK-47 and an Arkright killer whale pillow so it's pretty fun

9756,"Cult classic zombie shooter that sparked memes like ""BBQ bacon burger"", really great with friends and there's just so much to offer. Then when you think you're done don't even think about it, the workshop community for this game is amazing. you can have silly things like reskins for characters and zombies (zombie witches could be gruntilda from banjo and kazooie or your ally named coach could be spider man for example), or even random things like you flashlight shape (for example mine is big floppa). There's just too much too offer here its amazing. especially when its on sale you get WAY MORE than your moneys worth."
9757,i love this game more than my own family pls make a 3rd one
9758,"one of the only co op zombie shooters that actually encourages teamwork, play this when ya really wanna get together with your buddies to relax from all the warzone craze or whatever's mainstream at the time you're reading this lol"

9760,Always a great mess around game
9761,Very Nice. I would let it date my daughter.
9762,i recommend Left 4 Dead 2 because it holds both the left 4 dead 2 campaign and the original left 4 dead campaign along side the DLC and the mods that are in the workshop to change player models and changing common and special infected models creates funny moments with friends
9763,Toxic wasted 2 bucks reeeeeefund inbound.
9764,"Good game, it is so flexible in putting mods you can make the smoker squidward from spongebob, very cool."
9765,Download furry mod because it make better (pyrocynical approves)

9790,"ITS REALLY FUN the thoght of being in a zombie apoclpilse sorry i dont know to that
plus it teaches you how to survive if one Does happen but thats not going to happen right?????"
9791,"yes
"
9792,"Where do i even begin, this game is and will continue to be my favourite game of all time, been playing since the Xbox 360 days.

Gameplay: F*cking brilliant, the game is based around teamwork, the special infected are designed to punish bad teamplayers. Think its an okay idea to run off on your own? Nope. game will spawn a hunter to pounce on you and rip your guts out. this teaches new players. ""Oh maybe i should stay with my team so the hunter doesn't kill me.""

Sound and music: Most multiplayer games don't have music because it tends to ""get in the way"" but L4D2's music helps you know whats coming and heightens the horror experience, all the special infected have their unique sounds and music themes for when they have spawned, idling and attacking. For new players hearing a Jockey's maniacal laughter or the Boomer's deep gurgling of vomit will make those cheeks clench. Hell, i still get uneasy when i hear the Charger violently muttering to himself.

Characters: Don't get me started on the characters we'll be here forever. All i'll say is these 8 legends still make me laugh to this day.
""Ugh what's that smell?""
""All i smell is ribs.""
""Because all you you think about is ribs Coach!""

Theme: The original L4D's theme was ""We are f*cked but we'll keep going"" but this one is more ""F*ck yeah kill zombies"".

Its full of stuff that you miss if you ignore all of the games lore which is fine i understand most people are not playing this for story and talking about the story, its nothing special but still good with amazing world building (At the beginning you have C.E.D.A's lacklaster response to the outbreak and the end where you have the military's cold but needed bombing of New Orleans) the games not depression fuel but its not a full out comedy.

The community is (99% of the time) super friendly, ive met so many awesome people because of this game.

even if you somehow get bored of the game there is a thriving workshop full of amazing items. Stupid items and amazing stupid items.

Just buy it, it goes 3aud on sales."
9793,amazing
9794,quality and nostalgia

9852,this is the best co op shooter ive ever seen i recomend this game to any that wants to have a bloody zombie moive come to life
9853,"When I first sat down to play muck I was expecting a bad free to play meme game. And what I got, was a New, Unique, and frankly Breathtaking take on the survival genre. This game is incredibly nuanced, with an extraordinarily deep, Intelligent, yet still challenging story, that will play with your emotions at every turn.

What this game feels like, is as if you gave an expert team of developers an infinite budget, and no time constraints, and told them to make what they want. Further, the graphics that this game provides are some of the best looking, realistic graphics that I've ever seen come from a video game, and it manages to keep My PC cold while doing so.

This game has one of the most intense, and rich story's out there, good enough to rival the likes of RdR2, the entire persona series, the kingdom hearts games, and much more. And with doing all of this, the game is still able to make downright genius social commentary on many real world issues. but not so much that it hampers the story in any way.

To play this game for free, truly is a blessing, Anyone who is out for money knows they could make millions off of this tremendous piece of art. and while, maybe we cant pay for this modern Picasso we can support the creator in other ways

9867,"The whole game in 1 line-  [b] Senseless killing of zombies [/b]

Also, why does it feel like it's on the hardest mode even when it's on easy, why do I die so easily in the game?
Millions of zombies come running towards you and you are left with no choice but to just use guns.
Little to no storyline, please play 'The Evil Within' if you need one.

Great for kids/adults who just need to fidget the Left Mouse Button.

P.S. The gameplay is exactly how I feel during my end terms--TRAPPED in a never ending horde of zombies where I am sure to never survive."

9903,fun game alone. even more fun if you have friends
9904,"Left 4 Dead 2 is still to this day the best cooperative shooter I have ever played since I first started it on my Xbox 360. Anytime my friends and I want to play a game together, I can always rely on this game to provide hours of fun and engagement. The game from start to finish in almost every campaign feels like (and sometimes literally is) a well-paced roller coaster of high-action zombie evisceration and careful scavenging for supplies to make it through the horde, and to the exit door.

The Steam release of Left 4 Dead 2 includes all DLC, as well as all of the original Left 4 Dead's campaigns. The game is packed with infinitely replayable content that is aided even further by the campaign levels' dynamic nature, which can create different routes and thus different strategies each playthrough. The main factor in Left 4 Dead 2's replayability however is the in-game Director, which alters the game as you play according to how you play. This includes sending a zombie horde during a period of extended rest, or placing more health packs throughout the level if your team is particularly injured.

The Southern United States setting of Left 4 Dead 2 lends it to more visually distinct and sunny environments than the generally moody and dark levels of the original Left 4 Dead. The classic zombie shopping mall scenario, a clown zombie infested carnival, and the streets of a waterfront city particularly stand out. The same character archetypes from the original Left 4 Dead return, but applied to entirely new character designs and backgrounds. The leader Coach, the optimist mechanic Ellis, the pessimist conman Nick, and the caring producer Rochelle are memorable characters that players will grow to love over time.

While the overall population of the online multiplayer has declined in the many years since the game's release, it is still possible to find online lobbies in both cooperative and versus play. Online versus provides an experience entirely different from usual gameplay, placing players in the decrepit shoes of one of the special infected enemies to stop the survivor team from reaching the exit. There are 6 special infected in total excluding the Tank and Witch, and each has its own unique purpose and synergizes with the other special infected to create excellent team play. These special infected are of course encountered in singleplayer and co-op as well and act as the main threats among the sea of common infected, providing variety to a level's encounters. There is often a Tank in each level that acts as a boss enemy, and its behavior is as its name suggests; barreling down corridors towards the survivors and smashing anything in its path with a large health pool to boot.

I can confidently recommend Left 4 Dead 2 to anyone, it's hard not to enjoy this game. Left 4 Dead 2 often goes on sale for dirt cheap so if $10 seems too steep for you, you can very well wait a bit for it to drop as low as $2. In my opinion this is a must-play."
9905,what do you think this game is? Its left for dead! i dont say this as a in experienced gamer but no matter how old this game gets or how old we are this will always be up there in legendary games like minecraft and cod. btw i asked my friend for it and he gifted it to me so yeah kinda got it for free for those who care.

9954,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

The only downside is the picture quality. I don't like the picture quality of this game very much, but I understand it very well. After all, this game is very old and there is a time factor in it. If there is left 4 Dead 3, I would buy it without hesitation."

As someone with chronic game choice paralysis, a game needs to be good and replayable.
I also don't like number crunching on percents and bonuses and builds.
This cost me 13 dollars and I have the hours you see here, still entertained.
I'm a massive pussy so hearing a Witch gets me carefully peeking corners and triangulating her position, and when I hear a tank snarl... let's just say the campaign takes five to fifteen minutes longer, as I try and find where he is before accidentally letting him find out we're here.

Left 4 Dead 2 is the perfect 2009 zombie shooter, and none are yet to surpass it.
It's travel based, so no camping or arbitrary collect X fungus for the hut man. The environments are detailed and the director can spawn even laser sights just outside of where you'd look, so look hard, but also go fast because hordes and specials... it's a great blend of pacing and the Director assists that intent.

7/8 characters still hold strong to this very day, 13 years later.
The special infected design has been the icon for special horde enemy design - AVP, ""this one is like the Hunter"" - WWZ, ""This one is like the Hunter / Charger"" - Vermintide, ""this one is like the Jockey"" - and so on. The detail in their cosmetic designs still impresses and hints even years later, and their AI behaviour is harrowing considering the in-world apocalyptic scenario, with intelligent yet maliciously feral special infected stalking survivors and waiting behind corners.

The modding capability is the pinnacle of workshop support, but of course it attracts weebshit.

It's been one of the only games ever that has been worth the damn money. Screw that 60 dollar AAA 8 hour playthrough with no replayability, I don't give a shit about the graphics, 2009 source is all you need to make a game able to be read. I don't need 30 ridges and lines per polygon, I need to be able to distinguish what I'm looking at and not have a trillion particle effects and ability countdowns cluttering my screen.
But surprise surprise, all you need to make a game last is make it good. l4d2 has no meta progression, at all. No levels, no unlocks, no perks, no skills, no active abilities, no loadout presets. Just your skills and the luck of the drop. As such, it leaves even new players able to match a skilled one. After all, shoot gun into swarm coming through door. Nobody has an advantage just because they have multitudes more free time and got a big number, the advantage is skill. As such, whenever something happens, it's not because you didn't have reload speed 2, or shove stamina 3. It's because you need to manage limited resources. Only ammo is infinite, but bullets only hurt, every scratch counts. There's no 'press E to healing aura' bollocks.
Every attempted evolution of L4D2 has missed points of it. No meta progression, don't have dozens and dozens of guns, don't have 5 attachment slots, don't make infected be true bullet sponges, don't have a bazillion things to do, don't make the graphics an overdetailed mishmash.
It's disappointing, because we probably just... won't ever get another L4D, with maybe another new infected, more official detailed and ambiently horrific maps, another gun or two, a fourth throwable... But L4D2 is still playable, and it's amazingly bereft of bugs and glitches."

I used to play L4D2 on my XBOX 360 with my friends and it was always a fun experience no matter how many times we've replayed it. This is my childhood game and I am grateful for it and the amazing memories it continues to create now that I can get mods and make L4D2 even more chaotic. 10/10 the helicopter is certainly made out of chocolate"

10091,"Left 4 Dead 2. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this game. Even after 13 years [ at the time of this review ] The community is going strong and still is played to the point where it is one of the top played games on steam, and for good reason. Left 4 Dead 2 takes 4 players [friends, online, or bots] and has them attempt to get from point A to point B to safely extract from the Zombie Apocalypse. There are loads of maps, weapons, infected zombies, and story [though not traditional story telling more from character dialog and writings throughout the map and safe room]. There is also a multiplayer option that allows for gameplay for both survivors and infected. I wish that Value would understand that the fanbase is DESPERATELY wanting a Left 4 Dead 3 [No Back 4 Blood is not a good day and is not Left 4 Dead 3 in anyway. ] If you somehow have not played this game, Please check it out! Especially with friends."

10126,"Left for dead 2 
One of the greatest video games of our generation maybe even of all time. To experience such luxury for a fraction of what it's worth is absolutely astounding,brilliant,superb,astonishing,incredible,enlightening and pleasant. 
To gracefully slaughter the undead hordes, Is such a delight. No such elegance can be found in any media or activity. There is no saying how creative and charming the cast of characters are, truly the peak of human psychoanalysis on how to construct an array of characters. Ranging from a Hillbilly who's (questionably homosexual) to a scam artist who enjoys the pleasures of life such as making fun of the hillbilly and his companions.
It is not without saying the unique aspects of this game stem not from it's idea but from it's execute as the creative choice to implement original designs of the zombies which reside in this masterpiece and give them special traits which spice up the gameplay and make it 100 times more extravagant and enjoyable. 
It is safe to say and see that the game which you hope to purchase is without any question or doubt a MASTERPIECE."

Screw HL3, I want L4D3 before that happens. or something similar to it. B4B was very close on getting it right. If it was maybe made 5 years earlier, I think it would be the new L4D. But with the most recent expansion that couldn't happen."

Deep Rock Galactic, Destiny 2, Risk of Rain 2 are just a few options I have installed that feel far better to play IMO. Now I must admit none of those have the modding scene or the classic feel. Those I can admit are nice. However, I just get really bored running and gunning with no fear of dying beyond it being bad.
This all just my opinion and it's still a good game. Just maybe not anymore..."

10275,"I admit, I like Left 4 Dead 2, it's a great game, and I will put some information on [i] why [/i].

First of all, we gotta go over the positives.

What does the game bring to the table?

First of all, it brings a lot of good mechanics, the zombies are a big threat by themselves already (At least, if you play Advanced and Expert, and of course Expert Realism), but with the Special Infected, this brings an unique flavor to the game. Also, there's a MASSIVE workshop, if you get through all these anime-style thingies, a lot of decent stuff exists, I might even make a collecton the ""good stuff"" of the workshop.
The weapon selection is pretty fine and dandy, and the achievement stats are a pretty unique thing, as I don't recall seeing something like that in, for example, CS:GO or TF2.
I also must admit that I love the characters. I've got no favorite, but all these characters, Ellis, Coach, Bill, Francis, and even Rochelle and Zoey, all have some sort of character and personality, but also more things that define them. It's not typical cliché characters that were made in a day or two, they have [i] a story behind them. [/i]

What do I think is bad?
[hr][/hr]
Well, first of all, the AI Director is [b] not [/b] a bad idea in my opinion, it keeps the game slightly unique, but only slightly, and this is where I want to bring some criticism: The game feels the same a lot of the time, like, the Director doesn't have any unique strategies or something like that, the algorythm only looks at how well you're doing, and my suggestions for this are following, even if it's difficult to do:
-Track player movements, are they going the same path as most players go? If they do not, they are somewhat rewarded with slightly easier gameplay and, over time, a slightly more balanced experience.
-Give the Director concrete, randomized plans that go with the flow of the algorythm, like, will he bring a specific sortiment a lot, or just a lot of commons instead of Specials? Will he try to pressure the players into a corner and then spawn a lot of Spitters? Will he rely on tanks more than hordes? You know, concrete plans that are sort of randomized, but also a collection of randomized ideas and tactics, to make much more gameplay that you can't easily predict, this may piss off people in Versus, but there could always be adjustments depending on the gamemode.
-Look at the players' weapon selection, if they have a lot of snipers, there will be Infected that can be easily hit by a Sniper, but also spawn, for example, a Smoker as a counter to that, or Hunters. This may be a thing already, but I'd really like that.
I don't know other negatives, the Director is just underwhelming to me.

I would say, with all these things, I must give the game a 8-9/10. The worst part is probably the lack of variance with the Director, but other than that, for a 2009 game, it hold itself up to a good standard very well.
I may just be new, salty, or stupid, but in my 27 hours of this, I think the game's good and fine, just please make the Director better, alright?"

10283,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Got a smoker that drags me, get released.. then a jockey rides the head... and another 3 smoker's grabs 3 of us while another jockey rides the 4th AI (Survival).. But an achievement to stay alive for 30+ minutes... lmfao yeah right... developers are smoking some weird stuff to even think of 30+ min on any survival map is even fun at all. The most stressful, annoying achievement a developer can add and I'm assuming they added these ""extra"" achievements cause people weren't playing this old boring game anymore.. Back 4 Blood is 10x better and AI on that game at least can help save you quicker and they help out on mowing down zombies better"

10298,"[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] One of the best zombie games, co-op games, and FPS games on the PC. Packed with content that can easily be played for hundreds of hours, but also supports Steam Workshop mods should the base game ever get stale. Play it alone or play it with friends, but avoid the decade-old toxicity of the online community.

[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] is a co-operative first-person shooter in which you and your friends play as a group of survivors as they fight their way through countless hordes of humans infected by a zombie virus. It's a game that I'd argue needs no introduction, being almost as old as the distribution service on which it sits, yet still maintaining a concurrent player count that has almost never fallen below five figures in its 13-year long history. It's one of the most well-known and well-beloved games on this platform, and it even holds the title of my first ever Steam purchase all the way back in November 2009. All of this is to say that [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] was, and still is, an amazing game.

The core gameplay revolves around navigating a mostly-linear map alongside your teammates in order to reach a safe house on the other side, doing a bit of exploring along the way to find new gear and prepare for the harder battles ahead. Most of the enemies you fight are simple ""common infected""--weak on their own, dangerous in a group--but sprinkled in each map are a variety of ""special infected"", each with unique abilities and a high capacity to harm you and your team if you're not careful. The variety and quantity of infected you fight changes with every playthrough, and it's all thanks to one of game's most interesting features: the AI Director, a system running in the background that alters things like enemy/item spawn rate and even level layout depending on player performance. Maybe it'll spawn multiple special infected at the same time if you're clearing a level too easily, or put some extra healing items in your path if you're starting to struggle, or ambush players that stray too far from their teammates. Much of the overall design ensures that [b]cooperation is always necessary, and every player regardless of skill level is a valuable part of the team[/b]; conversely, it also ensures that players who abandon or neglect their team will be swiftly punished by the Director for doing so.

The Director's automatic balancing combined with (mostly) competent AI teammates make it so that, [b]despite its co-op focus, it's still enjoyable even if you're playing solo[/b]. If anything, playing solo is arguably a better way to learn how to play, as it's easier to figure things out when you're not getting distracted or rushed along by other players. That being said, [b]the game as a whole is a lot more fun with friends[/b]. Whether it's just you and a buddy against the horde in Co-op or an eight-person party competing against each other in Versus, every campaign you play will be an absolute blast--just as long as you make sure your lobbies are set to ""friends only"" (more on that later).

The base game already contained enough replayable content to last a long time, but updates over the years have added even more game modes and levels to the mix, including updated versions of all the original [i]Left 4 Dead[/i] campaigns and some new ones that tie the story of the two games together. Should all of this start to become repetitive, [b]look no further than the Steam Workshop to breathe new life into the game[/b]. Though many of the most popular mods are just funny texture/sound swap-outs, there are also a lot of new campaigns and game modes to be found that can really shake things up. One of my recent favorites is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121070254]Rayman1103's Mutation Mod[/url], consisting of a ton of new modes that tweak the standard game rules in order to make things more challenging or just more entertaining. It has modes for everything from solo to Co-op to Versus, but you're gonna want a guide like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=536442883]this one[/url] on hand since the menus lack proper descriptions of each mode.

I can only think of two things that I'd consider a point of concern before making a purchase--one I found in my recent return to the game, and one that's been the subject of serious criticism from players over the years:
[olist]
[*][b]There's no real tutorial to be found in the base game[/b]. You're occasionally given on-screen prompts explaining the basic mechanics, but for the most part you're just thrown right into the action and left to figure everything out on your own. You don't get a lot of time to get your bearings, especially thanks to the Director throwing threats at you if you spend too long loitering around; and if you're playing with people above your skill level, you're going to find yourself struggling to keep up. Luckily, shortly before writing this, a member of the community named Kyle H. McCloud created an [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800506083]unofficial tutorial campaign[/url], and I can't overstate how helpful it is. You're given a safe environment to test every piece of gear, core mechanic, and special infected fight, and it's filled with detailed information that even I never knew before. It's a must-have for any player jumping into this game for the first time.

[*]This is something that can't really be fixed, but it can be avoided: for many years, the game has been plagued by a toxic community that makes online play borderline impossible for casual players. Almost every constructive negative review I could find highlights this issue, and I'll let those regale you with the horror stories of elitist players, the abuse of the ""kick player"" function, and other generally bad behavior. I'll just leave it at this: [b]if you're going to get this game, play singleplayer or in a friends-only lobby--do [i]not[/i] go in with the expectation of playing with randoms online[/b].
[/olist]

I played a lot of this game in the first couple years of its release, mostly on my own; and I've had the pleasure of being able to revisit it recently alongside a group comprised of friends both old and new. It's even more fun now than it was back then, and suffice to say that I plan to spend a lot more time on it in the months to come. [b][u]After nearly 13 years, [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] is still one of the best games of its kind; and whether you play it alone or with your friends, you're bound to have one hell of a good time.[/u][/b]

10385,"Still good and funny coop!!! The game is from the developers of ""Valve"". It shows itself as a zombie shooter with a cooperative, it has a lot of maps and weapons. In this game we play for four survivors, or for four infected. Unlike the first part of the game, there is a new type of weapon (melee - melee weapons), and new weapons: snap. rifles, machine guns, shotguns.It has several modes, campaigns and a version. In the campaign, we go through several chapters so that our heroes are saved. In Versus, we play for four embroidered or for four infected. We need to kill the survivors, or go through the entire chapter for the survivors.There are also additional modes, such as collecting cans, survival for a while. The second part of L4D2 became the killer of the first part, all the players switched to it. And at that time it was very popular.
Conclusion: You can safely buy if you have a weak and old computer, you can play more than a hundred hours in it, and you won't get bored of it."

10541,BEST CO-OP ZOMBIE GAME
10542,"""There's a witch around here"" (Bots famous last words before getting beaten to death)"
10543,"This game is a very good shooter game, its fun and enjoyable, its a classic, and i would recommend buying it."
10544,"Pros: The game is well-balanced. Every player has the chance to do their part no matter which character they choose. It's easy to find and join MP games, and the community is on the whole pretty nice to deal with.  Teamwork is essential in this game. I like how players will risk their lives for each other. Sometimes you go back to help someone and you get killed, but no person left behind is a good policy. 

No micro-transactions or in-game store items. You want something , you gotta go get it. Just like life! 

Cons: It's difficult to get microphones working. The workshop items can be pretty buggy and make the game crash. Keyboard settings often get reset when you start the game, no matter how many .cfg files you edit.

Overrally, this is my go-to game that I can slip on like an old pair of shoes and start killing zombies. The teamwork feature of the game is amazing. I can't wait for Left 4 Dead 3."
10545,shits fire
10546,WAS FUN TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS.
10547,gud
10548,ok

10573,"Very fun game after even decades, insane replayibility value. 10/10 would recommend."
10574,"The power of L4D2 is in its replayability, and is the main selling point of this videogame. I would say this certainly delivers on that, which plenty of different campaigns to go through. Not only this, but the menagerie of add-ons, mods, and tweaks to gameplay that are availability through the community workshop makes the game even more adaptive to whatever one wants to tailor their gaming experience to, be that cosmetic or functional."
10575,Masterpiece
10576,game is totally worth it i is extremly fun and wirth friends or mods even its almost doble or triple the fun

10589,A really magnificent co-op game. Very enjoyable with friends
10590,"Very cool game to play with friends on a Saturday night. Cooperative zombie FPS. Despite being old, the game is still worth playing casually."
10591,gem choi rat hay neu choi cung` ny / ae / me m. t yeu gaben
10592,If you don't own this game then hurry up and buy it. Still holds up and somehow doesnt stop being fun. Plus all the mod support is dope.
10593,very fun game with friends! :)
10594,"Hey whats wrong L4D2 ?, I cna't play it please fix it :0"

10601,best fucking survival game ever
10602,"Left 4 dead 2 keeps aging like fine wine. The more years that pass and more games created to top L4d the more you realize how Good this game really is. This is one of the first zombie shooter games I've played but still holds up to ALL the newer ones you can see everywhere.

Left 4 dead 2. The pinnacle of Zombie Shooters everybody."

10608,is good
10609,zombies are not so radical
10610,"og best game of all time
"
10611,"First of all great game! My favorite zombie game ever for a matter of fact! I love the lore, teamwork mechanics, and characters voice lines and the characters themselves. My favorite is Ellis because of his stories and his personality in general. I love the writings on the walls in the safe houses giving more background of the game. The shooting mechanics is a masterpiece and teamwork mechanics. The map always changes no matter if its the same one being replayed. For the teamwork mechanics if you stray too far from your team you might get pounced on by any special infected. I love how the special infected stalk you in the game. The workshop for this game is always active and making greats mods. The game is fully customizable including even the menu. As I say this last part I think everybody else in the L4D community can agree with me on this with the game being part of our childhoods. In conclusion 11/10 is my rating for this game I cant wait for a 3rd game!"
10612,great game
10613,Great game especially it being so old of a game.
10614,yo this game is fire dawg
10615,"this is a good game to play offline for users who enjoy a good baseball bat to a zombie head
"
10616,"Best co-op shooter I have ever played. Infinite replayability, tons of variety. This game is a masterpiece and stands the test of time. 

There's so many modes and mutations you're bound to find something that tickles your pickle.

Did I mention I was only talking about the base game?

Because of mods, there is wayyyyy more variety in how you play the game. Mods ranging from replacing the default weapons with MW2019 equivalents, to more...strange stuff like making your character do the orange justice fortnite dance when healing.

This game is awesome, go buy it."
10617,incredibly devious and silly game😈😈😈
10618,awesomesauce
10619,The zombie clown reminds me of the joker. I keep asking if he can beatbox but he doesnt answer

10680,"Bough the game a while back but forgot to give it a positive review until now.

This game is simply one of the best game ever made. That is not to say that it is perfect in every way, there are issues here and there but those are just minor things to worry about. I used to play pirated version back when I was much younger, now properly bought it. 

This used to be one of my favorite game, played it all the time, brought some friend along and having a blast together. Then life happened and I stopped playing for a very long time up until recently and I've gotta say. Nothing changed, the same magic back when I first play it when I was younger, enjoying it every single time I come back to it.

Highly recommend for everyone to try out, especially with friends, much better with friends actually, there's a lot of toxicity and elitism going on with the Versus (PvP) scene if you're not very knowledgeable with the game mechanics (depends on the region I guess). Though playing Campaign with randoms are usually fine and fun."
10681,excellent it really is
10682,so nice
10683,A classic that to this day no other zombie game like it can beat. Just wish they continue releasing content for it but the community keeps this going strong.

friends in groups of 4. the gore is in abundance, and there's a lot of language, just from the game (no f-bombs or slurs), not online chat. online chat is at your own risk, but it's no worse than a vc in CS:GO. this game is not for the faint of heart. I ended up buying this game for friends, and they enjoyed it as well. I'll see you in a campaign..."

10837,"Good game!
"
10838,I like it.
10839,"I mean, it's a classic.

What else is there to say?

Got it as a gift just for the frying pan for TF2, got one hell of a game too. 

I was never a fan of L4D2 but I never really wanted to buy the game for my own money. Although now that I played through it... I will have to say it is worth the money, especially when on sale. 

The story is great, simple and easy to play through. You can spice it up a bit if you want by changing the difficulties. You can also play through the campaign with your friends (like I did) and if you're done with that, there is plenty of other modes to keep you entertained. The characters are... interesting??? (Coach is the best) but you can take some morale out of this game if you take it seriously.  Weapons are well developed and make sense.

The amount of mods, like in every single Valve game, is insane. 
Overall, very fun experience to go through, definitely recommend. 




Hunters are terrifying though."

10864,"It's fun. Visually one of the better looking source games I've played, characters are actually memorable and likeable which I didn't expect when I got the game, and the modding community is active. The guns in this game feel better than in a lot of other zombie games I can think of, all the shotguns feel satisfying to get oneshots with, sniping zombies before they see you is fun, and the assault rifles can tear through everything with ease and make you feel like a badass. Maps are all great for the most part, maybe minus the swamp one, hard rain is probably my favourite because of the visuals. I enjoy this game quite a lot."

10880,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

10885,"At this point in time,i feel like every User has at least a copy of L4D.  If you dont,i suggest getting L4D2 for its cheap/replayable due to its active community and mods and for the simple fact that its a good alternative to Back 4 blood which i find it kinda lame in comparison

10906,Classic
10907,Ive played this game for 10 years and palyed on xbox but man pc is just great
10908,da
10909,"I have been playing this game since I was a kid and ever since then, I have fell in love with it. Playing this on console was fun with this game but it is much better on PC. There are just so much more stuff you can do when it is on PC. It is easily one of my favorite games when it comes to the genre of zombies. This hame is really fun with friends or with people online. Multiplayer is just as fun as the campaign itself! I recommend playing game if you're into zombie horror and/if you're bored!"

10938,"I love this game with all my heart.I wish I can go back in time to 2014 to experience the golden days of gaming.When tf2 didnt have bots,when lfd2 had tons of people still playing.When sfm videos included tf2 and lfd.Therefore you should install this beautiful game and maybe you can agree with me."
10939,ur basically a zombie killing machine
10940,yes
10941,"I know this is a pretty gory and violent game but I think its awesome, I  love the graphics mostly but it also has a great plot. That's my opinion. Have a great day!"
10942,10/10
10943,"This is probably one of the best zombie games ever because it has its moments, Ellis's stories, coach's love for cheeseburgers, the way Francis hates everything and even the way that the main cast looks up to bill for guidence as a leader, and if you have not experienced grabbing a chainsaw and just mowing down a group of zombies and your character going YEAHYEAHYEH WHOOOOOOOHOOOOO and screaming like a lunatic, then I suggest to get this game, and thank you for reading my review. (also you can get mods to make the zombies look like the main spongebob cast)"

10947,"There's a lot to say, but I recommend it for the co-op experience, the modding experience, and more... This game has massive replayability and also personality. What better situation than to have yourself stuck with a bunch of love-hate teammates. The characters are endearing, the gameplay is engaging, and the community is surprisingly active for such an old game. You can run this game on a potato PC and still get a lot of fun from it. The downside for Left 4 Dead 2 is the never-ending problem of being in a game with trolls, or maybe even on the other hand, people who take the game too seriously; you might find yourself in an depressing situation. But that's life. And this game teaches you quite a bit of it."
10948,Best Zombie Game Since House Of The Dead
10949,I've been playing this game since 2012 and I can never get tired of it. I can play this game for hours and every chapter will always be different in some way.

10955,W GAME
10956,"This game is zombiephobic and I like it because I'm zombiephobe!!!

10/10 best game (don't play versus without a friend worst mistake of my life)
"
10957,"Bought this game 8 years ago, getting back playing it due to VR mod. Takes the game to another level playing in VR. With the amount of mods, limitless fun. The game has held up well for an over 10 year old game."
10958,Amazing game I used to watch alot of this game videos when I were younger but now I get to play it
10959,"Absolutely incredible game, if you get a few mods the game becomes even better"
10960,good
10961,"Now with a wip vr mod, so you can fulfil your childhood wet dreams

10966,I'm hard
10967,"13 years and its still the best zombie co-op.

from my old years of playing l4d2 the best thing that comes to when playing l4d2 was the mods and the community, today there are still a good amount of active players that plays l4d2, some have come back to play because of how b4b never did anything to improve their game except a dlc thats sucks monkey butt. Overall l4d2 stays on top while b4b rot in the garbage disposal. ALSO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS ONE DAY THAT LEFT 4 DEAD 2 WAS FREE TO KEEP BECAUSE IT WAS CHRISTMAS AND VALVE WANTED TO GIVE EVERYONE LEFT 4 DEAD AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT!

not much to say but the servers used to be crazy not sure if its still there but there was a versus mode for 16 survivors & 16 infected."

Favourite quote of the game, and the TF2's Bot name from this game."
10982,This is one of the best games ever
10983,So much thought and effort put in to the game. For awhile I was oblivious to all the effort that went into this game but after Back4Blood I realized how much passion really went into this
10984,"obivously one of the best horde shooters ever made, fun to play over and over, and even more with friends or mods thanks to the valve workshop. 10 out of 10"
10985,indeed
10986,"A must have for any Steam library. Lots of mod support and so much attention to detail in this game.
You can feel the love that was made in this project. Absolutely fantastic."
10987,solid co-op
10988,"a average modded game/campaign is so silly and so goddamn stupid and holy crap what is going on, more then your average game of tf2, 12 out of 10 (hey lois this reminds me of that one time me and 2 of my friends played l4d2 for 12 hours. worst mistake of my life)"
10989,My favorite game :D
10990,Good Game
10991,"mad fun fr
"
10992,Shoot gun fun
10993,"I enjoyed playing this a lot! I first played this on my friend's xbox years ago, and we had a ton of fun and played Bridge a lot to see if we could complete it faster than the last time. So many years later I got it for my Xbox One and I had a blast. We didn't have DLC on his Xbox so I got DLC when I played this on my xbox, I had more fun playing No Mercy and Blood Harvest. So I got it on PC because of Mods and free DLC. So yeah, I got Peter Griffin as Common Infected, It Has To Be This Way for tank music, Monster's Inc. theme for Credits theme, and What a Wonderful World for Escape theme. So I HIGHLY recommend the PC version."
10994,masta piece thats all i have to say
10995,"fun game, characters are nice, huge modding community, and it's old and good so your pc can probably run it. Overall, good game, my pc has a little input delay but it's still playable."

Except, the core gameplay is amazing so the mods just make it that much better.

There's nothing quite like screaming as Kermit hops onto your face as Tom Nook tries to pry him off so you can help Arthur Morgan and Hank Hill get to safety with you, the Server from Runescape."

11015,Best zombie game ever made i hope that left 4 dead 3 comes out one day for a new generation to play i hope this game gets more respect for being the best ever
11016,"This game is one of those older style, level based shoot 'em ups that can be -- in many ways -- whatever you want it to be. With the workshop you're not restricted to playing just what may be considered an aging game. In my game, I'm stomping around as ODSTs from Halo slaughtering flood, or maybe you'd rather run around in a team consisting of a knight, 2b from Neir, straight up isabella in Doom marine armor, and a version of Coach who just has a chef hat on, using weapons with floppy droop physics while all the zombies are minecraft zombies with Alex Jones screams replacing certain music pieces that play when special infected show up.

All in Helms Deep from LOTR.

Even if you don't care for the base game, that workshop keeps it all alive."
11017,"left 4 dead 2 is your typical zombie shooter game, it's fun duh, but it loses it's touch if you don't have friends, and if you don't have any, there's always mods, custom maps, etc, so if you're ever bored of the game just go and check the workshop and find something to add some spice to the game"

11065,This Game is very good bottom line. There are many more hours to come but in the brief amount of time i have played it has sunned me on how smooth it is (you can run it decently on a potato like my computer). There is so many various weapons to pick from and all with different attributes. (sniper = broken). All in all it is a large game with endless content and a great opportunity to progress through campaigne and play with your friends.
11066,"I'm glad that this game is still one of the best zombie shooter games out there.

11091,"This game is unlike any other, it's a masterpiece, but if you once decide to get into versus then you may have my condolences as it has a very high entry threshold coupled with mostly unfriendly community who are likely to kick you for your little knowledge of some (many) important gameplay things rather than explain you what you did wrong. This is not the only problem you're gonna face playing versus games but it's the most common one"

11105,"So left 4 dead 2 is a beautiful game that I wish I played back in 2009 when it released you get so much out of hearing the survivors crack jokes encoountering special infected, getting to play versus as spitter,tank,hunter,smoker,charger, BOOMER,and of course the one the only back humping himself the jockey playing all of these specials is so dam good oh word of advice play all campings before going into versus if you don't you will get curb stomp by enemy team and you're teammates will kick you for the smallest thing so to be shocked about that. So another thing mods not the ones that people cheat like mods that are goofy and fun to use by replacing character models of survivors/infected to anything that you want so please give this game a chance you won't regret it."

11145,What are we wating for?
11146,"shooting zombies is cool right?
"
11147,"The game is very good for 10 dollars, there are 4 characters you can choose. Each have different personalities which makes it fun. The game is about shooting zombies and the guns have very good sounds even though the game is old. So I'd say 8/10 because of community"

But if you are unlucky enough to have bad teammate, certainly you are in hell with the satan himself.. plus this game got a lot, i mean a lot of stupid singaporeans.. singaporeans are kiasu ( meaning, cant accept the lost ) eventhough they play like shit.. they will blame on their teammate and start to vote kick for their own weakness. stay away from stupid singaporeans"

11190,ti
11191,So amazing & immersive guys...
11192,"One of if not the greatest zombie shooters ever, Left 4 Dead 2 is the kind of video game that you need to play to experience to the fullest.

Left for Dead 2 is extremely detailed, the zombies have hundreds of motion captured deaths, you can damage individual parts of zombies bodies. you can also damage 1-3 parts of them before a zombie dies you can damage them in over 78,000 ways. Each of the special infected is designed around the team game-play, and has a unique music cue. and finally, the game has a built-in music engine that changes based on the unique situation each player is in. 

The game has much more amazing qualities, but are best experienced yourself. If you read this review before watching a video on Left 4 Dead 2 I suggest you play this game blind, it's a fantastic experience.

11202,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a game that everyone loves. Bored, and friends are online? Invite them to play! Even if you just have 1 other person, and you're both terrible, you can have a *ton* of fun as the bots carry you and the Director AI pansies up the game."
11203,still one of the best games out there
11204,"This game is amazing by itself but with mods, it's even better."
11205,nostalgic. i remember my friend screamed when they met the tank

11213,"Good game to play with friends, and to see what strange mods you can come across on its workshop."
11214,"Great game, very far ahead of it's time. I have loved it since I first ever played back when I was around 12-13. There is no zombie game that is better than this one. Perhaps never."

11236,Best game ever
11237,"game consists of me and my friends screaming at each other and getting a mental breakdown when we complete a campaign
11/10"
11238,"One of the most hyped up valve games for the 360, no matter how much time I spent on any of the levels the Director AI always kept me on my toes. the AI teammates can be a little frustrating and often more than less slower than dial-up wifi at times, the mod support can help add more functionality to them. maps are beautifully perfect for both versus and singleplayer, the literal night and day differences in the L4D2 and 1 maps is executed perfectly, Don't even mention how well optimised it is, It can play at 1080p 60fps on even a Chromebook! for zombie fps this is a masterpiece If I've ever seen one. whether you use a dollar store mouse, Xbox One/360 or heck even PS4/PS3 controller, Its gonna be a fun time ripping apart endless hordes of the infected. have I mentioned theres over 700 ways to damage one? ya, over 700 damage combos. Just remember, teamwork IS the dream-work here.  theres also mods in this game too, PLENTY of them. they could range from hentai outhouses to whole dang campaigns made by 1 person alone. Love it.
10/10 Zombie game
(It was my childhood game on my 360, used to love playing with my bigger brother too!)"
11239,"Zoey would 100% smash

11248,"Fun to play with friends

(which I have none)"
11249,"what's there to be described? just play the game , it's worth it"
11250,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

11270,"Absolutely one of the best zombie games of all time, one of the best multiplater coop (online or couch coop) games of all time, and maybe one of the best First Person Shooters of all time. Truly an iconic game from an iconic franchise, made by an iconic developer.....now, if only they could count to 3."
11271,One of the last non-toxic multiplayer experiences left on this hellscape on an internet 10/10
11272,"Shitty game, only fun for about an hour before it gets boring as math class"
11273,"Some call me Master Lock, most don't though."
11274,E
11275,"Don't know how it gets so many positive reviews - it's not as intense as it's quoted as being, and the zombies disappear instantly after dispatching them. I understand why that might be a thing, but overall it's not really much fun when you're not really doing much more than the same thing again and again.
Might be more fun as a co-op game, but not for me."
11276,good game excatly like the old one no changes

11405,very silly but fun with pals
11406,"This game is a true classic. I don't think any other zombie style game comes close to L4D2 in the base game version, let alone the mods you can add. It's for this reason that this game will always stay relevant and never forgotten. If you haven't played it yet then you need to."
11407,its relly fun i recomend it to any body whose played the payday games
11408,guud
11409,lots of fun
11410,L4D2 is definitely an upgrade from L4D1--you don't even need the original to play the original maps. Very generous developers. If this game goes on sale it's a must buy if you have not already played it.
11411,So. Fucking. Fun. its a bit toxic but dont be a bitch and you can have porn sprays campaigns are pretty solid to play on and mutations are slept on shit makes it so much more exciting when you get bored and get friends it makes it the best

The truth goes unspoken
I’ve even forgotten my name

I don’t know the season
Or what is the reason
I’m standing here holding my blade

A desolate place
Without any trace
It’s only the cold wind I feel

It’s me that I spite
As I stand up and fight
The only thing I know for real

There will be blood-shed
The man in the mirror nods his head

The only one left
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
Oh no
There will be blood-shed
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

Losing my identity

11451,hi
11452,growl
11453,this game is gud
11454,What can I honestly say that hasn't been said before this game right here is one of the best zombie game's I've ever had the pleasure of playing I played the first L4D way back in 2008 and I got L4D2 for the 360 when it first came out and once I got my first PC a long time ago now I had to get it for my PC and now I have been playing more because of that fact this game is such a masterpiece sure it isn't perfect but this game does what Skyrim or Fallout does it keeps you coming back because of mod's and multiplayer is also a major part of it as well at least for me it is so for those who are new to the series you play as one of the four survivor's and you need to get from point A to point B while grabbing whatever you may come across that could be weapon's such as gun's melee or the throw able one's as well like molotov's pipebomb's or bilebomb's or you could find healing supplies which are medkit's or pill's but the best part is shooting the ever lasting hell out of the infected that come your way blowing part's off like arm's and leg's or their head's but of course you gotta be careful for there is special infected as well such as hunter's spitter's jockey's charger's boomer's smoker's witches and tank's all wanting to absolutely destroy you and your team now if I were to recommend the best multiplayer mode in my personal opinion it would be campaign but you can play it solo which is really fun as well but I think you get the point this game is honestly amazing if you need more proof of that watch people play it a little bit not a modded one by the way you wanna see the normal stuff first which is obvious so that is about it from me as you can tell I love this game it is still the best zombie shooter out there so if you can pick this game up and give it a try I truly do think you will love it alright then cheers mate's and sorry for this review not being to professional
11455,"fun

11474,"The amazing and ultimate zombie apocalypse survival game! This is defiantly essential, as ""zombie"" apocalypses may occur in real life. Not in the sense of the undead (as is impossible for dead cells to be still functional) but in a sense when drug/alcohol companies hit their high marks, and everyone's addiction has gotten serious. Drug zombies. Drunk zombies. Those are the kind you would encounter in an apocalypse."

11498,"Here we are roughly one year after the release of Left 4 Dead, and its sequel is already out. For Valve, Left 4 Dead 2 represents an unusually speedy turnaround time considering the delays and release date fuzziness generally associated with its games, notably in the years leading up to Team Fortress 2 and the still mysterious status of Half-Life 2: Episode 3. Despite that history and the potential concerns associated with how soon this game is showing up after the first, Left 4 Dead 2 is very much a complete game, much more so than the original, and is without a doubt the better product. If you're still in the mood to group up with friends and slay packs of ravenous undead, then it doesn't get any better than this. However, if you're tired of Left 4 Dead's gameplay formula, the sequel, as good as it is, may not be enough to warrant a purchase. It's a game that's more about refinement and augmentation of existing features instead of offering something dramatically new.

As a result, after you've played Left 4 Dead 2, it's difficult to go back to the original without a mild sense of disappointment. Remember, of Left 4 Dead's four original campaigns, only two were set up for Versus play right out of the gate. It wasn't until Valve released the Survival Pack months later that players got the full Versus experience as well as the now-standard timed Survival mode. Left 4 Dead 2 has five full and more interesting campaigns, a more fleshed out and distinctive setting with some fantastic action set pieces, more personality, more modes, and in general gives you more to do. In many ways, I wish this would have been the product that was released first since it feels much more full-featured than the original, and the fiercely team-oriented style of gameplay wouldn't have been as familiar then as it is now.



It's entirely possible you're someone who never played the first and have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll take a step back for a moment. It's the zombie apocalypse, and you play as one of four human Survivors who attempt to shoot their way through hordes of fast-moving ""infected"" (which I'll refer to as zombies) to get to the end of a map. The sequel is set in the American southeast and the new cast of characters is more memorable this time around, as they seem more aware of their situation, chattering away and commenting on specific parts of the environment as they battle through. Ellis' inane stories while huddled in safe houses are a particular highlight as he waxes on about accident-prone acquaintances while mobs of bloodthirsty zombies converge on his position, at which point the others understandably tell him to shut his mouth.


That's not what you should be doing while playing, however. More effectively than most other titles out there, Left 4 Dead 2 forces you to work as a team if you want to win. You need to talk, and you need to participate. Every member of your four person squad of Survivors needs to be communicating about what they're doing, calling out locations for ammunition, weapon, and health pickups, and asking for help when in trouble. The catch is that no stage ever plays out the same way, because there's an artificial intelligence called the Director governing the action. Packs of common zombies can attack at any time, and if what the Director throws at you proves too challenging, your path of progression through a stage may even get swapped around to make things easier. It makes every experience different, and encourages repeat play as it adapts to challenge players of any skill level.


More zombie types make the gameplay even more unpredictable.

Like before, there are multiple difficulty settings, with Normal serving as a good entry-level challenge while on Expert only those with the best communication, decision-making, and reaction skills will survive. Left 4 Dead 2's Realism mode makes the challenge even more daunting, removing helpful glows around items and weapons amongst other things, meaning it's all up to your communication skills to call out ammunition and item pickups or to let people know you're in trouble. If you're the type of player who generally shies away from a conversation and prefers to remain silent, then you're not going to like Left 4 Dead, mostly because your team isn't going to do very well if everyone's only interacting on a minimal level. Because of how much teamwork is required in Left 4 Dead, it's also one of the best games out there for triggering an emotional response in players, which works both ways. If you manage to pull through, you feel a much greater sense of accomplishment, and if you're losing, it can be singularly frustrating since your success is just as reliant on the behavior of those around you as it is on your own personal skill.

Bots are still included, though, so if you do want to run through the five campaigns by yourself that's entirely possible, and should a person have to drop out midway through a campaign, an artificial intelligence will take over so you don't have to all give up. Your computer-controlled teammates will work alongside, making accurate shots, swapping out weapons, reviving, trading items and healing when necessary. It's nowhere close to as entertaining an experience, but it's still functional and playable solo. Ideally, like when preparing for a dungeon run in an MMO, you'll be able to get a full party together to tackle the challenges, and it's an experience that's at its best when in a full Versus game.

Versus is also where you'll be challenged the most, as four players will be running through as Survivors and four others controlling the powerful boss zombie types. These include the Tanks, Boomers, Smokers, and Hunters from the first game, in addition to the new Spitters, Jockeys, and Chargers. The new boss zombie special powers add layers to the gameplay, such as the Spitter's acid pool that can do heavy damage over time to anyone who stumbles into it. The Jockey's ability to take over control of a Survivor's direction of movement makes for even more interesting combination possibilities here, and overall the addition of these new boss zombies adds in a welcome amount of depth and, if you're playing as Survivors, unpredictability to the play experience. If your Infected team is working together you can time Boomer bile attacks with Jockey jumps and Spitter attacks so large groups of common zombies are attacking while one Survivor stumbles under a Jockey's control and the rest are slowly dying in a pool of acid.


These kinds of team tactics are subject to further refinement when you take into account the campaign-specific challenges, some of which are sure to get your pulse pounding. To be perfectly clear, this is not a relaxing game. You're tense and fixated on the screen at all moments, and during sequences like the rollercoaster race in the Dark Carnival campaign and the storming and flooding of the second half of Hard Rain, you'll need to pay even closer attention. The campaigns here include exciting crescendo events and defense sequences that any hardcore Left 4 Dead fan is going to go absolutely nuts over. In that sense, if you're still playing Left 4 Dead and are looking for more, then you're going to love this product.

It's not just the better campaigns, the more fully-realized and detailed environments and the switch from the dark city streets of the first game to the bogs, carnival grounds, marshes, and sunlit construction yards that contribute to reasons why this is a better game. There's also a wealth of little things that make this a sturdier, more complex, and more entertaining experience. You'll find scattered around rooms incendiary and explosive ammunition pickups for all to enjoy, a wider range of rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles to pick apart your opposition (though many of the like weapons models behave similarly), and perhaps most importantly of all, in Left 4 Dead 2 you can take advantage of melee weapons."
11499,It's L4D2 its incredible. If you don't know what it is by now where have you been living? Did you just drop out the vagina? Buy this game
11500,literally copied l4d2
11501,good game terrible vs' community never have I ever seen such entitlement before but otherwise great
11502,yes
11503,Awesome game containing all the content from the previous game And a workshop with plenty of time to it making your game a gigantic as you want. Personally I'd recommend a couple of Roku's Resident Evil maps when you finish both campaigns.

11515,"На удивление, качественный продукт, который прошёл проверку временем. С очень крутым саундтреком под ситуацию, атмосфера, особенно на картах первой части и в компании Жуткий ливень. Любая компания может перепроходится за счёт режиссёра, и особый интерес представляет кооператив на реализме эксперте. Для фана можно в сражение играть, но сейчас можно ввести тут звания от сильвера до глобал элит) В принципе и недостатки есть, такие как убогий тикрейт, как будто 32 а не 64. Много странных глитчей, которые способствуют телепортациям, и додж падения(возможно уже исправили) 
В общем, игра делает сырой Back for Blood, даже и близко не нужно ставить с данным шедевром. Решили уйти от ежовых руковиц дяди Гейба, получился кал... Составляет конкуренцию полумёртвой Rainbow six Extraction(она намного круче Back for blood, но из-за того что ubisoft потеряли доверие к аудитории, продалось мало копий) 
Всем советую данную игру, ибо она творит историю геймдева вальве тех лет_)) и доказывает, что их игры играются и сейчас свежо, привет CS GO, Portal. Half Life)"

reasons: 1 This game gets intense like when huge wave of zombies come out of nowhere that's intense
2 the characters feel so unique like Ellis who constantly tells story's while fighting zombies or Louis who makes references to other valve games.
3 the mods the mods are easy to install and are downright hilarious like you can have your whole squad be the scooby doo gang or gnome chompskis.
And those are the reasons you should play left4dead2 the greatest zombie game ever."

11766,"I remember when this launched. Talk about a really fun and intense zombie shooter.

Best part is, the story is so loose, it's like all matching-making style, but this allows you to play solo. Even better tho, when you play with a full squad and you get booted cuz of connection or just want to bail on a session, you don't feel like you're missing out on any story content.

get some friends and shoot some zombies.

I enjoy this over COD Zombies.

11800,"Community is great, though some people still troll/grief after the game being over 10 years old. There are a lot, and I mean a LOT of awesome mods on the workshop that add in more great content. Devs occasionally add in new patches for the most rarest occasional bug and the rare update to add new maps. If you're new to the Left 4 Dead series, this game has all of the campaigns from the first game plus DLC that are already in the game so you get the full franchise experience. If you want to know when L4D3 is coming out...don't get your hopes too high, Valve said they're most likely not gonna do a third part but then again it took them over 10 years to make Half Life Alyx so who knows, maybe in 2030 we'll get #3"
11801,"Honestly , this could be one of my best memory from this game. Yet, it's old but still gold as always."
11802,Overall a great game to play with a group of friends but I recommend you get the bundle with left 4 dead because the game is pretty short. I like how much you can customize in this game and each level is pretty unique.
11803,Perfection. Only play with competent players that you know will have your back or extremely incompetent players (Matteo) so you can laugh at them!

it's cool that you get to spend money and time on a game because you like the function and premise just so the creators can turn around and change it into something else that you don't want later down the road.

11843,"An amazing title, especially with friends.

A friend and I just finished the available campaigns. No burnout, no boredom and very few bugs during our playtime.

The maps feel very distinct from each other, with specific themes surrounding it. The concept of being a movie makes a lot of sense, as every episode feels like a totally different movie with the same set of characters. I've enjoyed some maps more than others, but overall, I've had a great experience in every single stage I've set my foot in.

The guns are varied, some are weaker, some are stronger. We started recognising preferred weapons, creating different strategies and combinations. The teamwork sense honed as every stage was completed. My friend took the sniper and a hatchet? Well, then I'm going for a rifle and a magnum, or maybe another melee weapon - those were common conversations while we decided how to tackle the horde of zombies to come.

The special monsters are fun and challenging. Simple sillouettes, simple concepts and yet you always get caught unguarded by that smoker or hunter, or you think you're smart hiding in a cabin until a spitter covers it in acid and you die. After a few chapters we were already creating strategies to kill the witch (startle and run!!) or signalising different zombies (I hear a boomer!).

This is a MASTERCLASS in audio design. Everything cues a sound - being on acid, being covered in vomit, getting near a witch, starting a horde... This game challenges you while it extends you the hand by giving you hints through sound and effects.

Killing zombies feels very organic, good physics response, good visuals of torn limbs or torso. The game is old, graphics are not as fancy as some titles we have, and still it feels more real than maaaaany new titles we've got in the recent past.

Overall, a GREAT experience that I highly recommend."

11883,Back 4 Blood is worse.
11884,it is an awesome zombie based game with many modes to experience and play
11885,"Small rant against inconsiderate players. 
I've played this game since launch, mostly on Xbox. Now days, good luck finding a group that doesn't wanna just run around and pop each other in the butt or Rambo it straight through the map while you're trying to search nooks and crannies for pipe bombs and medkits and, you know, actually play the game. That's after they steal all the ninja swords, of course. If they pause long enough to notice one.
When you're done with a campaign and the game time says 40 minutes and the zombie count is under 1000, you did it wrong. It's also a good indicator that you're probably playing with people (or children) fresh from the urban CoD playground and have played L4D a lifetime total of about 45 minutes. 

I rant because in this game your team mates' presence is absolutely essential for survival, and when you've got retards 1, 2, and 3 waiting at the safe house, shooting at pizza boxes on the ground, having the stones to tell you to hurry, while you were busy searching a house for their benefit...   it's just dang irritating. And not at all good for your character's health. Finishing a map in 10 minutes is absolutely unacceptable and a spit in the face of the developers and every decent L4D player out there.

Review: Thumbs up, I recommend. 13 year player. There."

11923,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

11978,best game ever?
11979,"good game
"
11980,"YeeeeehawwwwAAA! Bring it on!
"
11981,Source 2 port with new campaigns when?????
11982,"Very fun, especially with mods like turning common zombies into an army of one-liner spewing Homer Simpsons, a Peter Griffin Tank, or making the Smoker into Doofenshmertz voiced by Samuel L. Jackson"
11983,"Left 4 Dead 2 has been a blast in the past couple of years for me. It is a fun multiplayer (or singleplayer) experience, with plenty of chapters to choose from and unique game modes to play. Every time you replay chapters, the experience changes drastically, all thanks to the AI Director which controls the spawns of the infected in the game, another factor is that each server has different people to play with. All of this adds so much fun to the game. The community in this game is pretty good, not too bad besides some versus players, some of those people are not too fond of new players to the game. The people in those servers would likely kick someone if they did one thing wrong. Aside from that, it’s a pretty friendly community, easy to find friends on the campaigns. 

Let’s talk about the gameplay. The gameplay is like all the other Valve fps games, you run, think, shoot, and live. It’s easy to pick up and play, especially since each chapter in the game is around 40 minutes long. If you play from start to finish it’ll take you around 8 hours (including L4D1 campaign)

Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is another great Valve game, it’s an endlessly fun game for the price of just $10 on the Steam store. I definitely recommend you give this game a try! It’s a fun zombie-killing experience! Left 4 Dead 2 is a game I come back to every year, it’s just a unique game. I Never had a more fun time on any other zombie co-op games besides this one!

11997,"This game is amazing, they knocked it out of the park.
and surprisingly, being made from valve, it only took them a year to make this sequel.
i stan gnome chompski btw."
11998,mods is fun :)
11999,i hate my friends
12000,Timeless
12001,"It was not bad at its time. It was one of the first to focus on cooperative gameplay which was scarce at the time. So why the negative?: 

- Its so repetitive.... how many maps does it have now? 5? 6? I don't know... but its the same and the same.... 
- It started a ""zombie"" theme that is the most cliché thing I can imagine (besides anime), I hate it and I'm tired of this theme.

"
12002,good game
12003,very good
12004,"Still one of the most timeless games I think exists. If you love zombie games, or shooters and CERTAINLY if you love co-op games....this is a must play and own. I just wish we could have a L4D3."
12005,Shaggy chasing me while the Giga chad music is playing while u got a friend in me is playing simultaneously while Franklin from GTA 5 is chasing me simultaneously while buzz lightyear is healing Mario from Super Mario 64 all simultaneously and also seeing the Mystery Van from Scooby Doo just parked outside a whole zombie apocalypse while also Walter Clements the dog is reviving Woody from Toy Story is a total fever dream

12010,this game sucks
12011,very nice
12012,"yes, this game is extremely good, free mods, decent people, and great game play.
just a note, if your going to hop onto versus watch the guides they have on youtube, guides like the 5 unspoken rules and general guides like how to use the tank and other characters. i say this mainly cause you'll get kciked from the match if you dont know the basics.
and btw if you have the game tf2 you get a free hat and melee weapon from it. enjoy and have fun if you get it :)"

12037,"L4d2 is without a doubt the greatest zombie game of all time, this game is so fun with friends. However what makes this game unique is the crazy amount of mods that you can find to give you a more definitive experience, and high replay ability value. Although L4d2 is a great game the community for this game is amazing I highly recommend this game."
12038,"fun

12052,Fun and co op
12053,"The game is already a masterpiece on its own with how much content there is for the price and how detailed it is but then you add mods and I am Master Chief with a squad of Neco Arc, Adachi, and Jill RE fighting off a horde of CoD Nazi Zombies with nothing but a Doom shotgun and a Plumbus all the sudden Donkey Kong fucking charges out of nowhere and breaks my spine while Goofy Goober is playing cuz I'm at the end of Dark Carnival."
12054,"Good game, would not recommend multiplayer.  This is one of those games where people harass you for not knowing how to play.  Singleplayer however is a blast, would definitely recommend."

12061,"This game is absolutely amazing. It has the first game's and extra second campaign, many gamemodes, mods and the gore is oh, so violent. The ways zombies will have a death animation before ragdolling which will react dynamically depending on the situation is amazing, especially with this being from 2009. Even more amazing is all the ways you can damage zombies. *chef kiss* Get it, or you miss out on a game even more fun than annoying a family member."

12066,it holds up ten years later and will do the same hundred years later.
12067,"Left 4 Dead 2 is the 4th game in the Left 4 Dead series, it is the sequel to DayZ.
The game takes place in America post Covid. You play as the 4 last survivors, also known as the only 4 Americans who have never been to Florida.
This is an example of a zombie game done right, not like those leeches from back in the day that made a shitty spin off (Yakuza) or a clunky ass game that is praised for dumb features (Dead Rising)
The game is very basic yet very fun. It has none of that bullshit most games have nowadays like the first 5 hours being full of cutscenes. You open the game, skip the opening cutscene and just play, just do it.
The controls are easy to learn and work very well. There are just so many games from that era that nowadays would feel old because of their controls but here everything still feels smooth. Shooting feels great and the zombie death/injury animations make a big part of it.
The game has a variety of maps, enemies, weapons, playable characters and gamemodes. Not only that, you can also get even more content and create your own by going to the workshop. Which means the game has endless amounts of content.

really all the game is missing are NFTs

12097,"Absolute masterpiece of a game, this game has plenty of different gamemodes which are all very fun and playable if your looking for something different from the campaign. Don't forget about the mods though, its an absolute rabbit hole ranging from incredible to wacky to questionable, it just makes the game infinitely replayable."

12115,"Left 4 Dead is a masterpiece of gaming history as one of the best co-op shooters ever made, everyone out there that hasn't given this a try will only be missing out of what original game play that can be experienced, especially the expansion of mods, challenges like mutations and versus, and even survival maps there's an endless stream of replay value. Hopefully one day we can get another Left 4 Dead title that would once again blow away the gaming industry, but its doubtful, for now we can just stick to this OG title and hopefully not run into any toxic players."

Everybody's left), or someone doesn't vote kick someone for a mistake that, let's be face it, is regular and expectable in multiplayer games?

12217,One of the all time classics. You must have some gaming culture to enjoy this.
12218,good game~
12219,"This game saved my life.

I am 50.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as."

Enemy Placement Isn't Stupid And Actually Random So Teamwork Is Always Necessary, Characters Are Fun, Maps Are Unique, And Guns And Melee Weapons Come In A Lot Of Varieties. But The Best Thing About This Game Are The Mods, Wanna Demolish Zombies As An Anime Girl While Holding The Super Shotgun From Doom Or Play As Raiden Fighting Shrek While Rules Of Nature Place Or Hear The Bully Maguire Theme While Healing While Spiderman Shoots A Dr Pepper Can Well Left 4 Dead 2 Has So Many Mods With The Simple Gameplay Combined With Crazy Mods Makes This Game Fun Or Play This Without Mods The Game Is Still Amazing So I Recommend This Game If Your Looking For A Fun Co-op Zombie Shooter.

12335,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

12339,honestly this game is a really good game. i would compare it with dead rising. and there is a lot of game modes and in the game and you can also do co op or play online. and for a game where you just run in and beat up zombies they made it seriously good. this is a top tier game. plus there is also mods for this game.

12377,"what can i say about l4d series other than is a great game, wonderful with groups and even better with mods, but dear god, some how i just can't find a way to create a room for the live of me without getting caught in some of the chines hacking sever, jesus they like cockroaches you think u will never seen them again, but some how by some kind of magic they are already their and thriving"
12378,Best game ever
12379,Kill zombie
12380,"There is no escape. You press play, and its 5:00 am
"
12381,"This game is very fun, it is very well made, and has nice graphics for a 2009 game. Zombies are well made, the special infected are well made, then the characters too, the campaigns are also very fun to do, I like the dark carnival one. Basically the best zombie game for me. I recommend this game to other players because it's a very fun shooting game, and this game is fun to play with friends too. 


This is me editing the review, I forgot to say, this game still has so many people, like people still making videos of this game, and still has a community! Normally some old games don't have a community anymore or any people barely plays it. But for this game, no, for this game, it still has a community, which is crazy, considering this game was made 13 years ago."
12382,please simp for Bill.
12383,Good game to play with friends

12385,haha boom zombie oh no I die

12388,"This is one of the first video games I remember playing on my PC. The combat and action are insane and make for a very enjoyable first-person shooter game. Additionally, the co-op aspect of this game is spectacular. Overall, this is my short review of Left 4 Dead 2, and I would absolutely recommend this video game for everyone."
12389,It's an Amazing game that hasn't aged to badly like a fine wine it get's better with time. Worth playing solo or with friends or online with other people
12390,"ethan shit tho

12391,"Rochelle is against the team. She shoots me everytime I'm fighting with a zombie. However, it's a great game especially the tank survival mod."
12392,"The best zombie game ever made. Everything from the tinniest details are mastercrafted, a little detail I love is the characters, they could've been cheesy one liner chaps, but we get an amazing dynamic between them that some full fledged single player games struggle to do. 10/10"

dont worry cuz L4D2 its the solution, an experience that envolves killing zombies with 3 more Slayers aka ""Survivers"" with amazing campaings and wholesome characters, and infecteds.

come and enjoy The Left 4 Death 2 experience (YOU CAN EVEN MAKE IT DOOM ETERNAL WITH AMAZING MODS)"
12476,"Left 4 Dead 2 apesar de ser um jogo antigo, ele é um multplayer que vale muito apena jogar. Você tem a possibilidade de jogar com pessoas de todos os tipos e fazer boas amizades dentro do jogo, pois, afinal, você está em um apocalípse zumbi com mais 3 sobreviventes. A harmonia entre os sobreviventes é essensial para completar os capítulos das campanhas!"

12497,"This game, and the one before, was the answer to all my desire as a gamer and zombie fan. The teamworks required make the game even more interesting. You can't be a good player and win everytime alone, you need to be a good TEAM player, and that's what I like. It's also the game I've heard the more '' Sorry'' for all the friendly fires. The difficulty level of the Expert Realism mode is simply fantastic, being a challenge every time you play it, not matter how good you are... and if it's became boring to you, please friend me, I need you haha."

12517,Best game ever made!
12518,"The sequel that takes place right after the events of the first game. You plays as either one of the characters of four, Rochelle, Coach, Ellis and Nick. They are the other survivors from the pandemic zombie virus. New monsters were introduced and it's your job to fight them all so you can live another day. It is probably the very last game of L4D because the same developers  decided to make a game that would be the next successor but it flopped horribly. 

8 / 10"
12519,"If you like first person shooters that can be played both co-op and single player this game is right for you! It may be old but the endless streams of zombies and interactive levels are enough to make you want to play it over and over, and even if those don't entertain you enough you can always go to the workshop and install some of the thousands of mods that are available.

12525, ru unburnuitjuhikgf8
12526,Still the best co-op horde shooter.

12538,"This was the most fun me and my co-workers had battling each other as survivors and special infected. A great game to get your peeps together on ventrillo and have at it. Tons and tons of add on maps, mods and other content to check out. Even for single player probably worth it, until your teammates just watch you get choked out by a smoker!"

12580,"I don't know exactly how to put it, but this game is just...frequently upsetting. I'm not exactly the calmest or quietest gamer, but at the very minimum, I don't get nearly as upset at any other game as I somehow manage to with this one, and after more than 24 hours of gameplay, I think I've figured out why.

Campaign is fine. As far as I can tell, its balanced and enjoyable. If anything it probably doesn't provide enough of a challenge, but I mostly play versus with my friends in this game, which involves one team playing as survivors, and the other one playing as special zombies.

The game isn't satisfying, or at the very least doesn't leave you with net satisfaction. The dissappointments outnumber and outweigh the triumphs, and any success you experience is just overshadowed by everything that's gone wrong.

It never really feels like you're *winning* when you play this game, it just feels like you're either losing or not losing yet. You just feel absolutely hopeless playing this game, like you fully acknowledge that you're going to lose no matter what you do, but you act in the vain hope of getting farther than the other team. There is no gratification. It just feels empty. Maybe a bleak feeling like that is what they were going for as a zombie apocalpyse game, but its at such a level that the game design itself makes it difficult to enjoy the experience or have fun.

Valve is a great studio. I've enjoyed plenty of their other games, and I generally like and trust their brand, but I cannot get behind this product. Sometimes games like these where its not really that fun are more meant to be pieces of art, and fun isn't the desired experience, and its meant to be more provocative than that, and I understand that, but this game really feels like a game that's supposed to be fun but it just isn't.

Playing this game makes me uniquely irritable. Even with other games, if I get really really into it, and I get really really upset when I die in a stupid way, I'm still laughing about it 10 seconds later. This is the only videogame I've ever played that has the power to leave me in a terrible mood for hours after I've stopped playing it. The amount of time I've spent in a bad mood as a result of playing this game is probably longer than the amount of time i've actually spent in the game.

It makes me get really mad at the game, and it makes me get really mad at my friends, and it starts stupid fights that wouldn't even need to happen in the first place. I always feel really awkward and embarrassed when I realize I'm getting so mad over a videogame. I don't like the way this game makes me feel.

Maybe the game itself isn't innately or prescriptively terrible, but the experience that it provides is. If you want to get more angry at a videogame than you ever have before, if you want to ruin your otherwise stable and healthy friendships, or if you just want to ruin your day, this game is for you. Otherwise, I cannot reccomend against it enough."

This game has like 12 campaigns including those of 1. You may say SO LITTLE! But thats the fun mastering
every gun. dominating every special that used to be scary. Learn how to dominate every route. Blasting heads with style. The online aspect also will make sure
you will never get bored. Every playthrough is different, and the servers are stable running and populated!

12617,"Great game that has become a classic. Highly recommend you find some friends in-game or a LFG and play friends only matches to avoid trolls.

Also the troll players are terrible, You can vote to kick them, but they might ruin your run and make you restart at the checkpoint.  If you find that you are having lots of trolls try playing some other time.

They do have tons of mods though you do have a 50/50 chance to join a public modded server which depending on what you want may be good or bad. Sadly there is not a way to list the current matches that are vanilla. So you may have to start a new game, but there are still tons of dedicated servers."

Opening Comments: 
This game is POETRY, it is by far my favorite horde/multiplayer game EVER. I love the simple approach to gunplay through interesting level design. Simply put this game is a CLASSIC up there with the best of DOOM, FF, etc.


Pros: 
Great Single player, Great Multiplayer(I don't play versus, but I am aware that the community there is toxic), VERY moddable with some of the most fun mods to experience, Content that after many many years has not gotten stale in the slightest, great characters/story, simple gunplay with a complex mechanic curve.

Cons:

The versus community (from my understanding) is horrible and though i do not play it i will like to mention this here as the feedback on this topic is overwhelming. Now back to Cons. Without mods the game isn't as interesting(personal opinion), Gunplay is simple however, i feel the game could've benefited from a different approach on bloom/recoil; this doesn't break the game, but again just something personal.

Closing Comments: 


10/10 Game with those cons in mind this game is flawless top to bottom and i don't know anyone who hasn't played it but i read these reviews for fun sometimes, so if that is you as well then cooool!! Have fun with your day <3

"

All the content blends together masterfully to give unique multiplayer experience, which hasn't been replicated since this game's release in 2009. A true zombie horror experience compared to Back 4 Blood. 10/10 would recommend to others."
12733,it's fun when you have friends to play with
12734,Controls are similar to CS: GO. You also don't need to be a tryhard to play this. You rarely ever meet that specific demographic over here

The game is a lot of fun whether solo or with friends, and I didn't realize that the chapters from the 1st left 4 dead were also added to the the 2nd game. So, I have both left 4 dead 1 and 2, but if you have to choose between the two, get the 2nd so you get the updated version of the first one too. I got it for a sweet price of under $5 for both though, so it was ok."

12787,"Left 4 Dead 2 is at this point an old game, and one difficulty with old games is do they hold up, are they worth playing still after over a decade of being released. Left 4 Dead 2 still certainly holds up, and still provides one of the best and unique co-op experiences that not only competes with the most modern games, but in many ways continues to surpass them.
The main selling point of why I continue to return to Left 4 Dead 2 is that it allows full playerside modding and customization. I have downloaded so many texture, model and sound changes that I have not seen a zombie in a very long time. Every normal zombie is a teletubby, while the player characters are iconic like master chief, jack skellington, and the guns are everything from violins to cats. Every weapon model, zombie and survivor is changed, making it a stupid and wonderful experience. More games need this level of customization because it allows for so many dumb and amazing moments while playing with friends. When I want to relax and have a good time, this game continues to have me coming back.
This game was so ahead of its time that it continues to not feel dated. It uses a unique form of AI to control where zombies should spawn and what type based on how the players are doing, and so it balances the experience to make it feel like a fair and unique experience. If you are doing too well, it will throw a big roadblock that you have to deal with, but if you are struggling it might throw you some much needed medkits. This helps keep the game from being too easy, but doesn’t overwhelm you. 
Although this game is old, don’t let that deter you. It is still one of the best and unique experiences to play with friends. While both challenging and casual, it continues to be a game that is worth buying and playing after nearly 13 years."

13023,Great game to play with friends !
13024,"i'm just gonna say what others say and I completely agree (note I did play this game when it was first released and then played on and off on another account):
""Just buy Left 4 Dead instead of Back 4 Blood"""
13025,"A (relatively) old but fun game, kept alive by a robust modding community (including custom campaigns) and the mayhem that is versus mode.  It may not be the prettiest thing, it may have some kinda wonky default controls (especially on controller), but it's still a lot of fun."
13026,Mods
13027,good game please make L4D3 gaben
13028,Best game money can buy.
13029,"Ok, whoever made this game is an absolute genius. If you don't have this or the original Left 4 Dead in your library, you are missing [b]OUT.[/b]

Graphics age pretty well in that department, but let's be honest it looks really cartoonish. The infected models are pretty great too.

The story is amazing! There are 6 canon campaigns, Dead Center, The Passing, Dark Carnival, Swamp Fever, Hard Rain, and The Parish.

What I like about Left 4 Dead 2 better than the original, is how it focuses on more of a comedic atmosphere. I'll be honest, it is a bit scary at first, but soon after you start playing it more you will find the infected more annoying than scary.

There is around 9 different game modes, all being incredibly well made and extra fun.

It even comes with it's own section in the Steam Workshop, where you can add plenty of cool and hilarious modifications, or *shudder* the amount of garbage in the Rochelle category *shivers*

ANYways, overall I'd rate Left 4 Dead 2 a 9.5/10. It's one of the best games on Steam so add this to your library if you want a good time!"
13030,Ellis shot my barbeque bacon burger
13031,Amazing Coop Multiplayer Team play game ! Love it ... tough as nails too.
13032,"its to good

13055,Yep rofl
13056,Instead of giving us Left 4 dead 3 which we've been all waiting for years now and still waiting they gave us Back 4 Blood.....
13057,"Classic, yet still playable after.. how many years? Just get it. Play it."
13058,yes good game. would recomentd
13059,"A great game created by Valve themselves. With almost 150 hours so far, I can say this is perfect for anyone who enjoys slaying infected across the northern and southern United States, solo or with a squad.

Especially the modding community! I love the creative mods that are released on the workshop for this game. 

I hope this game never dies. And judging that people are still playing a game from 2008-2009, I doubt that it ever will. 10/10."
13060,"This game holds a special place in my heart I used to only be able to play this game once a year for 3 year so getting excited for thanksgiving was easy. I then rented the first one from blockbuster for a week and had to return it . but being able to play with my friends on a game Ive always lovedwill always be special to me . They sure as hell dont make em like they used to and the 2000s sure were a time to live but hey dont let this review stop you from rubbing it all over yourself.

13085,👍
13086,A classic
13087,"Pretty fun for a valve game. Worth 10 dollars, good purchase on my end."
13088,So many mods you can basically change the game to almost any theme you like. And if there ain't no mod in the workshop of what you're looking for you could always make it yourself. (Or commission someone which I haven't done yet)
13089,Best horde shooter ever. And if you say payday 2 is better I will find you.

I can't imagine how it could have been released in 2009 and still be so much better than many others released recently.
Of course in the old days games were made with much more love.
At least the big Estudios games.

I wasted my time playing some other crap, and yes, it was a big waste of time and money.

I took the advice of a friend, who is a solo developer and who also loves this game, and I need to thank you for introducing me to this gem!

13146,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, go below, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

13183,funny zombie game
13184,play
13185,great game
13186,good
13187,nice
13188,good game
13189,L4D2 is cool
13190,this game can be described in 4 words: Cooperation required zombie shooter.
13191,"I've played L4D2 since I was a kid on Xbox 360 and I never got tired of the regular campaigns. I started memorizing them because I didn't know how DLC worked back in 2009. Now, that its been so long, and the DLC is completely added into the game, I can sorta live my dream I had as a kid of being able to beat all campaigns on normal at least. It holds its own like any other VALVE game and has the timeless feel that TF2 and Garry's Mod inherently preserve. Well designed maps, great selection of zombies and unique abilities, fast paced when you want it to be, and realistically creepy. Love the blood and gore from seeing a giant hole where a zombie's torso should be. Radical. Also, Ellis is my favorite Himbo of all time. Even the characters are endearing--solid 9/10. For the premier zombie game that made my future of FPS possible, right next to Halo: CE."
13192,Played this shit back in 09-10 on the xbox. One of the best zombie games of all time without a doubt
13193,Great game
13194,"Good game to play with friends, wish there were new maps tho ^_^"
13195,"zombies + guns = fun
play"
13196,Great game with friends
13197,"Hi! TF2’s bot/cheater problem has been a major issue for 2 years now. Very little has been done to address this problem and it hasn’t been directly acknowledged by anyone at Valve or the TF2 team.
If anyone at Valve could give the community an update on the situation and let us know if it’s being worked on and when it might be fixed that would mean a lot.

-No thanks untill it's fixed"
13198,"well the game is awesome because of coach and francis and might be the best game out there for its teamwork mechanics.
shooting feels good and this is a game where you make allot of friends lol
just need another l4d3!!!! Valve do something> please"
13199,zambies
13200,old but gud
13201,"Valve is an incredible company that makes game to last. Left 4 dead 2 is one that still holds up, and is easy to mod."
13202,"i've played this and the original Left 4 Dead on xbox for 100s of hours back on release. Never enjoyed 2 quite as much, but playing on PC with mods has definitely made the experience much more enjoyable. AMazing franchise, to bad Back 4 Blood was bomb."
13203,The sound of Weeping Witch.
13204,"An amazing throwback to when I was younger, L4D never gets old"
13205,Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the most fun co-op games. Period.

13227,"[h1] I Never Thought I'd Actually Enjoy a Zombie Game [/h1]

If you look at my library, most of my games are in the management, automation and strategy genres. I like to think. In my recent stint of trying new things, I thought I'd pick up L4D2 since I already had it in my library and I heard good things. This game is certified Awesome. 

I didn't realize until I was scripting my full review for my yt channel that this game was made in 2009. For reference, Borderlands 1, AC 2, and the original CoD MW all came out in 2009. IMO, this game was way ahead of its time as far as polish mechanically and aesthetically. 

The gameplay is so much better than CoD zombies or something. If you're expecting a story experience, go pick up The Last of Us, but if you want to run through and shoot zombies for fun with infinite replayability with your friends, this is perfect, and 100% worth the price, even off sale. 

I would say most of the weapons might feel a bit weird if your only experience with FPS games is playing recent titles, besides the shotguns. I've never played a game with shotguns that feel so good. For a multiplayer arcade like experience, where you can pick it up at anytime with any friends, no matter their experience or skill level, this game is awesome.

Check out my full review on yt if you're interested.

13238,"It is a game all about Co-op. You WILL meet the salty solo runner/solo runner, but really, give them no mind or just kick them when they show they will not or just refuse to help the rest of the team. PUG in this game can be horrible, but I have had more fun then bad moments. 
VS is still toxic trash so play at your own risk, play with friends so you do not get booted for ""Just cause"" reasons. -You don't know how to play infected, so they kick you and you can't really learn lol-
8/10"
13239,"This game is possibly the best zombie game I have ever played. The game has a very grungy and realistic feel to it, though it is still super fun to play. Better yet, add-ons can be added to the game, making it absolutely hilarious and/or unique. The only trouble i did have, though, was that the add-ons where a bit difficult to add, so if this is a game you want to play with mods or add-ons, please consult a guide."

13290,"These days I would say look at Vermintide 2  or Deep rock galactic instead. The one feature this game does have a very fun PVP zombies VS survivor mode (Be a crazed zombie that jumps on you buddies and 'drives' then off a cliff is always a laff) 

If you can rustle up 5-8 ppl to flesh out the zombie VS survivor mode. then prob worth it on special. otherwise check the more modern version games in this format."

13307,"Mod support is amazing however some mods can conflict with each other (Not the games fault), base campaign is fun and keeps the story continuing after the original Left 4 Dead game as well as including the 1st games levels. Creative and reactive gore, great tracking from the zombies, and overall simplistic gameplay create a great zombie game that really feels like you're always in danger, even in silence."

Cold Stream is so pretty

a very easy game to meet new people in, though some are gonna be trolls so...
just do not play versus. hell, i kept to co op on normal, for the most part
most randos either rush ahead or fall behind, a team of 2 + 2 is nearly always better than 3/1 soo....

definitely my fave shooter game, especially with the genuine wealth of mods!"

13362,"[h1]Often imitated, never duplicated[/h1]
L4D was a game ahead of its time. It displayed what a co-op zombie horde game should be. Throughout the years, so many others either drew inspiration or straight up tried to copy the L4D formula. Yet L4D still reigns supreme. It just has a certain charm to it, combined with a rather straight forward gameplay. And of course the loyal playerbase and the modding community. All the user generated content is what kept the game alive for all these years. It just goes to show you how a game can thrive and stay relevant when the modders can do their thing."

13432,"My review:
     - Gameplay: 8,5/10, zombie shooter with less annoying bot than the other version.
     - Story : - the game isn't story based, but you could listen their interaction and other story that you can see in each campaign.
     - Visuals : 8.5/10, the visuals is quite enjoyable for an old game.
     - Sound : 8.5/10, the sound fits the situation very well and it's more better than the last version.
""Again, same with the Left 4 Dead 1, i recommend this game even if you guys play it in 2030 (with exception of closed server). I quite enjoy the experience of this co-op zombie shooter game, every aspect you could explore, and more story you can uncover because the game isn't story based but it is... a story and a film. This is really like the remastered version of Left 4 Dead 1 but I'm down if Left 4 Dead released a new game or new update, I'm always down. I guess there still much room to improve on for developer team, but overall, this time Left 4 Dead 2 is on my on top of best zombie shooter game I ever played.""
     - Overall : 8,5/10 [Four of them I always remember.]"

But if you're just gonna go single-player, and you're not really good at FPS in general or want to go guns blazing - not as fun, but at least there's bots to help you out.

13558,I recommend this game as it is a classic of its time and still is. very customaizable  and fun to play as group and friends.      i also recommend the verus gamemode with friends as its a fun 1v1 or 6v6
13559,A timeless classic

This is one of many games that ACTUALLY reinforce the co-op aspect, sure you might see a quite of bit of people that know how to play this game and all that jazz but the game plays how you want to play it basically, if ya like being an ass to your friends then this game takes the cake, man ill tell you its just fun all around. Most of all the mods for this game are just fantastic and just to warning you there are a lot of anime mods but if you like anime then go nuts dude. Overall this game is just a certified badass classic. 10/10 for me if ya dont like it then its fine all the same, at least ya tried it. :)"
13663,Great game buy it
13664,Its Left 4 Dead. Enough said.
13665,"""One time my buddy Keith played Left 4 Dead 2 and drove Jimmy Gibbs stock car to kiddie land to ride the screaming oak while zombies were attacking him.""

""Pill induced versus scumbags""-Ellis is now the best time
After you play the game. - Left 4 Dead 2 is as famous as Elvis, or the president.
""Pro Zombie rights activist""- Really because he looks like a A$$hole.
 This game has the most memorable characters and voice lines."
13666,Such a good game goddamn
13667,"Honestly, it's a cheap zombie game that is equal or better than a lot of triple A 60$ zombie games on the market. It's also really fun with your friends, and since it's not nearly as expensive as stuff like Back 4 Blood, people with less money can actually buy the game and enjoy it, because it's not too long, but it's short either. It gives a good story (at least in my opinion), as it doesn't require a ton of thinking to understand, but it isn't brutally easy to expect the next event. It all goes together with each stage, while sure it skips some of the in-betweens of each chapter, it sums it up usually when the chapter first begins, giving you the essentials to understand what happened. The gameplay is also smooth and easy to understand, and I still enjoy it more than most games as of posting this. As a shooter, it's nice to get into and it's basics are, well, basic. As a horror game, it may shock you a couple times but you can just laugh it off after. 

As a last note, I believe playing it with friends is the best experience for fun, but if you're looking for story it might be easier doing it solo so you don't get carried away. I have zero complaints."
13668,"Best linear zombie game I've ever played owing to the great attention to detail, extraordinary map making, and to the adaptive game director and absolutely great steam community page. The only drawback is the 2006 AI but you can find fixes for that in the Steam community page."
13669,"Random teammate once told us all to get up the escalator, but pronounced it ""escaladder."" He kept yelling get up the escaladder, get up the escaladder. 10/10"
13670,Game was great. I had a lot of fun playing multiplayer with my pals. Only issue was the game suffered lag in a couple spots but that was fixable. Loved it!
13671,Cool game!

13797,Remember when people said this came out too quickly after the first left 4 dead? Insane.
13798,The game is really good the one part i think it's missing is that the guys with the big fat arms should be able to stick up your ass and you make a moaning noise other than that it's a good game
13799,"pretty fun with friends
"
13800,Its a classic zombie game. Fun co-op with a bunch of interesting add ons
13801,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

13821,"One of the greatest games ever made. A low powered PC can even run the game with minimal problems. Although, it's not the best welcoming community due to veterans having a tendency to kick new players due to their knowledge of the game, but the replays, unique runs because of an AI Director, crazy mods you can install yourself like the Shrek Tank, memes gone to the L4D Universe or even, anime mods! I really recommend this for new and squad players. You don't need gems, or in game currency to buff your character, the game is balanced by everybody. It all comes down to cooperation, there are servers that buff up the game. I've played this game since I was a kid and this is one of the games I will never get tired of."

13940,"How have I put all this time into this masterpiece of a game and not given it a recommended review? Anyway, my saying its a masterpiece is all you really need to know about this game. 
Do yourself a favor if you've never played Left 4 Dead 2 before. Get this game, and play it. 
NOTE: Its best to buy Left 4 Dead 2, it comes with all the maps from the first game in the second one, only much more up to date, and with the full 6 special zombies vs. the first ones 3 specials only.
Basically Left 4 Dead 2 is Left 4 Dead 1, but way more up to date. And the gore system in Left 4 Dead 2 is way more bloody :D"
13941,Left For Dead Two

Working with your teammates (especially in multiplayer) can mean life or death on harder difficulties, leading to some great moments when the special mobs arrive. The addition of other game modes (like Survival and Infected) and the maps + characters from the first game? Icing on the cake."

14107,"Sangat Cocok Untuk Di Maenkan Bersama,Walaupun Game Jadul"
14108,"Very fun game to play with friends. Plenty of maps and mods to keep the game fresh and fun. The mutations are fun as well. You can weeb your game out with anime mods, or mod the game to have better looking weapons, and player models from CoD games and so on. 
Overall a very fun game, but it does have its flaws (it is from 2009 after all).

I personally like playing with enhanced weapon scripts which make the guns feel more accurate to their in world counter-parts and makes the game more enjoyable and less rage indusing. 
speaking of rage, you will definitely scream at this game, especially on higher difficulties.


In short, game is super fun, wide variety of mods, better with friends. can be rage inducing at times, and can bug out from being an older game."
14109,cool game
14110,good to play with friends
14111,I RECCOMEND THIS GAME
14112," Even over a decade later this game is still an absolute masterpiece that has, is, and will stand the test of time.
The graphics have a nice blend of realism, retro, and cartoon styles that make this game run smoothly whilst not hurting the eyes. I can't tell you how many hours I've sunk into this game on Xbox 360 and Xbox one, all you need to know is that I loved the game enough to buy it a second time to play on PC. The modding community is still alive and well with some top quality reworks, enhancements, overhauls, and just the plain silly meme mods. I couldn't recommend this game more whether its your first or final game in your library."

14159,haha zombie goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
14160,"It's good game that has its authenticity ruined by gratuitous childish swearing. For me, swearing is for those with a limited vocabulary and children out to shock their parents. It's got no place in game set before such language existed. Swearing is easier to write than meaningful dialogue, so it saves on money. Instead of hiring decent writers who can put emotions into to words it's cheaper to hire second rate writers such as those in this game. It's A pity that the devs did not have courage of their convictions and produce a well written script."

14191,If you like back 4 blood but don't want to aim down the sights this game is for you. Also coach is a gem of a human.
14192,"Played from 2011-2013, stopped for 8 years... opened it up again in 2022.

Just as good as I remember.

Charming characters, cozy setting, doesn't take itself too seriously, nothing gratuitous despite 'violent' subject matter. Versus is an absolute blast every time - well-balanced, and when you get into a lobby with serious players for a full match, it's 40-50 minutes of serious, satisfying gaming.

Old-school lobby rules are also still in play: Everyone competes to make the most offensive usernames possible, and to use voice-chat to shock and delight their fellow players with finely-honed obscenities of the purest nature. I, for example, renamed myself to N*****Whipper_5000 last round, to the uproarious delight of my multi-ethic, multi-cultural lobby. Truly, a microcosm of better times past.

Playing this again in 2022 has actually given my score-and-ten bones a not-inconsequential feeling of ennui - Gaming has REALLY, SERIOUSLY, PRECIPITOUSLY gone BACKWARDS over the last 10 years."

14214,"This game saved my life.

I am 41.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

Left 4 Dead 2 is aged well I still can't believe that this game is from 2009. The game itself still solid and fun
One of the best zombie-shooter game out there! At least better than Back 4 Blood lol.

Graphic was good there are some mod for graphic to make it even better! For 2009 standard it still good even now.

The gameplay are amazing! zombie AI is smart and realistic, maybe even better than some game nowadays.
Special infected make the game even better! It make player be careful and play as a team. You can solo but it will be
harder than it should be so stick with your team.

In this game there is NO microstranscations, unlockable items, no skins. but it wasn't that bad since L4D2 community
is on another level! Modders in this game are amazing they're keeping the game alive even though this game is 13 years old. The game is still alive till this day thanks to modders!

The systems requirement is potato even 2005 PC can play this game.

Conclusion: ""Just buy it"""
14270,Amazing even today.
14271,BEST GAME EVER
14272,"for it's day and still in most respects is gaming gold. A remaster of this game with a modern engine and mechanics and some form of progression is what i really want. I love black for blood as well , it's a great game, but i can still hope for the best of both :0"

14306,If it weren't for the steam workshop i would give this game a thumbs down
14307,"Shot some sick homeless dudes testicles off, and he sprinted at me while yelling babble. Also this game was fun as well I guess."
14308,"Honestly I could never understand why this is so popular on pc. The best i can thinm is a case of right place and right time. It has some cool ideas dont get me wrong but most of them seem invalidated by other elements.

All those cool animations and damage models? Good luck paying much attention while being mobbed. Want to use ranged weapons? Most enemies are melee only and run at you so why not just use the melee weapons? Want an interesting experience? Have fun as you just bum rush through the level as quick as possible. And as far as coop once you run the levels that is it. There is workshop I suppose but that isnt exactly unique.

To be fair versus is where this game shines, though there were always some cheese starts that is most games. I remember having a fair bit of fun in versus despite all the other weird design choices.

Maybe I just didnt ""get it"" but this game is pretty overrated to be honest. Especcially now when there are many other online coop games, and with much more variety.

The silver lining is it is 9.99 these days as opposed to 19.99, at that price eh it is probably a bit of fun. But again plenty of other choices too, especcially on sales."

14442,"This was my first ever shooter game and my Mother's substitute for when I wanted to play Call of Duty when I was younger. Needless to say; this is better than any COD game I've ever played, especially with a group of friends.

Laugh as you basically beat up your teammates with chainsaws and gnomes. Disturb witches and watch your friends get football-tackled by Tanks and Chargers. It's truthfully the best zombie shooter imo. 100% would recommend. If your friends have it then get it. You'll for sure laugh."

This one is just like the first one but MUCH BETTER.
Even tho the first L4D hold a near and dear place in my heart, L4D2 is just a game that just keeps on giving and its pretty crazy to see so many people still playing these games!
You just cant beat the classics.

14510,"i turned it into a freaking resident evil game, and then i turned it into halo, id say its pretty good."
14511,"Great 4 player survival coop experience. with the game being almost 13 years old it still holds up great. the visuals are a bit dated but a ""quick"" browse on the games community workshop can fix that. A good majority of the maps feel a bit unfair and too difficult even with a full team of adept players. Most of the time me and my friends play on the legacy maps from the 1st game and vastly prefer them over the newer l4d2 maps. 

The Last Stand Update:
The new map is horrible, the difficulty is way to high. the 2 chapters included are both way too long and should be split up into 4 separate chapters. The finale itself is fine although the map is way too large for the gas can section, its hard to collect all of the cans and make sure your team sticks together.

TLS Bug Fixes: 
I understand that this may differ from player to player but, after 11 years of playing this game i find it disheartening that all of the bugs i've grown up doing are being removed. I never really cared for high times on maps but the actions and knowledge required to get out of the map is something thats stuck to me for years and almost feels like part of the game at this point so for them to be removed is sad"

1. It's overall has that Valve polish and detail that goes into all of their games.
2. It's a lot cheaper.

He has dropped out of school and even gotten violent when we ask him to get off and go outside… he won’t even answer calls or his front door. I asked him “please stop this and come outside” he replied “muhahahaha how dare you tell me not to play my favorite game made by my god Gabe Newell.” He then proceeded to doxx me and steal my social security number. What I am trying to say is that this game will ruin you and your loved ones lives. It is not worth it, I’m glad I was able to see past the fake reality it was trapping me into. Don’t let this disease spread… good luck and stay safe"

The game feels fun, rewarding and fresh even though it came out in 2009, a true testament to it's quality which is what I would expect from a publisher/developer like Valve"

I fell in love with this game when I was pretty young, and i still love it to this day. If you are getting tired of normal stuff then there is also the workshop. The mods in the workshop can be hilarious or tinker with some mechanics. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TENSE, EXCITING, AND AMAZING GAMEPLAY. Keep making hilarious mods community, it's what makes the game more fun to play for modders."

14625,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

14634,"Dear Valve, please consider banning a player that goes by the gamertag ""Gamilkanan"" (also known as ""Diego_31""). All they know is killing their team members relentlessly, stealing ammunition and health kit supplies and spamming racial slurs in the text chat. We should not tolerate toxic behaviour like this. Hopefully we can get them banned as soon as possibly and make ""Left four Death 2"" a better place."

14675,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

14678,"Left 4 Dead 2 Is easily one of my favorite games of all time. Growing up, I played the SHIT outta this game on Xbox 360. Reliving it on PC was a whole new experience. This game is a masterpiece like no other, with the characters, infected types, and game play. First of all the characters are the funniest characters out of any game hands down. And the little Easter eggs and clever secrets make it so fun. One of my favorite moments, was when I was playing as Ellis and I saw a witch, at a ruined wedding. Not thinking I shot her, and Ellis screamed something along the lines of: ""I AM NOT GETTING MARRIED."" It was one of the funniest moments, in my entire career of gaming. Left 4 Dead 2 Is truly a masterpiece and deserves another game, directly from Valve."

The first time I saw it was when my friends screenshared the versus mode on the first map of swamp fever for me, at that time I didn't think I would love it this much, but after i bought it and played it, I realized how great this game is. Not only is the game really good, but also the mods make it EVEN FUNNIER. It's funny trying to strategize with your friend until they get charged by a charger out of nowhere, BUT IT'S EVEN FUNNIER WHEN YOU (A Greninja) AND YOUR FRIEND (Heavy from TF2) ARE TRYING TO STRATEGIZE WHEN SUDDENLY THEY GET CHARGED BY A ROBLOX NOOB OUT OF NOWHERE. I also love the story the game portrays. I honestly think everybody should play this. It's not just a boring zombie survival video game. It is a very very fun zombie survival game. There is honestly no mistakes in this game despite it being really old. AND TO ADD TO ALL THE GOOD THINGS, IT'S REALLY CHEAP. EVEN CHEAPER WHEN ON SALE."

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.

pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

14794,"One of the best games of all time.

The story and humor are exceptional, and the design is very fitting for a post apocalyptic world.

The enemies, called the infected, present a variety of challenge to the game. They come in three types, the normal Infected, the Uncommon Infected (whom are extra dangerous due to the equipment they had before being turned), and the Tremendously dangerous Special Infected, who have mutated special ways to kill you, be it a frog-like tongue, or jumping out at you from the shadows. 

The campaigns are fun to play, and the different modes, difficulties, and challenges give it almost infinite replayability. That's not to mention the extremely dedicated and hard working community creating new campaigns to play through. (A few of my personal favorites are Redemption 2, Back to School, Day Break, Urban Flight, Suicide Blitz 2, and Riptide.)

If campaigns not your style, why not try a mutation? These fun game modes change how the game works by implementing different rules, such as Last Man On Earth, in which you are alone, and only the Special Infected spawn. How about Four Swordsmen? Just you, your teammates and 4 Katanas between you and the horde.

If you're feeling a bit competitive, why not play some Versus? This game mode pits a 4-person Survivor team against a 4-person Infected Team, rotating every round. The Survivors goal is to make it through the level without being killed, and the Infected's goal is to kill the survivors as soon as possible.

The fun never ends in this zombie-shooting, post-apocalyptic, humorous first person shooter.

There's also a gnome.

Try Left 4 Dead 2 today!"

Zombies being dismembered left and right.

After the effort, between the rampage of the hoards, it always feels so good.

14907,Shocked how this game came out in 2009 and still is one of the best games ever. 2009 game is better than a certain cheap 2021 game..
14908,haha funny people go pew pew haha zombie
14909,"An absolutely classic, and an awesome gift from a friend for my new gaming pc. I have 100's of hours on the console version, and can't wait to grind away on here. It's also fantastic that L4D2 comes with all the L4D maps as well!"

14926,A classic game that still holds to todays standards
14927,"good as fuck
"
14928,"After 27 hours of this game I will still rather replay this than Back 4 Blood.

This is the first game I played on my first gaming PC and it's pure nostalgia if I don't count playing games since 2001 as a 3 year old but that was not a gaming PC and it was not for sure mine. But as a gamer since childhood this is that one game that I will talk about to my grandchildren one day explaining how cool their grandma is haha.

Anyways, if you wanna grab this game and play it, don't hesitate. Just play it I recommend it and enjoy while you can. 

Sincerely yours,
HelenWxW"
14929,its an old game but is very fun to play with your friends
14930,"Left 4 Dead 2 will always be in my heart. It is one of the first Steam games I bought, and I have to say, It is very worth it. Even though I don't play it as frequent anymore, I still find it extremely fun and enjoyable. Thanks VALVe!"

14944,"This game was the highlight of my gaming career back when it was newer, getting it again has been so nostalgic and its even better than I thought so back then. I haven't a lot of playtime yet but thats because I've recently got it and want to savor the campaign. I highly recommend this as I cant think of a zombie game that I found better than this. <3 Left 4 Dead 2"

15017,"Left 4 Dead 2... an instant classic of a game. Whether you like zombie shooter games or not the experience of Left 4 Dead 2 is worth giving it a try if you have 1-3 friends to play the game with. After playing Back 4 Blood (the Left 4 Dead Predecessor) it left me very disappointed and coming back to the original to just have a good time killing some zombies. If you've played the original game and not this one somehow, it scrubs out and works on all the problems that the original game had. On another note when you use mods on this game it can make it twice as good! Everyone should try this game"

Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie"

15071,"one of the best zombie games I have ever played in my opinion, I love playing it with friends! highly recommended!"
15072,"I bought this with my own money, totally"
15073,"This game has had a significant impact on my life, more than I’d care to admit.

First and only online multiplayer game I’ve ever played [was bit of a shy gurl worried about how pros would react to my poor skills]. Started playing it online cos my friends were not always around. I really liked the game, so was sort-of forced to venture into the world of MMOFPS, and boy! what a world it is.

It seems to me [and I am really not experienced in these types of games, so could be wrong] that this game, unlike any other, allows a remarkable degree of freedom to play around with code and create your own custom game, which a lot of people with coding skills actually do. The result is that now there are some fascinating modded servers with all kinds of tweaks that make the playing experience unique and really fun. When you land on those servers as a noob, it can be tough. But if you endure the teasing and occasional kick from the game, you get to experience something quite beautiful.

No microtransactions, no pay-to-win horseshit, you rely on your aiming skills and the energy you give off in chat to win the game and to win new friends. The community is, true, highly competitive and medium-high toxic. But once you clear out the garbage, you find some nice and truly smart people. Just like in any other area of life. I’m writing this [my first] highly subjective review free of technicalities at 3 AM after a wonderful session with some very smart Earthlings, something I would never experience if this game was never made.

L4D2 got me through some tough periods when I was on autopilot battling depression and it gave me something to occupy my mind and practice reaction time. Because it’s simple, but at the same time remarkably complicated. Maybe that’s why it so dear to my heart. Thank you, Gaben and Valve, thank you for Half-Life, and Portal, as well as this gem of a game. You’ve changed my life."
15074,this game is cool cus i can be io from paladins. thats all
15075,it's pretty good ig
15076,Best co-op horde shooter ever made.  Beats Back 4 Blood everyday even though it was made a decade later.  Wish Valve would make a sequel so I can give them my money

15179,"Btw, game crashes if you die
so don't try to do that."
15180,"A friend gifted this game to me and I feel like nothing I would do would be enough to repay em for this.

Campaign mode is great as a new player and wont need to go in depth as there are plenty of reviews for this 10yr old game but finales quickly become tiresome when you get good enough and survival is just an extended finale which I find personally lame

I spend majority of my time playing the Tankrun mutation because no one complains if you stray away from the team and its basically the best overall mode to bunnyhop in. Solo skips aren't that frowned upon as the team only cares about making it to the end. Learning how to dodge several tanks by baiting, having it climb, stalling in certain areas so your team can progress, rock juking in the tightest spaces or out running a tank by bhopping is always a thrill especially on expert where 1 hit = a down. Some maps are BS but possible like The Passing when you don't have an adren drop for the under water tour because the director didn't spawn one, The Sacrifice chapter 1's Tank door unable to be opened even on easy because a tank respawns and wont ever be able to be interacted with it, The Parish Chapter 2 panic event if you have slow as fuck teamates/bots, No Mercy hospital chapter where you are required to exploit on expert and other examples you will see commonly if you play the mode with the small existing community for the mode. Mainly the problems you would face are tank spawns and its reach in high ping scenarios

I do not touch VS mode because online rando is almost always competitive and non friendly to newer players.
Make a mistake? You get kicked.

Don't know how to play as the infected team? 
You get kicked.

Your teammates don't hear you getting pounced, hung, etc by a special infected and you die from their incompetency? 
You get kicked.

You don't do anything wrong and are actually a good teammate?
You get kicked.

No incentive to play VS even with almost 800hrs at the time of writing.

I would recommend Tankrun for people who enjoy going fast and don't mind exploits and skips with a huge side of BS. 

Avoid VS unless you already have experience or have enough friends to play non competitive (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T KICK PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG BECAUSE YOU FORGOT TO MAKE THE LOBBY FRIENDS ONLY), 

Survival in my minimal experience Is pretty lame as its just running in circles while trying not to get incapacitated which is similar to cod zombies in a way with less to do

Scavenge mode I never touched as its also a VS exclusive mode

Realism is for those who think expert is too easy and want an actual punishment for death and non cooperation

Thats about it."

15219,"Left for Dead series has always been a fun game. Worth playing with friends, or by yourself if you have no friends to play with at the time. The maps remain the same but no two games will end the same. Run, fight. Survive. Then die of laughing from shenanigans."

15230,Over a decade later this game still surpasses the quality of almost all current AAA releases and with the level of replayability it has I see it lasting another 10 at least. Even for being as old as it is the visuals and effects still hold up surprisingly well compared to current titles. Definitely one of the steam must-have games that almost everyone has and can and will want to fall back on. Gabe if you see this I don't care about Half Life 3 but PLEASE give us another Left 4 Dead game. Nothing has even come close to matching it in the coop experience.
15231,better than back4blood by a long shot.

15261,"The game is incredibly fun to play. It is one of the best Co-op zombie game to date imo. Though it might look a little old, you won't even feel it (except for the rare case of a smoker pulling you to an unreachable spot.  Being old it can run on any pc, it's a valve game c'mon). The game has a lot more to it than seems, there is a story for players who want one, the zombie exterminating experience is just phenomenal. You can watch crowbcats comparison video on youtube and then you'll understand why its a cut above Back 4 Blood. 


Is it worth the money? Definitely yes, if you have friends. It takes more than an hour to complete 1 map on normal difficulty. You can mod it or add extra maps if you wish to."

15388,GOOD
15389,Zombies
15390,"The good:  Fun game play, lots of replay value (especially with friends)
Classic game that helped establish Valve as top-tier game studio.   Brings Zombie survival to multiplayer.  Very unique mechanics for asymmetric shooter.
The action is fast-paced but the game is simple so it's easy to learn/come back to.  The levels have parts that are randomized by the computer so replaying it doesn't get boring.  Trash talking your friends and the crazy things that can randomly interfere with who wins make the game really funny.

The bad:  Match-making with strangers and toxic community.

Parts of the game can be hard to pick up.  For example, as infected you have to attack together and it's often the case that one person has to sacrifice themselves by going first so that the other infected can follow-up but people either don't know this or don't want to do it because they don't trust the strangers they're playing with.

It's hard to find good match making as everyone these days seems to want to find someone to carry them and so they vote-kick all the new players, many of whom are legitimately trying and just don't know what to do.   Long ago, somebody on your team solo-carried all the bad players and didn't care.  Now average players are flaming constantly and vote-kicking noobs just to get a better team that can carry them.  Nobody switches teams to even teams out.

Because infected requires coordination it's easy to get destroyed by pre-mades if you're rolling by yourself with randos.  If your teammates refuse to spawn as infected or you get incapped immediately by zombies as survivors then it feels like you're not reallly playing the game.

The game is not competitive and doesn't have a ranking system so why are you trying to win?  Nobody's keeping score.   Lots of people seem to be modding servers / running hacks to give themselves an edge also.

So basically it has the toxic mentality of league or some other competitive team-based game with no ranking system to reward you for overcoming the toxicity.

If you can find a community to play with or make a friends list then it's really a fun game still.  I guess it's getting a little old after 10 years.

So basically great with friends, kinda trash by yourself but it's a cheap game and you can make friends on line pretty easily as a lot of people want to make friends to avoid these issues."
15391,Left 4 Dead 2. My dad came back right as I downloaded the game.
15392,"good game

15393,bobo
15394,its great
15395,god game
15396,its fun to play
15397,"You know, I went back and forth about recommending this to others. The game is excellent, and the community  has lasted forever, but something rubs me wrong about the number of women that play this game combined with the reasons most of play this game, the thrill of leaving your team behind. For years I have pondered the mystery as to why women gravitate towards this game, and I don't really have an answer. My recommendation is purely to further the research into the science behind this mystery, where it leads us as a species I leave to you to discover.

Also, play on Rampage or Zombie Islands (10v10), but fair warning if you have not done much versus these servers are quite demanding. 20 years later though, its just what the doctor ordered, nice and relaxing and still with that thrill of survival at every turn. I am unable to think of any other game that generates the laughs per second that this one does, and to this day the deep level of investment in game design and art remain impressive, what it must have been like to work on such a focused game with such a limited budget as far as computer power goes.

I vow if I ever purchase Steam, I will make a modern Left 4 Dead ;)"

15474,"The second part of the game is much more detailed in every detail.
 Added in the second part:
 - more gaming companies;
 - a lot of firearms and hand-to-hand weapons;
 - adrenaline and a defibrillator were added to the first-aid kit and pills (with which you can bring a dead comrade back to life);
 - added new special infected;
 - also added grenade launcher and machine gun M60, whose ammunition cannot be replenished;
 - ""Fat Man's Vomit"" has been added to thrown weapons, which, when broken, attracts a large horde of infected;
 - Four new game modes have also been added: Realism, Gathering, Mutations and Combat: Realism.
 Also, new achievements have been added that can be earned on the added game modes.
 GENERAL IMPRESSION:
 Better than the first part of the game can only be the second"

15502,"If you can't tell, this is the classic zombie game of all zombie games. The remake, Back 4 Blood is an embarrassment to what these games stood for. One of the first outstanding looks at motion capture, the best procedural AI for zombies as they chase after you in hordes, and the general fun you get playing with friends. The beauty of the game comes from the sheer effort put into it all those years ago, and it standing up to this day. Games these days are rushed and rated Triple A (AAA) top of the line industry-rated video-games that use technology that proves to be more of a challenge to enjoy the game, simply because they had to cut corners constantly and satisfy the people in charge. The corporate market for the gaming industry has plagued our fun with glitches, bugs, copy-paste game design, and now the term ""Game Engine"" has shifted meaning from a complex system to run the game on, providing it with a software to make the game run and look amazing, to a buggy mess that gives the player lack of immersion because they didn't bother to work out the kinks of the physics engine or textures. I'm looking at you Ubisoft. The beauty of game design is in the hallowed halls of Valve. Where they have redefined gaming for almost every one of the titles they release. I cannot tell you the amount of nostalgia I obtain simply from playing this game in it's base form. No workshop mods, nothing. The hours I would spend alone, fighting with random people I met online or with my brothers as I trudged through horde after horde of monsters that LITERALLY FEEL LIKE THEY WANT TO KILL YOU. The horror genre was forever redefined. No, the Zombie genre was redefined after all these games started biting off of the premises introduced by the first game. Needless to say, in conclusion I have found that through all the times I have played on a PC for the sake of chilling with friends, one of the first games I still recommend is Left 4 Dead 2. A pinnacle of the gaming industry."

15557,"They don't do them like that anymore. Easily one of the best games ever made.

Left 4 Dead 2 is easy to learn and hard to master, yet what's even more important (in my opinion) is that it is ""pure"". It's pure in the sense that there's no unnecessary BS. There's no micro-transactions, progression, item rarity and the usual shit we see in newer names.

A must have for any ""gamer"", really. It's cheap, fun, with infinite replay value and obviously not demanding of a high-end PC."

15578,"Left 4 Dead 2 or as I like to call it: Left 4 Cope, is a fun zombie shooting game where your objective is to get as far away as possible from your friends. Common misconception is that you're supposed to work together with teammates, however this is false as you should be able to survive without teammates on expert.

 In versus gamemode your objective is not to win, but to rather to make your opponents cope as much as possible. Easiest possible way to achieve this, is by playing the game well and knowing the ins and outs of this game and exploiting the broken spawn system.

Recommend? Absolutely."

Moreover, the community's collection of mods infinitely customizes said experience-- the cherry on top.

I almost have no proper words to describe what Left 4 Dead 2 is to the community. This masterpiece is just that amazing. 100% worth the price, 1000% worth your time. If I were any less responsible in life, I'd double the hours I put into this game."

Comment:
Even if this game is 13 years old it still has really good graphics. The gameplay is a story where you need to complete a bunch of ""waves"", you gonna need to kill the zombies that are around the map until you reach the safe zone, you gotta do this over and over again until the end of the story. At first, it may be fun doing these, but after a little bit, it gets really boring cause you always do the same thing over and over, kill zombies, reach the safe zone, kill zombies, reach the safe zone. The multiplayer is kinda dead, there's almost no one playing on the multiplayer. But this game can run on any low-end system, of course with low settings, and it can get to 60 fps stable. I would recommend buying this in the bundle of the Game Of The Year edition cause it cost half of the price combined with 2 games."

Pain pills will also heal you, but only temporarily. Adrenaline is also temporary; Adrenaline triggers the body's fight-or-flight response. This reaction causes air passages to dilate to provide the muscles with the oxygen they need to either fight danger or flee. this makes you run faster,  perform actions faster and be an unstoppable force against zombies."

15741,Good game still goin strong. Wish they made a third game and made it better than the 2nd which would be a monumental feat.
15742,"I've turned this game in to a hentai simulator. Everything I do is a hentai or porn reference. My guns moan or sounds like a vtuber, my surroundings are filled to the brim with hentai, I turn to the right, I see Artoria Pendragon, naked with her pussy spread apart, dripping wet. To the left, I see that the vending machines are now offering 18+ goods, with rotating gifs of anime girls naked or partially nude, on the edge of nudity, in seductive poses. I look up, and my posters and boards are more anime girls, all naked and dripping wet. Their huge breasts ready to sway at you if you were to imagine them to. I look forward, and I see waves of girls coming towards me, all screaming Onii-Chan, with their war cry being heard from a distance ""Nico Nico Nii."" My squad of girls are ready, all with custom voices, naked 2B, Hitomi, Prinz Eugne, and Noelle. I watch as my squad blast down anime girl after anime girl, screeching Onii-Chan, then they appeared. I watch as we are killed by a round of special infected, all of course in the form of anime girls, all naked, all with bouncing breasts that are delectable to the eye. We've died, and I am back at my menu, I see that my entire background has been replaced with a 18+ Hatsune Miku MMD, with the icons for my menu replaced with girls having sex, or were finished and the background music has now been replaced with the Dead Or Alive menu music. I prepare to launch up a new game, with a new squad of girls, and I watch as my loading background, three girls with large breasts, glistening in the sun, I watch my anime loading icon spin around and around. We are in, I grab The Penetrator in turn for my pistol, and grab the nearby grenade launcher, which summons an animated vagina on the wall permanently, and set out on a new journey."
15743,A timeless zombie shooter classic
15744,"It's a good game, I guess. It's made by Valve so of course it's high quality. Too bad I can't get into it. I've tried three separate times and I still don't care for it. Sorry. :/"
15745,The game in it self is fantastic form campaign to survival but the community surrounding pvp is straight cancer if you want to have fun play campaign or any other game mode avoid pvp unless you want 13 year vets spamming the vote to kick button like there beating there fucking dicks
15746,"This game is very good, It has endless amounts of game modes, mods, and a lot of tricks to make gameplay faster. But there's one thing in mind that everyone has. Versus Mode, This mode is not very good for people buying the game. Sure Versus Mode is fun but one thing is that if you mess up even that is small nor a game-changer. YOU are kicked from the game not even lasting one chapter of the campaign. I had massive suffering but I kinda liked it. If you do play Versus for the first time. PLEASE, use guides first before doing Versus. Overall in my opinion. It's pretty good but none forgiving for Versus Community

Well imagine if you could kill some zombies WITH FRIENDS.Did I mention that you can also play against your friends. Yes, you heard me right. YOU can be the zombie and fight your FRIENDS. Oh also the mods. They are like INFINITE. Also the game isn't dead at all. This game is amazing and YOU NEED TO PLAY IT if you like zombie/coop/both type of games."

15815,"One of the best multiplayer games in history.  Even though i've only played this for a year, I feel like it's been far longer. The lore, the gameplay, the mods, the characters, everything. I can see now why Gabe Newell is considered as the Jesus of the gaming industry, appearing every now and then to make a miracle occur. Long live valve and this masterpiece!"
15816,I come to this game for zombies. the only thing i get is gay horny anime furries

15824,"This game is probably in my top 5 games. This game is a coop first person zombie shooter made in 2009. Despite it's old age this game still holds up and in my opinion, it's better than Back 4 Blood by a LONG shot. Buy this game if you want to have fun with your friends; or, and this applies to a lot of people, if you don't have any friends you can always join public lobbies or simply play single player."
15825,I highly recommend buying the game if you haven't. Tons of cool people who'd help you in the apocalypse and be friendly with you throughout the Left 4 Dead journey.

15945,Very good :)
15946,Its Probs the best COOP shooter out there and I recommened this to anyone looking for a intense and fast paced zombie action
15947,"Don't look at the workshop, worst mistake of my life"
15948,i liike the part with the zombie
15949,"First of all, compare this to COD zombies.
Personally I regret money spent on COD instead of the best zombie game in the world: L4D2.
Combines L4D1 and 2 so you actually do not have to spend more money for another campain. W o w.
It also requires teamwork so you cannot go away from your team. Or atleast you can, with extreme caution.
AI teamates are also very good. They do not have too much aimbot, nor do they health cheat. Or maybe they do, I never really see them heal. So I just heal them."
15950,very good
15951,Best coop survival in it's year

15964,Best zombie game ever

15999,"I really enjoy this game. Sometime it can be difficult, but hey keep on trying! It's super awesome, I also highly recommend this game to anyone who likes zombie first person shooter games. Make sure you have 3 friends (or more) to play this with cause the A.I's in the game are totally retarded! When you get injured, and are down to the ground using your pistols on the zombies, the A.I's will not help you, and it's so frustrating. I mean I can understand they're trying to kill the zombies but still. Usually this game goes on sell for 1$, or so. I got it on sell, cause like that's a pretty good price. Soo, yeah. That's what I gotta review about left 4 dead 2. Super crazy game, but it brings back memories of playing this on my xbox 360 with my brother, or usually by myself."
16000,"Good game been playing ever since 2008 I always loved the game back then even when I played It on xbox 360 and It's even now on PC with the mods
"
16001,versus mode:(
16002,I have thousands of hours on the 360 version of this game. This version is just as good but with mods. Love it.
16003,"Amazing game, a masterpiece"
16004,This remembers me of Doom The Movie
16005,very nice game
16006,"A product of its time.
Back then, games were made to be great, not sell skins."
16007,yes
16008,"good

16009,its another good game

There are moments of genuine emotion of, ""Am I going to get out of this situation still standing?"" or ""OH MY GOD THERE ARE 3 TANKS WHAT THE FUCK"". It's incredibly fun, whether it be with friends, bots, strangers, aliens, whatever, you will have a blast."

Heavily recommend for people to buy this, definitely worth the money no doubt and having friends to play with them is AWESOME!"

Over a decade old and still fantastic - Left4Dead2 is a fun expierience every time. Incredible love to detail makes this game feel newer than games less than a year old. An amazing multiplayer expierience.

16157,"I have a confession to make.

I downloaded a ton of anime mods off the workshop as a joke as a ""ha ha anime exterminator"" joke but now I cant fathom playing any other way. Every single zombie is an anime girl, the screams of the flesh-eating anime girls are omnipresent, the last thing I hear is ""niko niko niii!"" as my entrails are ripped from my chest cavity. I see this as the only way to play, the vanilla experience feels hollow to me now.

God help me."

16200,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

And from what I've seen this game is still thriving with players across the globe. I had been playing the pirated version of L4D 1 & L4D 2 since I was 8 years old, but now I have the games in my hands with everything made for it. + Workshop is the 2nd best feature this game has and all the love goes to Valve & Gabe Newell for letting us the community mod whatever we want.

The normal zombies can be aggravating when they swarm you as your speed drops to a crawl, and the CPU-controlled characters are delinquent kill-stealing kill-stealers."

16461,"It's a ton of fun, but only if you have at least one friend to play with, it's not the best as a solo experience. I do wish that there was a little more emphasis on story or exploration, instead of just shooting, that's just a personal preference though."

16605,What a classic game
16606,"This game is perfect and will forever have a special place inside my heart. The character interactions are very good that they feel like they're family. Every match is different so you can have different and unique experiences every match. Chargers appear as jumpscares every time, Smoker-Jockey-Hunter are the trio of killing your luck everytime you wanna go to the vehicle at the final (seriously super annoying), Spitter makes your team spread out, Boomer isn't really that annoying, Witch makes you scream at the top your lungs when you startle her, Tank is when you realise you gotta teamwork. This game is truly a masterpiece by Valve and Turtle Rock Studios. Certainly better than Back 4 Blood."
16607,good
16608,"this has been my favorite game since i was like 8 and till this day i still love every thing about this game,"
16609,"This is a very great game, the only bad thing is that there are less and less people playing making it hard to find multiplayer lobbies on some gamemodes. Other than that it's a great game"
16610,nice

16613,I Love This Game And I Recommend This Game To People Because You Can Make Friends And That`s How I Make Half Of My Friends And I Love Mods For This Game Im Writting This Review Because I Want More People To Play This Game And That`s What I Have To Say (Zombie Go Brrrrrr)
16614,bruhhhhhhh...
16615,"Like Back 4 Blood but actually has detail, environment, good sound design, interesting characters with voice lines that are contextually accurate and not so cringe you want to jump off a cliff....so I guess not like Back 4 Blood."
16616,"Such a great zombie game ever!!,
Even its an old game, still dominating :O"
16617,"For me it got boring real quickly, i don't know. As a kid L4D1 on my XBOX was much more exciting. Perhaps it was age."
16618,"game fun zombies go RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH left 4 dead 3 when? b4b suck

16627,its fun try it
16628,its a fuck but a fuck is good so its a giant fuck

16639,great game tbh
16640,"Left 4 Dead 2 is better and bigger than Left 4 Dead. It’s a sequel that builds on its incredibly stern and ludicrously fun foundations, expanding in all the right places and scrubbing out all the little problems that existed in the original."
16641,"this is the ultimate zombie apocalypse game for me.  the atmosphere of the campaigns is creepy and lonely and excellent, the world around you is destructible and interactive, and a lot of time was also put into replayability mechanics like multiplayer versus mode, custom levels, and allowing modded content so that the community can thrive long after the game's release."

16655,it gud
16656,"Do you want to take a co-op shooter and absolutely destroy it with stupid but easy to install mods?  Do you want Master Chief, Gordon Ramsey, Bowsette, and Deadpool fighting a hoard of anime waifu's thru the south?  Then L4D2 might be the game for you, you strange, strange person."
16657,Great for playing with friends or if you are in of some zombie killing fun.
16658,"Been playing this game since it first released on the 360. Hands down one of the best pick-up-and-play zombie shooters out on the market.  Between my xbox time and my time here on steam, I absolutely adore this game. The modding capabilities are endless and having access to hundreds of community made maps also just adds to the replayability of this gem. 

With mods you can update the graphics and shading to be more modern/HD and it performs well with low-high end PCs as long as you know what settings you're working with. For lower end PCs I highly recommend going easy on the workshop stuff because it will bog you down, for higher end peeps, go crazy and have fun. Let loose and mow down zombies as you work with your team to safety and survival! 

The community from what I've experienced is mostly wholesome, though I have come across some rather toxic players as well; but, that's the internet for you. You take the good with the bad, y'know? Seriously though, worth the purchase, still an amazing game that holds up even among the newer generation of games  released."

16695,"Good game. Have way more hours than on record from playing for the first few years of owning in in offline mode, but I love playing by myself and with friends. Would recommend to people with a love for FPS games. Can take a bit to get used to the game if you aren't used to FPS style games, but it is worth it if you work through the learning curve. 

Started playing the game around 7 or 8 years ago, so I wasn't playing from the very beginning, but I still enjoy the game nonetheless. I mostly just play Campaign though and not any of the other modes like Verses, Survival, etc, so I can't give my opinion on those modes. Either way, I would recommend the game especially with the semi-recently added new content."

17020,"As a 4-8 player party game, its a solid horde shooter, especially when you have that many friends to play with in either a campaign or in a 'LAN party' playing versus mode.
With randoms, I would not recommend it; more recently the community (especially in versus) might have become incredibly toxic and/or prone to draconian vote kicking, *possibly* on the level of *some* of the man-children that frequent TF2's mann up MVM tours, hypothetically at least, Ive not played versus w/ randoms.

TL;DR: fun horde shooter, but I recommend against playing with randoms."
17021,"Very bad game, please don't buy it."
17022,GG best game ever.
17023,Goated game
17024,fun to play with friends and fun with split screen.
17025,"amazing game thats better than b4b buy this game immediately if on sale or not , 4-8 player game that made me grow up with a smile 
"
17026,"I used to have this game and didn't think much of it at the time.

Now I play this game so much. It's insanely arcadey and is one of the few games that is hard to find just like it. I feel like most similar games lack it's arcadey feel. It's so fun to go back in and mess with friends to kill so many zombies over and over again. The game just doesn't get old, it's fun to jump right back into it again and just mess around.

The 4 survivors are all great and enjoyable, Nick's a sarcastic jerk who lightens up as things goes on, Coach takes charge and is fun mess, Ellis is hilarious, and Rochelle is a witty badass. This even includes the original survivors and they're also so good.

Oh and I didn't even get into MODS. You can either turn it into a meme mess, a unique fun take, a dumb crossover fanfic, or just flat out enhance the game with vanilla mods. One of the things I do, vanilla wise that is, is make everything winter during the winter season to make everything feel colder. 

Custom campaigns are also another way to enhance the game. I recommend looking through them and the community to find the best ones, people make lots of creative and vanilla feeling campaigns.

Overall, heavily recommend. It often goes on sale for the cheap, comes with L4D1, and this game is so fun."
17027,"bruh this game is pretty good, nice gore effects, good sound effects, funny lines, and easy modding (if you are interested)"
17028,"VERY GOOD

17040,yes
17041,Fantastic game. So many different things to do and complete. I love achievement hunting in Left 4 Dead and playing versus is incredibly fun. Although I like the Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns more I still enjoy the campaigns in this game and the L4D1 campaigns have been added to this game anyway. Although versus can be super toxic it's still a fun experience and has a huge skill ceiling which means you can always improve in virtually any way. Highly recommend this game especially for it's price.
17042,Game
17043,"Who doesn't like fighting zombies?

While the updates occur once in a blue moon, this game will never lose its touch.  It will always stick up to what its supposed to be -- a horror survival first-person shooter.  When you see a tank, you know its time to run.  When you see a witch, shut the light off.  Or else."

17085,"This game saved my life.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."

And ever since i switched from xbox to steam, It's been such a pleasant, infected annihilating experience, with addons giving you the opportunity to make the game look and feel however you desire. 10/10 would death charge again <3"

There is nothing more satisfying than getting into the rescue vehicle on expert difficulty, knowing that you got there purely by you and your team's evolution of skill in combat, strategies and experience. No bullsh*t  ranking system that needs grinding to get an edge on the AI. PURE SKILL. The AI is also intuitive with convincing navigation and appealing characteristics of the infected (tracking, gore, idle animations, physics based shoves etc.). AND THE MODS AND MAPS ON THE WORKSHOP JUST MAKE THIS SOO MUCH MORE FUN AND ENGAGING. DON'T PLAY L4D2, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EXPERIMENT A LITTLE. Not only are there some spectacular crowd sourced campaigns i.e. YAMA, Red Tide, Discrapper etc. But also an abundance of models, textures, sounds etc. that bring soo many laughs to any campaign.

Highly recommend"
17154,Just how i remembered playing it when i was younger  :D will still come back after it being so long!!!!
17155,classic as always
17156,Play this game. Beat it vanilla. Download mods after. Have fun. 10/10
17157,"The game itself is pretty good, the price is fine and items in TF2 are great.
Can be difficult sometimes, but it'll get easier the more you play it. Yet it can be impossible without losing one of the characters. (SPOILER: The Sacrifice, The Last Stand [Tank on top of the house].)
I like the design of campaigns, and the finales of them. Those are basically just survival.
Difficulties can be at some parts of campaigns where you need to rush through GIANTS HORDES OF ZOMBIES. You can be confused ""Where do i go now?"", me too, since usually there's no navigation. I also liked the mechanics of some zombies, like the Clown or the Witch.
Price says for itself, not the best, but not the worst. I recommend the game, 8.6/10"

It's clearly light years ahead of its time. The gameplay is incredibly well balanced, each weapon works differently and each zombie type is unique. The controls are also very simple and easy to get used to. You must rely on your team to survive the hoards of undead that come your way, and lack to do so results in certain death"

A well balanced PvP that is great fun with a big group of friends or even matching up with randoms for a quick game that keeps bringing you back. Along with campaigns that change every time you play with help of The genius ""Director"" a.i. gives the game endless replay value.

Jockey？Monkey！
By the way, Creative workshop is very useful that can help favorite characters join the survivors mods."
17301,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower."

17322,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. The sequel to Turtle Rock Studios's Left 4 Dead (2008) and the second game in the Left 4 Dead series, it was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in November 2009, Mac OS X in October 2010, and Linux in July 2013.

Left 4 Dead 2 builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of zombies known as the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and act extremely aggressive. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale. The gameplay is procedurally altered by the ""AI Director 2.0"", which monitors the players' performance and adjusts the scenario to provide a dynamic challenge. Other new features include new types of special infected and an arsenal of melee weapons.

The game made its world premiere at E3 2009 with a trailer during the Microsoft press event. Prior to release, it received mixed critical and community reactions and attracted an unusually high volume of controversy about its graphic content. In response, alterations were made to the cover art, but both Australia and Germany refused to rate the unmodified edition at the time of release. Despite this, the game was met with positive critical reviews and is considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made, much like its predecessor."

I wish the new series was as good as the graphics...
A Left 4 Dead fan will not give up on this series."
17340,workshop make this game give you more fun !
17341,"This game has been one of my favorite games since i first got it on xbox360 years ago even now on a computer its still one of my favorites and its still really good!
But it does have a few cons.
-depending if on your laptop i'd recommend a plug-in mouse to move the screen abit better if your fire weapon button is clicking the mouse since the screen can get very wonky sometimes using a touchpad but lowering sensitivity helps that if you dont have a plug-in mouse
-Campaigns on maps can be a little annoying and not great with certain players being completely rude and killing you if you lag behind just abit or pick a certain weapon and not rescuing you leaving you to die constantly but other times you get the good players so its kinda a gamble with some people
But other than that its a wonderful game to play and i highly recommend it if you like first person shooters and zombies."

17443,"L4D2 shows you that you need to be on your feet at all times and always cautious of your grounding because staying at one spot for too long can cost you with hordes and special zombies. Fast paced zombie game with tons of mods for any taste and it's generally really fun on multiplayer/with friends. For only 5-10 dollars, you can experience this."

17445,the pioneer of fast paced zombie games👍
17446,ywe
17447,"This is one of those games where it proves the statement, ""Old is gold.""

L4D2 is amazing. Not because the gameplay is THAT fun. IMO, its a mix of it's interesting and short story as well as the value you get playing this game with friends. 

The story is great for a zombie game in an industry where it's just the same schtick multiple times over. Even if it's just haha zombie virus go brrrr, the characters really glowed it up. Ellis, Bill, that one guy with the suit. Coach is fucking awesome. 

And the value you get with friends. When you play with people you truly are friends with, your experience gets multiplied by ten-fold. That one time where one of my friends shot a witch while taunting it, only to get obliterated. Ah... that one was good.

Overall rating: 8/10

L4D2 is awesome on itself. Combine it with mods, it will be a 10/10."

17538,"One of the best games ever made, no hyperbole.

Shooting never gets old, flawless general game design, brilliant small design details you may not even notice, but the game would be obviously worse without, strategy changes greatly depending on which mode you play. Anyone who says it's just a mindless but fun zombie shooter has never tried playing Realism Expert (or even Advanced). At its core, it's a game about communication and coordination. Infinitely replayable.

Don't do numbered scores, but this would get a perfect score."

This game has lead to me losing 1/2 friends and my only friend is my mirror. Days have been getting harder these past 127 hours. Please, do not buy this game"

17621,"I can't think of any other coop game that can be so fun and enjoyable, as many times as you play it. I have spent hours and hours playing with friends and losing it because of the mods we had installed or the times we mess up, or how the game is overall.

L4D2 is great, most of the characters are very likeable and have amazing personalities. The campaigns are very fun and memorable, and the gameplay, is not so complicated, but very fun, it can be very challenging sometimes tho, especially on higher difficulties, but it is always a blast to play through, plus you always end up finding little secrets you had no idea they existed along the maps.

And of course, the elephant in the room, modding is incredible. There is a lot of very good mods in the Workshop which can make the experience overall very funny, and you can change almost everything about the game as is. Plus there are campaigns made by the community, so you never really run out of content, there is always something new to do.
(There is a lot of trash on the Workshop too, like in any other Steam game that has one, but it is very easy to avoid)

Overall, very fun, especially with a party of friends. Absolutely would recommend."

17769,"I am so late to the crowd but damn I love this game! I thought I hated zombie stuff but this game is fun, for the most part.
AFter this game has been out for 12 years or whatever, I do wonder why I notice Quality of Life things right away that I wonder why weren't implemented by now.
-quick matchmaking with custom settings. If I have settings such as Difficulty set to Advanced in online play, why not make auto match making do that too? It just defaults to normal and any map, lobby or not
-Reorganizing the credits. Some people seem to disagree with me and try to say 'thats's not  the point of a co-op"" but I'm going to say in any FPS I care about my kills. Why do I have to wait until the VERY BOTTOM of the long credits to see total kills, team saves, special kills.. I dont care about how long the game took, how many revives I had to do.. Show me kills first!
-which leads me to, would be nice to show me my stats at anytime when I hit TAB in game. The in-game tab is 100% useless as far as I see, just shows ping? 
-An easier way to MUTE people. There are some annoying ass people that dont turn off their mic and I shouldnt have to take a class in C++ programming to figure out what to type in console to mute somebody.

Minor QOL things but would love them. Someone said 'there's a mod for that' and yet, I didn't find any.

Other than that, fun game!"

17779,"[h1] Best game ever, However... [/h1]

One of my favourite games of all time, barely anything comes close.
This game is a perfect amalgamation of everything I love, CO-OP, zombies, play as zombie, Campaigns that aren't super long and super re-playable.

The single most impressive thing about this game is the Director, it makes the game so much more interesting with it's different pathings, unique system of what comes next.

Most of the maps are very satisfying, have great settings that aren't just at night time. I'm glad they added more day time maps compared to L4D1 when it first came out.

Music is fan-f*cking-tastic

The addition of the steam mod workshop to keep this game alive after so many years was such a blessing because it keeps players..playing. It keeps me invested to see that so many creative and talented people create models based off characters I enjoy in other media. The creativity in map design from some of these mods are seriously unreal, it can be breathtaking at times. One of my favourite things about this game for sure.

However, the one or two problems I have with this game is;
[b]Community[/b]
This community has got to be the most confusing thing ever. Players can range to- incredibly fun to play with- to absolute a**holes- to some who are chill/relaxed who like to just play for fun, nothing serious- to incredibly toxic slur induced cry babies. Also, so many people have disgusting sprays it's ridiculous.

They whine if you make a mistake, kick you for making a mistake. They take versus so competitively that if you slip up even once, you're kicked no questions asked, no second chances. Have a furry pfp? Get absolutely harassed by everyone in sight, no one there to defend you. You have no right to judge anyone by what they like, if you can't even do research on them. Not all of them f*** dogs, no one judges you for your ugly army loli pfp, so leave them be. I could go on, but this is already getting super long.


[b]Versus hit detection (both sides)[/b]
The hit detection for both sides is atrocious. When you're perfectly lined up with a survivor as lets say a charger or jockey, it teleports the survivor to the side while you just go through them. It can cost you the game easily and is incredibly frustrating. (This doesn't apply specifically to Charger and jockey, it's everything, but probably not spitter.) 

When pouncing a survivor it's even worse. When you pounce someone as hunter or jockey, the survivors can push you from a mile away. However, when YOU'RE survivor, you line up the shove so perfectly you think you're going to get the stun? Short answer, no you f*cking don't. Your shove was completely worthless, which happens about 85% of the time by the way. It isn't about ""getting good"" because I absolutely should have gotten a stun but it didn't count. I should also mention, this happens at any ping. It happens when you have low ping but can also happen at high ping (obviously).

Sure, you can argue that this is a 18+ game, but most of my concerns is when these so called ""adults"" play this game like whiny cry babies, it makes the game unbearable.

[b]Overall, I would rate this game a 9/10, knocked down a point just because of the community.[/b]"

17782,"Good game. Plenty of active players. Entering a lobby is quick, unlike *that other zombie game*. If you play solo, it's still plenty fun. Fun game-play types besides playing the usual storyline."
17783,"So take your friends and plunge into this world of hell zombies (more species of especially infected are waiting for you!), From which you don’t want to leave before dawn. In the second part, new companies are waiting for us, which are filled with the drive of rock and the sun, and a different atmosphere in relation to the first part. But despite this, both parts turned out so well that the developers took the companies from the first part, added them to the new version of the Source Engine, where you have not only more weapons, but also more especially infected enemies, for which you You can play multiplayer battles 4 on 4.

If after many hours of the game you feel that you want more from this powerful engine and this world of the game, then to your attention is a library from the Steam Workshop, which contains 1000 different modifications from a simple weapon skin change to a large-scale changes of everything you want, and if something is not found, then maybe soon I will see your modification in the top of the best :)

R.S. The most unique case is that when the developers released the first part, and a year later they released the second, and made it not only worse than the first, but even better!

17852,"Its been 18 hours without Roblox, I can’t stop shaking and I’m having severe mental breakdowns. I woke up today trying to log onto Roblox but the site was down, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. I couldn’t go to school today, I am so worried that I even took my dads gun from the shed, thinking of killing myself. I am nothing without Roblox, it is my life, it is my destiny, without Roblox, I wouldn't be able to do anything. Roblox is the best thing ever made and I can't get rid of my addiction to it, it is the best game in existence . I can't stop trembling and crying, I am very worried. I used all of my money on Roblox, I bought the Super Super Happy Face and bought a Valkyrie for my girlfriend CoolDjoleProGamerYT. I don't know what to do. Roblox can't be gone for any longer cause if it does then I'll go insane again.. breaking my mouse, chair, house and everything I own. Roblox is very amazing and I can't lose it. Roblox is my life, I met my amazing girlfriend john there, In bloxburg, I was delivering pizza's, when I saw this amazingly attractive woman named, CoolDjoleProGamerYT, she was so cute, I flushed. I found her home later then and tried to talk to her, she was so kind and cute that i accidentally typed my thoughts out ""mind: she's so cute.."" and she flushed then i got nervous, we then went in and made out, after that we went on many dates to Adopt Me, where we adopted 2 boys named DemonicLuciferr, and RedDoflaming0. Demonic and Red were so cute that I even took them out of town and took them to Brookhaven. after that we had our own child in Bloxburg on our rooftop named lazerlamps. Our kids were so cute and amazing that I even fed them my special milk, they liked it so much that they wanted it again. and the day after... Roblox was down and I went through my panic attack, Shivering in fear of losing my fiance and kids. I am so scared that I might just lose my mind and go insane... I want my kids back"
17853,dude this game is awesome. and when theres mods on the game becomes godly. like short ellis amongus common infected and buff steve tank and much more. i really love this game

I don't have many people to play this ,so I play a lot of Singleplayer with bots 
It's fun but it has some issues and has to do with the AI functions
The AI take so long to help you with special infected and reviving 
But overall the game is a lot of fun and is a must have"
17971,Fun.
17972,Now I know why Back 4 Blood is dying. Because the REAL creators of Left 4 Dead ain't there.

17989,This is game is absolute hotdog water and I love it!!!
17990,I've put countless hours into L4D2 on the Xbox 360 back in the day.  The game is just as fun as it was back then.  Playing with friends is highly advised as that adds to the fun factor.  Mods adds to the experience as well.
17991,Just as amazing as I remember playing when I was younger
17992,Left 4 Dead 2 x Killing Floor :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes:

17995,good game!!!
17996,"noice
"
17997,it is very fun on it's own but it is super fun with friends.
17998,"Great maps, I found myself not getting misguided as nearly as much as I was in L4D1. Reviewing this many years late, but the ideas for the enemy additions were excellent as well and I don’t think they could have chosen any better for a game that requires a lot running, shooting like crazy, but also team coordination and skills in special infected dispatching or evasion. Each map had really recognizable OST that sticks with me to this day. PvE and PvP are equally fun and offer a satisfying amount of things to do for those long term players who occasionally need a break from continually going from one campaign straight into another. The characters they chose to utilize were great and equally as funny as the interactions you would find in L4D1. I credit this game to a lot of fun weeks of gameplay in my childhood and it continues to be entertaining each time I play to this very day. Overall also an excellent game if you’re a beginner at video games or even streaming and you’re looking for material that won’t fail you or perhaps your audience. Plays better with friends but NPCs from my point of view had less issues with me than they did in L4D1."

18000,"literally a must have in any steam library for any not babies out there, plus its 10 bucks literally a steal for one of the best co-op games out there"

i love left 4 dead 2 i never stop playing, my wife begged me to come eat supper cause the kids haven't seen me in months, i told her L + Ratio and now shes taking the kids, luckily with the power of the steam workshop i used addons to change her divorce papers into a photo of dababy eating a pepsi hamburger

18012,mods very cool
18013,"needless to say, it's a Valve game, so polished, preformant, and highly modable (thus infinitely customizable). I would recommend this game, so long as you have people to play it with (the more the merrier)."
18014,"Easily one of the best co-op games ever made with functionally infinite replay value and amazing depth to it's design. 
The fact that you can play it for 10+ years (used to play it on my brother's steam account before I got my own) and still hear new voice lines every now and then, and continually find yourself in new and unique situations, is a true testament to the craftsmanship with which Valve has made this game.

Turtle Rock may claim to be the creators of L4D but in reality they are not. Valve are the ones we have to thank and I do believe that should be very evident by now. 
Don't bother with TR's ""spiritual successor"", play L4D if you want the best zombie apocalypse experience with friends. Especially now with it's price being so low it's a complete steal."
18015,Good Game
18016,"I played this a while ago, and this game was my childhood, and to come back to Left 4 Dead in 2022, its just awesome, the gore, the guns, the glory, all of the above. Its a great game, highly recommend."

Peter Griffin Boomer Peter Griffin Tank Peter Griffin Coach in Grove Street from San Andreas, Minecraft zombies being killed by a heroin shooting Ned Flanders with a shotgun shouting ""AMONGUS,"" The undead making Mr. Krabs walking sounds while moving at any speed.  the game is amazing but modding makes it perfect, I would love to see modding ported to console but that can be hard sometimes.  I love how left for dead still holds up when compared to some modern and triple A games, you may say that's a bold thing to say but that is just my opinion and you should form your own opinion.

Base Game 10/10

Modded Game 10/10 peter griffins"
18028,one of the best games I have ever played. Still holds very strong to this day both in terms how it looks and how fun it is to play. Amount of community content is mindblowing which extends the main content of the game many times.

18035,This game is iconic since 2009 it became more iconic when Valve allowed mods for models guns and even maps the thing I like about it is changing the voices for specific models its kinda hard to do but its worth it

18049,Great game till the latest patch in Feb22. Everything went down the drain after that. Probably the developers want to force the players to try and migrate to their new game Back 4 Blood. It was fun while it lasted.

18079,"The absolute best zombie game of all time. Many have followed in the genre but not many can match up. Just recently, Back 4 Blood was fun and tried to bring back the formula but it couldn't overtake the classic. My honest opinion? I love this game. I've been playing it for over 10 years. I am patiently waiting until after Q2 2022 for my Steam Deck to arrive. I will play this game for 10 more years, except on the go, something I've been wanting since gameboy. Please hook a bro up, lord of PC. Thanks for the magic."

18174,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a classic zombie game that's fun and full of great moments. if you haven't played left 4 dead you are absolutely missing out, its worth the money especially if you have friends who like games. the zombies look, sound, and feel authentic, (especially when they're mauling you). Coach, Ellis, Rochelle, and Nick are the four playable characters and each of them has their own personality to really help you connect with them, in my opinion this enhances the game because not only are you murdering zombies but you're also listening to the very good dialogue which improves your time playing exponentially. I love this game and I think you will too. Highly recommend."

18273,"A masterpiece as both a zombie game and as a co-op multiplayer game! For me personally I'm not that into PVP multiplayer, and prefer cooperative play with my friends, and this game just satisfies that fully! A really fun co-op game with some fun shooting and scavenging for new weapons! Great maps and characters to play as! 

I did try the Xbox 360 version, and while its the only way to play this game on consoles, this game can run on practically any new PC or laptop these days, so I recommend the PC version above all else. Not only do you get way better performance, you also get access to the Steam Workshop which provides you with a whole suite of mods from weapon skins, character skins down to new entire maps for you to play on which is incredible. Last night, I was playing a match with a friend and thanks to mods I had my characters dressed as Big Smoke from San Andreas; Leon's police uniform from Resident Evil 2 and another character dressed as Tony Montana from Scarface. What other game are you going to get an experience like that?"

18324,"Valve titles have always been a level above the competition, but left 4 dead 2 takes the cake. The levels of polish are insane, you can get lost in the minor details and small considerations that just make the game perfectly immersive. The graphics, though from 2009, surprisingly still hold up today. Being a Valve game, the level design is incredibly intuitive and very thoughtful. The zombies are much more believable than other titles, they mope around when they have not seen you, in-fight with each other, they act diseased, they have momentum when running and moving and there are over 1000 death animations so no two deaths are ever alike.

All in all, the game is a masterpiece and definitely worth the £7.19. Shooting a zombie in the stomach as he runs towards you and watching his bowls spill out all over the floor whilst being able to see your team-mates through the whole you just made is still one of the coolest effects in any game I've ever played. 10/10."

18327,"Back when I was younger, this game was one of the best multi-player game with theme of zombie for playing with friends!! It's been 13 years since this game has been released and still we can agree it's one of the best and can even compete with some of these new games !"

18337,"Valve, by your actions, namely by restricting your users from one of the largest regions of the earth the ability to fully pay for anything in your store, you deprive yourself of monetization, as well as people's trust. In all the conflicts you have shown yourself worthy, but now you have become like those who have always been a bad example for you. I don't understand what you want to achieve with this. If you want to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine, then you clearly do not need to take away one of the few good things that we have left, because no one supports the Russian government, including the Russians, but by this action you only strengthen the pro-Propaganda tales about the ""evil West"" and that there are only enemies around Russia. I hope that people at Valve will see this, that they can somehow influence this.

Valve, своими действиями, а именно ограничением своим пользователям из одного из крупнейших регионов земли возможности полноценно оплачивать все что угодно в вашем магазине вы лишаете себя монитезации, а так же народного доверия. Во всех конфликтах вы показывали себя достойно, но сейчас вы уподобились тем кто всегда был плохим примером для вас. Я не понимаю чего вы хотите добиться этим. Если вы хотите прекратить кровопролитие в Украине, то вам явно не надо отбирать одну из немногих хороших вещей что у нас осталось, ведь никто не поддерживает российское правительство, в том числе и русские, но этим действием вы лишь укрепляете пропогандисские сказки о ""злом западе"" и о том что вокруг россии одни враги. Надеюсь что это увидят люди в Valve что могут хоть как то на это повлиять."

18402,"A fantastic game that reminds me just how terrible I am at shooter games. Only fun when played with friends, obviously. Highly recommend playing with a crew of varying skill levels. Any leftover character not played by a friend ends up being the useless robot you bully for the entire game and fight with your teammates over whether or not to leave them behind to die. Good clean wholesome fun"

18405,"back 4 blood reminds me why this game was good

it's all in the details"
18406,"It's a classic zombie shooter with a great cast of characters to play as while downloading mods that make the experience fun. For replay value, I recommend listening to some music or podcasts as you replay the levels in the game. Easy 10/10 I honestly don't give this rating to a lot of games but this does deserve it."
18407,super duper cool

18422,"Probably one of the best if not the best zombie game of all time. Every aspect of the game is perfectly crafted to an unbelievable level. The characters have unique personality and background, the level design is top tier in gameplay, story, and aesthetic design, the mechanic is simple with a high skill ceiling, every round almost never feels the same thanks to The AI Director constantly changing item spawns and the amount of infected and special infected based on your performance, the game is filled with content both in singleplayer and co-op/multiplayer, the atmosphere is a perfect blend of action, horror, and comedy, full compatibility with the workshop to give extra replayability through mod guns and custom maps, I can go on and on. The all time classic indeed"
18423,such a nice game
18424,good
18425,Best game ever @!!!
18426,"So I've seen this game here and there, and I've always thought ""Meh, it's an old game, I doubt it's that fun"". And honestly... I was SLEEPING on this game. I got bored and bought it now, and my goodness it's so much fun. The best horde shooter I've played yet. And plus, because it's an old game, it runs amazingly well on my friend's office pre-built PC, and we play together.

So if you're into FPSs, and looking for a fun, fast-paced wave/horde shooter, this game is absolutely worth it. And even if your friends have an old, poopy PC, you can still play together with them. And it's not that expensive as well, absolutely worth the price.

And of course, the mods. The modding community is extremely active, and all the mods are a-plenty. It can be something really cool, or something downright stupid. It's great.

Damn great game. Love it."

Game description key-points: an outdated Co-Op game with Zombies, much better than 1st part. For free or cheap still has some powder to offer fun for your time.

Overview:
definitely was cool and good to play back in the past days, but the main downside are outdated textures.
The is also some credibility behind hearsay that it`s the best part in series, beating in some aspects 4th part.

There are two options to play it: as a Single or multi-player game.
Online with other players is really fun, beating Zombies by all means in different Levels designed to get to a safe house destination point by literally clearing the path full of zombies and some powerful hostiles.
Also other game modes, like survive or looting etc."

It was on L4D where Gabe Newell’s presence became more apparent. I think Portal 2 was the group’s undisputed masterpiece. It’s an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three games."

so if you got friends for full lobby and possible to host yourself go for it. otherwise would wait till they atleast do something about their servers. but prob wont since they dont make money of skins"

18550,Still awesome today.
18551,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

Very good game, it's like it never gets old.
I recommend to buy and play this game, very fun.
Game basically about shooting the infected aka zombies but with special zombies that attack you in different ways.
Like, the boomer vomiting on you, their vomit attracts zombies and blurs your vision you for a moment.
Then there's the smoker that will choke you with it's tongue, meaning you get incapacitated, and you have to wait for your teammates to help you, so you can move again and shoot zombies.
Can also get lots of achievements, play different modes, and co-op which, I'm up for.
Yeah."

18615,"After 42 hours, I can say this game is one of the best on Steam. It wouldn't be one of the best if it didn't have workshop support.
Final Rating (w/o workshop):
6.5/10
The game is decent fun without mods, but slowly gets boring up until you finish all content, which it becomes pointless to play afterwards.

Final Rating (With Workshop):
9 Glenn Quagmire jockeys/10
Modding the heck out of this game made me appreciate all the franchises and characters I love even more. I even made the vanilla L4D1 and 2 crew into my favorite show's main characters, along with changing the name files and changing the intro cinematic to the show's intro!

I wholeheartedly recommend this to the ones who haven't played yet...which is very few people...
Just remember: Quagmire Jockey is watching.

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

18671,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

I really wish I could get rid of this vac ban but apparently it is non negotiable so I'm stuck with the vac ban and currently got the game deleted off of my library as a playable game, none the less its still a good game.

The game also gives a lot of interaction beetween the survivor players by making them talk, respond to a problem and even change their friedships between each other!

A very fun game to play with friends and by yourself. The story line is pretty long and you probably won’t go through it in a day. If you are sick of multiplayer and the campaign there are plenty of mods from the work shop that make the game a little different to you changed the campaign.

18811,This game is just fun.
18812,"almost a millennia ago my mother and i used to play this game on her laptop on a hill, i was so young back then but i still remember the howling winds and the strange animals walking through the towering trees, at one point i even got attacked by a small bear, but nothing could stop me from playing this game, even if i won the lottery and had to raise my head from the screen so they could verify my identity i wouldn't budge. its almost like i can hear faint voices calling upon me to get up, one of them sound very close to my mothers voice, which also sounds like my voice. that would make scene since my mother has left me because i couldn't stop the game to respond to her not even once, i now live in endless misery due to my own incompetence. anyways good game 10/10 would play again"
18813,best game ever and even better than back 4 blood.

18825,"This game is a timeless classic, and although the game has aged really well, many of the people who still play it really bring the whole game down. Certain members of the community (like Khomchik) have inspired players to treat the game as a competitive free-for-all, rather than a cooperative survival shooter. You'll constantly be running into speedrunners and griefers who ruin the game, even in the co-op campaign, unless you bring friends along to kick them out. Be nice to your fellow survivors and help them out, especially if they're new. If new players get scared off by the so-called ""professionals"", then this game won't have a strong community for much longer."

18836,"This game is solid but frustrating. I think that the AI difficulty definitely got increased in this game from its predecessor and your teammate AI also got dumbed down pretty considerably.

I think the sandbox and cast of characters is more fun than the first Left 4 Dead game, plus you have a bigger campaign selection than the first game, but once again the steep increase in difficulty (or maybe I'm just not that great at the game) is one of those things that makes the experience kind of frustrating overall.

I definitely think this game is great and it's a timeless classic, just more frustrating than I remember."

18843,"honestly, I'm using the most shittiest laptop in the world to play this game, and thanks to the wifi's very slow network, it runs pretty fucking decent. I used to play this when i was almost 10 years old, and it gives me joy that this game is still one of the classic games in the Valve company....or well Steam, or shit idk, to give fans the pleasure and creative experience to play one of the greatest games in the Microsoft store. Straight up 12/10 stars. i definitely recommend this to folks who can't get enough of the nostalgia, or to folks who hasn't played this masterpiece yet."

We didnt have no tools to cut him out so I called up his cousin who owns a tow truck. Now let me tell you, keiths cousin is dumber than the gators in his backyard, because he went right ahead and hooked up the pickup truck and started to drive away. Man you shoulda seen the look on keiths face when the truck started movin, he about saw the lord himself. Keiths cousin couldnt hear keith screamin bloody murder in the back over the radio, so he went drivin all the way back to Savannah! Keith suppose to be in that wheelchair for about 4 months, but 1 week later he said that it was all healed up. Just goes to show how much of a champ keith is."

18884,"l4d2 gameplay: haha gun kill zobie l4d2 lore: Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Kimbra:]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Gotye:]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

If you're a fan of zombies and FPS then this is a must buy. If you're buying this game then you might as well buy the first game because it's just as good. The Workshop mods make this game twice as good.

Also if you have the time. People need to start demanding Valve to make Left 4 Dead 3."
19037,"Enjoyable game to play with friends with multiple different game modes. Definitely a hallmark game of Valve. Must try this ""classic"", and very fun to do so with friends. Though beware of toxic players in online modes and strange hitboxes when playing as special infected zombies."

19044,gud
19045,yes
19046,"""Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?
Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh... Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

19086,My friends and I bought this game while it was on sale. Playing this game with friends has been so much fun. We have been playing through the campaign and it has brought us so many laughs. This game is an oldy but a goody. It holds up pretty well and it runs smoothly for me. If you want a fun game to play with your friends that doesn't take itself super seriously then I recommend this game!

Valve really knows how to polish their games and they do it better than any other game company in my opinion. Keep in mind this game is 10+ years old and still looks amazing. This game is on sale all the time and belongs in the library of game enthusiasts.

19199,"Possibly the greatest zombie game out there. The multiplayer gameplay is unsurpassed, and it still holds its standards after 10+ years. It's challenging, but not to the point where it's frustrating. The game promotes teamwork.

Subscribing to mods in the workshop that's made by people around the world makes the game more enjoyable. The game deserves its M rating for blood and gore, intense violence and language.

Met a lot of good people because of this game. Overall, this game is fun. But very bloody, scary, and contains frequent uses of mild bad words. Would not recommend this for kids below 12 or 13 unless they go into their game settings and turn their gore level to ""low"".

800+ hours on record. Had to use a different account bc of complications in my other games."

19248,"THIS shit ass
"
19249,"It's better than Back 4 Blood because Valve did quality control on this and it shows.  They did details that still stand up to this day and while you may not notice them, your brain does, and it will know if something looks or feels off.

Shoot guns in a dark tunnel?  Muzzle flashes actually light up the area, and that brief light even casts shadows.  Dead zombies float on water.  Many objects that move or break when you hit or shoot them.  Etc.  Valve even hired actors and used motion capture to make zombies and survivors move in a believable way.

A 2009 game somehow beats a game from 2020-2021."

19348,The gore is so satisfying
19349,"Welcome to San Andreas, I'm CJ from Grove Street
Land of the heinous, gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos, neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competin', even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast wit' the flag on the strap, that's OG!
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get supercut and big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats: Respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps
Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survival's good (Survival's good)
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bus' a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas's full of gangsters, homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers, homeboy
And it's dangerous, homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers, homeboy
Heat cocked, we poppin' hot ones, dump 'em out
Bend the block, shake before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap, catch a straggler with the shot gun
Hittin' them up, what that Grove Street like
In a dirty slingshot and old Levi's"

19377,"When I first saw this masterpiece, I thought to myself...this is the perfect opportunity--for me to get some booty.

See, the most important thing when you play this game is owning...some man's butt.

That's right! Owning...getting Owned is more important than Back4Blood...More important than food OR water...

When I see a human Ellis I like as a Jockey...I tell'z them like'his'here...

I like's ya...
(Tank: He LIIIIIIIKES YOU!)

and I want's ya...
(Francis: *Nods* He hates you.)

NOW...we can do this the easy way...or we can do this the HARD way...choice is yours...
(Ellis: I...did...)
(Nick: Ey Ehllis!)
Spitter & Rochelle: I can't..can't hear ya Ellis! The man did ""axe"" you a question.)
(Witch: *Seth-loathing crying because of life choices, while Boomer in the kitchen getting chips to charge the cantankorus Chaturbate-Charger. Bill and Smoker left to the chopper to get cigarettes again today).

Ellis: Did I ever tell you about the time my buddy Keith almost drowned in the ""Tunnel-of-Love""?
(Everybody: O.o o.O <.< o,o -.- ^.^ *.* X.X xD : | @.@

Ellis: ...see you woul'nt think it could happen. 'Cause the water'z so shallow. BUT that's how it gets you...Over-Confidence. Now see, Keith was wit' his lady...an' do you know what suck the headz mean? It ain't nuthin' bad--itz about eating...

(Coach: Boy...you are wearing me out! (           >          .          <         )

19394,"PILLS HERE
"
19395,"Left 4 Dead 2 is one of those games that can survive for Hundreds of years! This game shows all the aspects of too how CO-OP and Zombie FPS games were made for! This game in particular is one or maybe best Zombie games of all time! It has great Voice Actors , Great Graphics ( for a game made in 2009! This is better than most movies back then! ) and great weapon animations! Valve has completely out done there self's, but the sad part is that valve discontinued the franchise for no reason? ( This game is he best MMO game and valve has lost millions due too this! ). Now they got this new off-brand L4D2 Game called Back for Blood / BFB, That game has worst graphics then L4D2 and L4D1 Alone?! All the aspects of B4B are off branded to affect L4D2 Fan base? Overall this game receives a 10/10 Rating from me TOTALLY RECOMMENCED! Note : This game "" L4D2 "" Still receives re-works and updates most of the time. :))"
19396,"This is a Pretty Decent First Person Shooter.  For an F.P.S.; It's fairly easy to learn, Cultivates Comradeship in Multiplayer Scenarios, and does give you a sense of accomplishment when you've completed a difficult scenario.  I found that after a frustrating day; it's almost a relief to get off: ""A Few Hundred Bursts on some Zombies and Ugly Creatures""......but, that's just me.  It's a fun game, it's enduring well, Our Friends at Valve did a Great Job.                                                                                                           Recommendations:  Learn to use everything at your disposal well.  Check Your Targets before you Burst. Stay Moving, and be ready to duck into good defensive positions at any time.  Be Aggressive, Don't be Cow'd, Take the fight to them as much as you can.......because you still gain ground.  Always fire in Bursts, Reload Every Chance you Get, Always keep a full mag.  Alway......and I mean Always Stay Together, and if you can't.....pair up.  Everyone Team up on Specialty Creatures(They're the Real Threat).  Lastly; Use Good Clean Combat Movement if you can, and when stopped: Use,Line, Half Circle,and Alamo. Be ready to Kneal(CTRL Key)...so that you may take advatage of Firepower Redundancy.   Our Team Leader is: ""CREED"", ""ELVIS"" is Back......and Dropping Undead Left and Right.  I am ""Whitetalon""......I'll Catch You in Drift My Friends."

19420,"just buy it bro
"
19421,"As a once avid player of the series on the Xbox 360. it's a no-brainer to get this game even for the asked retail price. Coupled with Workshop integration, the player is able to create or twist their own zombified apocalypse which is sure to keep anyone entertained for countless hours. A timeless masterpiece of a zombie shooter."

19436,The game is masterpiece!
19437,"I cant believe people like this garbage game. People say that B4B is a bad game compare to this game (a lot is true ) but not like AI, story, characters its all the same in both games. no real enjoyment, graphics like that of the ps1 with bad textures and horrible sounds. Its no wonder that this game and others of this company becomes real cheap because there is no good content, fun or story line. this game franchise should just back up and leave."

19468,"You cannot play this game with 1 friend. You need to to play solo or with a group of friends. With one friend, the bots actually just are useless because they cannot decide who to follow and just refuse to damage zombies in favor of pushing a jockey or hunter off of someone and will not shoot whilst backpedalling. It is fun in very moderate amounts. The workshop support is great and the level design are interesting but seriously, the AI companions complete kill the experience and ultimately make it much more challenging then playing with 3 friends who are incompetent at aiming."
19469,"shoot zombie, game good"

19527,"gameplay is pretty good, one can thoroughly enjoy the game"
19528,much blood. much fun
19529,good game
19530,"I've been playing this game since I was a kid. On the 360 this game was amazing, and today on PC it remains as one of my favorite and most played games of all time. Every detail in the world and every aspect of gameplay is just fantastic, as well as the characters and their VAs. With the ""director"" controlling how each campaign plays out, almost every time you start up a game, it can feel completely different from your last playthrough, which gives even more incredible replay-ability. The day I'm writing this, I actually experienced a tank spawn in dead air which I've never seen before. It's incredible after countless hours of killing infected and surviving finals, I keep coming back. Personally, my favorite campaign is No Mercy, but each campaign is actually really good besides like 2. They each try something new, and add a new atmosphere to your surroundings. Another addition is how story telling is told through the world, by drawings on walls, posters, or even an entire building. Overall, I really recommend this game, which still holds it's standards after 10+ years. If you're looking for a ""zombie"" shooting game, this is the one. Please don't pick Back 4 Blood over this-"
19531,its fucking perf!!! XD
19532,sdsds
19533,"So many things about Left 4 Dead 2 are ahead of its time: the sound effects, the gore, the gameplay, the aesthetics...
While all that of Back 4 Blood feel like they're of an old CoD game Activision couldn't care less about."

19535,10/10
19536,zombies but awsome
19537, It doesn't hurt

19539,Left 4 dead 2
19540,it should be a crime to not have this game already.
19541,it gud
19542,This is a real review that steam didn't even have to pay me to give. If you have 3 friends to play this game with you should buy it for yourself and them too if you can afford it so that you can play it together. I have over 100 hours with 3 friends from HS and hundreds of hours with others. I wish I had thousands.
19543,fun
19544,its a good game
19545,kill zombies = fun
19546,The best zombie game out there period.
19547,Never gets old. That's all I can say.

19549,good game zombies goes boom - boom
19550,good game
19551,"Tons of community mods. I have modded this like crazy. It's fun with friends, and fun alone. It's an old game for sure, but I can't say it's bad. Can run on a potato if you lower the graphics settings.

Conclusion, damn good game. Probably should buy it."
19552,"incredible game! a great find for all fans of zombie shooters. great levels, believable weapon physics. no extra game modes, they are all interesting and exciting. difficulty levels allow both beginners to play, without the risk of destroying the keyboard in a fit of anger, after the hundredth loss, and experienced players. and cons ... yes, what are the cons, they simply do not exist here, except that the characters of the second part are slightly less charismatic than the characters of the first part. 10 out of 10!"

19610,"The AI for humans is beyond awful, like I really don't get how it can be so bad. 

There are issues with the game design like how in versus mode you can't take a break even if you have been playing for an hour straight. This is so simple to fix to, like having a mandatiry cooldown every two rounds or something.

And worst of all is the community, it is extremely toxic. You will either end up with: 

a) Elitists who will kick you for the dumbest or most minor of reasons. Last night I was kicked because a person who clearly cannot speak english tried to tell me something through voice-chat and I simply couldn't understand him. This also brings me to the issue of how easy it is to abuse the vote kick. If someone has atleast one friend in the team then they simply won't be able to be kicked out no matter how much they f@ck with the team. If they have 2 friends then you are completely at the mercy of their caprice.

 or b) you will end up in servers full of people who don't know how to play the game which is logical to happen when the environment is so hostile to learning.

There is so no place for those who are neither experts nor noobs.

Simply put, the game has not been an enjoyable expirience. It is painfully clear to me now that it is a game explicitly designed to be played with friends, people who you know and can chat with. Unless you have friends which are willing to play this game with you then I am afraid this is simply not worth it. 

TLDP; DON'T buy the game if you plan to play online with random strangers."

19617,The best survival game and zombies that will entertain you for the rest of your life and are highly recommended
19618,"My goodness. Where do I even begin? Let's start with the fast and easy answer first. Left 4 Dead 2 is an absolutely phenomenal game. I really recommend this to everyone! A personal 8.3/10. 



But let's get into the details on what I think of Left 4 Dead 2.

• The gameplay. What can I say? It's a blast to play, with multiple game modes. And maps. There is also a large number of custom campaigns and maps. There are thousands of community-made things in the workshop! If you ever get bored of the standard gameplay loop or if the game is too easy, there are a lot of things you can change with mods! If the game is too easy, then. I would recommend these [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1675287324] difficulties [/url] made by lizvullok! But other than that. I would give the gameplay a solid 7.6/10

• The community. A solid 10/10, if you exclude the bad side of course. But the player-base is a wonderful community! There is an amazing. Wiki to look at if you need information, and players usually help answer questions for newer players, and don't forget about the guides! There are a ton of guides to read about ranging. From information about the special infected all the way to the fine details of the weapons! So a perfect 10/10!

• The sound effects. Like it's spot on, they absolutely nailed the sound design for Left 4 Dead 2! The ambient to the hoard theme, and not to mention the special infected sounds. They are truly terrifying. One of my personal favorites is the witch sounds. It just sends a chill down my spine every time I hear her! A solid 9.6/10!

• The infected. One of my favorite zombie games and the common zombies are really unique! And then you have the special infected. All of them provide a unique danger to you and your team! For example, we have the boomer. They will explode on death and will puke on you and your team. Which causes normal infected to come and beat you to death. Which will fall under the infected support list! Then you have the Hunter, a beast at picking off people. They will jump into the air and ponce on any survivor. And quickly and efficiently kill them off unless killed and/or shoved off the person! An amazing, set of dangers for you and your team and a solid 8.4/10

• The weapons. And finally the butter to the sandwich! The weapons you have at your disposal! Ranging from Shotguns, AR, Snipers, and more! and you also have melee weapons to choose from too! But be aware. You can only have either a pistol or a melee weapon. Not both. But either way, you can choose your own playstyle! So go beat up the zombies with a bloody golf club! and while you'r at it, decapitate them! A beautiful 9.4/10!

I really enjoy Left 4 Dead 2, it's one of my personal ways to release my anger, But hey. I'm just a person on the internet so go do what you want to do! Go blow up things in a different game who cares! It's your own life bro. Go have fun.

I hope more games likes left 4 dead comes out. (Not that they'd ever get close to the same enjoyable gameplay of L4d but hey, a man can dream)."

19721,"[h1]The Best Zombie/Horde Shooter Ever[/h1]

One of, if not my most favourite games of all time. I don't have a single bad thing to say about L4D2.

Born before the major take-off of lootcrates and micro-transactions, L4D2 is pure co-operative fun. Loveable characters, wonderful level-design, fantastic voice acting, satisfying gun-play; it's truly perfect in every way. The amount of attention to detail that goes into Valve games aren't lost on anyone, and L4D2 is no exception. 100's of voice-lines, animations and dynamic situations keep this game a blast to play to this very day.

L4D2 comes with the famous ""AI Director"", a scripted artificial intelligence that changes and enhances your gameplay based on how well you and your team are doing, and the current situation. Doing too well? The director will ramp up the difficulty. Struggling with that one level? After a few restarts and deaths, the AI Director actually takes pity on your team, and will be a little more forgiving going forward, spawning more guns, and triggering less random events.

The game is a blast from start to finish, bring your friends for more fun as you'll need to rely on them just as much and they will need to rely on you. There's honestly nothing to dislike. No lengthy loading screens. No weird forced XP systems. No nonsense. Just boot the game up, shoot and ask questions later. 

Truly one of the best games I have ever played, and still do play. There's just nothing like it, and I love it. Oh, and it also has Steam Workshop support, allowing for 1000's upon 1000's of mods. You can modify and change the game to your heart's content."

There is a section where you are in a stadium and you are waiting for rescue to arrive, there are zombies everywhere around you, so you start defend yourselves while rock music plays in the background. It is one of if not the best zombie shooter in existence (besides Undead Nightmare, but that's a DLC). It has an amazing community which will be glad to help new players. The game also has an impressively big modding community. You can download a mod which will turn the Tank class into Shrek. The gameplay is so addicting and unique. For example, when you right-click your mouse, you don't scope in like 99% of shooters but instead you shove. The maps are distinct and memorable. My favorite being Dark Carnival. The game has several different game modes like: Campaign, Single player, Survival, Versus, Survival Versus, Realism, Realism Versus, and Scavenge (there might be some more but I can't remember them). If you are a parent and you are wondering if you you should or should not allow your child to play this game then I'd say that this game is 12+. There is blood, gore, and swearing. However there is a mod which gets rid of the blood. If you don't want any gore then I recommend that you download the Minecraft Zombies Mod (last time I checked the mod doesn't have any dismemberment). I don't think that there is a mod which sensors out the swears. Who knows, maybe someone has already made a censoring mod and I'm just stupid. No matter who you are, I believe that you will enjoy this game. It is a lot better than Back4Bloood, I'll tell you that much."

19937,"One of the things that made me appreciate L4D2 is how timeless it is, I don't need to grind any levels and can just join the game and have fun. Modding is also a great aspect of the game which I like.

The difficulty in the game isn't tied to any setup or progression you necessarily have to have, it's based more on actual difficulty and forces you sometimes to do more things like hitting headshots or sticking a lot more together. Compare that to other games like payday 2, you have the complete opposite."

19951,"Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night.Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeletonwithout its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night."

Sometimes they are quick to help when you are incapacitated and others they take an obnoxious amount of time to rescue you.  Co-Op is fantastic as well. Always fun to play with a friend. Those are the only modes I’ve dabbled with. However, there are plenty other game modes to choose from as well.  The campaign maps are all memorable too. Including the L4D1 levels. Swamp Fever, Blood Harvest, Hard Rain, and Death Toll are the highlights for me. The rest are fantastic too.  Just get the damn game."

20058,"Scenario: 4am. The hordes just keep coming. Your Caprisun? Empty. Your pizza lunchable? Mutilated. Mozzarella shrapnel is scattered about your lack of chest hair. Someday, you whisper under your breath, God willing if your father has passed down the right pair of genes, a luscious chests fro will rise from this mixture of white cheese and Flaming Hot Cheeto ash.  Sweat beads drip down your temple. You clench, but a gaseous cloud escapes your rectum. When will this end? You think to yourself. Has it been days? Weeks?  Who am I? Where did this Oreo come from? Were there Oreos in that lunchable? Your pet lizard Whiskers seems to  have escaped captivity. There's no time. He was a brave soul, but not all hope is lost. The Last Stand is here, but your bowels are failing. Was the Code Red Mountain Dew really a good choice for dinner? Probably not. But you're a solider. No one notices your sacrifices. You're doing this for the rest of the world. Why can't anyone see that? The door bursts open! Another fart escapes with a clap. You're mother is there, furious. ""ROBERT NIGEL MCDOODLEBOTTOM IT'S 8:30 YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN IN BED 30 MINUTES AGO!"" 8:30? Why did you think it was 4am? What is time? She never understands. You've crossed the bridge, but production at the turd factory is at an all time high. Maybe you should've made those modifications to your sweet gaming chair. A 5 gallon bucket underneath that seat would work wonders right now. But alas sacrifices must be made again. This one is for you Whiskers. Your Garfield underwear are stricken with the skidmarks of war. You pass the Porta-Johns as you grow near the extraction zone and think I could really use you right now, Portable Johnson. Rochelle goes down. Not again, you can see the chopper. A hero never leaves anyone behind. You feel a piece of beef jerky stuck in your teeth. No one said this would be easy. As she regains consciousness, its now or never.  You make a break for the heli. Your assult rifle is singing louder than Gloria Estefan at a Superbowl halftime show. You only watch for the commercials anyways. As you finally board the chopper a sigh of relief is heard. A true masterpiece that withstood the test of time. Even if you were in the Twilight Zone."

Why the game is good

You can run this game on a potato
Zombie

"
20069,this game is one of the best zombie games
20070,No sex mods.
20071,pretty good game.
20072,"nice game, awesome gameplay"
20073,Once upon a time i used a dildo chainsaw to cut up a zombie
20074,Its pretty good worth to play with friends
20075,Good
20076,best zombie game for ever
20077,"I don't think I would be able to add anything more to say to the countless other reviews that others have left on this masterpiece of a game. Words cannot do enough justice to describe the technical and artistic quality of this game. It is albeit a relatively dated one considering the current generational demographic, but nevertheless, this game is a legend. I recently decided to buy this game to reminisce the days I spent with my friends as we played hardcore runs of the co-op campaigns, and the game plays as fun as it felt in my memories. Buy this game ASAP if zombies and co-op makes you smile. You won't regret it."
20078,GOAT
20079,still a masterpiece
20080,hell yes
20081,"I don't think this is the zombie game XD. But ofc this ""zombie"" game are 9999 times better than Back 4 Blood. Released on 2009, but still fun to play until now, especially there is bunch of Workshop on this game."
20082,"Get a few buddys, start a server. and boom hours of fun ass gameplay. a great buy"
20083,Left 4 dead 2 is also one of the best games I have played in recent memory it can run on a potato and is still so much fun today so check it out.
20084,when L4D3?
20085,oyunu modlayın
20086,BACK 4 BLOOD
20087,iz fun
20088,this game is more fun than back 4 blood.
20089,i turned it into halo and committed multiple clown genocides
20090,boom
20091,"the campaigns, survival, and the workshop mods combined are amazing I hope to see more maps be created on this game like dedicated Campaign maps, for example like Tomb Raider, Luigi Mansion just stuff like that, and a voice pack one and two for the Bayonetta replace Rochelle they got. Other than that Please give this game a try I love this alot cause it's never a dull moment"
20092,"i come to kill zombies
but my friend forced me to install anime girls character"
20093,Nice game but holy shiite the AI survivor so dumb. This game is much better with friends or anyone who you can invite to play with. We manage to survive all campaign map just the 2 of us in advance difficulty but we struggle a lot cuz of dumb AI survivor. Still hate the AI but I still play it XD
20094,"How many mods would you like to have on this game?

Me: Yes"
20095,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

20099,"l4d2, like tf2, is a good and fun game, it is very well made, as is tradition with valve games

it's priced around 10 bux or 8 euromonies, at that price you really can't go wrong with this game, I still play it with friends as it's just... so easy to start games and pop into it

"
20120,"playing this game in 2022 - still exciting & fun with awesome graphics!
I played online a little, and from my experience there were still quite a few players who got through full campaigns, they were helpful, polite and experienced. seems to be a cult following of respectful players. That my experience anyway,
But the modding community is really what makes this game worth buying. Left 4 Dead would be (ahem) dead to me by now if not for the mods you can install to replace enemies, survivors, sounds, weapons, etc, and there are new campaigns to play through as well. The mods add a whole new experience, and I wish more games had such options. You can change the blood color to green or blue, replace zombies with terminators, Mars Attacks Martians, stormtroopers, ZOMBIE stormtroopers, Alien Xenomorphs, Quake Strogg, the list goes on. You can even get basters from Star Wars, with laser blasts and everything. Although don't get me wrong, original Left 4 Dead games are classics, the excitement of bonding with well-designed and developed teammates, both AI and/or other humans if you have them, the levels to explore and the engagement and the super detailed graphics are all great, but I wouldn't have bothered to come back and start playing this again in 2022 if not for the Steam Workshop. I sure hope Back 4 Blood has some modding support in the future, I'd definitely buy Back 4 Blood if they have a buncha mods to play around with."
20121,you know why this is good
20122,"I like FPS Zombie games.  So I should like this one.

Except I don't.  Why?  Because of the moronic ""turn this on then run around to turn it back off"" parts.  Seriously... every damn zombie can climb.  Is that something imparted by the infection, because none of the survivors can climb over a damn fence to shut off the perpetual-horde-summoning noisemaker?  

So no.  Thumbs down."
20123,"very awesome game, i just hope that they make an ACTUAL better game like this. not B4B"
20124,im feel
20125,haha modded weapons go BRRRRRR
20126,"I always feel like once a year I come back to this game and just relive what is left 4 dead

20233," It depend on the periods you can come accross nice players who will help you to make achievements but if you fall badly you will have ultra toxic players...

If you do not go to the Steam servers (in game) which are all full of cheats impossible to finish the most complex achievements.

Lot of people play and don't care or do not know about Steam achievements.

I forgot the waiting rooms of the different game modes (survival, collection...) are often empty.

If you don't have a team of Steam friends who want to play this game it will be too hard to get achievements because  there are too many hazards with players online...

"
20238,"[b]My background[/b]: huge fan of first-person shooters.

[b]What I like about Left 4 Dead 2[/b]: the variety of the Versus gamemode. I'm only usually playing two campaigns (each consisting of five maps) — you'd think the game would become stale at some point in time. 111 hours in, I’m finding it more and more interesting as I’m finally at a point when the symphony of working together with your human teammates against your human opponents comes together and it just clicks: 

Walk through the corridor to avoid getting detected by the Infected → restock ammo → rush through the zombie horde to the next point → choose which teammate to save first → keep a safe distance from a Boomer → shove a Hunter away mid-pounce → cut a Smoker’s tongue → get pinched by a Charger → GG! Close match and all eight players had fun.

[b]What I dislike about Left 4 Dead 2[/b]: not much. With no proper matchmaking system, veteran players and newbies are often placed together — and that’s a recipe for a conflict, which usually ends in kicking players out. Also, some special infected mechanics (e.g. precise pouncing by Hunters or throwing rocks by Tanks) feel intimidating at first."
20239,"Left 4 Dead 2
-------------------------
Still one of the best zombie/horde shooter games out there.
It's just phenominal to see how much fun this title still is all these years later.
If you are doubting to get a horde shooter with zombies, then do not hesitate.

get L4D2, you will not be dissapointed.

It should go without saying that this game is well worth the full price, but if you are still on the fence, this game has gone on sale fairly often.

20272,"Personally one of my favorite games of all time to gameplay, story and just straight enjoyment. Grab a couple of friends to gun down hordes of zombies or maybe even die together. The amount of content this game provides is unless and with the workshop you can make it even 2x as fun. This game came out in  2009 and to still see the community supporting it and still playing is a miracle. This game never fails to amuse me and for that I make it my favorite game of all time 10/10"
20273,i really like the new jerma type they added into game also uhhhhhh its made by valve so its going to be good ofc unless its portal that game is boring
20274,i like the game but i think it may need more maps guns
20275,V gud
20276,i like it when the zombie go boom
20277,"I have been playing this game since it came out, mind you I owned and played it mostly on Xbox360 at that time. But, I have the best memories thanks to this game. My friends and I would stay up late all talking on a chat and being idiots. 
 I have played many zombie games since L4D2 and none can compare, in my opinion. The character dynamics are great, the game play, story line, hell even the graphics are still good to this day. 

I will forever cherish this game, and I will always recommend it to someone who is looking for a fun game.

"
20283,"the zombies are coming and so am i
:)"
20284,This game is probably one of the best co-op zombie shooters that encourage teamwork. The only thing is ask that would fix this game to perfection is if they added automatic Custom campaign downloading. Valves Older games have this were they automatically download custom maps and all its custom stuff.

20286,"I can't believe that I haven't written a review for L4D2 till now!
Do I recommend it? Hell yea!
Do I think it is an amazing game? Of course! It is a masterpiece of a game! Even now, after 13 years from its release, the game community is struggling to develop a game that's near it. You can find stuff ""coming near it"", but never matching its grade.

However, the only downside of this game is that it took the trend of action more than horror. If you played L4D1 you will notice it is more a horror game than an action game. While L4D2 took the trend of action with adding new weapons, melee weapons, adding more grenade types and so on.

All that aside, L4D2 rules all zombie games, with no competition. Games like World War Z and Back 4 Blood are trying to reach the stars, but L4D2 made the competition so fierce that no one could do it."

20504,"This game is litty. So let's get something straight; I'm not racist. We got that? Can I continue? Okay, thanks! This game is so stupid and bad but that's what makes it so fun half the time. One minute you're setting yourself on fire with spicy juice the next you're getting tongued, what's not to love? There's a nice variety of zombies, such as, Adult film star (Spitter), Lung Cancer (Smoker), Allahu Akbar (Boomer), Jockey, The Cooler Jockey (Hunter) and my least favorite, chronic masterbature (Charger). We also have the tank but who cares about that gorilla. The campaign is really short, we can probably beat both games in a single afternoon, however the replay value is high for me. I hate first person shooter games because I'm bad at them but in this game..... Yeah I'm still bad but the AI carries me so it balances out. The game is fun especially with friends. Playing the campaign with friends is lit but playing the campaign with the cpu makes you want to tie your dick in a knot. Recently I've been playing Versus more because it's the only good game mode. Controlling the zombies and cumming all over your friends with Boomer is so satisfying *wink* but I will admit, the game mode is not balanced at all. What else can I say? Valve knows how to make great number 2s and they seem that they can't count higher than 2. Portal 2, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 dead 2 and Half Life 2 *sniff* there will never be a sequel to any of these games will there? Solid game would recommend. 2/10"
20505,"I like how the game relies on teamwork and strategy to make it through the game. Basically one surviving player will not last long by himself/herself. However this is a double edged sword, as now if you have a bad team member that does not contribute, it brings down the whole gaming experience! Especially if there are two of them that are just clueless. Still this is an amazing game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombie type survival games."
20506,very good
20507,"Amazing next gen flashlight shadows, superb gunplay, a vast variety of special zombies, pristine death animations for common zombies, interesting map design ... my friend and I, again, are back 4 blood in this masterpiece of a game."

So, I purchased the Valve Bundle, downloaded the game, got a pal on, and went to town!
I mean every hour was just pure bliss I couldn't ask for a better experience.
Not to mention the ease of access to load mods FROM THE STEAM WORKSHOP, this is unprecedented for a sweaty Xbox gamer like me. 
The only caveat and and forewarning I have for any console gamers getting into L4D2 on PC is this. There are and you will run into really toxic people on this game. Although I can't vouch for everyone, but I believe there is chill peeps out there.

20576,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

20651,"I missed the initial hype for L4D, but I decided to get this last Lunar Year sale for like £1 and In the 22 hours I've played, I have absolutely fallen in love with this game. I've spent most of my time playing with my friends and it's always an amazing time, only made better when my mod illiterate friend and I discovered the community made mods, now all the zombies are Neco-arcs, Coach is Fat Albert and my guns moan, L4D2 is truly a masterpiece. I've also played a little bit of the game solo, just to appreciate the writing, animations, level design and everything else lost amongst the noise Shrek as the Tank, and while I already knew Valve were masterclass artists in their craft, L4D2 really demonstrates this with it's famously 780 ways Zombies can die, still impressive graphics and astonishingly expressive facial animations. L4D2 is an absolute masterpiece and still maintains one of the best zombie games ever made. And yes, it's leagues better than Back 4 Blood."

20666,"good gaming moments 
"
20667,"This game is amazing. I played this game on the 360, and even on console I enjoyed it very much. One of the benefits of getting it on PC is the mods. There is literally hundreds of thousands of mods you could download, from audios, re textures, (my favorite) gun skins, to even whole playable CAMPAIGNS. And there are more mods being created everyday. Not to mention how easy it is to install them. I strongly recommend this game because of the infinite fun. The multiplayer scene is also good, the most people I have ever seen playing this game is around 23k (pretty sure this was like a month ago). My favorite game mode is survival (my best time is around 12 minutes lol). Oh yeah and they literally have all the l4d1 campaigns and characters so that makes it even more worth it. All in all this game is great, fun to play by yourself but even more fun to play with friends. 11/10"
20668,fun

20739,"FACT: Valve games are great games. Hundreds of thousands of people are still playing their games, even though they were published more than ten years ago. CS 1.6, Half Life, CS:GO, Portal, Alien Swarm, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2. And Left 4 Dead 2 is no different from those that I just mentioned. It is basically a co-op zombie killing game with an interesting story to follow, and decent characters to play (Coach, my favorite dude!). There are normal infected, and special infected (Jockey, my worst enemy!). 9 on 10 from me."

20753,"Obviously great game, has been out long enough that I think everyone is well aware of what the game is like. Not anything I can add.

Horrible, horrible community. There are of course friendly people, and they are easy enough to find when playing anything cooperative. If you have interest in anything versus, though, you are likely going to be constantly kicked, berated, and without any real kind of feedback. The experience has been overall horrible, the worst from any game I've ever played. I understand why people may feel frustrated, but if I am not given any feedback and instead am just kicked over and over, I'm just going to stop playing. This is probably why there are so few games running at any time at this point."

20814,"Left 4 Dead 2 is another first person shooter game, but with a zombie theme.

The player character is a survivor of the zombie outbreak, the only human survivor of the entire ordeal.

The player starts with a single pistol and a light backpack.

There are several types of weapons available, ranging from assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles.

All weapons have different damage types, the player can find different types of ammo in the game.

The player can also find different types of health kits and bandages, with varying healing effects.

In the original Left 4 Dead, health kits have a finite amount of healing power, and if a player runs out of the health kits they must be restocked.

Health kits are only useful if the player stays still and is not actively fighting the enemy, as the"

20867,"This game doesn't even need any more validation at this point. It has proven itself to be one of the best of its kind.
Insane replay value thanks to the ai director or whatever the devs were talking about in their commentary video. The characters' everchanging dialogue really make you feel immersed in the game. All the survivors have their own unique, likeable character except for Rochelle but she has been played by players who save me from jocky enough time that i don't really mind her. 

Why write a review about it then if it doesn't need any validation? 
Because when a game that has been made with so much passion and care for their players has been claimed to have ANYTHING to do with a new shitty, money-grubbing, passionless game like black 4 butts, you should be offended. When their promotion material contain a cocky girl who follow the rules of ""Tell, don't show"" because they don't believe the audience has any shred of ability to infer and understand any subtle cue and dialogue from their characters, you should be offended. Today's game standard has been on decline sooo much lately and when a certain tortoise studio game try to ride over the fame of a legendary game that they hardly have contributed anything to, it shouldn't be tolerated. There should be consequences. 

I remember one time they gave interview that they want to make it ""Bigger and better""

And here allow me to response in Coach's deep manly voice.
""Hah! Better maa ass"""

20904,Best zombie game ever made. just waiting for the 3rd one as always
20905,"Want Play This
"
20906,"It's strange how a game that has no rewards system or any sort of tier/level thing can be one of the best zombie games of all time with a replay ability that can keep old and new players hooked. There's something so visceral about this game that makes you have fun, be on the edge of your seat and not give a care about some sort of reward, at the same time. The reward is a hell of a good time. Even the AI still holds up as intelligence, knowing when to help not just you, but each other, going into safe houses when you arrive at your destination instead of standing outside forever. Just expect them to focus on healing you more than run away from the tank with you. It's you and/or your friends slashing through zombies with randomized dangers hopping out of well crafted and designed maps. With a few bits of references, secrets, lore, mutations and fun achievements, even support from a massive modding community, Left 4 Dead 2 will always be a special gem for most people."

20929,They should do something like this in real life
20930,"Played this game ever since it released on the Xbox 360 back in 2009, while I enjoyed the experience as an FPS zombie game, the Steam Workshop for this game enhances the experience and adds much replayability. If you ask me, this is Valve's best game. An iconic quintessential zombie shooter with lighthearted humor and characters. 100/10

EDIT: I have literally never met a more racist community than this game. People drop the N bomb all the time just casually. This game, while great, has an awful fanbase and multiplayer experience. A command to disable chat would be nice"

The game is still very active even though the release date was well over a decade ago. Compared to Back 4 Blood, this is what i'd buy. its simply more fun in my opinion."
20940,Zombie
20941,"Really fun game to play with friends and even by yourself or with randoms in a lobby. I really like the versus gamemode, it's so fun to play as the special infected. I recommend this game if you want a FPS moddible game, who doesn't want to mow down teletubbies with a chainsaw?"

20964,There was no zombie dogs 0/10
20965,no one told me there would be zombies
20966,"First... all you noobs saying ""I cant find my way around"" ""Map's are terrible, I get lost""... you're just retarded stop eating lead paint chips and pay attention. It's very simple my 12 year old sister has beaten the Campaign numerous times on Advanced and Expert. I personally have not experienced any major bugs... or any minor bugs. Of course there are some map glitches, Like DC-1 you can jump the second floor of the hotel, and thus cheat the infected from being able to reach you. But... that's minor. And I'm sure in Competitive (cal/cevo) play it's not allowed. And most casual gamers don't use the glitch, if they even know about it. Actually it seems like the Competitive teams are the one who use it, go figure. Anyway... this is obviously not an expansion, and in no way, shape, or form should of been a DLC. This should of definitely been a sequel. Rushed? Maybe... High Quality, Action Packed, Suspenseful, Fun, Co-Op Survival? ABSOLUTELY. Hands down, BEST ZOMBIE GAME TOO DATE. The original was already amazing, but this game definitely expanded the gameplay, and added a nice new story to it. Originally I was put off, thinking this might be a buggy piece of DLC trash with some Lipstick on it, But that is definitely not the case. You people crying need to find a girlfriend... Or get a job so you can earn some money to buy this game and stop being so jealous. And that's another thing... it's not like Valve is out to get your money, they make a quality game, and market it, If you don't want to buy it, DON'T. Simple as that, they aren't holding you up, they're selling a product that they worked hard on. And... all you people talking about Lazy Coding/Programming... I do it for a living, and all work done on this game is of High Quality. Sure sometimes you take shortcuts, but the new weapons and new uncommon common were done beautifully and in no-way did I feel like i was wielding the same weapon with a different skin, or fighting the same zombie with a different outfit. Bottom Line, Great game, WORTH EVERY PENNY"
