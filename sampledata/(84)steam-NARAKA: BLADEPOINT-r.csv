1,Excellent gameplay mechanics and amazing art! Only downside for me is that I wish the abilities were more flashy and that they release characters more quickly!
2,"The best game I played in a while. It as everything I wished for, character customisation, great movement, skill based combat. I feel like a god damn ninja.

solid 9/10"
3,Nice
4,It goo
5,nice game
6,BOOBS!!!!
7,Amazing game!
8,dislike nothing about this game its awesome
9,It is a very good game and with time it's going to be even better.
10,"Naraka: Bladepoint is an action-adventure battle royale game developed by 24 Entertainment and published by NetEase Games Montreal. It is a battle royale game where up to 60 players fight each other to be the last one standing. The game incorporates martial arts-inspired melee combat and features a rock-paper-scissors combat system.There are vast arsenals of melee and ranged weapons to choose from, as well as a grappling hook that can be used for both combat and traversal. In addition, each hero has unique skills and talents, allowing for customization to suit your play style."
11,yes yes yes
12,good
13,the combat mechanics are so satisfying. Best battle royale game so far and my dream game is naraka type. A w for this one. You guys should probably love this if you are a attack of titan or naruto fan
14,"Very pleasant gameplay, worth a shot"
15,"Visually quite appealing (and fun to play when the ping doesn't act spicy, which is like all the time)"
16,not bad
17,Gave depression for a few months 9/10
18,"Good game, love the cosmetics and the fighting."
19,"This game is just another battle royal. it does have a cool take on it, its just melees and a few distance weapons, but for the most part it is really cool. just battle royals are kinda overdone imo."
20,the best games
21,"good enough game
"
22,"i liked everything
"
23,"Poorly optimized game, match started but assets are still loading for first 2 or 3 min, servers are not good, weird spikes here and there, when game fully loads its fun"
24,this game is so fun
25,dead game
26,"The combat is very fast paced with movement being important, along with the Rock/Paper/Scissors 'For Honor' melee type combat it is very nice. The addition of abilities and ultimate's make play making very interesting and spicy. 9.5/10 for combat.

Graphics are very nice, along with the attractive women and swole big men."
27,"Really great game, i do really enjoy playing it"
28,"So a month and a half after the release of crossplay, there is still no fix for the cross platform party bug between xbox and steam. Why?? Not even a mention of it, how? Shouldn't this be a simple fix, I can see if it took them 2 weeks but this is just ridiculous."
29,very fun battle royal that is unique in that its mainly melee based . nice little mix up to the fortnite and apex like battle royals out there
30,"Definitely worth checking out if you're interested in a melee focused battle royale or something a bit different in general. I'm nearing 30 hours in and still having a lot of fun with it so it's worth the price, but I'm still a long ways off from being any good.

Pros:
- Very fast paced, intense PvP. Game gets the blood flowing.
- Extreme character mobility through grapple hooks and ""movement techs""
- Good variety of characters, abilities and weapons (both melee and ranged, though the focus is a bit more on melee).
- Lots of game modes including solo, 2 or 3 person teams battle royale, death match, story, and others I haven't tried.

Cons:
- The animations are *really* fast and a bit jerky so it's hard to follow as a new player
- Steep learning curve (move techs, animation cancels, tons of knowledge about heroes / abilities / weapon movesets, etc.). As a newer player you'll find yourself combo'd, disoriented, or getting caught on terrain often. I like the challenge but this isn't for everyone.
- Heavy on microtransactions despite not being f2p (though having an up front cost reduces cheaters, which is nice)

I haven't noticed most of the complaints mentioned in these reviews. You'll see way more cheaters in the mega-popular games, and I've rarely if ever died to someone that was too laggy to hit. I honestly think some are overblowing it because they are frustrated at the difficulty.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. I think the game is worth it at the regular price point and easily worth a shot on sale."
31,Recommend <3
32,It's been a long time since I've found a game I've wanted to be good at
33,hhghg
34,GREAT ASS BATTLE ROYALE!!!!!
35,"Fantastic Game, ADVERTISE MORE."
36,"yes
"
37,games great!
38,Very fun to play. Very underrated but enjoyable.
39,Honestly This game is better than Fortnite.
40,90% bots
41,"The game is full of braindead ass bots, but when you do find an actual player, prepare to get your nutsack kicked in harder than a 50 yard field goal."
42,"veri cool, female character has big boobies"
43,Super love the game. Not your typical battle royale.
44,It's fun. that all.
45,good game
46,"Pour moi le BR le plus skill based, ce qui est une très bonne chose, même si frustrant par moments ! Tout n'est pas parfait sur l'équilibrage, mais le jeu apporte une expérience unique, et c'est rare de nos jours !"
47,ogga booga i am monki after da game play yes yes play with me now you monki
48,"I've spent some time with this game and while I can say that it's genuinely some of the most fun I've had in a melee focused game, ranked is PLAGUED with smurfs and non-ranked to a much lesser extent. 
Your rank is locked to your region so what happens is top 100s in Asian servers will go to NA and EU servers and start in Bronze V. This makes the ranked modes an absolute nightmare if you haven't spent a great deal of time sharpening your mechanical skills before even touching it. I regularly make it to the top 5 and all it takes to stop me dead is running into someone with a a name written in hanzi or kanji. Between their server lag, the hit or miss netcode and their 2000 hours in the game, I simply can't touch them. A ranked mode should never be so bad that you are running into smurfs every single game. That said, I still give the game itself a fair shake.
It has some of the best melee oriented combat I have encountered. The art style is gorgeous.
It's very unique in a an overpopulated genre. The flow of movement when mastered is a pleasure to watch and feels great to perform. It uses a paper-rock-scissors system to determine the victor when using light attacks, focus attack and ripostes that works amazingly well.

I'd recommend this game on the following conditions:
- You want a game with top notch melee combat.
- You want a a challenging experience in skill based combat.
- You like Chinese mythology themed action games.

I would not recommend if:
- You want a fair and balanced matchmaking experience.
- You are easily frustrated.
- You want to play a range focused game."
49,hhhhh
50,"I tried typing Winnie the Pooh in chat, and it said: ""Message not sent as it contains sensitive content."" I tried typing Taiwan and Hong Kong but got the same message. As for the game itself, the gameplay is fun for a few hours, but after that, it gets very repetitive. Also, the game is like 90% bots."
51,enjoy the PVP aspects of melee and spells
52," love it best battle royal so far 
Naruto vibes!!"
53, good game
54,"good gameplay good graphic
"
55,"game concept good, but its barely playable."
56,this game is amazing but have server problem or i dont know steamdb show right now have over 100k player but you have wait over 10 min to 20 min to get in match not matter is eu or asia or us
57,"it is a very good game
"
58,Good
59,"harus sat set sat set, too soon"
60,i have angry issues cuz of this game
61,Good to in 2022
62,"fun game, full of players and bot trying to find out all the complexity of controls keys, but still a good game"
63,gam
64,ok
65,is a fun game
66,"nice game with nice jiggle physic, recommended."
67,Green ping got disconnected from server> trash game
68,ass
69,An amazing game. Lots of action and great players to match up with. Great experience.
70,Fun fighting game
71,pay to win :)
72,"its very fun, if your into fighter games this is worth a go"
73,"In terms of gameplay and mechanics probably one of my favorite games, however for the lootbox system and collectibles they make it so you are required to spend more money (on top of the initial purchasing of the game) to unlock certain cosmetics as  opposed to other paid games with lootbox systems like overwatch where you could hypothetically get all the other cosmetics without spending a single penny after the initial buying of the game."
74,"i love it
"
75,Fun but bad optimization.
76,"First let me be clear that I can soloq to top 1 % in Apex legends and I'll keep playing NB no matter this review because I know I'll become better and enjoy myself but looking at grand picture:

Imagine you are silver 5, barely understanding the game and you are matched against #4 on the server with hundreds of hours in RANKED mode (1,6k mmr vs 4,7k XD).
Shooting part of the game is awful to partake in.
Zone moves too slowly, makes too little damage, match takes 32 minutes or something.
Filled with bots, acceptable within first few hours but these are present in every lobby, other chinese franchise (CB) that had 4-6k players daily matched bots only for like first 20 hours and afterwards players from every skill level got their games and enjoyed themselves, this has daily 130k and can't ? impossible. 
Steamcharts numbers are boosted by chinese just look how many play at 20 pm CET, prob has ~15k globally split into servers and then 10 game modes running at all times, insanely bad management and pretty much slaughtered by their own devs keeping it this way for EU/NA.
Remove solo modes, make it F2P or at least drop price by half to retain players otherwise I give it a year maybe 2 until tipping point."
77,good
78,The only battle-royale where u wont feel frustrated because of campers
79,Great fun
80,REMOVE CHINESE PEOPLE AND THE GAME IS GOOD
81,"Game runs like crap, so poorly optimised"
82,A work of art.
83,full of china sweats... but v fun xD
84,"Simply put, I Love the game. the mechanics are a welcomed change of pace to the typical drop, loot and shoot kind of game play you see in other battle royals. and almost all the mechanics work accordingly with the occasional hiccups, glitches and i cant really even say occasional to be honest because glitches and hiccups are rare in my experience. 

however i cant say i recommend it because the game seems to favor high ping players over low ones. players with high ping will normally faze through attacks when they should be stunned or staggered, teleport behind attacks that can visibly be seen connecting, and they Normally ignore parries that should have connected. (parries in this game are incredibly important because they are counters that not only stun the player but make them drop their weapon) this is an issue developers said they addressed in the recent patch, but they did not and in fact made it worse. 

players normally complain about this issue of favoring high ping players to no avail. its a VERY large issue and i can not recommend this game to anyone, unless its fixed because in a good number of cases it makes the game unplayable."
85,verry good
86,Horrible optimized - kinda fun still the lag spike hit
87,"I love this game, i have over 1000 hours in Apex Legends, and this game has eased my mind when it comes to gaming. Its so relaxing, and i love the game-play overall. It almost feels nostalgic, like I have been to some of the places in my dreams. alright theyve probably stopped reading this far...  Tiddies... Enough said, i hope this was enough for you to buy this game."
88,"a fun game if you're into asian culture or anime. good parkour and decent fighting with a wide arsenal of melee weapons, could be improved upon but all in all a fun experience especially when playing with friends."
89,"It's a really good game, there are aspect that make this feel unique unlike other battle royals, such as the more melee aspect, hand to hand and more of the oriental feel. 
Its super fun to play, characters and their skills are also extremely fun in their own way and no character is 'extremely busted' they, i would say are all on par with each other as they all bring something to a team/duo solo etc.
NOT pay to win which some people say, its pay only for cosmetics, which you don't have to buy if you choose not to.

I would say the only few cons with this game is their servers do need a bit of an update, it can take quite a while to get into a q more than 10mins at a time and when it gets later it can be up to 30mins (CASUAL MODE) so if you feel like you want to play you're kinda forced to play rank and some people dont like the aspect of rank.
Last con i would say is the amount of players from Asia which have no ping legit just destroy everyone in a game, leaving everyone to not even be able to play/move or legit do anything as by the time you have played a skill they have already seen it coming conquered it and smacked your ass."
90,:)
91,Gameplay good
92,NICE GAME
93,"Definitely worth the price and unlike any other BR we have right now. The monetization is unashamed and upfront, but sticks to cosmetics only. Great in-game movement, in-depth combat, multiple weapons, and fun characters. Another negative is the skill gap - very high learning curve especially when you're against a higher ranked player."
94,"[h1]I strongly recommend that you don't purchase this game and wait for it to become f2p in the future.[/h1]

The game's monetisation is exactly, almost copy paste, from that of Apex Legends but with an £18 price tag.
There are 3 currencies:
      Tae: The freemium currency that you'll use to unlock characters and low tier cosmetics which you'll eventually have in abundance
      Gold: The premium currency that you use to purchase cosmetics or lootboxes
      Silk: A crafting material where you can unlock certain cosmetics but unlike Apex where you can unlock all cosmetics at  any time there is a store rotation of a select few skins

As the game is freemium with an £18 price tag the player base is pretty low and as such you'll encounter your fair share of bots to boost up the players in the lobby. Another symptom of the low player count is that ranked is abhorrent! For example, I'm silver 5 (pretty shit) and when I queue up I'm matched with the server's #177 player just so I don't have a long wait time. These issues can be solved from an injection of players by making the game free to play.

Readability is the final point I want to touch on - as the game allows massive amount to customisation it's hard to tell characters apart from a glance and some abilities are game changers like takeda has an ability where he can auto-parry your attack, sometimes mid animation; take your weapon away and heal basically guaranteeing a won 1v1.

Overall, I would love to recommend this game however there are some glaring flaws both with monetisation and player base."
95,The game is unbalanced. One character can drop weapons = verry op.
96,Pretty fun and i enjoy being a hot anime girl
97,good
98,Very good.
99,Good
100,nice
101,"Everything is fine until ""亚洲名"" appears and you die."
102,"I started playing because I love battle royale, but I needed a new feel. This definitely provides a much different take on BR games. It has been a refreshing take, and a new addiction."
103,"Cannot recommend this game until they add a region lock for matchmaking. It's overwhelmingly frustrating competing in the leaderboards in my own city against hundreds on Chinese guys. Structured like a free title with lootcrates, premium currency, two separate earned currencies, and a battlepass. Fun game, but very poorly managed."

105,"The game overall is great very fun very addictive 

now that we got that out of the way here are the problems
-the worse your ping is the stronger you'll be 
-you'll have a fun time playing the game fighting NA players and bots until you come across a chinese player to demolish you
-you can abuse tarka with an infinit combo that makes you go 100-0 that the chinese enjoy using
-people can hack in this game without any issues aka insta parry/block/ESP/Aimlock

Now after you've passed the army of bots and the chinamen you can enjoy the game and see it as fun
"
106,"Most unique Battle Royale and this make the best one, unlike others BR 99% shooter Naraka is melee oriented gameplay (with also range style, if you are skilled enough), and also unlike other games Naraka don't look cheap (maybe is because it cost 20$, well how know?), 
What else could I say?, characters design are great, battle system is awesome, a lot of customisation in/out of the match
So what are you waiting of just buy and enjoy the game"
107,"Tried testing on HDD, never again. I cannot stress enough that when they say use SSD it's NOT an option."
108,double blade go brrr
109,"Game is to laggy, all my friends play with 10 fps (me too) and the servers are bad! from a game tht costs! i expect more! honestly worst battle royale by far. its matter of time until the game dies if they dont improve there servers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
110,this is the absolute worst running game on steam i have waited for updates just for it to run better when i load up a game and i just cant im getting beat up long before the game even actually loads dont know y i can play ANY other game no problems but this is just not playable Cyberpunk runs with no problems but this wont load for me properly???? get the fuk out hurst but im definitely uninstalling and i wont be wasting any more of my time i suggest people do the same
111,Was an ok game at first until the lobbies become filled with chinese players using vpns to get to the american servers. lagging all over the map making it so you can hit them. dont recommend

114,its like crack
115,fun
116,Wooden animation game named GOVNORAKA: SH!TPOINT
117,good
118,Good game.
119,"This is a great game IF you are willing to put a lot of time in, the combat is VERY complex and i still relatively know nothing after 15 hours so its difficult to buy this game and experience it all before refunding as it takes around 10 hours to even play in matches of mostly human (not bots) players. I whole heartedly recommend this game if you can invest enough hours in it. Also if you want to see if this game is right for you i recommend going in to the bloodbath game mode for the first 30 minutes and that should give you a good idea while still being able to refund."
120,Awesome combat system and great character customization!
121,"Too long to type, no time to comment, see you inside."
122,"The game is fun but the lag is an issue. I have a high-end PC and the fact that I have FPS drops with SLI Nvidia 2080 TI is frustrating.

On another note, I played this game for 10 hours before taking a break for a few months due to not having time. After trying to get back into the game, my account was reset. All progress was gone. Not talking about season stats but my overall stats like character level, overall playtime across my first season, etc. I spoke to Customer Support and they claim that I was only level 7 and logged in 6 times but that they see no abnormalities with my account and made sure to reassure me that they do not wipe accounts and that I probably left the game open for 10 hours. Keep in mind, I have played for 10 hours, which means at least 6 times I left the game open totaling up to 10 hours in idle time and also never played the game. I was level 1 when I logged in on Sept 3rd, 2022. I purchased the game after the official release (not beta).

I wish I would have kept the screenshots and videos I had of the gameplay but that is on me. I know I can get the levels and Tae (in-game currency) back but it is frustrating that many players have reported having this issue (including my partner) and yet the Customer Support team claims that I must have idled in the game for 10 hours, which doesn't make sense given that they show I was level 7 on August 21st, 2021 and when I logged in on September 3rd, 2022 I was level 1, which is an abnormality in itself.

You may enjoy the game if your computer can handle it and the lag isn't too bad, but keep in mind that Customer Support is less than helpful."
123,"It's good,
I'm broke so can't buy the game,
and my pc was burning when i tried to play anything other than the tutorial."
124,"Great combat system, good looking characters/skins, interesting map mechanism."
125,"Honestly wish everyone knew about this game and would give it a try. It's been such a long time since a game has made me want to get on it every day because the developers actually add new content and incentive to play. The combat mechanics are fantastic, the graphics are beautiful, the map design is incredible, the developers actually care, and they don't shove micro transactions down your throat (even though they are there). Give it a try, it's so much fun."
126,just enjoy to play this game.
127,Great game. Pretty fun and good for casual player cause every mission can do with bot :3
128,"Gameplay is fast paced and exciting, although I wish a good percentage of the cosmetics weren't locked behind a paywall. Overall, good game, but the shop system seems more like something you would see in a F2P game, not one that costs $30."
129,"FUN, NICE BOOBS"
130,"i love this game.
it makes me so bricked"
131,"game hay vl
"
132,"poggers
"
133,yuh
134,"game is great and beautiful!! fighting i feel can use a little work for seamless fights, and gold weapons are so much more stronger its a guarantee loss for u if u dnt have one. other than that the game is absolutely amazing 4 stars for me
"
135,"The game can be really fun, and I love the design and the style. But it doesn't have a latam region for the servers and the matchmaking takes way too long. Even some days I couldn't play because of the matchmaking"
136,Best damn game in years
137,"The game itself is great - recommendable.
So what, since the game developers destroy it at their own request - only fulfilling the dream of the Asian part of players. Are you entering the European server, are you having a great time? It's great, until suddenly you start to meet Asian players (you will recognize them by aflabet that you don't know - ""chinese stamps"") ... who do whatever they want with you, because they play this game much longer, have mastered mechanics, etc. It is enough to enter the TOP rankings of Europe or America to see that the whole thing is besieged by the Asian inquisition. The annoying fact is that the developer does absolutely nothing to transfer these players to their nominal server - they allow European and American players to destroy the game fun with impunity, and then they are surprised that the game in these regions is not very popular."
138,Lots of Bugs
139,nice melee pvp with smooth animation
140,Good Game
141,"IF you are tired of the same with battle royale, you should try this one, super fun."
142,Game lồn bắt tắt HVCI mới cho chơi.
143,Very nice game
144,"The game is great but please fix the bugs of the game and attract players instead of releasing battle passes. 
More than 5 minutes to find a match and it's extremely laggy"
145,Good
146,games gud
147,More cheats and hackers from Chinese players.
148,"great game, no complaints
"
149,"My friend begged me to play this game, so I played it. After few hours playtime, I realized I can master this game and slay most of the people easily, but I don't want to."
150,"Absolutely terrible state.

Game played just fine about a year ago. I was even playing it on an old pc and it ran fine.

Current state: I am playing it on a 5950X CPU and 3090 GPU.
Plenty of lag in US servers. Map won't render and so on. 
Couldn't play a single game without some sort of lag being an issue. Deleted and never installing again.
Would refund if I could."
151,Game is shit. Like a phone game that kind of shit.
152,"TLDR: Honestly the most fun I've had in a multiplayer/competitive game in a long time, even solo queueing.  

Pros:
+ Good mix of fast, reaction-based gameplay and mind games/predictions. 
+ Cool weapon designs with unique strengths, all of which are surprisingly well-balanced. 
+ Awesome Costumes/skins.
+ Characters easy to unlock.
+ Progression systems to keep you motivated outside of only competitive modes.
+ Surprisingly chill community with little to no toxicity

Cons:
- Low content creator and off-game population (at least in US) 
- Loot boxes/gacha mechanic prohibitively expensive (get the season pass)
- Heard stories of lagging Mainland Chinese players (haven't come across any yet)
- Your friends probably don't play it

Mixed:
~ Very cheap battle pass (partially pays for future passes as well), but somewhat required to get a significant amount of cool skins
~ Heavily Eastern (Chinese particularly) aesthetic (some might not be a fan)
~ (VERY) High-level gameplay requires practicing combos, movement, skill timings/interactions, etc. Very different from beginning playstyles"
153,"Pretty epic Battle Royale game, movement is smooth and combat can be very satisfying. The game has a lot to do outside of gameplay to keep you busy (claiming rewards, opening free chests, completing quests), and it has a great community that keeps the playerbase extremely high. Live operation events are creative and there is big effort put into them. There are definitely places the game can improve upon, like decreasing the pings and removing VPN users from our servers. But to be fair, damn bro, good one. Also- I think via friend referral (they call it Torchbringer) you can get a free 10-hour trial to check it out."
154,yhigyugty
155,just alt f4 if you seen an [X] on your teammates names they will probably run it down
156,Smooth movement and close-range combat system.
157,"I like it, but damn son the difficulty of the matchups is insane, which is fun 2"
158,"let me start by saying i never leave reviews. For those looking to buy or play this game. BEWARE!!!!
this game is full of VPN users from EU, CHINA players and everywhere else. this game allows cheating, this game allows for those to scum others with poor latency, this game allows for people to fight freely with most cheating possible.
what this game does, their matchmaking allows for high level players to play with low level players that knows the game so well its almost like they made the game not the DEVs. On top of that they allow high level players to scum low level players to let them win to make them happy to keep spending money on this game. 
This game has a good foundation, however in the current state of this game unless they limit the ping to maybe a playable state of PING rate. The game can be fun, however the game and the amount of crap the DEVs allow is a poor way to run a game. 
In one instance after checking a players in-game card was so miss matched in the match the moment we dropped in it took 3 minutes he had all yellow gear and weapons, this player wrecked me and 3 others in 3 minutes and then after resurrecting he was there waiting for us to spawn and continued to kill us match over. how is that ok? that is the meaning of this game cheat and cheat more all within 3 minutes. 
BEWARE buying this game its not fun when someone drops in and has a full loadout. good job DEVs with a so called RNG. Keep making high level players happy so they make you happy. BEWARE all buying this game."
159,game noob vkl
160,good game
161,"Intense combat lets goo 
"
162,"BAD OPTIMAZITION, even with 16GB RAM, Core i7-9750, an SSD driver and a GTX 1650, the game are still ridiculous unstable. What kind of game that took forever just to load a fucking map?
imagine being the one of the 2 people left in the field, and just the moment you are about to finish your oppoment, the screen suddenly become fucking froze and when it over, all you can see it your dead body and ended up at top 2."
163,love the game a few glitches though
164,"Great game, just dont lose connection or it counts as a left match and you get overall points taken away"
165,I like the idea of the game but i don't like the stun locks from the weapon combos.
166,"its a nice game but I was always matching a very high-level player so I can not play this game at my level, its very hard to me to play this game."
167,"Absolutely. Fast-paced BR that is relatively easy to get the hang of, but has quite the high skill ceiling. Fantastic setting, (especially if you are into Ancient Asian Mythology) unique weapons, and addicting gameplay. I've been somewhat addicted lately."
168,"It is an open world 3rd person fighting game battle royale. This game has addictive gameplay, challenging and high teamwork (if you have a mic). It's hard to get used to but super fun if you get the hang of it."
169,"+10 social credit (fully customizable hot waifu/husbando parkouring against other fully customizable hot waifu/husbando or shrek/monkey).
-1 +5 social credit (gacha/cash shop/more gacha, but worth idc)
+10 (social credit) orgasmic scene/graphic

171,"A wellmade game with exilirating gameplay, however I can not recomend this game.

The server placement in europe leaves alot to be desired. Instead of placing the servers somewhere centeral in europe(Like most other developers) they are placed in england causing high ping for many european countries.

I live in sweden with a high-speed fiber connection and the game quite often becomes borderline unplayable and sometimes the map not loading properly."
172,"Cool concept and the one fight i got into on the game was pretty neat. However i saw 4 other people on my team and 2 on the opposite the entire fight. Either needs more players or better match making or much smaller maps for small teams.

However still a cool game just not my cup o tea"

182,"It's a good game, very hard for new players, there is a gigantic skill gap between players differing 20ish points in ranked + it's full of bugs..."
183,"I absolutely fell in love with this game. The combat is sooooo deep and satisifying. A buddy of mine hassled me to play it for so long he finally bought it for me and I regret not jumping in sooner. The character customization is also suprisingly deep, even deeper than a pro wrestling video game. More than just a battle royale, it has so many fun modes. HIGH SKILL CEILING AND STEEP LEARNING CURVE, but worth the effort and fun to learn. Expect to die... a lot honestly, but once you start destroying enemies you'll not want to stop."
184,solid game player base seems to be declining a bit que times are getting longer every day
185,Only downside is the foreign players using VPN to play otherwise game is a lot of fun skill based when lag isn't interfering the whole time and enjoyable
186,good hack n slash pubg style game.
187,"One of the most unique battle royale games, but still it is not something that can touch a lot of people. 

With that being said let's do some little review. The game itself is great. You can choose from various heroes who all have some speacial abilities, which you can use in fight to kill someone or help your team (if you feel like playing in teams) to get out of the bad situation. The game itself has a nice graphic and even you find a little of a story of the characters, what builds a attachment to the game a little. 

The main problem this game faces is when people from Asia join the European server (and vice versa) because, even though this game is highly skill based, those people can ruin even the most skilled player. How? Well those people has higher pings so it often happen you just cannot hit them, even when you see direct hit. This is something what is killing the game. Another thing that is killing the game is the setup. Like let's be serious, the most of the people of the west world (EU, USA....) will more likely play regular BR because the asian type of environment is not for everyone. Even I would play rather BR with medieval knights than samurais, even though I like the idea of it. 

Take whatever you want from this review. It is my humble opinion taken from 100h of playing the game and all its game modes."

196,I just love this game.
197,NICE GAME
198,"Nice game, good game <3<3<3"
199,"Such a good game, even for the people who aren't diehard fans of battle royales, its quite complex, the 1st anniversary rewards were amazing and the devs are commited to adding new maps, weapons, characters, cosmetics, modes and the game on another platforms(ps5). It also has a lot of events and crossovers and the competitive scene is pretty enjoyable to watch. I have almost 100 hours on multiple platforms. I dont recommend it to people who doesnt want to improve at the game or only wants to have fun in the games they play because it is pretty competitive."
200,good game

202,Breath of fresh air from FPS BRs.

225,"- Purchased and installed
- Played 5 hours
- and then deleted because of the many updates

Too hard start and then got bored with it"
226,"There's a few things that really irk me about playing this game.
But first, the positives.
-combat is fun, using horiz/vert attacks and parrying is exciting!
-the variety of weapons and the different play styles they support!
-movement feels good and fairly fluid
-the inventory and weapon grading systems are simple enough that you shouldn't scratch your head in combat seeing something unfamiliar
-the maps and character designs are all gorgeous! Even wandering the 'empty wilderness' between POI's the world looks lush and pretty!
-character customization on a character-based system is a fantastic addition, and I crave it in more games!
-there's a pretty song they paid someone famous (I guess?) to preform that plays at the main menu now!

But, as good as the points above are, I struggle to enjoy them due to the following cons:
-animations for some attacks linger longer than you think, so at the start you will frequently cuck yourself 'parrying' when you try to combo from horiz>vert or vise-versa
-RNG is your deciding factor for a loadout, so sometimes you just get dogshit gear and wasted your run.
-Walls really goof movement for players and AI, some ledges look like you should be able to pull yourself up smoothly but you end up stuck in a corner, BAD for running to safety from the 'Storm'
-The Mobile Game Experience, including Full Screen Banners at launch AND close, Every day. They don't change nearly often enough to pop-up once a week.
-opens a free trial for a game with loot boxes but doesn't let Free Trial players open loot boxes
-limits camera range of motion for a 3rd Person game based on the limits of a '''realistic human neck''' so looking UP is a pain, like Genshin
-Loot boxes, and all the gambling risks associated.
-As nice as the song they paid someone to sing is, it's very repetitive on its own and there's no other menu song right now. 
-when starting an account, every server had ping above 280, so I chose the lowest server [SEA], now when I play in [NA] ping is under 100, I get scolded for not being on [SEA] ('function is only available on server account was created') when [SEA] still has high ping
-playing Duos Bot matches there's Terrible lag even though conceptually there should be FAR less lag when the server is only managing connection for two players, despite this I have had games where my partners connection (presumably as host) had me skipping 30/45 frames per second until they disconnected.

There's really a lot of potential for a Superb game here, but I feel that it's been drowned in 'This practice is found to increase odds of player spending money by 13.8% so we're putting it in too'.

Don't buy as is."

Deluxe only come with lootbox that will mostly give you blue rarity cosmetics, and 1 spear skin assuming you even going to find spear while in game."
238,"good battle royal but with swords, very fast paced"
239,"the game is surprisingly fun as it takes combat from fighting games, not every detail but certain aspects (such as Yakuza and sleeping dogs etc). Traversing in this game like any other br except the difference is that you can climb up rock faces, hang from ledges, grapple hooks -nothing else needs to be said- and being able to grab onto ceilings, I haven't tried for everything but i accidentally did it when i was inside a sand cave. 
Now, the things that i don't like are purely because i live in Australia and having to play in either Asian or North American servers makes combat a bit annoying when you can't parry attacks, besides that the game is a solid 8.7/10 for me"
240,"Plays well, pay only for cosmetics, and the skill gap is based on players and not the items. No pay to win, makes me think of Sea of Thieves in a sense of buy only cosmetics, and skill is based on play-style mixed with battle royale."

253,"The game searching is too long beacuse this game is getting alive at the evenings on EU server. So, at the evenings you have to wait for 1-3 min but at morning or afternoon you have to wait for 10 min and more. I don't play at CH server ( and I guess you know why :) ), so please developers you should attract attention of many EU players."
254,"El juego esta genial , jugabilidad graficos y de mas , he entrenado mucho mis habilidades durante estos dias para pelear y para correr de los chinos. (si ves un chino corre de ahi)"
255,Good
256,"The game is quite fun.
But if you don't install the game on SSD, it is unplayable. Quite poorly optimized on the HDD.
I mean the game just had it's anniversary but still in this state, that's not quite alright.
I think it's even worse than PUBG's early days."
257,"Graphically the game looks really good, optimisation for it isn't the best tho, also no OCE servers and bad ping can make the countering system a mess for someone with 100+ ping.

Combat is peak, with plenty of variety in game modes, and the characters and customisation is lit 

the reviews about hackers or people switching between servers to get a higher ping to benefit their gameplay and ruin the game is something i haven't encountered once through my play through. 

If the game is working properly with no stutters and ping issues, its a very good game 

"
258,good combat system
259,good :))

261,"Really agressive business model. I buy the game for 20 euro and the first thing I see when I log in is if I want to spend more money on skins. No wonder this game is close to being dead, over a year later and it has literally two maps. Sad I've spent money on it, it's not normal to have a business model like this in a B2P game, wtf."
262,"It's an A+ game with problems. Bringing it to an A- or maybe a B+ at the worst of times in my view. 

Upsides
.Great graphics
.Great game play
.Extremely high skill ceiling with options for casual or competitive play. 
.A great mix of game modes. 
.A lot of free cosmetic earning potential
.Great character customization and cosmetic animations
.Uniquely includes full face customization on all characters except 1 all for free. (think dark souls face creator.)
.No paywall blocked off in game benefits.
.Very limited ranged weapons (This may be a bad side for some, but for me it's benefit. I enjoy the engaging melee fights much more). 

Downsides: 
.Server problems (players with high ping can get away with more than would normally be possible. This is the NUMBER 1 DOWNSIDE OF THE GAME)
.Loot boxes (this personally doesn't bother me as they're easily earned and don't gate any benefits in game. They also seem more fair than others, but perhaps that's just personal luck. However, for a paid game loot boxes are a little scummy). 
.Battle pass? (this could be considered bad, but it could also be seen as free stuff even if you don't buy the paid part. It's up to you. If you do buy it and complete it, you can afford the next variant of the paid version for free. Theoretically, you could do this infinitely if you have the time and finish it). 

Conclusion: If your looking for a fun BR type game but FPS's have never appealed to you, this is a great alternative. As a person who's never been great at games like APEX or CSGO, this is a game that scratches that fun BR itch with a fun innovative and relatively new melee system. From me, it's an easy recommend! It's great and fun."
263,"gun battle royal, different than all of the shooters, real assasins creed meets crouching tiger, hidden dragon vibes. the specials of each character add to the gameplay, and the world is pretty cool."
264,"quick review: a lot of players are using auto parry and you fckers don't need to hide it. Let's face it, a lot of chinese players that uses 3rd party program should be banned for having no talent on playing this game."
265,W
266,hay
267,Ching to the Chang to the Chong!
268,"overall great game with a few problems

pros
-combat is fun and challenging 
-graphics are good and settings are plentiful 
-character design is great
-ability variety is high
-map size and design is really nice
-can play solo, duo, trio i like being able to play by myself or when my friend hops on

cons
-**(biggest issue)*** server lag is pretty awful worst than any other battle royale i've ever played, teleporting back or having hits/parrys not register is a problem for me and the youtubers i've watched.
-the gacha is pretty bad in my experience. I've not bought any chest but you get some playing and after 72 hours i've not got one legendary skin from any of the chest. 
-there's some infinite combos in the game and it's not often but when it happens to you it is lame
-ques can be very bad like 20 minutes bad, steam charts show a pretty decent player count but with how long it takes to get into games it feels like the games dead.
-not a lot of active youtubers or updated guides and the in game tutorial is mostly worthless.


overall it's a great game concept with a lot of down sides to it. I feel the game had potential to be bigger but with the inconsistent servers, long ques, questionable balance, it'll maintain it's semi playable state."
269,This is a mobile game put on PC for some reason.
270,Entertaining. No complaints!
271,finally a melee battle royale! Interesting combat and engaging and fun characters to play.
272,too good lmaoo naa its scary but you got it
273,"very fun fights and overall skill-expressive gameplay. i've been beaten by chinese player but on europe server it's not as common as on others. a lot of bots in multiplayer matches i feel, or just lots of level 1 and 2 in level 15 lobbies? enjoying the game, visuals, voice and fights, and i get the rush to come back. a game im definitely spending a few hundred hours on in the current version, even if it requires tweaks. And if it gets updates? oh man, going alongside apex"
274,"Been playing for a while now. Brilliant combat, lovely concepts, and good gameplay all around. However the big down side aside from the price-tag is the exponential wait times. I have been searching for over 2 hours without a single game during that time. Tried to contact anybody from support or for help and to no avail. It is just put on hold. If you want to play it, be ready for extreme waiting times; sometimes not even being able to play the game at all !"

278,"A very nice game, i play from 2 nd season when i hired about him, seens then i play every day!"
279,"To start, this game is like PUBG except with martial arts/ninja stuff. If you don't like PUBG then you may not like this game. As per the game itself, there is server lag. As, it doesn't seem they have got that fixed totally yet. Loading times are horrible but once in game, it starts to become more stable, just have to give it a few minutes to fully load. Graphics wise, its good looking and the environment looks well done. If you max out your graphics then it'll probably look even better but, as for me I have mine set to medium or low to help with the loading times. Gameplay, it's not bad. Though you can't adjust your FOV or field of view. And if you can, well then I have yet to figure out how. The combat is semi fluid, some hiccups here and there but nothing that'll break the overall mechanic of the gamplay. You can play this with mouse and keyboard but I prefer gamepad/controller just because it is easier. Though the shooting will probably be easier, of course, with the mouse and keyboard. Cosmetics, as per always with these type of games, their are a lot of options, though its a pay to look good thing. Not my style, I rather just earn them thru in-game currency and not pay for them with actual money. But that's on you if you want to spend the money. 
Overall, I would recommend getting this game. Though get it when its on sale or when the price drops. As, the price of it now seems like a lot to spending on such a game. Maybe if it got polished up some more then yeah but for now, wait until it drops a little in price to pick up and see if you like it."
280,very cool
281,"i love the wushu/wuxia genre and this game really does it justice. Especially in the combat system. The rock paper scissors combat style is very reminiscent of age of wushu. Which was a very popular mmo in the early 2010s that had a very similar form of combat. So for me the game was super easy to understand and pick up. Although, I wish it had some sort of arena/ tournament style mode where it wasnt just a Battle Royal all the time (there might be but im only 6 hours in)"

290,"Battle Royale type game. For once, does NOT focus on RANGE. It has range, but is much more situational and not relied on as others. 
Still classic game type, but focus on melee, abilities, and parries. Multiple Game Modes and leveling systems for individual characters, as well as overall level and other unlockables. 
Not pay to win either. Players are on even ground. Pay stuff is cosmetic in nature."

305,"[h1]Naraka Bladepoint - My new infatuation and all time favorite Battle Royale.[/h1]

I'd like to start out by stating that I've started playing Naraka in Season 4, which ended a few weeks prior to me writing this review. I am also in no way a great player, I climbed up to Gold rank in Solos, and I'm overall not very competitive. The game might be showing a little more cracks in mechanics among the very skilled players, but those are too far above me for me to really notice.

[b]Graphics and Optimization[/b]
The game looks stunning, no better way to put it. Especially if your PC is powerful enough to run smoothly on the highest settings. From the terrain and environments to weapons and characters, everything looks crisp and pristine. The tougher question is with optimization. If you do not have an SSD to install the game to, you will most likely NOT BE ABLE to run this. Naraka is a tough piece to run, so be prepared for that if your PC isn't among the powerful ones.

[b]Gameplay and Mechanics[/b]
Naraka is a Battle Royale game first, so all the classics from this genre are present. Closing circles, looting for weapons, healing items, perks and equipment, it's all here, and needs no introduction. The largest catch is that Naraka is primarily focused on melee combat. Yes, ranged weapons are an option, and can be quite devastating if used correctly, vast majority of fights get resolved face to face, in a good ol' brawl. This changes the fluidity of the genre just enough to remove a large portion of stress from getting sniped while running across an open field, as anyone looking to take you down has to get in close. Another thing to mention is traversal. With the use of grappling hooks and seemless parkour, moving across mountains and rooftops was never easier.

[b]Content and Accessibility[/b]
I'm pleased to say that Naraka is overflowing with content. Multiple modes, with the classic competitive ranked Battle Royale leading the charge, casual modes like Bloodbath (Deathmatch), and the new absolutely awesome PvE mode - Showdown. Naraka has something for everyone, which is also the reason why I became so easily hooked. If you're like me, and you don't like playing overly competitive games, have no fear, doesn't matter if you want to play a simple Deathmatch, a PvE pseudo story driven mode, or even against Bots to just chill and not try too hard, Naraka will always reward you with  EXP, and allow you to complete daily quests no matter which mode you play. This makes the game easily accessible to both Hardcore and Casual players.

Another huge boost to the volume of content are events. Naraka constantly comes out with new events that give you something to do ingame, and earn cosmetic rewards for your characters. As soon as one ends, another one begins, nothing out stays it's welcome, everything stays fresh and new. At the time of writing this review, we received a whole new beautiful map, a new Hero to play as, and a vast amount of skins and customization options. If the developer keeps up this pace, I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon.

[b]Customization and Monetization[/b]
Now, Naraka is not a Free to Play game, as we all see on the Steam Store page. Although, as is usual in these games, it does contain microtransactions, which might be a Red Flag to some. There is a Battle Pass each season with free and payed rewards, and there are Loot Boxes. There are two types of things you can purchase. EXP boosts to help you level up your account and Battle Pass quicker, or Cosmetic items. Nothing that would give you an advantage in game, which is appreciated. Also, a large amount of cosmetics can be purchased directly, so you at least know what you're paying for, which is still better then dropping money into RNG loot boxes, hoping you get the outfit you really want. For me, the monetization is not a big deal, I don't see issues with this, as long as it stays like this.

As for the quality of these cosmetics, and customization options for your Heroes, I  have never seen it better in ANY Battle Royale game. You can either use one of the default faces, or create your own using the classic sliders we see in modern MMOs. The amount of creations I've seen fighting against me range from absolutely stunningly beautiful, to... Handsome Squidward? Outfits are also high effort and beautiful, so hold on to your wallets, they will try their best to convince you to dress up your favourite heroes for a couple of bucks more.

[b]Did anyone even read this far? Just buy the damned game, it's a great god damned game, and it deserves it's time in the spotlight.[/b]"

308,"this game just has so many issues. I played for 1 hour with 2 other friends and we all returned it. All of us were experiencing horrible screen tearing, lag and glitches. Not worth."
309,nice game
310,great concept but all you need is a greatsword to win and a certain character and game over. really needs a rework
311,"It's like Blade and Soul's quick flashy pace met up with Soul Calibur's weaponry fight-styles and decided to do the horizontal monster mash with Apex Legend's battle royal formula. Graphics are gorgeous, the pace can be chaotic when random people show up to interfere with your fights, anything you buy leads to cosmetics so it's not pay-to-win. Solid 8/10 game overall."

317,"China playing against US?....Fun game....Great game, actually. 

2 Biggest problems with this game.

1) You can be grapple hook spammed/2-3 people jump on you and you're getting spammed to death.

2) If you are going against China, GL. The only way you'll beat them is by catching them at the very end in a 6v3."
318,very fasy paced alotta fun
319,"Best game to link up with Chinese people in pub matches.
It's great to see their economy boom so much they had to make their way into NA servers."

322,I would recommend it if u like apex and lost ark pvp.
323,Lowkey fun asf
324,It's alright. not worth 20 tho
325,"great game best twist on battle royale I've played so far. Combat takes some getting used to and i recommend watching a few guides.

F.Y.I - This is the first game that I've played that i feel deserves a review
"
326,big booba me likey
327,"For all the complaints of Chinese players, I don't find I encounter them enough to care. According to the discord, you mostly run into them around the earlier ranks and then they fade out. You can still deal with them. If you get mad enough, you can just join their servers and do the same to their region."
328,"Most of my Playtime is in Queue trying to find games. Naraka Bladepoint? No, Waiting to Find a Game Simulator, yes."
329,ONE OF THE FEW BATTLE ROYAL GAMES I ENJOY. THE COMBAT HAS A LOT OF DEPTH AND VERY FUN ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT

337,the game have potential if the server issue solve.
338,"YES, this is such a fun game. they have fun modes. different play styles. MELEE AND RANGED. trio.duo,single. good training type. the blodbath is great to hop in and try everything out. i have not been playing long but i plan to keep playing a bunch. once you get the hang of this one it is sooooooo much fun. get it if you like these style of games."
339,just do it.
340,The most awaited game for melee lovers
341,"Pretty fun game. Battle Royale is usually not my thing, but the combat in this is top tier. Has the complexity of a fighting game with the weapons/heroes to learn, so you will be getting killed by more experienced players once you stop playing with bots. All the weapons and heroes feel very unique and have a lot of depth. Excellent and addicting movement system to master as well.

Definitely the type of game you gain a lot of benefit from hopping into training mode or a casual death match just to practice certain things. Once you start playing with real players you will be frustrated and consistently bodied if you're just spam clicking.

If you like complex combat systems with high skill ceilings and team or solo PvP, it's an easy buy. Has all the standard microtransaction stuff a game like this would have, a battle pass and cosmetics only (absolutely nothing gives you any type of competitive edge its only skins, all characters can be unlocked by playing) - haven't felt the need or like I need to spend $ on anything. Game throws a lot of stuff at you."

350,"Scummy decisions by devs. Can't claim rewards until you reach over 2 hours in the game (Threshold for a refund on steam). Can't play Solos until you reach ""level 10"" for some fucking reason. I paid for the fucking game you should let me play it. Game runs like complete elephant prolapsed asshole unless you put it on a SSD"

"
359,"WIth the new introduction of crossplay, there's a healthy playerbase for new players to play against, highly recommend. Important note here is that there is a LOT of depth to the combat system that new players might not even realize exists, so I highly suggest digging around for resources via Discord or other communities.

UPDATE: I just hit the top 500 in NA Solo Queue and my point still stands, the game still feels fresh, there's new tech to discover every day and have fun with, and combat at the highest level still remains rewarding, sure, there will be a Chinese player once every 15 games with bad ping, but good game sense and mechanics usually means that you're the one with the advantage, not them. 

As a recommendation, rely on using tap dodge more than parry as a defensive mechanic against most players unless you're almost CERTAIN that they're going to throw it out, since it is still inconsistent and ping-based. Parries also are more of an anticipation mechanic rather than a reactive mechanic, for most of the weapons you can't just parry on reaction to the blue flash (except vs greatsword, and to a degree longsword), simply because of how the system is designed + netcode."

371,"A fairly unique entry to the BR genre, having melee-focused combat with Eastern mythical/magical themes. 

+ Gameplay is smooth, the different weapons are varied fun to use, and movement is fluid and satisfying.
+ Graphics are excellent, love both the artstyle and in-game models. 

- Costumes are pricey to obtain, especially since you have to buy into the game to begin with, but this is made better by events and becomes a non-issue if you play enough to complete the battlepass (which refunds itself and gives incredible sets of costumes, weapons and accessories every season). 

Overall strongly recommend, worth the money even at regular price - and you could always try it out during a free weekend! Please do!"
372,"lvl 43 on Xbox as of review. Came to post here because this seems to be the place with the most traction on the issue. Chinese players taking over NA is a major problem. Was loving the game for the first half of playtime until I began to get killed by high ping bs every single match due to region hop abuse. Game is very enjoyable and well made but I would advise any new players to avoid getting into it because the fun basically stops after lvl 20 - 30. Seems likely devs will not fix any of these issues, especially seeing their target demographic is China since that is where they are based. Was motivated to get into high level mechanics and tech but I think my time with this game is mostly at its end now."
373,Game is dead in the US. Matches filled with bots that teleport.
374,So far I've enjoyed the little time I have played on this game it has a lot of unique features and I like that there are other ways to get loot for cosmetics and in-game currency rather than becoming a complete money hungry game for skins and cosmetics (kinda can come off that way at first) but there is a lot of ways to get free stuff if you care about any of the cosmetics ;) The game play is good I think the movement is a little bit difficult in some ways like when you try to climb up buildings or when your just trying to run and it dashes but it's tolerable the combat doesn't require much skill but that's most hack n slash games the abilities are interesting and add some flavor to the game not only do the details and effects with them look cool but they are actually useful depending on your hero. Overall this game is pretty good hope to see more updates fixing the movement and some other aspects i'm sure that i'm not aware of yet but will see soon. 7/10 game.
375,好游戏但很难玩

382,game sucks i crashes on launch dont buy it
383," it is honestly fun,  a bit vain but looks good both graphics and aesthetic. Melee fighting system is decent but no where near as deep and as satisfying as For Honor. However you do have both gun fighting or ranged fighting along side melee fighting, as well as acrobatic maneuvers."
384,fun game
385,"I'd play this game over Apex or other BR fps games, more slashy less shooty I like when from 2 mouse buttons you can make a very diverse fighting mechanic recommend for RPG lovers, BR enjoyers and casual players"
386,Awesome!!!!!
387,"Great epic game ! Battle royale is not my cup of tea, but this one gave me a lot of fun."
388,ok

matching takes more than 20 mins  midnight.
NET Ease you Need to transfer the players into CN server to let them match with the majority.
Or the game is dead outside CN region"
390,"Region lock is very needed in this game. The game is fun and addictive. Combat is awesome. But after you start fighting someone that is lagging and your counters don't work, yeaaaaa no.

Edit: Discovered that Tarka Ji also has an infite combo build that one shots people and they haven't patched it out. People with purple armor getting one shotted just takes away the fun in a game."
391,funny monkey grapple
392,This game is pretty neat
393,"Review from someone who loves pvp games:
This game is awesome, It's a fast paced combat game with all sorts of weapons. I wish this game had more RPG stuff, but it's really good nonetheless.
Skill is also rewarded, meaning that it's not a P2W game."
394,GAME IS SO GOOD BUT 1 BAD NEWS SO LAGG SERVERS I RELLLY LIKE THAT GAME
395,"good game ,but on every match you will face an asian enemy that will kill you instantly because of ping diff."
396,"Fast fluid combat, high mobility, melee combat with a dodge and counter. Feels like Archblade combat mixed with blade and souls mobility. I'm surprised I have never looked into it until now"
397,great
398,"A really fun and unique battle royal with a wuxia setting with a wide variety of weapons, characters and abilities as well as a really good talent system. Whilst id highly recommend this game to anyone be aware it does feature quite a predatory system of micro transactions. There's a battle pass, loot boxes and paid skins however there are no pay to win elements, everything in the store is cosmetic."

403,"fun fighting :)
"
404,hay
405,"This game is absolutely amazing.
Even with distant servers in SEA and no dedicated OCE server (pls?) ive had between 110-35 ping and its fine.
The game does recommend you install it on an SSD and the performance is night and day, the warning is there for a reason; follow its advice!

Weapon diversity is fantastic, balance of ranged/melee and the ability to augment your character both before and during the game with Glyphs (pre-game) and Jadesoul (in-game) to help you play the way you want is perfection.

Character choice is really nice as well with team oriented ones (healers) still able to put up a fight because the core gameplay is the melee/ranged engagements instead of being purely ability reliant. Tianhi is my favorite transforming into this giant demon thing but its not invincible, slow and distance dependant grabs justifies the large damage output when successful (he himself is quite fast for a big demon when moving though)

I sincerely hope this game finds success. They might have just caught lightning in a bottle!"
406,垃圾游戏，谁买谁心堵
407,the game is so cool
408,"To be totally honest, this is the first game that I've been willing to buy from Steam. The game's graphics and sound are two crucial components that emulate a blockbuster movie theater experience. Unlike other Battle Royale video games, Naraka is unique. It doesn't concentrate on the outcome of the conflict; instead, it concentrates on the player's skill and the experience of direct fighting with other players. This game is amazing. Hopefully, the game will get better in the future."
409,"Unplayable.

Constant lags, freezes and crashes ruin pretty much all experience.

Main menu song might be amazing."
410,It's all fun and games till you see the Chinese letters come and strike you down.
411,sdgg
412,"For all the Australian players out there

This is really not playable the server closest to us is SEA Server and your stuck at around 153ms which is what the game says. Its alot higher i haven't been able to play this game without sever glitches and constantly being booted out of the server due to the internet connection not being fast enough.

Too give you an idea on what im using
137mbs download speed
56mbs upload speed
using ethernet direct not wifi

PC Is 
AMD 5950x
Radeon 6800xt graphics

so not hardware related definitely the game server 

game itself i actually liked just a shame the servers let us all down here in Australia"
413,Haha! I won!
414,yes
415,"This game has a lot to offer for players who are just joining the BR genre or are veterans with countless hours in BR games. However, understand that this game has a lot of things you won't be used to. Here is a list of things I found that were good from a beginners standpoint and some things that might stop you from playing for more than 2 hours.

The Good
1: Visuals are amazing
2: No connectivity or lag issues yet (recommended to have good internet).
3: Many playable characters each with their own abilities.
4: A very engaging and new style of BR (mostly melee and some gun combat + some unique movement options).
5: Optimized perfectly (from my experience).
6: Lots of cosmetic options (although some newer items/characters have fewer)
(Of course there are more things that I either forgot to add or haven't played enough to tell you about).

The Bad
1: The learning curve is quite steep due to the amount of complexity involved (it will take some time to get comfortable with the game mechanics).
2: Not a game for those who just want to drop into a multiplayer match and play the game since there is a lot to learn; you will be punished for being oblivious and will not enjoy the experience (luckily, there are 2 tutorials in the game including a bots training mode and casual mode).
3: Reading, yes you heard that right, if you don't like to read walls of text describing or teaching you about different abilities or weapon attacks/combos you will not enjoy this game at first. However, as you get used to this game this will become a non-issue. Oh and you might gain a few more brain cells which is nice.
(I actually spent more time reading in this game than playing it during my 5 hour duration).

The Ugly
1: This game is super fast paced, you will die fast if you aren't careful and movement is hard to learn so good luck running away, if you are OK with fast paced game-play then ignore this.

Overall for beginners I would say this game is worth it just to try it out. Although, you kinda have to commit to buying it because you won't really have a good idea of what this game is offering in just 2 hours of game-play unless you jump into a casuals match.
Game ranking: 9/10 (my opinion) because this game had no technical issues and the grind to learn the game mechanics has thus far felt rewarding enough to keep me playing. Let me know what you think."
416,chinese people ruin everything
417,Top tier if you love crazy battling
418,Game hard af but fun
419,"Game play is really smooth. The fighting is exceptionally fluid, and the skill ceiling is really high, which i think gives a lot of room to grow. It is like Apex Legends, but martial arts and a bit of magic focused, which i personally enjoy. 
Movement is multi-dimensional with wall climbing running, grappling hooks and sword dashes.. 
And if you've ever read or watched King's avatar.. this really feels like their tournament mode, without the MMO impact. 
I've been crushed pretty quickly here and there, had some great fights (at my amateur level) but still thoroughly enjoyable. Go watch a few Naraka Tips videos, to help make the game much more enjoyable, like most battle royales not much hand holding. 
I play in SEA. If anyone needs a code during Username Creation: ch3xfpnj6e"
420,Game is not installed on ssd also known as i have an ssd but its installed on hdd most games handle this just fine but Naraka goes brrrrr you dont have this installed on your shit sad drive we cant let you play until you wait for 5 minutes to load into the match and be at a severe disadvantage even on the lowest of low settings.
421,not the worst honestly
422,"Great game, so far A+++"
423,pretty fun
424,Pretty fun. More melee focused than other BRs which I like a lot.
425,Absolutely enjoyable
426,Combat feels balanced. Match making feels correct. Too many rewards but whatever. World is pretty and there is currently 2 maps.
427,fun
428,this game makes me want to rip my skin off starting from my eyelids
429,something fresh loved it whiles i had it
430,"Awesome game mechanically winning multiple times, feel bad for all the other newbies I wrecked :o"
431,"This game is really fun. It is like a battle royale with Black Desert Online graphics and Genshin Impact gameplay. The game is combo and input heavy if you want to get good, but they aren't that hard to learn the introductory stuff. So far 9/10."

439,"Liked the old world theme, characters, powers, skills and the attention to detail with the movements, costumes and weapons.

Disliked the lack of DX 12 support to take advantage of DLSS.

Overall, the game shows much potential in future updates as this review was solely based on the free-to-play period."

442,:D
443,皮肤好贵🥺
444,nice
445,"good combat, amazing movement and challenging learning curve"
446,asda
447,"TLDR: I give the game 10/10. Its has amazing in depth combat with an easy to pick up hard to master design, with very well balanced weapons and characters. For the price point I don't think there is a game i would suggest trying more. (slightly biast because i love melee combat games)

here are a few pros and cons to the game

Pros:

1. It's main game-mode is a battle royale, but if you are not into battle royales this one has a few things to offer you. It has other game-modes so you are not stuck playing a BR 24/7
2. This game doesn't suffer from many of the same issues most BRs do. There is no danger of randomly dying to a sniper after 15 minutes of running around, And combat is typically a bit longer w/ more interactions throughout the match.
3. every interaction is meaningful and fun.
4. looting, while it gives you an advantage, is not the determiner of the winner of a fight.
5. The combat system is ""easy to pick up hard to master"" making the sense of progression feel great as you start clapping other players cheeks with a good timed parry or dodge, or a perfectly performed combo.
6. There are no 0-death combos, which is a problem a lot of melee combat games suffer from, naraka does not which in my opinion is awesome. 
7. There are a lot of playstyles, none too much better than the other, you can choose the style that fits you best, and take it to the top. 
8. There is always room for improvement, so you could play for 1000s of hours easily. 
9. There is a very large player base, and the company that owns the game is very capable of supporting the player base and growing it when they need to. 95,000 online and active players at the time of posting this. The player base at the current moment is almost exactly as it was when it was released. So the chance of the game dying any time soon is very minimal. 
10. The god-dam character customization is awesome. You can literally upload a picture of yourself, and it makes your face in-game. Like WTF! Thats badass. Also if thats not your thing you can customize almost every aspect of the face down to the width of the base of the tip of your nose. It's a bit ridiculous, but awesome. 
11. where a lot of games monetize through cosmetics, so does naraka, but they allow you to earn a large portion of cosmetics through gameplay as well. So no need to drop 50 bucks just to look cool.


Now for some Cons:

1. It is a BR at heart, so playing in the BR game-modes is pushed if you want to level faster or get unlocks. Which for many might not be a problem, but as someone who deosn't typically like the BR format I thought it was worth mentioning.
2. while they have an AMAZING PVE game-mode, It is timelocked so it can feel a bit frustrating when you feel like playing it. 
3. The netcode in a majority of cases is beyond good enough, but against certain players you might get hit due to messed up parry timings, or attacks seemingly hitting before they should. For melee fighters netcode has always been more difficult especially if you put it in a BR format. 
4. If you go to play online your first handful of matches will typically be majority if not all bots. I'm not sure what the point of this is, but it might start you off with unrealistic ideas of how the game plays out.
5. While a lot of the time you'll find yourself in quite a few interactions throughout a match, It is a BR so you might find yourself searching for players time to time. 
6. Probably the biggest negative in my opinion is the queue times. Sometimes queues can last up to 5 min. While not incredibly common can definitely be a bit annoying."
448,"game bagus, walopun tidak terlalu lama main grafik dan animasi sangat bagus, mudah'an gk jadi game pay to win ajj"
449,"stutter and map rendering issues
ping issues 
easy refund
fix the game"
450,Fluid action combat and movement great characters and run concept. Not the best optimization so performance may be an issue for some setups but works great for me. Has a battlepass and cosmetics but in game purchases are completely optional and do not stop/slow progression as it's skill based rather than what lvl your character is. There are plenty of things to unlock though either through challenges or in game earnt currency.
451,Good
452,"naraka its a videogame that doesnt matter if you have a good internet or you are in the correct server (closer server with less ping) the game still has huge problems with lag the netcode is horrible, in fact it is not the only problem the game has, horrible antialiasing sistem it looks really blurry or pixeled in high graphics so you need to use the dlss that some how in this game looks way better
and somehow a videogame with crossplay with 40k active players in steam the queues are like 5 minutes in ranked and the quick matches doesnt work and for the 3 matches i played, i suspect the game is filled with bots like 60% of the players were really bad and some of them you can tell are humans and actually competent its really weird in a battleroyal for pc that you can win 3 games in a row easily like with 0 expierence, my teammates wasent bots but im sure some of the enemis were bots
and the last thing... 
the game asks you to disable hvci_kmci to run the game and it is a protection from windows defender just to be abble to play the game.
veredict ching chong 100"
453,"if you just want the base game and nothing else i would say it's worth it on sale and full price. i recommend this game with its dlc when its on sale (the dlc really isnt necessary its only if you like getting a few items in game).

GAMEPLAY:
there is issues with de-sync and you can tell when you are fighting someone with high ping or you can see your high ping teammates do well because of their ping but it isnt as big of a problem as people have made it seem in reviews, at least for me. the combat feels good and rewarding, for the most part. 

it should be mentioned its very unbalanced in moments where its a 1 vs 3, even 1 vs 2 can feel unbalanced if you are getting grouped. that being said thats a given, 1 player shouldn't be defeating 3 people. stun locking is the key problem in this 1 vs 3 scenario.

there are abilities and ultimates in this game that can change the outcome of fights heavily. ranging from support to damage, there is about 12 characters each having a unique ultimate and ability. from what ive experienced ultimates seem mostly balanced. some specific instances can make them feel unfair but thats a given, they are meant to be unfair sometimes.

half of the characters are locked behind a ""pay wall"", which you can unlock with in-game earned currency (tae). it costs 12k to unlock a character, when you are new getting that much tae isnt hard so unlocking is pretty fast.

CUSTOMISATION/COSMETICS:
like any game nowadays there is plenty of in-game transactions at a pretty standard price, with a loot crate system comparable to apex.

the cosmetics are great, the designs are cute (what i'd expect from such a game). theres a range of characters to pick from, male or female as well as the ability to customise your character completely, making the character feel more unique to you. 

they, of course, have a battlepass at a standard price. 1360 gold which you get back if you complete the full pass with pretty good cosmetics and as of right now it doesn't feel too tedious to level up.

QUEUE:
queue times have been very hit and miss, when there was 150k people actively playing on steam alone i was still waiting a minute for queue. this isnt too long but it's also confusing when you take into account there was 150k players, this game averages around 40k out of peak (it was 150k due to recent free-to-play weekend). there is xbox crossplay as well, which makes the player count even higher than 40k so i really dont know why the queue times are so random.

ANIMATIONS/MOVEMENT:
movement is key in this game, you can feel the importance of it when you get yourself into a bad situation and need to manoeuvre carefully. theres a big learning curve to this game for example utilising your grapple, parrying, dodging, etc. 

the animations of this game are really good and one of my favourite parts of it. thats all i have to say.

GRAPHICS:
the design and style of this game is beautiful. the characters/cosmetics are beautifully designed with a lot of color. the maps are easy on the eye, with characters mostly standing out against the maps. the ui can feel a bit overwhelming when you first play and it can feel a bit like a mobile game but once you are used to it, its just a standard ui.

PERFORMANCE:
the game runs well, i get a decent amount of frames on a mediocre at best pc. there isn't any hiccups, freezing or issues starting/running the game.

IMO:
theres a great range of weapons, from heavy to light as well as melee or ranged. there is something for every player, though i find the larger weapons can be extremely under-powered if you go against someone who has a faster weapon that knows what they are doing. ranged weapons can be a bit hit or miss too, especially at a distance due to ""de-sync"" or high ping players.

there are souljades as well as armour, which to me is a bit confusing. the souljades can increase your health amongst other things such as attack damage and reduction of incoming damage. to me, it makes it feel like armour can feel useless/misleading if someone is stacked with souljades.

the storm seems negligible, for the most part it doesnt do much damage especially in the early stages of the storms. (i cant speak on late game as i dont really stay near the storm end game).

TL;DR
its a good game, fast paced with beautiful graphics/character design/animations. first games are with bots so it feels more rewarding, as time passes bots decrease. theres a good variety of weapons for different types of play styles. movement is a learning curve and important in this game. each character has unique ultimates and abilities just like apex legends.
queue times are random despite high player count, there is crossplay with xbox too. de-sync and high ping can be an issue but not as much as an issue as ive seen people rant about on reviews. a lot of paid cosmetics/microtransactions as well as a battlepass, they do give out a decent amount of free cosmetics from events though."
454,i love the game
455,0.
456,
457,"Played like crazy during beta, had great time, Now came back to see how well it is optimized(vs. what it was back then) and how satisfying the combat is, not to mention currencies to back you up when wasting $$$ on loot boxes, YesYes"
458,me is much like
459,Nice game ngl
460,"Great Game Fun To Play Love The Mechanics, And Graphics."
461,"The game is fun and all to a point, but there are cheaters and people that lag so much you can't hit them while they somehow can in the ranked play that it takes the fun away from it.  You can still play casual, and there the hackers seem to be more chill. There is also no region lock, which accentuates this issue, as you play with the chinese that have a huge ping here.

Also, one of the biggest issues I see with this is that you pay for the game, yet you still have to pay a tremendous amount of money in game for micro transactions. While they don't necessarily affect the gameplay, I find it ridiculous that if you pay 50 euro they still ask money from you to unlock skins and such, to the point you may pay 3-5 times more than the price of the game to get what you may want if it's locked behind RNG.

The combat is not quite that fluid either and it definitely lacks at this price point, not to mention the small choice of characters you can play with, while also most of them being locked behind a pay-wall or grind-wall, with no way to know if you want to unlock any of those characters because you can't even try them.

It goes without saying that it is an online only type of game, so if they ever decide to shut down their servers you can't even come back to the game to play it, so all your investment in it will just go away.

On a reduced price it may be worth it, but at full price, absolutely not. With the amount of money they ask you for those micro-transactions it should be free."
462,ye
463,"Pros:
- Graphics
- Jiggle Physics
- Combat
- Maps
- Waifus

Cons:
- Premium with the feel of a F2P game.
- Locked characters
- Unbalanced
- Unpolished

Verdict:
- Wait for sale.
- This should be free to play,"
464,"The game runs like dogshit but the general gameplay loop is really fun. However, this definitely is more of a PUBG than an Apex Legends, with all the pros and cons that come with that distinction. I personally loved PUBG but could never get into Apex. This game really scratches that itch in a good way.

If you like battle royales, have a good PC (like, decently above recommended specs good, I have a 1080 and 7700K and can barely maintain 1080p60fps at medium graphics) and think the trailer looks good, definitely give this a try.

Probably wait for a sale tho"
465,good
466,"Reviewed based on free weekend.
Trailer looks nice, and then you get met with this korean style semi-non target fantasy RPG Fortnite game with glitchy mechanics, and tons of cosmetics for real money. First few matches its you in a team vs bots, and sure, it gives you a feel for the combat, which if you don't find rare or epic quality of gear, you are pretty much dead. After few attacks/shots you have to repair the weapon using consumables, limited carryweight and all the items go into ether once you complete the quick match. there are some free cosmetics for playing daily, and activities,  and sure its nice that every class can use every weapon, but the customization is very limited, and alot of classes require unlocking. Overall, not what i expected, introduction is against normal monsters and then you are sent to fight against other classes out of blue, if this was supposed to be introduction to story fo this game, then you told me more than in fortnite, and it still makes way less sense.

Just no."
467,awesome game~
468,BEST GAME
469,้hmmm...
470,Love to Chinese people!

474,"Great game, nice PVP action!"
475,good game
476,"I've been following Naraka for awhile, and thanks to the recent trial i was able to try it out.
 This has become one of my favorite Battle Royale games so far, and it's such a nice change of pace compared to all the Shooters.

Graphically, it's quite pleasing. While i'm normally playing on Medium for performance even then it still looks good.
I love the music and sound effects. 

The gameplay is a little hard to get used to at first, but after 16 hrs played i have the hang of it.
Learning combos is something i still need to work on. There's a good selection of weapons, although i rarely use Ranged because it's hard to hit the target unless you're using  a controller (Aim Assist). 

Each character has their own specials, and when leveled you can alter their specials changing how they work.
My personal favorite is Takedo, mostly because he's a Samurai literally voiced by the Ghost of Tsushima himself. You can also deeply edit your characters and make them look however you want.

I have no issues getting Trios or Solo matches, although late night sessions take about 5 mins max.
It does say it supports Cross-Play i believe, and that would include Xbox i'm assuming. There are more modes i've yet to try out as well.

Sometimes i'll come across chinese players that seem to always be god mode. I've yet to beat them.
I'll come close but they always have some trick up their sleeve. So theres that. But i'm not one to jump to conclusions. They are probably just experienced. There ARE bots, but the game says they show up less the higher lvl you are. Either way they're sometimes difficult themselves (unless they're players and i cant tell) but often you can beat them. Good practice. 

Lastly there are a LOT of events, Battle Pass, or hidden menus etc each giving you the ability to earn some sort of reward or currency etc. But they're not really explained very well so you just have to kinda click around till you figure it out sort of thing. There are good cosmetics, although so far it seems to be really rare to unlock anything good. Kinda like Apex Legends. And they do sometimes push things like, Follow this or that. But you can tell it to stop annoying you (For that day).

It's by no means a deal breaker though. For $10 you can't go wrong, even for $20 i'd say that's reasonable considering how fun it is. I wouldn't personally recommend the DLCs but if it's your thing then that's your choice. 

All in all, i'd say this is totally worth checking out if you like BR's but want Melee combat with interesting Character choices."
477,IOOOOOOOOO
478,lagging
479,"Game is fun. I'm not a fan of PvP games myself, buy this one really won me over. I started on gamepass and after a while decided it deserves place in my steam library.

I know I never be good at it and I'll be stressing over lost games because I simply suck, but it's fine. Not Devs fault.

Also, recently there was a beta of new PvE mode, which was super fun. I hope they bring more of it, next time on permanent basis"
480,"This game has a cool concept, except that i feel that it wants to be apex legends too much. Also, the controls feel very primitive, and the graphics are also not the best either. This is a battle royal so don't expect a single player experience where you can actually develop you character the way you want to. Not only does this game cost money there are also in game transactions that are ridiculous, don't spend money in the game if you buy it! Unless you like it i guess."
481,so happy when i play with my friend
482,good
483,"idk wut to say 

"
484,"Fun game with learning curve, smooth Br feel"
485,Awesome game
486,game is fun
487,The game mechanics feel clunky and unpolished. It does not have a lock-on system for melee making it extremely weird whether if the attacks are hitting anyone.The game also takes way too much graphics and it even lags and freezes with a gtx 1650 with settings set to low.The game is extremely easy to freeze while mid-game making it overall a very bad experience.The only good side of the game is the character models are AT LEAST not play-doh graphics. Overall a 2/10 for now.If the server and game freezing bugs are fixed then i'd probably give it a 6/10 due to its creativeness from the other games.
488,Avoid chinese players they will destroy you.
489,its a fire fighting royal game
490,Very fun game with lots of combos and deep combat system
491,NICE GAME
492,GG
493,I like the fighting style pvp reminds me of fortnite with out the guns part which is great news to have close range style combat  game  battle royal   hate the storm part of game i rather have no time limit and hunt them down  or have a choice for no storm or storm  3 people team just great way you can take there gear amazeing fast  easy to understand dont like that there is no open world pve  was really hopeing for this in the game  horses hunting fishing   mission  but sword style  hell ya  but if they do make this happen i hope they take style of red dead 2 with hunting and fighing and bountys maybe even make saki brew for cash hmm so much they can do here with this style of gameing love the 3rd person  and makeing my guy my own guy need more of that in games battle royal is geting way  over made in pc and ps5
494,"i have been playing this game for a while now.
i can only say that it can only get better."
495,GOOD SOUP
496,I love the concept. High mobility with martial arts battle royal.
497,Try not to be racist against Chinese players challenge (impossible)
498,"runs terrible, lags in big fights.
you open the game first thing you see is pop ups for overpriced crappy cosmetics.
weapon sounds (swords clashing, bow arrows, cannon bullets) sound extremely cheap.
graphics are comparable to mobile games and still, the game does not run well and NEEDS to be installed on your SSD.
fights are insanely boring and require little to no skill. Its just smashing left click and some dodging/running and using your ability properly.

do not recommend there is way better games out there."
499,The games was good enough to compete with the other battle-royale genre but it need more uniqueness from itself. I am looking forward for more action pack things for this game to come.
500,"Very fun
"
501,"Neat take on the battle royal formula with attacks, attack combos, and skills that blend pretty well together."
502,Best game ever !
503,"well well well,,,
"
504,fun game sofar
505,"Game looks great when the textures load.  Combat is very simple .    It stutters like crazy if something goes wrong.  Was fun for the first hour or so but got dull after.    

I do not recommend this game unless you really want non-complex combat of rock/paper/scissors/shoot in a battle royale setting. 
"
506,good
507,Made it through the tutorial without any issues some frame drops on the cinematics but overall fine gameplay. Then I went into a online match and the world wasn't loading properly and eventually it kicked me saying my game files were corrupt I validated the game via steam's diagnostic tool and reinstalled it neither worked so never actually got to try the game RIP.
508,"Game? Yes.
Chinese? No.
Bring region and ping limit. There is always a 操你妈 in last 3 players to ruin your emotions."
509,"Are you into Action, Hack and Slash, Open World? Welcome to the Battle Royale Survival game that does just that."
510,super fun
511,"Still horrible connections after a year,. How are you still lagging and losing frame rate when I uncapped the fps and medium graphic setting with my freaking  Alienware Aurora R14?  Like what kind of gaming pc do you expect this to run on? $50000 or more extream rig? if you want to play this, do your self a favor, DON'T , got play some cod br, apex, pubg or even freaking fortnite, for god's sake and its better than this crap right now. And yes i only have 6.5 hours on this account but my other account i have at least 40 hours and I played when it first came out but got bored since the performance and optimization was so bad."
512,"IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: IF YOU CANT PUT THIS GAME ON AN SSD FOR ANY REASON, DO NOT BUY IT, ITS NOT PLAYABLE. 
I have no idea what went wrong there but something seriously did and the game SHOULD NOT be purchased if youre gonna put it on an HDD.

Other than that ive started during the free weekend and bought it on sale, I have had my head kicked in more than once by competent players but there are other players closer to my skill level so thats nice. The fact the game puts you in with bots for the first few games honestly didnt bug me, and every so often a bot might get sprinkled in even later, but you can turn that off if you so wish.
The combat system is pretty fun, if a bit unwieldy to get the hang of, but as a new player with only 10 hours in, im having a good enough time having a go at it. There is an advanced tutorial that puts you in a faux match and shows you the ropes, but the game doesnt direct you to it, you gotta do it yourself. You can find it in the menu where youre picking which mode you wanna queue for, its under training.
Other than that ive seen no real hackers, or ping abusing players, so those reviews might be outdated.

So yeah, I recommend it, unless you dont have an SSD, or you dont have enough room on your SSD, in which case stay very far away."
513,good shit
514,If you like anime style slash game stop there. so fun to play
515,"Honestly would be the best battle royale if it was on all systems in my eyes
"
516,Here for the jiggles.
517,"I wish I could recommend this game, i love the concept of a BR that's melee oriented. But the flaws in it are really hard to ignore. After six hours of playing I've run into the same issues.


-Stun locking is a bitch. Combat just boils down to who can stun lock who first, it gets old really fast.

-even though you pay 10-20 dollars for the game, you still have to unlock characters. That's something I've only ever seen in free to play games. And while you can unlock them with a currency you can unlock in game, you also need that currency to upgrade your characters stats for things like being able to find better loot or grapple further, things that make it easier to win and get more currency, so you get into a rather long grind to unlock characters you should probably already have unlocked after paying for the game. This is also very frustrating.  
"
518,gud
519,SUPER FUN FAST PASTED
520,region lock the game. fix cheating.
521,Far better than the game was at launch.
522,"bro definitely worth the money, super fun game. awesome concept. Def what I was looking for!"
523,"i like the way game look, fun to play. However there lots of bugs, such as game forgets to load player's interface, so you cant pick anything of the ground/chest/loot,  ""E"" ""Esc"" ""Tab"" buttons don't work, res don't work every now and then,
confusing menu, music in lobby can not be switched off, in 3 days of play didn't found how to change keyboard settings if they can be changed. getting stuck in textures in a fight, pulled off the cliff NPC in training could not go to the next step as that bastard did't die from fall, and i could not kill him as he was hiding on a sea floor. May be they will fix those things in future..."
524,"The combat is what makes me want to play this game, it's fast and fluid aside from the stuttering I get here and their. It looks pretty good and the cosmetics are actually worth paying for. Yeah there cash grabs but at least they put effort into making the worth it. Only thing I hope is the game doesn't end up like Overwatch where the updates get slower and new characters become rare. That's fine if there are a lot of characters and balance needs to be worked but 30 something characters just isn't enough after 6 years."
525,good game

547,"Naraka Bladepoint is a game with a medieval East Asian ambience.
Sword fighting, bows and arrows, monsters, etc.

The artwork is quite good, which I always appreciate in a game.

There are various options in the game's settings, but - amazingly (and not in a good way) - you can't change the keyboard controls.
What the ??? Did someone turn the clock back 30 years?
Well, I suppose if it has a medieval setting, one might expect medieval gaming options.

It's an ok game, but being so backward as to not enable control changes, puts a damper on things.
Unfortunately, this one's not for me.


(Note: I played this game on a free weekend.)"
548,"Ok, let me explain my ""don't recommend this game"" choice.
This game is kinda beautiful in absolute honesty, the character customisation is cool too, and the gameplay is easy to understand and very fun.
Now you may be confused, in a quick look it’s look like that we got no actual problem, and I’m just a moron who dislikes things without any actual point but let me explain: 
This game is like battlefront 2 before the EA game refont: it’s a money vacuum. 
The only purpose of this game is to suck your money out you: every little thing need money but don’t take me wrong: this game is not pay2win, but pay2play: like the game is supposed to be free, but the first message you get “please purchase this game”. Very smart move: you can’t get yourself reimburse if you don't like the actual game because you buy it through micro transaction: what a sick joke. 
The “free trial” thing is an absolute garbage merchant move.
But that’s not the only “deal” with this game: they want you to link your every account to their game: free spying on your discord, twitter, steam etc.
Plus you got this very low effort chara design: the drunk fighter, the “deadly beauty”, the monk ect.
Ah and did I mention that the solo queue is only unlockable at lv10 for people on trial mode, but instantly unlocked for paying customers?

So you got this very low effort game, with a lot and a lot of micro transactions, with somes randoms pings drops, a fake “free trial” and somes pay to unlock play mode: I call this being really thirsty for your money and I found it disgusting on a Human moral base."
549,game ran like ass but in the games defence it did warn me for downloading it on a hdd its a battle royal game hard to gleem that from the games advertising not too bad fast paced combat would be fun to the right person give it a 5/10 could have been not a battle royal
550,"Very good
"
551,"Still new to this game, but after the free weekend this has been the most unique take for a BR game. Love the combat."
552,Characters have big boobs.
553,"Fallout New Vegas is clearly the BEST GAME EVER MADE, the writing is SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY compared to every other game. There are so many important moral choices that can be made. Fallout New Vegas has so many quest that are well written with their immersive story telling... You like fallout 3??? HA that game is terrible! THE WORLD DESIGN is terrible! Bethesda is THE MOST EVIL COMPANY EVER!!!!!! In fact, I'm surprised that Bethesda even makes games and they haven't sold Fallout to Obsidian!!! I mean, anyone who has put any time into Fallout New Vegas would know that the world is so immersive that I FORGOT THAT REALITY EXISTED and I pissed myself without noticing! Amazing! There is so much attention to detail that EVERY ROOM has a 25 page wiki article! I read so much about the games world that I became the worlds fastest speedreader! Now I'm a celebrity all thanks to Fallout New Vegas! In fact, playing Fallout New Vegas got me laid! That's right, I had sex because of my speedreader skills! Now women are just falling on me at all times! You haven't played the Obsidian classic Fallout New Vegas? I bet you HATE having sex! Women find 9/10 Fallout New Vegas players more attractive! As a plus, there are well written characters like Veronica and since I can't tell reality from fiction, I'm begging you Veronica please ♥♥♥♥ me! If you don't like Fallout New Vegas then you clearly are just as smart as the Labotomites from the game! You don't get that reference uhh, ""Quest added: Ring A Ding Ding"" you don't get that either? Wow, you should play the game. I work really hard so everyone I know plays it since I know we can't expect God to do all the work! Did I mention the depth of the political ideals in Fallout New Vegas, none of that matters since I always side with the NCR (that are the good guys)....... Most people support them, but some stupid people don't understand the depth of it and support Mr. House or the Legion..... I have to DESTROY them in argument if they are wrong, it's cool because Fallout New Vegas even causes political arguments now! A lot of people don't like how they can't talk about fallout without me getting into a political debate with them. I don't mind since I ""catch them off guard!"" Anyway, I love fallout New Vegas, it changed my life.

Funny thing is that [b]Xbox's version of NARAKA[/b] already has localized pricing for in-game purchasable cosmetics and stuff.

On Steam it costs about double the total amount of what it would've cost if it were in local currencies ( depends from country to country but you get it ).

Tried Steam forums but the post has been ignored for about 2 months now, tried Reddit but the mods removed the post there as well.

584,"When I started Naraka up for the first time I'm not sure what I was expecting, however I was pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the game. From graphics while playing to cut scenes, and also the music that was playing throughout. Really well done, the game is tons of fun. I have not been able to stop playing this weekend and I will without a doubt be putting a lot more hours into it. 

Character design is super entertaining, and if your not into spending lots of time doing it yourself they have a very convenient import system to get already made designs from others. There are some awesome and unique looking characters you can design. The actual appearance editing reminds me a bit of Lost Ark, which is a good thing as I think both are great. And the apparel that you can unlock are super good looking as well. 


It is challenging, however very rewarding watching yourself improve in small aspects like movement or combat. I think the combat is a blast and its cool finding different combinations of weapons, weapon modifiers, and heroes. 

Great game, I'm sad I didn't start it sooner."

587,"Very interesting take on battle royale with great melee combat and abilities (honestly wish they were in an MMO or PvE-centered game, haha). Matches tend to feel more ""fair"" than your average due to the melee focus (you may get hit by some shots at range, but you're not getting sniped without seeing an enemy)."
588,(HELP) Can someone help me fix my game. my game renders don't load i have fps drops and my connection goes red bars
589,If you like to be a ninja in a battle royale then this is your game!
590,Best game ever
591,"Incredibly polished and well-translated for a Chinese title. The game feels good to play and despite being an Asian PvP game, doesn't seem to be pay2win? I enjoyed running around in the one match I was able to play after the tutorial.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend as-is. This PC ran Kingdom Come: Deliverance at max, yet it can't run Naraka at the lowest settings. The developers are fully aware the game is poorly optimized: they provide detailed instructions for you if the game's not installed on an SSD. That's reminiscent of websites that tell you they work best in only Firefox or Chrome; in 2022 this is inexcusable for such a big title. They also don't support DX12, but the graphics page lets you know they're working on it. Once the map/UI/etc finishes loading, it isn't too laggy, but texture errors are still frequent. I might check the game out again on a free weekend if they fix the SSD requirement.

Finally, I'll say: this is a Chinese title. They exist in a country where their government can force them to hand over all stored information on you. Any mention of Taiwan is censored. (see my screenshots) Be mindful of who you give your data and money to."

597,The lag is unbearable.

606,Great game. Allowing bot fight to be counted in quest is good enough for player like me. Playing with friend is the best in this game. You should try it :3
607,YEAAAAA NARAKAAAAA
608,Nice gam
609,"Could be a good game. Too bad its only another Chinese cashgrab for sweaty Chinese. The whole monetization system with all these points,credits,money,xp,credits, points and again points and more points and money and ughhh. 
GTFO of my face !!!"
610,Overseas players teleport around like it's DBZ. Also pay2pay2gacha is goofy af. Nice theme song though.
611,"it's a mixed bag the game is visually stunning and fun to play but it's hitting 99% usage on my GPU causing the game to freeze and stutter every time something needs to load whether it's a map I spawned in to or just loading the end of match results screen

612,so good Game

614,a Melee battle royal? Color me interested
615,played it loved it
616,"combat is fast and tests your reflections and characters and skills are all unique and fun to use and there is different kinds of weapons that suites all players
matchmaking is fast and players are fun to play with
i liked how u can choose different skills for each character *o* 
the map is big and well made and parkour makes the game very fun :D
the spirit mode when you die is something new to me that left me a little confused but it's a good thing to have a chance to revenge from the one who killed you *_*
the game has more than one gamemode for the players who get bored fast wich is a good thing ^_^
that's it ,thanks for reading and i hope this game become free to play in the future ;)"
617,"The game is fun, but I'm struggling to have fun.
It's constantly freezing and lagging, unless you're playing in China. They're superfast, and will make you feel like some random guy trying to fight against an agent in the Matrix. 
I might come back to this in the future if this is fixed, or else it's just not worth it."

Don't get me wrong, fun game? But, a lot of craptastic implementation."
620,it has good movement so it's a good game
621,"Yes i like it. 

I can jump from a rooftop and still wont die.

No cheaters at all so thats a plus. 

10/10"
622,i enjoy but like others makes me racist
623,everybody was kung fu fighting
624,"i got this game on it's free weekend, played one game, won, and thoroughly believe i never want to play this game again. the combat is so surface level and unsatisfying, it boils down to ""who attacked first"" and button mashing. I got 8 kills by button mashing. everything about this game is thoroughly underwhelming, poorly optimised, and boring. I've never disliked playing a game more."
625,Region lock. Get these 2000 ping-pongs out of the NA servers.
626,
627,DGFGDGD
628,The constant stuttering and lag on this game makes it literally unplayable. Its complete sht. I have a really good rig and constantly have issues with only this game. Waste money on a better game.
629,"When NA servers are the only ones with lag issues so they complain constantly, furthering that, when those lacking actual combat skill can't take 9 v 2 and win so lurk on the edges till its over. GJ  proving how much of an actual whimp you actually are. Played Asian, AUS, EU, no one else uses these tactics. Whats more, lag doesn't happen if you have an SSD, genuinely a bit of a design flaw but it isn't Asian players you have to worry about honestly. I've had plenty of 1 v 1 / 2 v 2 fights ending with who ever plays the best. It's the NA players ya'll gotta watch for. Either way, fantastic game, really makes you feel like the skill you apply actually matters (not so much NA side) but EU. Asian players are glorious to play with even in solo. Keep doing what you're doing devs, this scratches an itch long in the making and, aside the ssd loading issues; can't fault ya."
630,"3.7 Hours in, only lost 1 match, found it very fun that I bought it even though there is a free trial because I wanted to keep playing afterwords immediately. Already recommended to some friends. Great Game, excited to see the future of it!"
631,Really fun game w/ amazing graphics ^^ my favourite game at the moment
632,"First thing I see when I try to boot up the game is someting called NEAC which I have no idea what is and then I'm hit with this rediculous message: 

""We ReCcOmEnD iNsTaLlInG tHe GaMe On An SsD""

I should not have to go out and buy an SSD just to play ONE game and a horribly optimized one at that, after 2-3 minutes of loading I am thrust into what I think is a tutorial of some kind (that you apparently can't go into again if you are forced to close the game during THE TUTORIAL! you know, the thing that's supposed to TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY THE GAME) but the awful stuttering and lag and apparently internet connection!? is making it so unplayable that I've already uninstalled it, not even 20 minutes was the game running and I already regret ever looking it's direction.

TL;DR
Game is HORRIBLY unoptimized and unplayable in it's current state if you don't have an SSD since the devs apparently does'nt know what optimization is."
633,good
634,tried it when it was free week glad i did not buy it gets borring quick and battle mechanic who is faster than the other .... dont waste you 20$ on it
635,"the more north american players thetre are, the better game quality it seems to have :) keep em coming!"
636,This wasn't even worth the $9.00 I paid for it on sale. It's poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. Gameplay lacks depth and connections to other players are so poor that there's nothing to do but mash attack and pray you take them out quicker.
637,"Pay overprice for the PC-version of the mobile game, and enjoy killing those who like to play it on their phones."
638,Nice
639,"The game is almost good. But its a fast paced game with no region locking system. So people from eastern servers will play on US servers with 800 ping and wipe lobbies because they get to ignore damage and CC. If the devs would region lock the game, 100% worth $10. But right now, its just a frustrating mess."
640,"So... a 20 dollar battle royale where you also can pay for unlocking characters. Either you sell the game or you put in the pay2fast/pay2win mechanics, you cant have both."
641,I killed a toad
642,"Good game, though some events are limited to certain times, but based on asian servers, so it thinks its monday when its sunday if you live in the usa"
643,"the ranked games are totaly unballanced.... i haven't seen a victory since new season came out, and every single time i die i get killed by a chinese/japanese or something asian. this is so unballanced."
644,"it was free to play for the weekend and I got hooked,purchasing now!"
645,<3
646,boring af
647,"Its a good game with good and unique characters, this game has very good graphics and play functions. The Music is amazing and I would highly recommend for people who like mythical fighting games"
648,Good
649,Some battle royale with way less impressive combat than the trailer shows.. i don't like it even though i made 16 kills and died once.
650,"I thought this game is PVE but it is actually Battle Royale Game. wth?

It should be free game."
651,Ancient Asian battle royale 10/10!
652," Waste of money. I had hope that all of those updates that were launched since I last played, a long time ago, would change something. Well it did, they know how to add countless cosmetics but forget to actually get some real servers that are actually in your region and not china, and I mean servers not laptops running on coal and powered potatoes. 
 They destroyed the performance even more than it was before, constantly destroying your ping, fps and laoding times of everything on the map. 
 So just try to play a game where everyone mashes their face against the keyboard and the game constantly freezes and shows you that you dont have connection cuz u try to just run, walk or change your weapon."
653,"So far, every 2 games I have to restart the game because it crashes in loading screen, not sure if this is a common issue or what, but its quite annoying. Otherwise quite fun game."
654,Amazing except u have to buy for 10 bucks the online mode 8/10
655,chinese game
656,more performance issues than dayz

667,"Your standard live service game filled with microtransactions. except they also ask for a upfront payment. i play during their free weekend, everything is locked except the ""battle"" button. if you are interested in wuxia style action game, there may be a few hours of fun here, for everybody else, there are better game to play."

670,uwahhhh
671,nice but lag
672,Good game.
673,Can't recommend a game that is this dead... Really strange considering there are apparently so many players playing. Are they BOTing maybe?
674,W
675,"I thought this was a battle royale at first, but then I realized it's just a regular hack 'n slash game, where you destroy waves of weak bots. This game is no different than that. I hopped on my first match, excited to have a fateful battle with sword and shield against another skillful player, but I got met with disappointment. The bots just met up in large groups and started slashing at each other, giving no sign of awareness of my presence. Then I would promptly go ahead and eliminate them. Once there only was me and another player left, I realized that it was another bot, because it killed itself outside the safe circle, giving me the much deserved win. I didn't meet one real player.

The lobby also has vocalized music, with no way to mute it, which I think is super-cringe."
676,"Please ignore the positive/negative critics and try out for yourself. It is good they did a free weekend, because it is really difficult to know if you like by just watching reviews/gameplay.
The feeling of combat and movement has to be experienced and it is really what this is all about.
Nice variety with weapons and champions as well.

Thumbs up from me. I do not really like BR but this one would get a 7/10 if i had to give it a score.
-3 points for excessive microtransactions (-2) and too many game modes being available at the same time stretching out the playerbase (-1)."
677,"It was a pretty fun game with a few simple combos from what I could tell. However there were a few issues I couldn't figure out till I got past the training portions. 
First the MC in the training portion was just annoying and her voice acting seemed cheap. Then I got to the main lobby. This thing is a cash grab mobile game made into a PC game with micro-transactions. It's well done and the graphics seem pleasant but there was something else I couldn't figure out. 

There was an element that just turned me off. Everything combined just seemed like a cash grab and cheap. Not sure if it's pay to win, everything seemed to be cosmetic. However with the format and the vibe I was getting I doubt it will be only a cash grab. 

Edit: When I tried to exit the game for the first time. 
The game prevented me from exiting and popped up a request to like/follow their social media accounts. That was the final straw. I uninstalled this game and will not recommend it."
678,"laggy as hell poorly optimized
actually unplayable"
679,Really SUCK!! Keep notice me file crashed when I start a match. Reinstalled few time but still showing me same notice. Bloody Hell!! DON'T PROMOTE FREE TO PLAY if making those Error TRICKS and not allow people play free.

689,"To killing time by playing this game Battle Royale, Hack & Slahs not recommended, because on this server system there is still a problem."
690,"Tried playing with a friend during free weekend, couldn't play the game with him. Also, kind of stupid that the free weekend is only a trial version of the game and limits what you are able to do."
691,ชอบบบ

693,"The Chinese-named people in this game are either smurfs, rank boosters, hackers or bots, very rarely do i encounter a normal one."
694,The Chinese can rape me from around the corner and up my ass... great game would play again
695,"This game looks outdated and heavily monetized with microtransactions. To charge an entry-fee for a br game that is heavily monetized, no thanks. There are tons of f2p games with the same business model that you can play and surely much better than what this game has to offer."
696,"I really like the concept and when you're in the tutorial it feels fun to play. But the actual battle royal part is very clunky due to server/ping issues and some of the design. 

Not sure what the people who post videos of the game doing cool stuff are doing differently to be able to have a stable connection for combat, but that was not my experience at all (and judging by other reviews it's pretty common).

I know it isn't my connection as other multiplayer games work fine and I have a fast connection. But since it's so laggy all the aspects of the combat do not matter as you can't accurately respond to anything.

So you just end up spamming attack to win. Which works but isn't really fun but repetitive; esp as the game is presented as a much more thoughtful combat encounters responding and strategizing.

Enemies are basically teleporting around and never in the spot you're aiming so you're best just swinging wildly in their general direction. It especially makes the parry mechanic pointless as timing is impossible due to this.

The UI and interface is clunky as well. Trying to switch out your weapons or items (as you have limited slots) when quickly trying to gather items and gear for fights quickly is cumbersome and unintuitive.

Or you'll be by item pick ups and accidentally load up a screen of items when trying to do one of your super moves. TBF I was using a controller so maybe that's the issue for that, but even then there are much better ways for it to be set up. So I could switch to kb&m, though I don't think it's much better from videos I've seen.

Maybe this will be improved later but after winning a few matches I honestly just lost any interest (I hear it's mostly bots in the beginning so these issues seem like they'd be worse with actual other players)."
697,It is  a little buggy at that start of each game but once it starts to warm up it runs okay. Once i saw it was another br game i thought it was gonna be trash but i won my first 3 games in a row and i had alot of fun. Made the purchase and im still playing.
698,fun game hard to master

701,"Played it for a bit during a free weekend.\
If you're going to have a storm of cosmetic microtransactions and character microtransactions and all these other predatory practices... at least have your game be free to play? Gameplay seems fine. Either the free weekend playerbase is braindead or they utilize bots to inflate player confidence so they buy the game. Interesting gameplay, pretty game, nice music, terrible MTX practices - It's not just that they're there - It's that they're constantly there. Right in front of you. Every third thing you look at is some sort of advetisement for a way to throw money in the game. Unless it's easy as fuck to earn MTX currency in game and you can get something every week... It's just not worth it. Slightly too abusive MTX for me to reccomend it, nevermind buy it myself - Which is sad, because I had been heavily considering getting it."

707,this game is sweet and very asian
708,"I tried the free version, I don't know if the game is worth the money, the graphics are nice but there is no use, but I like to play and not progress :)"
709,"Honestly I think the game is pretty awful. It could be that I am use to Elden Ring style of combat, which is NOWHERE CLOSE to this game. 

From the lense of a solo-queue style player, the combat is crap imo. It's fast, spammy, makes no sense as to what move can counter another move, what abilities have i-frames vs which ones don't. It's just a slugfest and you better pray to the RNG gods you have whatever luck you need to not be stunned and deleted. 

If you are looking for a combat system that is enjoyable and something you can sink your teeth into, go check out For Honor or Elden Ring. Both pull that off quite well I think.

Tack all this with the typical battle pass system. Just isn't a very impressive game. <shrug>"
710,"I'm sure with enough time it would be pretty fun/competitive but for me it was just an Apex Legends re-skin, its a battle royal clone."
711,"Very poorly optimised, the steam page says SSD recommended, but it should say required. The game is unplayable on HDD, it can't even load the character select in time for you to make a choice, and once you're in the game you've got decent odds of dying before it actually loads enough to start functioning. 40 GBs is a lot of SSD space to ask for, and it really shouldn't be necessary."
712,"The intro is a confusing mess.  I had a sword, then didn't have a sword. Had my bow lose durability during a fight (which just makes it a lousy bow not worth keeping) and then I had a sword again.

I tried longer than I needed to but could not get the block to proc.  Then just as I'm winning a fight the action stops and I'm dumped into a lobby being pestered with ads and ""Buy the game to access this"" 

Even when I exited the game, it still tried to sell me things and it has a ""do not ask me again today"" button like the absolute worst of the mobile PTW games.

And why put a timer on the skip cutscene option?  If I want to skip, it means I don't want to wait for the cutscene.  Let me skip or don't let me skip, but forcing me to watch 10 seconds of something doesn't make me pay attention to it or enjoy it.

I can already see where this game is heading and I want no part of it.  I was in-game for maybe ten minutes and it was ten minutes too long.  You failed to capture my attention or interest because of your over-marketed janky mess."

DO NOT BUY THIS if you live in OCE, there are no OCE servers and there is a very important mechanic in this game that depends on timing.

Other than that, graphics and movement look weird. Just not my kind of game.

721,"Great game for battle royal, more playable map then most battle royal style games"
722,Cool
723,"I mainly played this game during one of their betas and I really enjoyed it and thanks to this free weekend, I can finally leave a review. 

It's a really fast paced melee combat BR style game with some pretty cool customization (I personally love the animal tails and ears you can put on characters, I really wish more games had that) but my biggest problem with it is the price. You are buying a $20 game that treats you like a f2p game. 

I had this complaint since the beta and it's the main reason I never bought the game. This game is so clearly designed like how a f2p game would be but it's not. You have to spend $20 for the base game and then you'll get tons of (cosmetic) microtransactions shoved in your face. 

Pretty much all the cool cosmetics are locked behind the premium currency (now I don't own the game itself, so I don't exactly know the rate that you get it in game or if you get it ingame at all. I know during the beta you got some but that was a beta.) So you are pressured into spending more money on a cute fox tail or something to make your character stand out more. Ontop of that, there's also a battle pass (paid and free) but that's not really surprising as most games have those now.

I went into the beta not knowing much about the game (and from the game itself, I thought it was going to be a F2P game) and I really enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun, and I was 100% going to play when it fully released and even spend some money on it... then I found out it's not f2p and instead a $20 game with a stupid amount of microtransactions. 

I think the game is pretty good, it has flaws and I don't know much about it's current state and what not but overall it is enjoyable. I just don't think it's worth $20 with how many microtransactions are currently in the game."
724,It's aight
725,"Everything about this game CAN be fun. However, it's either, (1) you suck and need to try real fucking hard, or (2) you play  against top tier people and get rocked easy. No in-between. I basically play alone until I get butthurt and quit."
726,Very fun game :3
727,not for me
728,im playing the free trial and its already making me racist
729,"The game is very uniqe. I like it a lot acutally. There are so many lovely cosmetics to choose from, so everyone should get what he/she likes. The gameplay is nice, you have to spam your buttons a lot. but if you get the hang, its very addictive.

732,"wepon based battle royale!! The characters have different abilities, interesting mechanics"
733,"Tried this game on a whim, its incredibly fun! if you were looking for a game to change up your routine, this did it for me :)"
734,awesome battle royale game
735,fun
736,This game shocked me. Even tho my fps can barely handle on lowest graphics i still am able to find joy in playing it. I highly recommend coping this im fs buying after free trial.
737,"Game is borderline unplayable on an HDD (which they state would lag in the beginning of the game).

Combat takes no skill, it's click spammy with a few visual effects. You don't need skill to play this game.

Ranged weapons are pointless because the ping differences between you and everyone else is too vast for you to hit anything. (For some reason they match up players who are in China with players who are in North America). 

You have to pay money to play this game and then pay more money for in game cosmetics. You should not have to pay for a game if they are trying to monetize it. 

Suffers from the same battle royal sickness. Running around for 90% of the time looking for loot.

On the plus side the graphics are nice. When they don't stutter trying to load properly.

The characters don't feel unique, and the abilities are wildly overpowered in crowd control situations.

I wouldn't really recommend this game for anyone trying to find an entry level battle royal. I haven't played the other modes because this game is marketed towards the battle royal genre. It feels like this game could have taken off a lot more if they focused on single/multiplayer storytelling. The visuals are nice but because battle royals are a very lackluster type game mode, it doesn't compliment each other.

Overall this game feels like it was designed to maximize the cash shop without looking into building a lasting player base. Maybe if it was more skill based, more difficult, and less laggy (both FPS wise and Ping wise), it could take off a little more, but I don't see it going anywhere."
738,"Edit: Ok, nvm. This game has a terrible network optimization. The network speeds are atrocious. So unplayable when getting into combat, literally freezes and stutters and I couldn't move or defend myself when getting jumped by 4 lagging players. You guys have got to fix this. The idea is there, but this is just awful. But still fun when playable."

SHITTY ANTICHEAT YOU CAN FIND INFORMATION ON HOW TO COMPLETELY BYPASS WITH A GOOGLE SEARCH

744,"Pros: 
Pretty to look at
Decent character customization

Cons:
Way too much crowd control. Expect to not have control of your character half the time, especially against certain characters. You will be juggled, stun locked, and have your weapon taken out of your hands constantly.

Disrespects your time heavily. You will spend a lot of time waiting in queues, looting, a lot of time fighting AI that fights worse than a 90 year old grandmother trying to play this game, and then finally, after a while, you'll get to PVP. Very high likelihood that your few actual player opponents will be VPN users with 600 ping."
745,"This really surprised me. I was constantly getting it recommended to me on the steam store and so when I finally gain an interest, it goes on sale and I consider it. Then the day after it goes free for a weekend which is when I'm currently writing this review and so I think why not try it, now is my chance. This feels like such 
a refreshment for the battle royale genre. I would say the combat is a lot like Elden Ring's PvP and it definitely gives me vibes of Ghost of Tsushima. It's got customization for each hero you can play from the hair,  to the colours of it and the clothes that you wear. I would definitely recommend this when it's on sale as it is a bit costly at full price considering the microtransactions and loot boxes with a battle pass included. I also forgot to mention that it has a bot game mode which, me personally, love that inclusion as it keeps the game alive long after the playerbase lowers. It has little game modes on the side too which is great!"
746,NICE GAME.... I PLAY THIS GAME ON AND  ON ..............
747,"ngl it was very overhyped the combat was boring i got it in the free weekend an thank god i did it takes 30 mins just to actually play the game i genuinely think this is the worst battle royale games i ever played and so overpriced i would not buy it for the fraction of the price please spend it on something else like i said before the combat is boring not satisfying at all the design is good but the style and theme is classic i nothing really special and the there is so many kinds of currency its like a gacha game even genshin impact is better than this ""game"""
748,"Steam should have a maybe/neutral review option.  I can see how this game would appeal to some.  It has lovely graphics and an complicated gameplay that some want.  But it's too complicated.  I just won a 3v3 match through button smashing and I don't even know what I was doing.  It's also full of micro-transactions and the lobby is like a flashing neon billboard with tons of superficial content.  It's just, not for me."

761,"A very special kind of Battle Royale game, its really fun and worth trying, I have it on gamepass but just played it here to give it a positive review...

a superb melee combat game, the combat system is just perfect for a Battle Royale game, some chain attacks, attack cancel, block, dodge and parry.
Fighters have their own Ultimate.
The movement speed around the map is pretty good and fun, it never gets boring.
They have also added a Duo mode which makes it even better to play it with 1 friend.
The girls are sexy everyone agrees on this point.
The environment is great, I just hope they won't ruin the game by replacing it with another map.
The price looks very fair for the fun you're gonna get from this game.
Run away when you see an Asian player before you get spotted!

Overall 9/10 highly recommended."

770,"downloaded it on free weekend, takes more than 15 minutes to find a match and the game runs like sh*t, has massive sttuters and I don't have a potato PC. Plus the lobby music was one of the most awful things I've heard in years and I couldn't find the options to turn it off anywhere other than muted the audio until a match was found. honestly after more than 30 minutes I just deleted and glad I didn't buy this since I had it on my wishlist. total pass..."

780,"not my cup of tea, looks SUPER cool, just not my type of game"
781,"OK.... So after a rough beginning, with looong queues and EXCESSIVE lag (SEA servers), I finally found a fix: Using a VPN, for what ever reason, leaves me with about 130ms, but, completely stable, no spikes etc, and to be honest so far it's playable. 
Now that all the connection issues are sorted, I really enjoy the game (and I don't like BR's). Its unique and fun, great game for playing with a friend or two."
782,Not that good - didn't run smoothly and the gameplay was obscure. Had some good animations though.
783,game is unpolished too much clunkyness  and nearly dead game . If you are new and are trying to learn the game yeah gl with that you aint getting a chance most of the time you fight pro players . Not beginner friendly and battle passes are a scam. See if you like while its on free trial but dont get unless you rich or have money to spend. Where game is at not worth its price . Also characters are broken some can 1shot and some are completely bad.
784,So much fun when someone macro's the shit out of the game and has 100% counter rate

787,"Tried this game as it was free for a weekend.
Did the tutorial, started a game.
First of all new players can only tag games of groups of 2 or 3 even when solo (meaning you're alone versus teams). As a solo player this is really bothersome.

First game went as follow : 
 - Game is full of bots (95% were bots), none of which are any threats.
 - Met 1 guy in 1v1 after 10min of game (in a game for groups of 3)
 - after some more bots encounters, finally made it into the final
 - I'm 1v3 (they had a group of 3, i could only tag alone) 
 - obsiously lost

uninstalled game as i don't have the determination to grind 1v3s until i can reach the level to start solo games

793,"Naraka: Bladepoint is based on the well-known Battle Royale system, but differs in the combat system, because the focus here is not on firearms. Of course, we also have a large selection of long-range weapons at our disposal here, but our main weapon is intended for close combat. With knives, swords, katana, spears, nunchucks and more, we face our opponents in direct combat. In order to meet the Battle Royale claim, we don't need any abstruse key combinations here, but the melee is based on actions that we can trigger using the right and left mouse button. The landscape, the characters and a large part of the armament come from the Asian region.  Similar to the operator known from other titles, here we play one of nine different heroes. Each of these heroes has special hero abilities. Of course, we can also customize the look and clothes of our heroes. Some can be unlocked through game progress, but there are also skins that can be purchased through an in-game shop. When we start the game for the first time, we land directly in a tutorial mode. Here we are first explained the basic controls, such as running, jumping and climbing. Next we will learn about the grappling hook. With its help we can reach higher points or overcome gorges. After completing the tutorial, we have two more training sessions available. But we can also repeat the introductory training at any time as often as we like. The two other training sessions now deepen the combat mechanics and other systematics. So we can still learn some things about buying items and also about revival in the extended tutorial. In free training we can configure a sparring partner and thus familiarize ourselves with the various heroes, abilities and weapons. We can also get to know the soul jade better here. Because this serves us to optimize skills or brings us helpful effects, such as self-healing. Combat Mechanics:
When it comes to combat mechanics, we have to differentiate between melee and ranged combat. Both have their own control mechanics. What both types of weapons have in common is that we have to keep an eye on durability. Even if the pure control is manageable, the correct use in combat must be learned in detail.The control of the fights is based on the right and left mouse button in close combat. With these we can trigger vertical and horizontal attacks once. If we keep the button pressed we can carry out a charged attack. Several attacks in a row result in a combo attack, which always ends in a particularly powerful attack. We don't need to learn complex key combinations for this. But what we can't trim with our melee weapon is the vegetation.Naraka: Bladepoint has the potential to establish itself as a real alternative in the battle royale market. It offers chic graphics that are still easily scalable. The gameplay differs from most other titles on the market due to its focus on close combat, but still manages to use a familiar control concept. In addition to the well-structured tutorial, there is also a quite demanding bot mode. In this way, newcomers and those switching to the game can first gain some experience before they plunge into combat against living opponents. Because in real combat it is difficult for a beginner to gain a foothold. Because the pure control may be easy to learn, but you need some time for the right combat management. Here it is important to find the right combination of the two attacks and avoiding enemy actions.

Of course, one could of course criticize the in-game shop. But this one is somehow part of the genre, because for many players the latest skins are probably almost more important than the actual gameplay. After all, the shop is focused on visual extensions, so the title definitely doesn't follow the Pay2Win scheme.

We can recommend Naraka: Bladepoint to everyone who, after many years, is looking for a change in the battle royale genre, but also to those who have previously shied away from this genre because they are not fans of shooters."
794,"Love this game, beating chinese players is really hard tho."
795,"3 days after I bought the game, season 5 went live, and the new character with it. Zipin Yin.
 I played only solo so far as none of my friends play this game, so I wanted to learn a bit before going into duos/trios. And unfortunately, solo is unplayable beacuse of the new character. Its unkillable. For those who dont know, a quick summary of her set: healing and more healing and def boost and lethal attack immunity. Unless you can one shot her with perma stagger before she pops her ult, its not worth to pick up a fight. Well, she is probably gonna chase you down and slaughter you sooner or later anyway. 
Thats my new player experience, as long as I dont come across Zipin Yin, the game is rather enjoyable. Im not yet in a position to either recommend it or not, but I will keep playing, trying to get better. 
As for this review, Im posting it as a downvote, as Im againts characters that give you adventage by simply picking them."

802,best combat since titanfall 2
803,My favourite Battle Royal to date. The combat feels unique and challenging; there's lots of combos and movement techniques to learn and get good at. The environment is gorgeous and the aesthetics of the characters/weapons/outfits is all very well done and there hasn't been a skin I haven't liked yet. The battle pass gives you a lot of things and the price is reasonable compared to battle passes I see in some other games. Most of all I appreciate that you can gain experience and do quests in PvE mode and casual PvP - there's no requirement to do the ranked mode if you don't want to.
804,"PLAY FREE WEEKEND REVIEW

off the bat, I think this is personally too much for my PC. You cant redeem rewards or unlock chests in trial play which makes sense it just forces you to buy the game almost. 

The gameplay itself is interesting. it's like Fortnite with martial arts. customization and gameplay are good, It's a shame many NA servers are overridden with other servers, making them untouchable due to ping. 

They bring events out so often that you get tons of customizable items. 

Id say this game is good, it's just read the reviews for a real take on the server issue,"
805,"the good of the game is outweighed by its obtuse systems, terrible monetization scheme, and overall clunkiness/jank. Hoping another team can do the concept better one day"
806,"This game is amazing, it has a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, this game is a blast. It's LITERALLY kung-fu Fortnite. It's so much FUCKING fun. The graphics are stunning and each character sticks out in their own unique ways. The new addition of the PVE game mode, DEFINITELY helps this game out for those looking for more then a BIG OLD PVP!  OH a note to make for fans of the Sword and Fairy RPG franchise, Naraka recently did a crossover in honor of Sword and Fairy 7."

812,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Narkara and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
813,this game has lots of bugs including stuttering and unusual framedrops.

834,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
835,"I was expecting a bit more from this game tbh, but man, this game is really bad.
- Unable to find a game, taking more than 8 min (thought I bought a fighting game, not a waiting simulator)
- Poorly optimised, quitting the game resulted in a Blue Screen (Kernel Security Check Failure)
- The combat is kind of meh( at least at the beginning)
- Unable to play it with a controller, the character started running in a direction for no reason after not touching the left stick, (feels better with K & M tho)
Didn't meet any Chinese tho, lucky me I guess."

845,"With how often this game freezes to stream and load content, I'm a bit curious as to what content I actually installed on my machine. Kurumi, for example, is clearly not installed. She's invisible. I can play as her, and I can see her face floating in the air.

Every couple of minutes the game will freeze and then render something that should have already been present.

Perhaps the game wasn't made properly? I mean, no other title I've played has issues like this. Usually, a game will load the map and structures and players (etc) then simply render them when the player turns the camera to observe the object. It seems like Naraka doesn't even bother loading things until it is far too late.

Also, my ping is (allegedly) 42ms. Unfortunately, I think the game is lying to me."

It is fun to play only when asia is sleeping."
851,"Great game, really needs work in the ult department. Been playing so much and still run into so many Chinese usernames in the NA server and several (SEA, EU) people as well in the wrong server ruining it for others who don't have 900+ ping. I really wish there was a way to like my account to the Xbox Gamepass system and have cross save that way but this is going to be another Apex were they want you to respond all the money and time into it.
Also please buff Valda, she's so useless in most solo games."
852,My favorite part of the game is when the wall gets closer and I drop from 100+ fps to 17 fps. It just makes the game so playable.

871,It's a fun game with good mechanics but the horrible connection issues and optimisation make it unplayable stay away from it untill they fix it.
872,Naraka Bladepoint is an extremely fun battle royale for me because of the combat style and the movement. However I don't think it's very popular within the NA region as I feel like I'm constantly going against bots until the last 3. Either way still really good just needs more NA players. 9/10

884,the most skill based and nice fight flow of all Battle Royales i have played
885,The game is quite alright but the connection is extremely bad
886,i like this game play. so cool !!!
887,"Noiceeeeeeeeeeee.
I love Baifern~"
888,.
889,If you like swords and melee gameplay this is the game for you! Especially if you like a battleroyal without the gun element to it!
890,gg
891,I don't think anything has ever made me hate a group of people as much as this game made me hate the Chinese.
892,"This game really shouldn't cost money, it has all of the mechanics and monetization of a free to play game, lootboxes, $20 skins, a battlepass and constant updates. If they make most of their money off of those things listed why still charge 20 for a game with a dead playerbase since beta? IF it goes f2p the playerbase would be bigger as more people would try it. Not some free weekend bs."
893,BOOM
894,bad
895,"yo this game is the only game that keep crashing every game. It just suddenly stuck or quit the program itself.
kinda sucks."
896,"goog game
"
897,"Few things beforehand, there is a big learning gap between first time players and people who have been playing. First game you may feel like a god fighting against bots, a few games later you are getting destroyed by people that have smurf accounts or people that have been playing for a long time. I enjoy the game even saying this. Sometimes the queue takes long but overall i would recommend people to play. One of the first BR games that i don't get mad at when i die. I know 97 hours isnt long compared to others. 
If you have reservations with the game, you can always play using XBOX GAME PASS for free and play on pc using that. 

Please note, cross save doesn't work. Not sure if implemented later.
Currently adding friends cross - platform doesn't work. They know about the bug and are working through it. You can still get lucky and queue into each other.

Personally i would say 7.5/10"

901,傻逼游戏，没有这个技术就别做这种游戏，打击感想吃屎一样，就整个角色就飘在地上，br游戏打架0收益，永远都是被3rd party， 抄人家弹反就好好抄，第一场见到弹反是弹反蓄力重击的，还有光效和音效提示，xswl，怕不是专门设计出来给残疾人玩的， 武器对刀的弹刀， 小匕首能和大剑弹刀？在搞笑呢？
902,"Naraka: Bladepoint is an amazing fighting game and a pretty good 60-man brawl. The more you play, the more you will enjoy it.

Beginners will feel like the game is impossible, hard, unfair, unforgiving, ruthless, hard to learn, and luck based.

This is all fair and true. But after 450 hours I love the game! (I loved it After just a few hours, even though I was awful in skill level).

But once you play the game a lot you WILL learn to play the game. You will suck at this game when you start, guaranteed. The combat is rich, exciting, and spikes your adrenaline.

Grab some friends, the game is best shared in a 3-man or 2-man group!"

904,its a really fun game
905,"It was good BR, but not popular in my country, so I stopped playing it."
906,"love the game

907,"The concept is fine but everything else is mediocre, but the worst of all is the connection issues. You get disconnect in the middle of a fight due to server issues and boom, your whole team is gone. Fix it before everyone leave this game."

913,"Yea the game is cool and fighting CAN be fun but matchmaking is a joke. You have a good 3-4 games then the new player buff wears off and your put in absolute SWEAT lobbies. a new/casual player cant even make top 30. The amount of sweat already in this game is insane, one meta is using blue form weapon animation cancels just to move/dash faster. Theres bountiful hacking it seems just cant prove it. Theres not just a learning curve, theres a no life it or dont play curve."

920,"I have less than 4 hours in this at this point but this is a game that I've been wanting to get into since launch as it looked really good.  My first impressions?  It's really good.  The game itself if fun and I like the character custimization as well as some amazing outfits and equipment skins.  It may be a little early for me to give a good deep review of this game but so far, I like what I've experienced."
921,"If your into hand to hand combat with a challenge I would recommend this game. Its hot new game, where they have variety of characters and customization for you to try out."
922,one of the best BR i have played in years
923,"toi khong the dang nhap game duoc
"
924,"Naraka, in my opinion, is a fantastic game. I haven't had so much fun playing PVP in years. I've played PUBG and Apex Legends for over 1000 hours, but this game doesn't feel like a traditional BR to me. As a fighting game, it's more like Mordhau than a multiplayer action combat game, but it's still the best action combat/melee multiplayer game that I've ever played. It borrows heavily from Apex Legends, but it's distinct enough to avoid feeling like you're playing the same game.

The Souljade system adds a lot of variety to gameplay, and each weapon and hero is meticulously designed. The variety of attacks and combos available for each melee weapon keeps the game from feeling repetitive and instead makes it very addictive and rewarding to improve in. So even newbies can compete with the best players in the game if they read a few games and practice enough. Naraka, in contrast to other games, never gives you the impression that you can't beat the most sweaty player. In light of the fact that you can grab and climb just about anything you see, the grapple and free climbing system is truly remarkable. In terms of animation quality, it is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen in an action combat game (and it's not even close). In contrast to other games I've played recently, this one doesn't feel janky at all (New World, BF 2042 Beta, Elyon). Because you can traverse and climb everything, I haven't encountered a single bug like falling through the map or getting stuck, or glitching through objects.

The heroes, weapons, and environments all have fantastic textures and model designs, and the audio for each weapon and hero ability is distinctive enough that you can always tell what's going on around. The user interface (UI) is simple, clear, and easy to get around in. Even if you choose to cancel animations, the game will not feel jerky or glitchy.

The negative aspects of the game are unrelated to the game's content. The player base is to blame for all of the negative aspects. People are most upset about meta picks, long queues, and a confusing ranking system. However, the root of all of these problems is a small pool of active players (at least in the West). Another problem is the game's difficulty; new players will shy away from it due to the fact that more experienced players will smash their faces in. You'll get rolled a lot in the beginning. Those who persevere, on the other hand, will [hopefully] come to appreciate this game for the masterpiece it is.

Finally, the RNG lootboxes are a source of much dissatisfaction among players. To reiterate, there is no pay to win in the game (incredibly refreshing for an Asian developer!)! In order to counteract the best cosmetics being locked behind RNG, the shop has a slew of great skins that can be purchased outright. The base price does not affect your ability to play the entire game. Glyphs are the only thing preventing you from playing on an even playing field with your opponents and teammates, but getting all of them maxed out only takes a few days.

In terms of gameplay, fun, and fluidity, many of the games I've played this year have been an embarrassment (most notably New World and BF2042 Beta). In my opinion, the most important factor in determining how enjoyable a game is to play is the gameplay, not the visuals. Everything works in Naraka, and it's a lot of fun if you put in the effort to improve. Being victorious in a duel, hunting down a target as a third party, or obtaining a clutch play, snipe, ulti, or other satisfying outcomes is gratifying. The game has a high quality feel to it, and I have no doubts that the creators put a lot of thought and care into it.

There are still some developers out there who are focused on gameplay rather than glitz and glamour, and that's why I wrote this long ass review: it's a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the West."

"
934,GOOD GAME
935,"Currently, I would recommend against putting any money into this game. Try it out on Xbox's Game Pass, but don't buy it here if you haven't played a fair amount of hours first.
Lobbies are flooded with players with awful ping and/or bots resulting in poor match quality. There's no way to set a ping limit when searching for games and queues are long as-is so I don't see this being fixed.
Obnoxious menus which have prompts for nearly everything you try to do (ex: Collect a reward?, prompt for each item (no collect all). exiting the game? prompt. you get the idea).

TL;DR: Gameplay is solid, everything around it is bad enough to think twice."
936,"really fun and high skill-capped, need more players"
937,this game so funny

944,"I've bought it, played one ranked game, won with 15 kills and literally was surprised how shitty this game is, my opinion is not worth it, full of cheaters and toxic community, plus a lot of bugs, yep that's all from me I've refunded the game because of all these."
945,"Very fun, great mechanics, would recommend."
946,This game is so good that I tried to kill myself
947,nice
948,Good
949,"The game is great. Really fun and the skill ceiling is high. I like when players better than me fight me because it helps me learn the game faster and better, but my one and only complaint is that after reaching silver 5 i run into so many Chinese players/ or players using VPNs to hop servers and its near impossible to beat them in a fair fight. I've run into top 500 players who cc you to death and that is fine it's skill, but... 
I'll be a whole grapple hook away from a server hopper and then they'll do a blue attack and i'm dead. 
They teleport to me and attack me through walls.
When it goes to spectate they are teleporting all over the place. 
I'll deal loads of damage and then all of a sudden i'm the one with low health and they're full.
I'll hit them while they heal and their heal goes through instead of them getting stunned or knocked out of it.
I'll grapple them and they don't get stunned. 
They parry my normal attack which can't be parried, only blue and purple attacks can be.
I'll parry a blue attack and they just hit me through it then continue their combo.
I'll use a skill like the monks bell and they hit it but don't get pushed back. The list goes on.
The devs need to fix this. They need to block people with ping over a certain number from playing with other people below a certain ping.
If you stick to random non ranked matches for the most part and can let it go when the odd server hopper lag kills you i recommend this game 100%
If you want to do ranked then i cannot recommend it."
950,Unique Battle Royale
951,"Nice game so far, needs a bit more players on the EU server since queues can be long at low population hours.

The gameplay is quite smooth and easy to learn with a decent learning curve to become very good at the game.

Please do use my code for free stuff if you are buying the game :D ""chprf64n78"""
952,"Good game just came out at the rong time
"
953,i like to eat burgers -_-
954,"I want so badly to love this game. I will definitely be coming back to check if they've made improvements.

The good:
- Combat is fun, fluid and feels satisfying
- Wide variety of weapons and characters for a newer game
- Frequently updated, developers communicate with community
- Various modes for different types of players.

The bad:
- For some reason, an overwhelming amount of Chinese players are playing on NA servers. This is a problem as ping is king in Naraka.
- Low player count means matchmaking is slow and inaccurate. When you are matched against players around your own skill, the game is a blast. 9 times out of 10, you will be playing against a handful of the top players on the server.
- Looting and UI need some love and optimization

There is a large update coming later this month; I hope they make significant changes and incentivize new players to join the game."

962,"My computer can run Blade and Sorcery and Boneworks at max settings but cannot run this bullshit at minimum settings. I Died To Someone who was Fucking T-Posing at me for reasons i cannot fucking begin to understand. Yes Im salty, No im not joking."
963,"The game's amusing and all, but it takes a while to get used to, hard to learn, hard to master. No region lock, meaning  you'll be facing lots of Chinese players who haven't touched grass in a long time, and get your ass beat.  Once you grasp the flow, however, it is addictive. Lots of heros to refresh your experience when you feel like things are getting repetitive, likewise the variety of weapons make it easier for you to adopt a new fighting style. The battles really have a feel for them, and you can experience some genuine adrenaline trying to survive. You can play solo or go with a duo / group of 3 people. The game's got a ranking system too which makes it all the better for competitive players such as myself. Moreover, it is not a pay-to-win game, you heard it right! Asian developers, and yet you can get the best cosmetic products simply by spending event points or unlocking chests. Last but not least, the visuals are outstanding. They really excel at conveying the traditional eastern style, I play in the medium settings and even I can stop and just appreciate this relaxing scenery sometimes. The optimization is not the best though. 

Overall this is a good PvP game with a unique approach, and solid combat system as well as
beautiful graphics. 10/8. I'd say the price is easily justified."
964,"Naraka

Good Game Graphic, not a pay to win. 
Learning process of this game is pretty smooth, you can pick up this game really fast if you play Pubg and other mmorpg before.
Try out the game first before paying for skin, it kinda like league of legend if you want to look good you have to pay.
There are rune pages to increase your ability in game.
There are many different reward for beginner player, leveling up process is pretty fast due to multiple even happening at the same time. 
I hit level 20 within 6 hours of game play
The ranking system is this game is a bit unbalance at the moment. (Hopefully they will fix this)
There aren't any bot in rank, but through quick play I think there plenty of bot or they're just brain dead player playing at 4AM like me."

The devs really need to do something about them using a vpn to play in other regions, because I really don't see how anyone would want to keep playing this game when you have opponents who lag like crazy and ruin the game."
986,"DON'T BUY IT!!! There are almost no players in this game in the US, and if you choose to play this in the US server, it would be impossible to match with even 3 teammates, not to say matching 60 online players at the same time. REQUESTING FOR A REFUND

992,ممتازه اللعبه
993,This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.
994,This game turns into a survival horror when you encounter an asian player
995,"its good

996,Too good to play
997,"Infested with cheaters. When you reach rank platinum above, you will meet them more often."
998,its different game
999,One of the best games I have played in a while.
1000,Movement is great. One of the best battle royale games I've played.
1001,This game is ass. Gets boring really easily and the in-game events are lame as well.
1002,"I really like the game in this game, starting from the fierce battles between other teams by doing combat battles where each team fights who is the strongest among them, what I like the most about this game is the combat battle where every player can do a counter attack on the enemy, and in my opinion this game is very suitable for players who usually play mechanisms with combat battles, but players who usually play battle royale will also quickly adapt to the mechanics of this game. So I highly recommend this game to all of you."
1003,"If you are planning to buy this game. DON'T!!!! take it only when it will be free to play for couple of days.

Matchmaking queue is long as 7-10 minutes. There are a lot of cheaters. There are a lot of chinese players who spend their lives in this game therefore it is not for an ordinary player who just wants to chill and logs in for couple of hours. On top of everything once you spot a player with chinese nickname your ping will start spiking like crazy, you will be quite limited in what you can do while the other player just smashes your right front and center like nothing. Initially i though that it is a coincidence but once i went through other reviews i understood that developers apparently do not care about stability of this game for wide range of players. There were so many reviews where people asked to region lock servers so that everyone can enjoy this game properly.

WORST PURCHASE ON STEAM EVER!!!"
1004,I love how addictive Naraka is and how you get a hang of the game. I dislike how there are people often teaming non-intentionally
1005,Good graphics and user friendly game play ! Definitely recommended !
1006,its fire
1007,"PAY TO LEVEL / WIN LIKE A MOFO! This game would be totally awesome if not for characters and leveling them up being stuck behind a paywall. You technically can grind the Tae but you CAN NOT GET GOLD any way other than buying it. I costs 16,000 Tae to unlock a character. After paying $19.99 for it when it first came out I feel gyped. I can't beat the people in the game after recently restarting to play because I am not willing to drop $$$$$ PHAT CASH $$$$$ on currency to purchase characters to try and level them up. I always just get pounded by an invincible MAX level with $45 worth of cosmetics on. I was digging it but the PAY TO Win spoiled it completely."

1009,This game is awesome

1011,"Naraka: Bladepoint is like no other Battle Royal game I simply like the fact that its almost purely melee based combat. The movement is fluid the customization is excellent and the combat is superb, and fighting an opponent feels like I'm in a duel to death and it is EPIC! The lag was a bit of an issue, but it can be fixed real quick in settings. Unfortunately for me I'm not a big PvP person so I won't play this game as much as others, but for those who are looking for something drastically different that your standard third person Battle Royal this game is a must have.

1015,"I played 60 hours of this game, only to get permanently falsely banned for ""cheating"". Little known fact was they were giving out broom skins to people who got others banned successfully, so I feel I got targeted for winning a match against a salty person. I had all my VODs on my channel of all my gameplay, and yet the support team did nothing to get it figured out. I sent multiple emails, and in game support tickets, including my channel so they could review it if they wanted. I was in the Discord channel asking for assistance as well. I had all the proof I didn't cheat. I had countless hours of gameplay on my channel, yet they didn't care.  I spent over $200 on items ingame, as well as buying the game. Don't spend money on this game. If you get wrongfully banned, they will not help you, or even consider reversing the ban. I thought the wrongful ban thing was a very very rare occurrence, however it feels different when it happens to you. Would not recommend this game to anyone. If you get invested into it, you will want to spend money. It's fun, but the support team will screw you if you happen to have any issues. Not to mention the VPN abusers & awful Qeue times."
1016,"This game can be very fun. The combat is very fluid, and there is a lot to play around with using the different characters. The problem is that the game usually doesn't work properly. The netcode is horrible and tends to favor the player that is lagging, which is why players from overseas will always have the advantage. Parrying only works when the game wants it to, which is about half the time, on the other half a focus attack will just go through a parry because why not. I have never seen queue times below 1 minute, but even then, half the enemies you fight in any given match is probably a bot that runs around you and occasionally attacks once or twice."

Has some cool mythology flavor as well.  It's pretty easy to learn the basics, but takes some time to really get competitive.  It's not as complicated as it may seem, just takes practice to get the timing right on certain things.  Great game in my opinion and definitely worth it."

1034,Is it me getting bad at playing or the player just too good suddenly? they often instantly parry me way too perfect and suspicius...
1035,Lags way to much! I have a 2000 dollar and my frames are lower than 30. would not recommend
1036,graet
1037,"Chinese players ruining the servers. Other than that, a fun game to play."
1038,"Tired of the same tried and tired battle royale formula of running around for 20 minutes just to get sniped in the back of the head, but still enjoy the thrill of large-scale free for all combat?

If the idea of Sekiro combat in a hero-based battle royale with anime-style aesthetics sounds interesting to you, you've come to the right place."
1039,the game is so much fun can't wait to play with friends
1040,game is kinda easy but fun idk if theres bot but i dropped 27 kills and i just started playing
1041,cant even play with all these high ping enemies
1042,nice
1043,Wait 10 minutes for a game just to get rocked by some 900 ping chinese fella
1044,Kollaammmm pwoliii sanamm
1045,yes
1046,.
1047,"TL,DR : game mechanically is incredibly fun but i don't feel safe playing it
This game has a combat and mobility system that is incredibly fun and refreshing among the bloat of other BR games out there. a rock paper scissor style melee centered around normal, focus, and parry attacks and all the mixups inbetween, leading to mindgames and combo flow that feels satisfying to pull off. coupled with heros that each have a unique tactical abilty and ultimate that can be customized into one of 3 variations per abilty per hero as you play the hero means the way you approach each fight can be unique to the player. 
HOWEVER
I don't know if it's hackers hacking the game itself  or inherent vulnerabilities in the game allowing access to my side of the situation; but I've had steam windows pop up during fights, had my wasd controls reversed on spawn (leading to a ""your files are corrupt repair and relog"" message) only for everything to verify,  had attacks bounce off of someone constantly while they re-apply thier armor powder as if i was hitting a justina gu while they slow-walk around.... I put 46 levels worth of time into the game and it's getting worse with every match.  i'm jumping ship, and you shouldn't hop on."
1048,"So beautiful game ... I have good PC parts but I still cant play with high graphics... So much FPS drops while playing with it. I still enjoy to play with lowest graphics. Perfect game!

1056,"I have two accounts total of 1000+hour on record.

Don't even bother if u located outside of China & South East Asia.

Dev team trend to change this game to spamming focus attack and instant parry. Dagger & nunchucks are unbalanced rn and extremely annoying to play against, if u have latency above 50+ or low fps, u gonna get rekted by dagger&nunchucks spamming BS regular attack combo that root u on ground many times in a row.

No sign for new map and game mode. Player base shrinking drastically."
1057,"Only played a little so far, but the adventure has been fun. Look forward to the evolution of this great game."

1060,"I love this game, its just so so so so so so buggy. I got it for free on GamePass, but bought it on Steam hoping steam would fix how buggy it is but no its actually even worse. Couldn't get though the dam tutorial with out freezing every 2 seconds. An an online match? Forget it its just unplayable I really really want to play as well because the few game I have gotten to play have been super fun but its so buggy. My PC smashes the required specs, divers up to date everything but this game just cripples it. Can Direct X just die please?"
1061,Honestly one of the best Br's i've ever played they don't dive into what pulls for other br's they stay themselves
1062,"it's lagging on multiplayer, even on SEA or EU, even my graphic card is RTX3050, on i9. 
So,  I refund. It's sad, because love the graphics and Asians scene thingy."

1064,My mailbox can't receive anything for no reason...
1065,"Just nope... save your sanity for anything else... Its rly not fun game when you keep matched with Xbox players/ or Asia... pretty fun sadly no way to turn it off... so gl

But well if you decide to play it... go for it its awesome game but the MM is pain...Well gl hf :)"
1066,I dont normally care for battle royal type of games but getting outside of shooter has made this enjoyable for me
1067,fucking balls this game looks good too bad my shitty pc can only play with pixelated potato graphics but the gameplay is fun as hell
1068,"I'm on the East Coast of the US and I don't have any server issues like I've seen in some reviews. 21 hours in, account level 40 and I absolutely love this game. I'm trying to get more of my friends involved and have successfully gotten 4 of them to try it out and play regularly. If you have the Xbox game pass you should definitely try, and to be honest I think the 20 bucks is well worth the fun I've had with this game."
1069,its aight
1070,Good in my opinion in u like martial arts
1071,"do you like knives and big titties? this is the game for you.
MAJOR BOOBA. and did i mention knifes?"

1082,"Enjoyable BR with ninjas, freaking gud!"
1083,"The weapons are very cool, and the combat is seamless and smooth, great graphics as well, overall a fantastic game."
1084,"A Kung-fu inspired, kickass game with a lot of style!

 I love this game. the characters are fun and colorful without going over the top. The weapons are all a thrill to use. It's a great game and the xbox gamepass release was a fantastic idea to buff up those numbers to get some fresh blood in to the bloodbath that is naraka bladepoint! 

I hope this game can go above the ""Battle royale"" heap and show that it has somethign special to offer, whether you're grappling around like attack on titan, sniping your foes from afar, or taking them head on with a giant sword. good stuff."
1085,all the promotional art they use for characters in this game isnt how they actually look when you get them. you have to get really shitty lootboxes if you want them actually look cool. also too many bots in this game. waste of money
1086,focus cancel.
1087,Nice premium game
1088,best game !!!
1089,"LOL

1090,jiggle jiggle
1091,"The game itself is fun and all that, but the crossplay problem is a MAJOR issue. I, like many others, bought this game with the intent of playing with friends, yet that's not possible if they're on Xbox. With the advertisement of crossplay, one would expect the feature to actually work. The worst part is, there's been a whole new update and yet still no mention of resolving this issue. Disappointing."
1092,"Best melee based (there's some ranged weapons too i.e. bows, muskets) battle royal. fast paced intense combat"
1093,"this game is SSD-ist

if u have a bad pc, all u can do is make pretty characters u.u

1097,"All in all a good game, i love the movement. One slight problem, on my second game in i already had some guy curse me out because i was grabbing the wrong stuff, this is a sign to play with a trusted friend or solo."
1098,ok
1099,Nice Game
1100,Ping is a problem for SEA server
1101,"Is just amazing, and very fresh and new, I don't have any complain at the moment, and there a lot of things to do and most important thing ""is not a pay to win game"".

1102,i get my ass beat all the time
1103,nice good game
1104,no
1105,"Pros:
Graphic
Easy combat
You can always get better at the game

Cons:
Lobby a bit laggy (Game still fresh prob will fix it)

Personally I would recommend this game. If you like MMO RPG but don't wanna grind for items and likes pvp. This game is for you. I have a lot of fun while playing it."
1106,good battle royal game
1107,"trios: woopa gangthem style opponents, or be woopa ganged.

duos: i honestly got no friends so i don't ever play this, but i would assume its more for skilled teamwork then trio squads spamming you against a rock to were you should just free your hands and look at the amazing graphics while u are beaten to death.

solo: i see a 6-8 person brawl in the middle of a field so like any fps player i pull out a gun and go bang bang. walked away rich then died shortly after in a 1v1.

this game is 10/10 in my book, and i expect to have hundreds of hours into the future."
1108,this game needs a bit of work  the arena mode main problem  from the button layout to the fighting its a bunch of nonsense would have been better off making this game like elder scrolls online need to be able to block attacks not just pery them  some of the powers are op  the main survival mode is pretty good tho
1109,"meh

1110,AWESOME ACTION FOR CLOSE RANGE COMBAT
1111,good graphics and decent gameplay dont see why you wouldnt get it
1112,"Its alot of fun but the menus are pretty annoying,"
1113,"Dagger, my beloved; How precious you stab my victims. May your sharpness be everlasting and your nerfs forthcoming! Praise Yurang's Rage!"
1114,Awesome game. Combat feels great.
1115,"Purchased on release day and really enjoyed playing, even against the complaints of Chinese players. Been on and off for a while as I just get distracted with other games easily. Pleased to see frequent updates and items/ skins added to the game as well as new weapons (which I never thought would happen) so I appreciate the support for the game and added diversity/ tactics. I'm not a sweaty player but love a good fight whether I win or lose or get close. Me and my random teams have won a good few times and it's a good feeling. Losing is a good learning curve, and I've never raged or complained when losing a fight or a match. I like what the game puts out and stands for; ..Keeps me coming back for the aesthetics of the game and swordplay/ ranged play which I feel is unique to this game. I normally dislike Battle Royale games but this take on it at least lets me enjoy the genre and require an amount of skill and effort doing so. It is a unique and great game in my eyes."
1116,Good
1117,Thumbs down until we see the capability of adding our friends that are on other platforms. Cross play might be there but not being able to add them and play with them makes this of no use to a lot of players. @Devs when can we see this bug fixed?
1118,
1119,"great game. highly recommend.
"
1120,"I think the game is actually really good, the mechanics take a second to learn but are very rewarding to pull off especially in the midst of fighting. It feels so good to be able to take out multiple people in a row especially with friends. I do believe the developers should make the game F2P and sell cosmetics /chests only this would allow far more people to play it and allow people who may be discouraged about the ""skill gap"" to continue grinding to get better. This would also help the ranked system balance more where newer/worse players are in the bronze to silver ranks and the guys who play it all the time are at the top of the leader boards and can actually fill their lobby in a decent time. This game has a ton of potential if the developers listen to the community and focus on the communities wants and needs and not their own. The fighting game style combat is amazing once you learn the basics of juggling counters and feints. Also developers still haven't fixed the ""bug"" that doesn't allow steam to play with xbox yet and THEY NEED to make this a priority to help with player counts as well no one wants to play a battle royal solo all the time. Sometimes I want to play with my friends on xbox and for now I have to use my xbox app on my pc to play with him which sucks because this makes it so I WONT buy skins until this is fixed as I am not going to buy skins on 2 accounts. Beside this ""bug"" everything else is quite enjoyable and may take some time to learn but if you are determined and practice in free training and watch guides you will pick up quick!"
1121,yes
1122,Really fun and interactive combat mechanics
1123,"The gameplay is so diverse with the wide array of weapons available for the characters both ranged and melee. Although, playing melee is so much more fun and complex. A must for people who like battle royale"
1124,W game
1125,god
1126,"Just beware it's a 20€ Game with mobile game-style microtransactions. Lower ranks not populated, but still fun"
1127,It's Warzone with shit controls and shit melee combat. If I didn't have friends that play it I'd have refunded it while I still could.
1128,"combat is good but it can be difficult, the learning curve is real"
1129,"It's a fun yet challenging game. I enjoy this game so much, I also got it for 13$ with the steam sale. I played the EA version and was saddened you had to pay ffor the game but I can see some benefits to this as well as drawbacks however for 13$ I paid it was totally worth it."
1130,"This game is probably one of the best battle royales out there. Totally unique and dynamic, very intuitive, and and full of Chinese culture!"
1131,it is fun....
1132,Good
1133,It s like taking LSD without the good part.
1134,YES
1135,Awesome but please fix crossplay to include steam :(
1136,"amazing, competitive, fun and much better than all the other battle royal's."
1137,Surprisingly my most liked battle royale game
1138,Need friends to play this 09/10
1139,"Its a great game to play to be honest, one of the more engaging battle royales for sure.
Very challenging though, I am still getting schooled more than I am winning, but I am constantly improving at the combat. 

There's actually a lot of mechanics to the combat itself, so it kind of plays out like a fighting game, where different attacks, crouch attacks, uppercuts all outplay other ones. Once you start learning that it goes beyond button mashing it gets enjoyable, and then all kinds of mental games start to make their way into facing your opponents. Parry nowadays seems to most of the time go through so I'm happy with that.

Looking forward to the new map on August 19th. Also hoping that the game goes through even more of a resurgence, there was the Xbox game pass lately, but I'm hoping it picks up even more."
1140,I really the combat gameplay and the grapple system
1141,"good fun time.
"
1142,"Well...*sigh*

Honestly the game is fun when you first pick it up, but that is majorly due to the bots on your game, honestly you barely even notice they are bots, but if you think they are lagging or just low IQ players, they are probably bot.

Now when you actually play the game, HOLY SHIIIIIIT. Chinese...Chinese everywhere, is not a bad thing, but they lag so much!!! The game's performance is also REAAAAAALLY bad, poor optimizations, textures not loading, Stuttering, Server-Side lag, characters walking without animations, you get in to a fight you don't even get hit, you don't understand why, until 3 sec pass and you get attacked out of nowhere and die.

This game is clearly some alpha or Pre-Beta, it's a shit dance, don't buy it unless the price is whatever and you want to play it when it gets better, but if no one plays it now, imagine later...

Veredict: Fun game and concept, but it's another dissapointment (Devs don't give a shit)"
1143,"Mostly playing bots, pretty boring"
1144,"Advertised as Crossplay with PC and XBOX however this does not work. I had to purchase the game a second time. I purchased it on Microsoft XBOX app on PC in order to play with XBOX friends using my PC, it works flawlessly. DON'T BUY THE STEAM VERSION IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH OTHER PLATFORMS!!!"
1145,this game is great set with different weapons  a good and very addictive game
1146,"This game has the most egregious optimization and performance issues I've seen with just about any game. Makes Cyberpunk 2077 look like a polished gem. If you do not own an SSD simply dont purchase it. Even if you do you may have issues. I have a relatively good computer, and can run most games on Ultra with my RTX 2070. This game will straight freeze for me on most encounters with players.

Otherwise a pretty fun game, inventory system is nice and straightforward. Combat is fun enough."
1147,got bored with the game  very quickly
1148,good
1149,It's a Good Game But You Need To Have Sharp Reflexes And Active Mind :P :) The Graphics and Combat are Nicely Done :)
1150,really good
1151,GOOD GAME
1152,"This game is fine but not worth the current price tag, want another melee combat fighting game that is actually worth its current price? for honor is right there"
1153,"Games really good. games really fun if and visualy appealing for new players and the best way i can describe it is a battle royale but with ninjas and shit. however as you climb in rank, the more youre required to understand things like skill canceling combos, movement and grappling movement extensions.. in bronze you probably only face people who throw their abilities at you in random sequence like mortal combat trying to keep you stuck in a corner forever however when you get to silver you see your complacency... watch a twitch stream and youll know what im talking about, theres a lot of that... if you wanna avoid that you can probably never play ranked and just do casual games with bronze MMR. but it can get real stressful trying to overcome the mountainous opponents.."
1154,Hands down best br out to date!!!!!!!
1155,"fast pace and great combat system/ movement system, very fluid"

"
1158,"pros:
rich character customization
exciting fights
spectacular visuals

cons:
dumb matchmaking
lack of players (a lot of bot lobbies)
stupid bots (atleast make them fight you instead of pressing AD)"
1159,i didn't enjoy it ver much
1160, BEST GAME EVER.
1161,yes
1162,some seriously fun pvp. battle mechanics could be a little more fleshed out so you feel like theres a little more but basics are still very fun and challenging.
1163,noice
1164,This should be a free to play game. Get good anti-cheat first! Game looks fun though! Just needs some work.
1165,The nunchucks make the game worth it
1166,It's  the best battle royal
1167,good and fun af
1168,it's a very good battle royale game (not the typical battle royale with guns that always camp and slow paced). It's very good and addicting but the matchmaking feels awful you'll be facing the server's top players even if you're just bronze but i took that as an opportunity to learn their techniques
1169,awesome
1170,垃圾游戏草拟吗
1171,im addicted
1172,many controls and its pay for the game but inside is free to play!
1173,Nice
1174,Incredibly fun team based battle royale. I like that melee combat is preferred over ranged/shooting. The combo system can be both fun and frustrating at times.
1175,haha funny double sword go brrrrrr
1176,addicting
1177,"Really refreshing melee-gameplay for a battle royale. Instead of getting sniped from somewhere across the map, you normally get into a melee battle where skill is involved, next to Drop Luck (as it is always in a BR). 
Yes, drop luck is involved a lot, but also knowing how to play the weapons and Soul Combos you choose, together with your character.
All in all a very enjoyable experience, both alone or in a group with friends."
1178,amazing
1179,Constantly Crashes.
1180,fun
1181,"The game is, at the very least, a decent martial-arts battle royale with a nice variety of weapons and characters. 

Weapons perform the same across different characters, but different characters have one ability and one ultimate, both of which can be changed to a different variation after reaching sufficient level (e.g. a healing beam that heals less, but offers increased damage reduction while active).

I bought this game when it released, but didn't enjoy it; when the game initially dropped there was some BS about being stuck in bot lobbies for a long time before getting to fight actual players, this was fixed at some point so now you can fight players at the lower ranked strata. (which was honestly the reason I didn't play a lot during the first season)"
1182,good
1183,"I have the game installed on an SSD but have a fairly modest system. The game runs well, has a very interesting take on action combat and battle royales and overall ticks all the boxes of what I like to see. Lots of character customization and many game modes. I haven't run into anything that would make me not like the game yet, having a great time."
1184,"great game, at first its hard but then when you learn it, it becomes soo good"
1185,"Pretty fun game if you like battle royales. Movement is smooth and similar to Assassin's Creed and combat is easy to learn; so far I haven't heard anybody be super toxic on there only supportive of the team etc. I recommend giving it a try if you're a fan of the genre. It is definitely more fun if you play it with friends. Only thing is the matchmaking system is a tad slow 1-2 minutes, but if you're a patient person it shouldn't be a big deal....................... Forgot to mention the graphics are stunning and it should perform well on just about any system."
1186,awesome game and nice support as well.
1187,its a great game if your into battle royal up close combat!
1188,"For a wuxia influenced game, it is extremely limited in its play scope (PvP only), and hence, limited player pull. Gaming wise, long waiting time (on average 2 min plus), player level disparity, above average graphics (barely), and a leaving a bitter taste of not-quite-there blue balls dis-satisfaction.

Basically, this is a PvP game with elements of character mods and dress-up (also very limited - color change on most outfits), not much different from android games like PUBG and COD Warzone."
1189,"3/10 game, 10/10 character creator"
1190,"yes
"
1191,"First of all, I would like to address the elephant in the room. 

YES, this game DOES have an issue with matchmaking and ping. Having played for 120+ Hours since September of 2021 - it has gotten a little better with the addition of crossplay, I'm personally just waiting for the Playstation Release to help alleviate numbers. 

However, the mechanics are mostly smooth and REALLY fun to play with. If you're prone to getting angry, or are expecting the learning curve to be easy - no, this game is not for you. 

One of the main downsides though is sadly the cosmetic/loot-crate system. 

As a player who is always keen to unlock all the drip for my big bitty girls - it was disappointing to see that not ONLY is this game Pay to Play, and not ONLY does it have a loot-box mechanic, but ONE SKIN can run you $10, sometimes even $20-30 depending on what pack or skin you want. 

This is one of the most greedy systems for microtransactions I have ever seen. The skins are not disappointing by any means, and you can get these loot-boxes for free with a little work, however this - as with all loot-crates, require a certain degree of luck - AND the duplicate issue is...bad to say the least. 

Overall, 

The game has some teething issues. The mechanics are fun to learn and play, and it is worth the $20 to spend. However, if you are prone to getting angry, this game is NOT for you. If you are looking for a smooth experience like Apex, Warzone or any other established BR - this game is NOT for you right now. 

The microtransaction mechanics are downright extortionate, so if you are a fan of unlocking skins without paying money...well, good luck to you. I sure as hell don't have that privilege. 

Now if you excuse me, I'll be buying 45 cent ramen noodles while looking at big ol bitties."
1192,"During your first games, you will probably encounter many [b]bots[/b]. Don't worry, this will change as you play more. Eventually, you'll exclusively be playing against real players.
The game also has many different [b]features[/b], such as souljades, brass bells, praying to statues, wishing wells, cave keys, rift dealers, morus's blessings, toxishrooms, prickly pears, dandelions...
This can make the game seem [b]overwhelming[/b] at first.

The game is actually very good! The [b]art style[/b] is cool, the [b]weapons[/b] are also quite cool and the [b]gameplay[/b] is fun.
The [b]characters[/b] are cool, although way too [b]sexualized[/b] in my opinion.

The game also has plenty of [b]quests[/b] and [b]rewards[/b] to keep it interesting! Although the way you can view these quests and collect the rewards is [b]unorganized[/b] and [b]chaotic[/b].

Another mildly frustrating thing is that this game has lots of [b]unobtainable skins, icons, emotes etc.[/b], and there is no way to hide these.

And my last critique is that the game is [b]not completely balanced[/b]. Some characters and weapons should definitely receive huge nerfs, in my opinion.

Overall, I do very much recommend giving this game a chance.
"
1193,nice!!!!!!!
1194,"I love this game very much and playing it with friends makes this game so much more fun, though if you'd want to play this game you would have to deal with its connection issues at the beginning of the game, for me it takes at least 1-2 minutes occasionally little fps drops here n there other than that i cant find a reason to dislike this game the combat in this game is very fun to play around with despite its simple explanation with vertical and horizontal combo attacks you can implement them into your combos to get some crazy attacks and the mobility imo is really good, with its on grappling mechanic it makes running away much harder and chasing much easier, overall i love this game i think for its price its worth it."
1195,fun and difficult game
1196,"I do not recommend purchasing this game if you are in the SA or OCE region.
SA/OCE have no servers we operate off nodes that match for our local server for 5min then region server 5min+.

Game is infested with bots, thought the xbox release would revive the playerbase but somehow they have managed to not get Xbox players to connect to the nodes and have been silent about resolving this.

As much as I enjoy the gameplay and fighting based BR this game is absolutely dead in SA/OCE regions.
Opinion may change when crossplay is resolved but have had 0 coms over the past 2 weeks since release."
1197,The Best Action
1198,"Okay, there's a lot to unpack here. I love this game as a BR. Players with severe time differences need to be region locked because they lag and in melee combat that is an advantage. The skill curve is there and i like it, However there are.... certain characters who are a little more OP than others for example: the monk who has a transformation for his ult, Any character that has a transformation is OP due to the massive health gain. If you see them.... Run. I give this game a solid 6/10 because the Devs dont listen to their community and are only worried about over-priced skins on some really hot character models. If you like melee BR its worth the 20$ and loads of fun. The movement kind of plays like bloodhunt key words: kind of. The grapple hook dodging and jumping make combat fun charges light and heady mix ins and timed parries are punishing as they make the other player drop the weapon they were attacking with. If the Devs cared about the quality of live i'd give this game an 8/10 because its a BR with no story. Very fun, a few QOL issues."
1199,"Coming from ranked wow arena pvp, I had never played anything like this before.  I love it!  The fast paced action pvp... SO GOOD!"
1200,This game made me buy an ssd
1201,Please region lock the players.
1202,"I really enjoy this game is so promising. Love that you are able to customize most of your heroes, and the rewards are sweet. The movement is amazing, i love the survival aspect."
1203,great !!!
1204,Expensive cosmetics but gameplay is good. 5 stars!
1205,worth
1206,just a very nice change of pace from fps.
1207,Best Battle Royale I've picked up in a long time.
1208,"Very fun. combat feels good. Customizations galore. 

EDIT: having played more of the game id give it an 7.5/10. It is a great game. You will have fun, your friends will have fun no doubt. kills feel good, combat is rewarding. This game has one of if not THE best pacing of any of the battle royales. I choose to get into fights constantly and that's made easier by the ""Bounty"" quests available mid match giving you a delayed location of a player. Definitely worth the money especially if on sale."
1209,i would say this game is dog sh*t but that would be an insult to dog sh*t
1210,.
1211,the next LOL
1212,"The game is simple, yet fun. Best combo."
1213,this game is pretty fun
1214,"New game, same BR concept. game is fun, but the cosmetic loot costs way to much."

1223,my favorite BR right now and its not even close

1225,"Absolutely hectic fun. There is a lot this game doesn't tell you however when you figure out the learning curve it is a blast. 
Feels great when you slap a weapon out of the enemy's hand, pick it up then kill them with their own weapon. Solid 8.5/10. 

Tip: Time your parry with the red light not the connection of weapons."
1226,"i mean take out the great sword and the titan call bald head and its a good game, but i don't think they are gonna do that so guess we just gotta deal with the little cross server slants sweats"
1227,Dead ass one of teh best games ive played (also hehe 69)
1228,tis good
1229,"8/10
love this game. feel like it needs some work but its awesome as is"
1230,"as someone who started PC gaming later in life, I definitely felt the lack of experience in any kind of FPS games on the PC especially those with bigger names and branding. smt about Naraka just felt right and usually i would never pay for games that involve PVP because I know I'll just suck and sulk. However the character designs and the gameplay immediately attracted me and I am glad it's been everything I thought it would be! I even got 4 kills on my first play (I've been playing Apex the past 3 months and I only got my first kill a few weeks ago) Definitely a unique game that has its own originality, just hoping that as the game grows that it will not be too harsh on baby players like myself... GET IT! SUPER WORTH AND THE FEMALE CHARACTERS ARE SO HOT"
1231,"Needs to be optimized, but stellar game overall!"
1232,This is a fun game until you go against controller players and you can't turn off crossplatform either. They have the option to turn off crossplatform ONLY for xbox players. They still haven't bothered to add that option in the game which sucks a lot. Hopefully they fix that soon
1233,"This is an amazing game, well polishes combat mechanics! One game for the competitive spirit!"
1234,"really wished they made a single player game with the same fighting mechanics, or an mmo or something else. BRs are in the decline but this game has so much personality"
1235,oo
1236,"W GAME ITS SO FUCKING FUN LOO]
"
1237,"The game is amazing and all i hoped for but, the queuing times for my region are very bad i have to wait up to 30 minutes just to get into a game sometimes. Make sure to install it on an SSD instead of your HD for less frame drops and better performance overall. Overall the game is great and i recommend buying it."

1239,fun but not fun
1240,I play it for them big plots
1241,Cool
1242,"leads to malware
"
1243,"Super cool game and really easy to grasp. Balanced fighting with opportunity to easily snowball or retaliate. In my opinion, this is the only battle royale where being seen first doesn't always result in your death. Fights are won by who has more skill (and sometimes luck). Also, for those who kinda suck and know it, there is a mode where you can play entirely against bots. Bots are pretty cool too because not all of em are total pushovers. Also there is a free-for-all mode for like 16 players or something that is essentially a death match with unlimited revives and highest score wins. Couple other game modes that are dope too. My favorite is the weekend tournaments where 16 players are bracketed and fight 1v1 best of 3. All in all, pretty sweet game that can be played with or without friends. Also, supports controller. No advantage for keyboard or controller both are pretty even."
1244,So fun and replaces my life on Valorant !!!
1245,"For starters...  your game is very poorly optimized, its pitiful. If you're making all this money from players how about using it towards making your game playable, enjoyable and transition between screens smoothly. Other than that game is fun and great to play when you don't run into the annoying lag spikes initially starting a match or it giving you an error that ""your game files are corrupted"" when on the same day the files integrity were verified."
1246,"I would love to love this game. The graphics are incredible and the gameplay is pretty damn smooth. It's super easy to pick up, the shield/health system is super intuitive. The combat is immaculate. 

Unfortunately, after your first couple ""PVP"" games (where the game literally tells you a majority of the players are bots so you can get used to gameplay), it starts matching you with real people. This is where the biggest issue with this game arises. Those ""real people"" don't exist in N/S American or European servers. Regardless of solo, duo, or trio mode, you will wait 10 minutes to find a match. This is not an exaggeration. To play a PVP match, you must join the China server during peak playtime. That is not to mention the 200+ ping you will experience as an American on this server. 

This is a travesty. The game is absolutely amazing, but no one on the western hemisphere plays it, so you'll never find a game."
1247,I dunno fo fuckin parry correctly. 0/10
1248,"The game is fun at first, but after a while you start to realize the matchmaking is HEAVILY unbalanced, especially in ranked where you'll run into teams being carried by high ranked players. I have no clue why this is a thing and why there's no limits as to who you can queue ranked with. Changed my opinion from ""A great BR game"" to ""A BR game that could be good if the matchmaking wasn't so fucked""."
1249,"those graphics are the best, the pvp takes a lot of focus. can die easily if ur not paying attention to everything

"
1250,"Challenging but accessible, Beautiful graphics, rewarding game play - I would give this a 7/10 as is...it would lose points for a Pay to Earn store...but thats become the norm in these types of games. at least the unlockables are mostly aesthetic."
1251,They won't fix their friending issues. I got this game thinking I would be able to play with my xbox and pc friends but no they let such a game breaking bug persist. Once you fix this bug I will then reccomend it to other players.
1252,BEST GAME EVER I LOVE IT
1253,i'm bad at aiming that's why i'm here
1254,It's an okay game. They got lots of work to do especially in terms of waiting time
1255,Very fun game. The skill floor is low yet the skill celling is high. I see myself playing this and trying to improve.

1267,"dont recommend to get this if you dont have alot of storage on your computer, itll lag and crash, im still dealing with that"
1268,"Ok, so my first exposure to Naraka was on XBox PC game pass because it was free.  After playing for several hours and enjoying the hell out of it, I then realized that I only took advantage of the 3 months of game pass for a $1.00 and have since cancelled and do not plan on renewing, I knew I had to get it on Steam.  Prior to my purchase however there was a little reluctance due to the lag and sometimes un-playability of the game on XBox.  I figured for $13.oo I'd give it a shot on Steam because it was that impressive.  Great decision!  The lag on Steam is very minimal compared to XBox and it is ONLY the first like 10 seconds after zoning in, then it's butter.  For those of you on the fence just grab it.  Better experience than XBox and from what I see, the developers are finally coming back to this title and starting to invest more time and attention. A+ Thumbs up! Would buy again.  and again.                         (BTW - the folks saying it's all bots . . . . RTFM!)"
1269,"Great game, Basically fortnite but advanced"
1270,"love it even with all the try hard's games a blast,9/10"
1271,"This game is very bad, graphics are nice and good looking but the mechanics are weird af and harder than my weiner i wouldnt really recommend it."
1272,Not Crossplay so why the fuck am i facing people on console
1273,Fun Game
1274,"[h1]The game is not worth the price tag, it should be a free to play game. [/h1]
Let me elaborate:

1) Basic bare bones combat
I was expecting something like Shadow Arena with several very distinct skills and playstyles per class. Here all you can do is light attack, strong attack, parry, block, roll, hook, dodge, a skill and an ultimate; just the basics. Lame. If you're going to be doing a melee battle royale, the combat better be at least action MMO tier. 

2) Terribly optimized 
For the level of meh graphics on offer, the game runs pretty poorly. 

3) Bots 
There are bots everywhere and it completely sucks the fun out of the game. If I wanted to farm some bots, I would just play some stupid cash grab MMO. 

4) Grind
You're going to have to grind to unlock about half the heroes, cosmetic items, glyphs, etc. It isn't a short grind either. 

All in all, I would have liked to refund the game before exceeding 2 hours of play time but Stockholm syndrome caught hold of me and I couldn't help but play some more to see if it's any good. It's not that good, 6/10 at best. I'll probably continue playing for a bit more, maybe every now and then, but I would not recommend it."
1275,hay
1276,The game requires you to put it on a SSD if you even want to have any fun at all and even if you do that it's a very unbalanced game with OP characters that will just stomp on you in seconds.
1277,The lag spike in this game are on another level like seriously what the hell. Get this shit fixed and it will actually be the game that we want it to be. I have had to stop recommending this game to people because of the stupid ass lag spikes.
1278,"No more running around, collecting loot for 15 minutes just to get one shot by a sniper from 2 km away. Combat is super fun and daily missions/activities can keep you playing for the whole day."
1279,"Game itself is not bad, performance could be better, lacks some video and other setting features, the BIGGEST downfall of this game is mm time, you can only play ranked and that itself takes up to 10 or more min to get into a match while other modes are dead, otherwise the game offers interesting hand to hand combat in BR game, wouldn't recommend this game, had to refund after less than 2h of playtime"
1280,fgffg
1281,!
1282,"Coming back to this game after taking a break after the 2nd month release.  These are my thoughts.

Typical battle royal loot tier system but the combat is the selling point (Think FortNite Loot).  You are rewarded for playing offensively vs turtling or running away in most other games.  Which is way more fun.  Think about how fun classic WoW pvp is vs playing WoW 2022 arena where you have to blow through every defensive CD to kill instead.  zzZZzzz..

There is a learning curve but spending 20-30 min practicing will greatly improve your results in game.  Like many fighting games there are combos and mastering them is very satisfying.  This game has a very anime style battle feel to it where you can have a great impact in the game by being skillful.  Fighting multiple opponents is common and you will get cheezed more often than you clutch but that's what makes those moments where you outplay multiple people feel so special because you spent that time training.

I've had a lot of moments where a battle can feel like a movie.  Right now its on sale for $13 but its normally $20.  I don't agree with the sentiment that this game needs to go free to play because every game that does it is rife with hackers & cheaters.  

If you can't afford a $20 buy in then you really shouldn't be playing video games.

Finally I wanted to add that they've added a lot of content to the game since release; 3 more heroes and 2 new weapons.  They balanced the souljades and added map features that add more dynamic to the game such has anti ult zones, map/terrain improvements, more game modes (duo queue!) than simply battle royal.  More heroes now have defensive cd's that can intterupt combo chains and allow you a fighting chance vs being beaten down from 100% life to 0% without the ability to fight back.

This game has changed a lot since release and if you're curious to try again I highly encourage it.  Also playing with friends is much more fun than playing alone.  Naraka is also very entertaining to watch (especially on twitch!).  Don't let the negative reviews lead you astray.  I've had a lot of fun for a small $20 investment as there is no p2w only pay for cool cosmetics."

1297,"I won my first 2 games cause it was all bots. What a waste of time.

Edit: I played 2 more games...still all bots and I won both. 

Also the menus are like those gatcha games. Filled with events, daily logins, microtransactions. 

The gameplay is pretty fun. But man is wading through everything else kinda meh."
1298,Game is very fun and technical 1000/10 would play over and over again.
1299,ok
1300,great game but need a lot of improvement to and some of skins is overprices
1301,"[h1] Pros [/h1]

- Unique battle royale (at lest I didn't see a BR with melee)
- Addictive, deep, and challenging gameplay
- High skill celling
- Many cool characters, each with unique skills
- Impressive character customization, and by impressive I mean that you can make almost anything you want . Shrek, Ninja Turtle, Khajiit, Squidward, Jocker? Hell heah!
- You can get good skins just by playing

[h1] Cons [/h1]

- If you don't have an SSD, then forget about comfort gameplay. The game is lagging as hell in the beggining of every match. And nothing else but a SSD will fix it. Devs even say it on the title screen when you first run the game
- Often waiting for matches to find takes 2-5 minutes"
1302,Kung fu treachery
1303,:)
1304,Underrated and slept on game... glad its getting more recognition now even though its mostly gamepass kids but def worth the price. You're tripping to not have this game in your library for 15 beans
1305,This is the Battle Royale if I was born for.
1306,very fun so far i love the fluid motion and the feel of the combat usually hate battle royals but this feels so much more dynamic feels much more fun to me
1307,nice game
1308,Loved it
1309,fire
1310,fk it do not buy it not worth the dlc also u cant link ur accounts no cross play just lagg all time trash
1311,I just asked for a refund for this game. Despite surpassing the minimum requirements this runs terribly. Unless you know you have a very high end pc do not purchase this game
1312,Noiceee game
1313,love the game
1314,i have so match faun its new for me to playing game like this <3
1315,Just amazing
1316,"Runs really poorly. I may not have the best systems in the world, but I have gtx 1070, i7 and 24 ram. if I can't run it, then the average pc I likely can't either. That's just not good enough. Needs a huge amount of optimizations to be worthwhile.

Could you play it like this? Yes, but there's sudden stutters from time to time. That's just too annoying for me to stick with."
1317,"I bought this game just looking for a new game to buy and play for when I'm bored, and was pleasantly surprised. This game brings a unique twist to the battle royal gamemode and I think executes it very well. The combat system is well thought out and each characters unique abilities just has you wanting to play and experience more. Overall a super fun, chill, relaxing game (aslong as you dont take it too seriously), and I definitely recommend it!"
1318,"TL;DR: Sekiro/Dark Souls/Ghost of Tsushima, but 60 ppl multiplayer battle royale instead of boss-fighting.

This is a very unique Battle Royale game. Melee weapons instead of guns = no camping and non-stop action. Combat system is simple and intuitive yet provides very high skill ceiling. Grappling hooks and parkour provide insane mobility not only for map travelling, but also in-combat. Beautiful scenery and architecture with red and gold leafed trees, pagodas, temples and so on straight from Wuxia/Xuanhuan Chinese fantasy. Non-cartoonish color palette and visual style, highly aesthetical character design and combat choreography. Basically complete opposite of games like Apex Legends, PUBG and Fornite.

I believe for anyone who prefers melee combat to modern warfare and also for those who prefer Asian character design to Western, Naraka is by far the best Battle Royale game on the market and it's easily worth every penny of its price even if you buy Ultimate Edition. For those who are more or less OK with existing battle royale shooters and don't accept buy-to-play model for BR in the age when Apex and even PUBG are FTP — well, Naraka was clearly not meant for you."
1319,"RIDICULOUS. AT THE END OF QUICK TUTORIALS, YOU ARE ASKED TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT NAME. I HAVE SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR TRYING TO PUT AN ACCOUNT NAME BUT EVERYTHING SAYS 'MUST CONTAIN SPECIAL CHARACTERS' WHICH I HAD FOR AT LEAST 100 TRIES."

1341,"Here is my review of the game after almost 1k hours playing.

Pros:
- Fun to play if you have friends
- An unique feel to the BR genre
- Obama and Shrek is in the game


Cons:
- China Nr.1
- Unenjoyable when you play solo
- getting stuck on non-existing structures and obstacles
- Counter/Parry works but only if the game feels like it
- Be the third party or enjoy being third partied
- Optimization is non-existing
- Don't feel happy when you kill someone, cuz it's a bot
- 2v1 is gg
- winning early fights feels unrewarded
- Coin toss on spawn location
- Not enough trees and obstacles
- Queue simulator is included
- Lagg switch is a thing
- Game uses a talent system which is a handicap for new players
- Don't let the 20€ price tag fool you of this game! You still need a RTX 9080ti to run it properly
- Super populated, however this is only the case if it was CN servers
- Best place to learn foreign languages when in pre-lobby (only if your voice chat options are enabled)
- Start game -> Win game -> Get 20+ kills -> get +1 point on your rank 🙂
- Insane balanced characters. Source: ""Trust me bro""
- Sticky keys???
- Game is sus

Do I recommend this game? Yes absolutely. Play Greatsword and you will be fine 🙃"

1355,I have a strong burning passion of hate for this game I bought it for 10$ I can handle some pretty challenging games but this is absolutely broken I've been top 20 in my state for a character I play so I know I'm decent maybe it's partially just me but this game pisses me off more then any other game I have ever played buy on sale if you really want it's beautiful and a fun game but there's one thing and that is the combat it ruins it some of it's cool but the blocking and follow up combos are bad they stun you if you do it right you can make it so your opponent can't even get a single hit on you I know cause I have or you can try blocking and not block a single attack no matter how you time it the combat is so utterly broken it ruins the game experience I've ruined others and they have ruined mine I put a hole in my wall my knuckles have never bled so much I got my 10$ worth I suppose I had some fun but there were a lot of times where it was horrible so until they balance out the game because some weapons are way too OP especially that one dagger skill until they fix the combat in general and nerf some stuff I can't recommend this game to anyone.
1356,Love the combat system on here :)
1357,"Puts a spin on battle royale. Extremely beautiful close combat graphics, movement and is much more strategic than usually 1-3 shots to kill Battle Royales"
1358,great game
1359,GOOD
1360,"10/10
AMAZIN"
1361,"Can't run worth a damn, don't buy it, Please stay away from this."
1362,"the game is great, i feel its best played with friends so if any of you new players need someone to play with add me, oh and be sure to use my partner code chep6mn4ka"
1363,"I really like this game, but i wish the developers would put a little more money into advertising. it was super popular but fell off quickly because they didnt put it out there. a game like this needs lots of players. please consider trying to  get more people in on the game"
1364,"good
"
1365,"Purchased the game with DLC.  It was only okay and in multiplayer it puts you against bots for first two hours until you can no longer refund which was a big warning, so I refunded the game with DLC and purchased the base game.  Upon running the game it said I needed the DLC or I could press a non-existent delete data button to remove the DLC association to my account.  With that I uninstalled the game and went through to delete any remaining files.  After reinstalling the same issue occurred I provided screenshots and details to Naraka: Bladepoint game support.  There response was as follows: 'About your issue, please purchase the corresponding DLC to enter the game~'.  Fucking terrible support.  Wasn't even that fun of a game so already wasted too much time on it.  Would not recommend."
1366,"I enjoy this game a lot, game play is all around fun and even though it is a battle royal, it is unique as it doesn't follow the grab a gun and shoot everything you see that other battle royal do. The combat features 7 ranged and melee weapons. Along with that it has 12 different characters to choose from, all of which are customizable from cosmetics to gameplay. Movement features a grapple hook and the ability to climb just about any wall or surface without annoying functions like a stamina bar for climbing or attempting to restrict you in a way. A good way to sum it up is that fighting in game is easy to learn, hard to master.

Devs also treat players like people and NOT like walking wallets to take money from every chance they get, everything that can be purchased is purely cosmetic, but you still have the ability to earn those same cosmetics just by playing the game. Not to mention they give out large cash prizes for doing tasks that support the game like competing to make in depth guides for the game and characters.
In summary, the game is good, and the people behind it are great. I 100% recommend to buy and try out.
"
1367,"Great game, not just a button smashing game."
1368,"cancer game full of bots, i advice to avoid this crap game"
1369,good game
1370,woooooo yeah baby
1371,"Nice and fun
"
1372,Amazing game.
1373,Great game with great combat
1374,good
1375,do not download if you are actually into small mechanics of a fighting game not for you...has zero depth and inconsistant asf
1376,play this game u wont regret it
1377,ppl kill eachother with funni abilities and funni guns and swords
1378,"I like the game a lot, honestly a very great game, nice chracther design, nice voiceovers, but there is some problems that i have to talk about.

First of all, there is a pretty big problem with oce and asia playerbase (not cn server).It would take average 10-30 minutes for me to find a match in quick match and also ranked. For me its way too much time, it should be around 0-5 minutes.

Secondly, the premium currency of the game is a little bit too high. this game is a paid game, at least for now. I think that they should lower the price of yellow cosmetics from 1700-1500, so that if we buy the 3000 gold bundle we will be able to buy 2 yellow accessories. I am sure that people will make more purchase this way.

I cant say anything about the gameplay since it is the first melee based BR game in the market, nothing i can compare with."
1379,这游戏是真的超好玩的！超推荐！
1380,"The biggest complaint that i have is that this game asked me to disable windows security - core isolation - Memory integrity for it just to run. Which is suspicious by itself and should never be done unless ran in a Virtual Machine so you keep your main machine safe if you really want to play this that badly. 

They even have a help page showing you what to do so they are very aware of this ""problem"". The only ""problem"" is this game itself and the intention this dev has for your machine.

My recommendation is to not even bother. No game should ask you to turn off security settings."
1381,This game runs like absolute shit.
1382,good
1383,It's a good combat game just needs more characters and more modes.
1384,"Servers are no longer potatoes and the queue times are short... Naraka was nearly unplayable at launch but now it runs smooth, 10/10"
1385,This is a good game.
1386,"nice game & good gameplay.
1 of the best battle royale that is not copycats."
1387,nice
1388,"amazing BR game, combat is fresh and different. Love it!!!"
1389,fun game
1390,"This game is great. It's fast-paced, has great combat, and the monetization centers largely around cosmetics.
I'm quite surprised this is so good. It's an intriguing blend of Warzone and Black Desert."
1391,good game
1392,"its not a casual game. im having to dedicate time to learn combos and movement mechanics (which the game doesnt tell you, you have to talk with other players) in order to at least get w win once in awhile or place Top 5.  Its incredibly hard; it plays more like an arcade-style fighting game than what i anticipated.  still a rush though, id recommend people try it."
1393,cool game.....a lot of chinese cheaters!
1394,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
1395,Very fun action pack battle royale game
1396,great game!!
1397,"Game has huge potential but stinks all over, is somewhat pay to win, can buy weapons that give better abilities.. Lag central fest, includes more lag central fest now that console is also in the lobby with pc.. So many pixel bugs, oh his next to u but on a slightly higher ground, oh well cant hit... I dont recommend it, cuz it will cause head ache and annoyance only from the bugs mentioned above.. Without them it would have been a lot better. As is right now I cant recommend this piece of shit gmae!"
1398,make me adictive
1399,"Amazing game, other than some server issues genuinely one of the best games i've ever played."
1400,"would have recommended the game if there shitty ass update didn't take my entire account and reset it. such a shitty company
"
1401,is good is fun
1402,"Actually quite enjoyable

Bought it thinking that me and my friends would return this game. But surprisingly it was a great experience. Playing from the NA server, I have a ping range of about 40ms to 80ms, occasionally spiking to over 200ms, however it doesn't really effect the game play.

Pros: Great graphics, fluid combos, satisfying abilities and possible parries. 

Cons: Have a limited play window before everything goes wrong. You would usually want to play around 2pm to 9pm. That is when the server belongs to the NA players. However, the moment it does into 10pm. All the CN monsters awake, and your ping will spike hard. 
I am not sure why they would prioritize the amount of players from a regions ping compared to the supposed region. Like if I'm from NA I should always have around 60ms, not altered because some people from other regions want to play in my region. It really doesn't make any sense. Like if CN players come to NA they should always have over 200ms."
1403,"Good and fun Battle royale for those who are over the super saturated shooter genre. The customization is incredible, all of the skins for weapons and characters are nice, and to be able to unlock actual talents through gaining levels just adds fuel to the fire. Very solid game with a lot to offer."
1404,Way more fun than I thought it would be. My buddy bought it for me and it's a blast.
1405,ITs good
1406,"Probably the only Battle Royal game that's actually good. Very easy to play, very difficult to master. If you ever wanted to play a fighting genre game in a Battle Royal setting, this is definitely for you."
1407,FALSE ADVERTISING NOT ACTUALLY CROSS PLAY GAME HAS MASSIVE CRASHING PROBLEMS FUCK THE DEVS
1408,nice game but the moment you get higher you start having ppl from other country who keep teleporting left and right and hit you 5 sec beofre you actually see it
1409,"This fun, score this game 7.5/10 for me.
and price for random box is expensive for 1 roll."
1410,this game is so cool broh i want this game again
1411,best battle royale rn
1412,"Known about the game because it was going to be free on Game Pass, saw some gameplays and risked to buy it so i can have a few weeks extra to play and level up. So, the game pass arrived with some bad news. There will be crossplay but you cannot add any friend who's not from Steam. So i cannot play with my lvled characters with my friends. The game got me from the beggining. The character customization is incredible. And battles are balanced. Would recommend!"
1413,nice
1414,WTF whhy my account blocked? I sent email but no one repsonse me. Bad customer service. Waste of my money
1415,Not enough. need more time to review.
1416,pog weeb br
1417,best ever
1418,"I've refunded the game. I came late, expecting to be overwhelmed with sweats. The tutorial was ok - despite it not really explaining the battle royale aspect of the game. I then ventured onto Quick Game with friends, where we won instantly. After that, we played ranked mode twice, which we also won very quickly. It seems the game is overrun by bots, even on the ranked mode. I understand that the higher rank we are, the less bots. However, I will not risk losing my refund on the possibility this game might be fun when encountering other players. 

Furthermore, it was very difficult to see if you've taken or dealt damage as there is no weight to the attacks. It feels like an MMO turned into a BR as an afterthought.

If this game allowed the party to queue botless, I might have given it more time."
1419,Booba
1420,fun asf
1421,"I am a 38 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 9 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1422,If this game can do more map and do another mmorpg are very nice
1423,The game graphics very nice. I love martial art games. Very recommend this game to whose love martial arts style kinda BR games and others. :)
1424,10/10 would recommend. Under rated game
1425,Fun game
1426,“好振，秀起来”
1427,Good
1428,it very very nice
1429,This game is a lot of fun! I recommend if you are interested in more of a fantasy type battle royal!
1430,i enjoy the game
1431,"i mean its alright

1432,"Hehe, Japanese women with Jiggly Boobies? Thumbs up from me :3"

1435,nhan vat vu to
1436,"Now it's on xbox game pass so you can try it out if you already have the pass.

COMBAT: Massive potential for the combat, but as of right now it feels just a bit off. The game may seem almost clunky because you have to be VERY deliberate with your inputs. Ultimately rock, paper, scissor combat. Figure it out from there. Dodge/Stamina, you know the drill.

UI: There are so many little things in the menu to check and click on. A whole host of notifications. Guaranteed updates incoming.

Recommended for someone looking for a new style of battle royale. Got it on sale so I'm ok with the purchase. My initial review was like ""wtf is this combat"" because the buffers created a learning curve. Most games don't need you to be that deliberate. Still think this game, however, needs a good deal of combat tweaks.

If you end up having trouble with this game, try changing the combat settings to your liking. There are a fair amount of options for movement/climbing as well.

"
1437,"old review: had pc requirements and yet the game couldnt run properly
new review: its really good, took some effort to make it work. and now its one of my favorite games"
1438,IT'S REALLY FUN =)))
1439,"great combat
great abilities 
great traversal 

-early games felt to populated with bots  ?
- not free 2 play population ?  
-chinese game with china as main market ? 
-update frequency ?"
1440,"A very refreshing game in the genre, having so much fun in it, the weapon fighting styles are diverse, the graphics are stunning, this is the first game where I actually could make myself in the character customization, the skins are remarkably unique. Actually You can easily get used to the game, but harder to master. I really REALLY recommend it. 

Definitely gonna support it and play it for a long term.

9.5/10"
1441,"good.

1442,Naraka: BladePoint revived Battle Royales!!!! Been on this no stop since purchase.
1443,simply amazing. love crushing xbox kids
1444,FUN GAME
1445,really fun the game is a true fighter battle royale 2 genres i really enjoy. The skill gap helps you beat those players that you are suppose to but makes the game enjoyable because there is no spam
1446,a work of art
1447,"If you are looking for something like this
[/] Melee combat 
[/] Multiplayer
[/] Beautiful graphic 
[/] Very detailed costume 
This is that game you are looking for. 

This game is friendly for new player the game will put Bot to help you quickly understand how to play. 
However, to master this game you still need to practice some combo and learn how to play each weapon.
From my 135 hr experience, I have no problem with skilled player or buggy things.

1448,sehr geiles game!
1449,Nice to play
1450,couldn't find a gay..
1451,Fun game but was too broke so refund :D
1452,main la bodo
1453,"good game, but you have to wait 15 min to get a rank match"
1454,good
1455,Good shit
1456,p
1457,"Rabish game  crashes and  pure laggy , my pc i can play almost any game ?  this will be the garbage  game , never should've bought it , even they fix it still garbage game ,  reload sucks running out emmo  can not pick enought items its fukking bullshiite game?"
1458,Only here because of disguised toast lol but the game is pretty fun. The movement mechanics could use some fine tuning and some other things as well. Overall fun
1459,"Nice to meet you guys, if you're hesitant to buy this game don't be it's a really fun game and the pvp feels free and fluent I really love the combat and characters ofc this game isn't for everyone but I suggest you give it a shot and have some fun testing out what weapons or characters you really enjoy to play with. Thanks for reading this hope it helps :P"
1460,"Graphics are great, playstyle is fun, and it's difficult enough to keep me wanting to get better."
1461,Weapons can get disarmed and leave you completely useless in a fight even when you are winning the fight to begin with. Also whole game feels like a gacha game.
1462,its a veerry fun battle royale game
1463,gud
1464,pretty fun! I wish I was actually good lol but very fun and exciting game!!
1465,"Another game with so many technical issues I had refund it before I even got a chance to play.

I bought this game while it was on sale because maximillian dood did a sponsored streamd and it seemed like a really fun time. After downloading to a regular hard drive I see a notice saying that the game needs to occupy my precious SSD space in order to run good. Slightly annoyed I clear some room and get the game moved over only for it to crash on the main menu several times it literally will not go past the click to start screen."
1466,"Pros: Overall fun game
Cons: If you don't like the game at the start, don't expect improvement. 1 year in the making, everything that is broken still in the game.
Developers loves Tarka Ji & Matari 
Every characters gets nerfed when they are performing well except for these 2.
Tarka Ji : Infinite Juggle, Uppercut OTK even when you are legend armor and full hp.
Matari: Literally if you know how to play this, is close to impossible to catch her in solo. Developers buff her further despite that."
1467,"Have been enjoying this game very much, would recommend if you like battle royale but something different..."
1468,fun game tbh but buying it on steam dosen't let you add xbox or ps friends so that sucks .
1469,its good
1470,"The good
-Incredibly fun and addictive gameplay, melee combat in a battle royale feels refreshing and fits right in.
-There's a good selection of champions, each with their own unique set of abilities and progression, as well as a good variety of weapons (melee and ranged).
-Multiple fun game modes.
-Crossplay with Xbox.

The meh
-In-game monetization is a bit too aggressive Imo, with battle pass, loot boxes, and premium currency, though micro payments are for cosmetic items only. Usually this wouldn't be something I would complain about if the game was Free to Play.
-The game can feel a bit laggy at times due to the lack of servers in SA and OCE."
1471,"Very impressive, like i'm a ninja!"
1472,nice
1473,"It's the best Battle Royale out. If you like fighting games or MOBAS, this is for you.

EDIT: Year 2 is kicking off AMAZINGLY. The new map is awesome. The new menu i SPECTACULAR. This is really a dreamlike game to me. It feels so good to play, and it is very exciting in-game. So many moments that just blow my mind in each match that I play. I wish there was a way to watch my replays. I thought that there was..."
1474,best game ever made
1475,"BR But Different in a way, Some will like it some wont."
1476,Much better than the brainless crackhead FPS craze everyone has been riding for two decades
1477,Super fun twist on battle royales i really like the melee combat even though the abilities can feel a bit unfair at times
1478,"Just starting to get the hang of this game and man it is a ton of fun. Great take on the battle royal genre. First starting out I was against a bunch of bots (which was fine since i was still learning how to play), but once you get to around lvl 8-10 or start ranked matches, the bots seem to go away. Only thing I'm not a fan of (with almost all battle royal games) is the loot box/ season pass loot system but it's not necessary for anything except cosmetics. Overall a great game with solo/duo/trio options for partying up."
1479,Very Fun Game and recommend for everybody
1480,"Game can be fun unless you play people who are across the world. The lag from the people you fight makes you just stand still and die. 

***READ BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING IN GAME***

IVE SPENT OVER $200 BUYING THINGS IN THE GAME AND OVER 50% OF THE ROLLS ARE THE SAME ITEM OVER AND OVER. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE IVE GOTTEN THE SAME ITEM OVER 5X. THE ITEMS MIGHT LOOK GOOD BUT ITS A WASTE OF MONEY AND IM DONE SUPPORTING A ROLL SYSTEM THAT IS SO GREEDY. I REPEAT BUY INGAME ITEMS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1481,"w game
"
1482,this game is so good i can play it all day.
1483,great game so glitchy though
1484,"Before you buy this game you need to make sure you install this on a SSD and not on a hard drive since your game will heavily lag to the point you're going to have sessions full of unplayable, floating faces gameplay. Otherwise if installed on the SSD you should be fine running this game smoothly even on max settings.

Overall this game is great rather you're playing solo or playing with friends though I must warn you if you're getting 2v1 it's best to counter their spam attacks you'll feel refreshed knowing that you disarmed the whole team and if you're quick enough can take their weapons away from them.

Character creation is great since you can do loads of creations from beautiful waifus to Thanos and Shrek. 
 
Hope this helps!"
1485,"I had 3 black screens in 15 minutes. Optimization is very poor. I could not get more than 130 fps on a 3070. If you are getting the game, don't get the deluxe or ultimate editions. It's pretty worthless and you can get better skins for less or free."
1486,Very good
1487,Nice game with intense combat system!
1488,NICE
1489,"I really like this game! Honestly, I would rather play this game than any shooter games since it does have melee weapons. It's really fun with friends as well,"
1490,This game is HIGHLY underrated. Pretty large skill ceiling. It's like if they made a third person martial artist version of Apex. Really fun and it's only 20 dollas babyyy let's go.
1491,Requires disabling a key windows 11 security feature to run the game. Would be happy to write a real review once that horrible decision is fixed.
1492,very fun battle royale
1493,"Bots and 10 minute ques. BEWARE.
Game is OKAY. 
But feels a bit dead and unstable.

Edit: 
I want to like this game so bad but... They will put you on with a team with 2 real players  and you will play vs a bot lobby - UNTIL you have 2 hours played so you cant refund. 

The problem: Player base is massivly Asian, which if you are play EU or US, good luck brother.
Just think shady tactics wont get this game popular, but maybe making it free or market it more, is a better idea than hostage your playerbase..."
1494,Yes
1495,"This game is awesome. The movement, is probably the most fluid and fun of any melee combat game I've played in the last decade. 
The combat is tricky to get the hang of, but once you grasp it its really fun and free form.
The graphics are gorgeous. The game itself runs really well.
But the BR aspect is terrible, as is any BR. This game is amazing, but it shouldn't be a BR. IMO 
I'm excited for the campaign mode they have announced because that if done right will work really well with the movement and combat of this game.
It does have an ""arena"" mode and team death match type mode and such, so you aren't forced to play BR. Which is very good.
I have played just under 30 hours and 28 of those hours were used grappling around the map and seeing what all I could parkour on next, which SPOILER ALERT, is literally everything."
1496,"Bought it and returned in within minutes.  The game seems super fun, but too bad it kept crashing my pc.

Each time I'd start a game,within minutes my pc would crash and restart. I could not find any guides to figure out what caused this.

My rig has a ryzen  5600x and 3060ti vid card. 16gbs of memory and ton of corsair accessories.
Not sure why this occurs, but it really bummed me out. 

If you know a fix, feel free to share because the actually  game play for this seemed really fun for the short bit I was able to play,"
1497,"[I'd like to preface that I never write reviews on Steam but Naraka definitely made me want to]

As someone who played in the beta and release, I had a ton of fun! 
I stopped playing due to lag (I left before Valda was released)
(I also dropped cash to buy the deluxe pack to get the ultimate skins)

However, 2-3 weeks ago I wanted to see how the game is and it turns out at peak hours, I can actually play the game and it was optimized! The community is nice and helped me out in getting better to not die every 2 seconds. 
Now I am 370+ in the NA Solos Leaderboard, capable of fighting even other top players! 

I've never witnessed a hacker in the whole time i played so I had no problems. My issues are more on the fact that queues take long but the Xbox Game Pass helped a lot with it (speaking from roughly 13 hours after the pass was out) and the playerbase in NA is getting higher as time passes! 

My other complaint is the nunchucks LOL

The game's definitely reaching higher numbers due to the xbox game pass and I absolutely urge you to try it out! 

I do wish the game is Free to Play though, it will make the game a lot more accessible and the devs make money off microtransactions anyway.

1498,good game

1501,"Incredible Graphics, Great Gameplay and something very unique in the context of all BR's currently. Highly Enjoy the game. Needs more players to keep the lobbies filled however. Influx from Console will probably help a lot when released."

1503,"Battle Royal with melee weapons, not to mention smooth combat"
1504,"this game changed my opinion on BRs, it's the only game I bought skins in besides csgo, and the only team based fighting game I've played that has a sense of competitive balance in ranked despite there being so many different niche playstyles. Never played anything like it"
1505,"I like the game itself, BUT:
If the game developers want to keep the WORLDWIDE players, not just Asian players, and become a MODEL of CHINESE Games. The DEVELOPERS must FOCUS:
1. Strict Supervision of Game Cheats;
2. Performance Optimization;
3. Game Balance;
4. New Maps;
5. New Game Mode;
6. Novice Friendly Matching Mechanism
...
You are welcome to comments below to add more deficiencies to the game to urge the developers."

1510,i have no words im in love this game
1511,its a pretty fun take on battle royales
1512,"combat, ninja"
1513,"It's all fun and games until someone who is playing on the right server smashes you into the ground until you are left to a confused mess who doesn't understand what just happend and is being aggravated due to it being a top 20 player while you are a silver player, and has better connections so that when he presses the block button it actually happens ,and while you are pressing that stupid button it takes about 3 seconds for you to get the block,

Don't even think about leaving a bot when you are already dead since you will lose those gargabe ass points that decide wheter you get xp or not


if you're an asian on the asian server you're good,

if you're anything else you can fuck right off since you have a dissadvantage against everyone else."
1514,This game looks easy on the surface but can get very mechanically complex fast. Fun if you like fast paced 1v1s that requires quick thinking.
1515,"I want to give this game the love it deserve, however with players from China/Asia coming in, it becomes a struggle to fight against ping. 

It's like fighting against floating t-posing bots, but the bots can invisibility attack you and you can't do shit but pray.
I DON'T recommend this game if you're an NA or EU player. Not until region/ping lock has been placed in-game.

Unless you're feeling the extra challenge, then go for it. Meanwhile I'll be pulling my hair out every time I fight against someone across the world that has a network advantage."
1516,"bad game, save ur 20$ on som els. severs are bad goes up too 200ping during fights, the voice acting is disgusting. could be a fun game if they actually put any effort on non CN servers"
1517,good
1518,Super good game
1519,"game is okay but it has a lot of flaws.
fight Chinese or Japanese player are retarded. including Russians and others across the global. the frame drop very proof and most of the time the game play will freeze has you attack them or they attack you.There  hackers and reporting them is pointless due too favoritism... the game take no skills more characters are better then other and yeah awful.
but the game can be fun and challenging depending on the matches. but honesty I'm dis pointed. there a lot of love and hate. but honesty all i can say is the game needs to be adjusted or i prefer balanced."

Character Customization is amazing and the characters are cute  :0  However even low settings seem to cause lag unless your computer is a god"
1535,"Awesome game, love the concept but the servers are awful, the game needs region lock as well as ping lock to prevent ping above 100 from joining servers, these people joining western servers has ruined the player base in the west, as the game can not be enjoyed whilst there are high ping players.

It would be best for everyone if they stuck to their own servers instead of taking advantage of the high ping, it does not help that the player with the high ping has the advantage.

i played the game a year ago for a few days and stopped due to this issue, I check back every few months to see if they have fixed their game, but sadly this great game is still unplayable and I recommend people to avoid buying it until you see that these issues are fixed.

I don't understand why the devs haven't fixed it as the reviews would be much better and more people would buy it, more people would play the game and make more in game purchases, which is where they would make more money."

The graphics and gameplay are realy smooth especially the way the character moves around the map. I really enjoy the fights in this game! They are full of mechanics you have to read your opponent and learn so many tricks to take the advantage and win!"
1547,You'll wait 10 minutes to get into a '' quick match '' and then when you load in you will have 500 ping and the game will kick you. The game is an atrocious state. I have actually spent more time in the lobby screen than in game. If there aren't any functional servers in the EU then this game cant work and i deserve my refund

1567,"The game is extremely fun to play and worth the 20$. But there are a few catches. They have failed to really grow the player base and it's been stagnant and dropping in numbers for a while now. It might be a worthwhile game for you if your available hours mesh with the spike in players on your specific region but otherwise your queue times might be a little long. With that in mind, you're really only allowed to play ranked matches where there are enough bots injected into your game (at any and all ranks) to inflate your performance as long as you don't die off spawn. With this in mind, the average player who wants a fast queue time will be resorted to play the ranked mode over the several other available modes because of queue times ranging from a full bot lobby instant popping to a 15 minute queue that finally popped because those other people just finished their game. That will only take effect at a higher rank, but there is nothing preventing the system from injecting someone of a high rank into your ranked match even when you're a brand new player. The match will be deemed extremely difficult, and you'll get extremely high rating for the match dependent on kills and placement. 

Personally, despite my opinions on the game, I wish they were to make this free to play as it's a really fun game to play and there is no arguing that. I've invested close to 400 hours between my two accounts and I've tried to get many people into the game but many failed due to the strict learning curve associated with this game. This is how it will go....

1. You make your account and queue up for a quick match to play against a non ranked environment.
2. Your queue insta pops and you feel great about it. 
3. There are probably 2 other players in your game, and it's your two other teammates in your trio.
4. You will run around and fight some AI who sometimes run into walls, have incredible parry reaction speed sometimes and sometimes it's just not there at all... there is no middle ground. 
5. You will likely win your first 1-3 and they will be fast queues because of the amount of real players in the game is low. 
6. Dependent on your performance in your other matches, your queue time might increase as more and more players get injected into your game. You will  progressively see 1 or 2 real parties, then maybe 3-6 , then maybe more.  This will progressively go up and up as you get going into your levels, but within the past several months playing both ranked in platinum where the queue times hit 10 minutes reguarly. I have yet to see a full game of real players. I never see more than 3-9 different names in the kill feed throughout the entire game and it feels like a vacant game now. 

on the other hand, if you had a friend to play and you were local to each other where the ping variance wasn't too severe.. I give this a 10/10 for customs.  The most playtime I get in this game nowadays is a custom lobby where several of my friends perform KOTH"

1582,PLS PLAY THIS GAME SO I DONT HAVE TO FIGHT 龙王神 AND 修炼大师武者 EVERY SINGLE MATCH.
1583,"I am at a crossroads with Naraka. I love it, despite such little time invested in it so far. However, THAT is the issue; time invested. The only reason I have only a couple hours is because I can't seem to catch the NA servers when they're at peak population. I wait for 5-6 minutes in the queue, refresh it, wait another 5-6 minutes - nothing. Seemingly no players online and no lobbies being filled. It's a damn shame because Naraka is such a satisfying game, and actually has a surprising amount of content! Not to mention, it is visually very pretty. I don't understand why the player base is dead.

In short, if you get the game and live in NA (or plan to use NA servers), just be prepared to wait a while for matches, unless you're THAT eager to play Bot matches (which IS an option). I would also not spend the money for the BP, as you won't be playing games often due to lack of players, therefore not leveling up your BP, ultimately making it redundant and a waste of money. 

*DISCLAIMER* you can earn all the cosmetics in game, no purchase necessary. Though some unlockables are only acquirable through certain loot boxes (which you can earn or buy), and through certain events.

Otherwise, Naraka is a very solid battle royale experience and will reward you for being a consistent player. 
I'd love to change this review to a thumbs up, and I hope I get to soon."
1584,No regrets nice game
1585,Great gameplay and graphics.
1586,"I rarely write a review, but seeing so many EU and NA players writing reviews relating to a server problem. As a SEA (South East Asia) player, I wanted to share my opinion on this game.

First of all, personally, gameplay is an addiction. I think it has to do with me liking For Honor, actually this is much better and easier than For Honor. So if you play For Honor regularly, this game is a piece of cake. And I know people say this game is easy to learn and harder to master, that's why I said if you can hold your ground in For Honor, you can beat almost everyone's ass in this game.

Next is graphic, tbh I don't have much to say in this aspect. The graphic is pretty good, the animation is also satisfying and not awkward.

And last but not least, the main reason why I'm writing this review, is about the server problem. We can tell that the EU and NA server is, as many reviews say, problematic right now. Many said there are cheaters & Chinese players (I'm assuming Chinese players are too good so that's why it's a problem?) invading their server, and a long waiting time for matchmaking. Now in SEA fortunately all of them are not true at all. I've never encountered a single cheater in my 87 hours of playing and for Chinese players? They actually play regularly on my server and surprisingly, they play like normal people with normal skills and I can go toe to toe with them, heck I even got 4 wins a couple of days ago. They are not some god-like gamers that people portray them. And for the long waiting time for matchmaking, tbf solo quick actually took forever to play, but trio only took a few seconds, the quickest time, and 3 minutes, the longest time, to get in a match in a busy time (50k+ players). And imo, it's not fair to not recommend a game and bring down the rating based on this alone. If I have this mindset, I'll probably write a ton of negative reviews since many games don't give a single damn about SEA. But I understand that they probably think some regions are not in their target market

In conclusion, do I recommend this game? Yes.
Do I recommend this game for EU and NA people? I can't say because I don't see how bad it is myself. But, based on reviews, it's better safe than sorry so don't buy it I guess.
Do I recommend this game for SEA people? Absolutely"
1587,"THERE ARE NO CHINESE VPN USERS. THEY ARE CHINESE AMERICAN. This game is very VERY popular in china so many other servers (mainly NA/EU) are dominated by people originally from there. You can ask them yourself! Most of them speak english!! It honestly blows my mind how widespread this misconception is. As for why they are destroying you, this game has a very high skill ceiling and you will pretty much get shit on by any decent player when starting out. My advice to you is add some of the people killing you and ask for advice! The community is very welcoming and their sure to help you out :)
"
1588,its a fun goods battle royale based around mobility and melee combat
1589,Once you cope with 95% of the playbase being chinese its fairly fun.  I enjoy its interesting combat and exciting movement

Please separate players from region. There are way too many asian players in NA servers. (Obviously smurfing.)"
1592,"DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!

My friends and I played this game from time to time, we even Beta Tested the game, my account ended up getting hacked from someone who plays this game and were using hacks on my account. I eventually got my account back and found that Naraka was the reason I got hacked so I uninstalled it. A week leader ,I get a message saying I was ""Permanently Banned"". I have even tried contacting but to no Avail. 

The developers DO NOT care about its Players.
Wish I could get my money back!"

1596,"everything good except for optimization, some small bugs, and losing weapons when getting perfect blocked (its super stupid and if you pb someone, you can destroy them, same vice versa)"
1597,"Here is my review of the game after almost 1k hours playing.

Pros: 
- Fun to play if you have friends
- An unique feel to the BR genre
- Obama and Shrek is in the game


Cons:
- China Nr.1
- Unenjoyable when you play solo
- getting stuck on non-existing structures and obstacles
- Counter/Parry works but only if the game feels like it
- Be the third party or enjoy being third partied
- Optimization is non-existing
- Don't feel happy when you kill someone, cuz it's a bot
- 2v1 is gg
- winning early fights feels unrewarded
- Coin toss on spawn location
- Not enough trees and obstacles
- Queue simulator is included
- Lagg switch is a thing
- Game uses a talent system which is a handicap for new players
- Don't let the 20€ price tag fool you of this game! You still need a RTX 9080ti to run it properly
- Super populated, however this is only the case if it was CN servers
- Best place to learn foreign languages when in pre-lobby (only if your voice chat options are enabled)
- Start game -> Win game -> Get 20+ kills -> get +1 point on your rank 🙂
- Insane balanced characters. Source: ""Trust me bro""
- Sticky keys???
- Game is sus

Do I recommend this game? Yes absolutely. Play Greatsword and you will be fine 🙃"

1619,such a shame we don't have a good indie dev team make a game like this. I can give credit where its due and the combat is really fun. But if your expecting a good pvp experience this isn't it its mainly bots and I got invincible my first match fresh out of the tutorial. The map is nice and so is the combat and weapons you get to use. But again its mainly pve against brain dead bots you need 0 practice to beat. Any game you can go in with 0 knowledge right out of the tutorial and win a match with 16 kills isn't worth spending your time on. But I'm going to leave comments open in hopes some people could help me find a silver lining into actually investing my time in a game like this. I hope this game succeeds unlike shadow arena but it seems like its already heading down that rabbit hole.

i like the fighting mechanic, the customization, the graphics and everything else works just fine its just the waiting time to get into a match is a pain. if you have patience you might not have a problem."
1624,"Great game! I hate battle royales but this is the best one of those!

Gameplay is solid for me. It's like a fighting game but you find weapons throughout the map and picking a weapons style you like is optimal for winning games.

Cosmetics are detailed but some nice ones are locked behind previous seasons or old content. Theres a good chunk of cosmetics that aren't obtainable for purchase even after the battle passes or previous events have ended. That's my main gripe of the game."
1625,Its such a fun game. But im a skin addict so its not good for my wallet.
1626,Interesting take on the BR genre
1627,hard to play but fun
1628,"Might be worth it if it was free to play as heavy monetization is there already.

I wanted to try this game but it seems there are no people playing it, took long enough to play two matches which were just bots even in ranked which just act like they don't know how to walk or fight. Have to refund since i'm almost out of time for that, make it F2P and let me actually try battling players, then i might give it a try again."

1635,"It's a challenging game, which is why I enjoy it. I play with a friend, so it's hard to say if I would enjoy this game alone. However, once you put in the work and practice it gets fun and also infuriating. I come from playing games like Apex, which has no mechanics similar to this game. If you come from darksouls or a similar game, then I can see you have an easier time. I still suck at this game, but with a little more familiarisation, I can see it becoming a lot more fun."

In overall, it's a beautiful game with the best character creation mode ever done. The concept of Asian battle royale with melee weapons for the most part is great.

But everything else in this game is horrible.
The optimisation is the worst ever, I barely have 60fps while I have a 1080ti, it stutters like hell and randomly tells me my game files are corrupted when I'm in game. The loading is so laggy and long that I can't choose the location I want to land on and I need to wait for 5 mins before I can interact in the world to get destroyed in a second right after.

I mean, if you want to play a BR game, play a free one with normal optimisation, not this game. Or unless you're only interested into character creation, but it's not worth its price just for that aspect."

I'd love to critique the actual game here, but as previously described, the program itself is totally broken, it refuses to run properly at all.

They actually reached out to survey me, individually, about everything I genuinely liked and genuinely hated about the game. Find another dev that does that. Yeah, ping issues are a problem, and you'll get an occasional hacker. Oh well. All this game needs is more players in the west."

1688,"Pros: 
- Very fun change of pace from traditional battle royales. 
- Low skill floor to pick up and understand the game.
- VERY HIGH skill ceiling learning how to combo various mechanics.
- Beautiful game
- Regular in game events and new content including new characters (1-2 per season) and new weapons and items
- Battle Pass has stuff at every level on the free track allowing for easy access to free cosmetics without paying for them
- All cash currency purchases are cosmetic only
- Gains and Losses in ranking is based on largely on your own preformance not your teams (trios or duos)
- Has a rotation of additional game modes

Cons:
- First game will be very very laggy if not installed to a solid state drive and can be very GPU demanding. (recommend playing in bot mode for first match of the day)
- Match Making has improved significantly to match players by ping but can still run into people playing wtih very bad ping due players trying to play on other regions servers.
- (personally dont see this as a bad thing but figured i would list it anyway) Game has LOTS of cash shop items even though its not a f2p game (cosmetic only)
- Some tool tip and item descriptions have poor translations into english

Conclusion: I have 156 hours in the game across 3 seasons and have hit as high as gold in ranked (took several months off due to life being busy or the hours would be much higher) This has quickly become my go to battle royale and has been a lot of fun for me in solos and with friends in duos and trios. Price is very reasonable but if you are unsure follow the game because free to play trial weekends are given fairly often. If you can ever get it on sale its an absolute steal.

1690,Game is amazing just wish there was more players. Q times can be crazy because of this. The other thing is now there is quite a bit of bots in the game because the player base is rather slim this makes games somewhat annoying as you'll be fighting millions of bots and then run into real people and things get real too quick.

💔 20$ game with Micro-transactions
💔 Queue time

8/10 would spam combo to let an Unarmed player take away my weapon and get killed just to queue for another 10min again."
1694,even tho i paid for it this game should be free to get more players tbh just do some cringe microtransaction shit like everyone else its annoying to wait 2min for a lobby
1695,swords go brrr
1696,game is shit they patched my anticheat bypass
1697,"enjoyed the game for the first 10 hours however afterwhich ive noticed 3000000000 chinese players on eu servers , chinese players are using the eu servers to lagband and get the upper hand in fights very scummy and the developer doesnt seem to care so im done"
1698,"Was fun but too many smurfs / server hoppers, impossible to play.

Tried learning, the people you fight are either complete bots who stand still or smurfs who combo you to death and completely stun look you. Since its a battle royal farming takes 20 minutes and then you suddenly die to some dude who has played for 10000 hours.

Absolutely 0 matchmaking..."
1699,"Very cool game and has really nice graphics, probably something you'd play when you are used to games like pubg"
1700,"The game experience is very poor, and teammates and opponents are not players at the same level as you.
The optimization of the game is also very poor, and the theme of the game is very interesting, but unfortunately the game company is too bad.
The sound effects of the game are also very bad, and the volume of the game is far higher than that of other games. The volume of the system that can be played normally in other games needs to be increased in this game, which is seriously incompatible with other background programs.
What a pity."
1701,absolutley love this game
1702,I hate this game :)
1703,"love the customisation, game-play, everything super immersive and competative in a good way!"

1710,"Killing the vpn china hard but otherwise game good, be good to kill good, good."
1711,vang
1712,"Good game, they need to not allow VPNs, you'll be in the top 5 and a laggy player with Chinese letters or people with EU lagging around so much you can't even block let alone run. If they patch that it would be a outstanding game, if they patched that."
1713,cool

	[td]NARAKA: BATTLEPOINT is a Battle Royale like no other. Its main focus is on its combat and it's really good at it. With amazing visuals, controls, and responsive combat mechanics this game feels really well thought out as a Battle Royale game. The menus are simple to follow and if you want to drop in and out of the game you can. You're not being forced by it, but rewarded for playing regularly. Be careful as when you plan to take breaks and come back, due to the nature of this game being difficult, you can expect to return having to relearn moves and counters.[/td]

	[td][b]Is it worth buying?[/b] [/td]

	[td]If you take the game and how it is at its core, it's a very good battle royale game that can't be found anywhere else. I do feel that the matchmaking and server migration should be worked on and with a good population, this game could become a really fun experience for new players.[/td]

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is designed to offer a brand new experience of combat and world exploration, featuring a boundless movement system, and an easy-to-use grappling hook mechanic, allowing you to interact with any objects around the world, and a sophisticated combat system involving block & parry mechanics.

[h3] ⚔ Gameplay: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★★

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT  is at its core a Battle Royale game. Its objective is very much similar to other games of its type. Compared to the rest of them, you're given the choice to spawn wherever you wish on the map before you join the game. Each character has unique abilities, inspired by the Chinese culture, making each encounter fun and difficult.

Your objective in the game is to eliminate your opponents and remain the last man/woman standing in the game. The game offers as well many other game mods where you can level up your weapon skills and become better at the game.

[h3] 😄 Fun: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★☆

I'm not going to lie, I've had a ton of fun playing this game, and despite being very difficult encountering smurfs and knowing for a fact that they will put up a challenge, winning against them really gives you a sense of victory only a soul-like game could. It's fully packed with action so it's hard to put this game down, but it can get really frustrating at times when you can't compete with players in your own rank and you end up fighting people who are higher ranked than you, yet they are in Bronze or Silver ranks.

That can put you off and therefore doesn't deserves 5 stars.

[h3] 🏞 Visuals: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★★

The game looks really good and character customization is really good. As you can see in the screenshot, I've made myself in it with a striking resemblance. The game looks great outside of the character customization area and the costumes and effects are really well polished. It's a gorgeous-looking game.

[h3] 🔊 Sound: [/h3]
Rate: ★★★★☆

Sound for abilities, voice acting, and interacting with the world sound good. Music is also good but becomes repetitive at times. If you like east-Asian instrumental music you'll enjoy this game a lot.

[h3] 📖 Story: [/h3]
Rate: ★☆☆☆☆

Sadly this game doesn't really have a story that will keep you somewhat engaged. At least not at this point in time. What I saw is that by playing the characters you like, you unlock new abilities and as well a part of the log or story related to the character. I wish they were presented as cinematics or something else, but not just a bunch of text. I can't consider this to be the strongest point for this game.

[h3] 🧵 Length: [/h3]

🔲 Short
🔲 Average
🔲 Long 
☑️ Unlimited

This game is a multiplayer game, so it doesn't have an ending per say. You can play it for a couple of minutes or hours as I did. It's easy to get lost in the track of time in this game.

[h3] 🧩 Difficulty: [/h3]

🔲 Easy
🔲 Normal
☑️ Hard
☑️ Brutally Hard
🔲 Impossible

The main reason why so many players found this game off-putting is the fact that is really difficult for new players to get used to the controls and combat. I personally had no issues and I was able to get through pretty much each game in the top 5. That can help you grow in rank in theory quite quickly.

[h3] ⭕Conclusion: [/h3]
NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a very fun, action battle royale game, but really needs a more active population in the West. There should also be more restrictive migrations from other servers as it can really ruin the experience for new players who want to play this game.

I honestly think that any player that doesn't like Battle Royale game should try this game because it simply feels different than any other. I had a lot of fun with this game.

1724,"Amazing creative game with refreshing focus on melee, but ruined by Chinese VPN spoofers making accounts in the NA server to smurf. They're laggy as heck and are stuck at Gold V and armed with meta knowledge not yet known western-sideand are not supposed to be able to hop to NA server. I can ony hop between NA, AU and EU. 
BUT. if you can take it not seriously and avoid ranked especially around 12 am central its a pretty fun battle royale."

Don't even bother if u located outside of China & South East Asia.
Dev team trend to change this game to spamming focus attack and instant parry. Dagger & nunchucks are unbalanced rn and extremely annoying to play against, if u have latency above 50+ or low fps, u gonna get rekted by dagger&nunchucks spamming BS regular attack combo that root u on ground many times in a row.
No sign for new map and game mode. Player base shrinking drastically.

1747,"I could never have thought that a game can make me racist.

This game has the worst matchmaking I've ever seen.
Many asian players in EU server that anihilate everything."
1748,"This game is a melee focused battle royale. It has ranged weapons, they play a part, but are not the focus. So if you are not a strong fps player it will not cripple you in combat, but you could be at a disadvantage in some fights. Grapple mechanics are smooth and critical to game-play and fights, and characters are unique and variable. 
Overall there aren't too many bugs in interactions, they do occur with the fast paced highly interactive combat, but are usually rare to see. The amount of mobility and types of mobility in this game, from grappling, to wall climbing, ceiling interaction, scale rushing (running on a vertical surface and then using your weapon to dive in a select direction, even directly up) is liberating and heavily raises the skill ceiling of the game. 
Combat has a base level of experience that you will be able to get by with in most fights, however because of movement variability, weapon combos, stagger effects, dash canceling, i-frame length choice etc, the skill ceiling in combat doesn't really have a cap. If you run into an experienced player sometimes you will feel like there was absolutely nothing you could do to even move before your meet your demise. I have over 1500 hours over multiple accounts, and still get rolled from time to time. Time spent, practice, and skill will be rewarded with more victories in this game. 
Final note, the NA community is still small overall, we have dedicated and friendly players that want to see more people join, but due to the devs lack of focus on the promotion of this game in NA, we remain small. I note this because our small community, broken into 6 game ques, normal match (solo, duo, trios) and ranked (solo, duo, trios) can result in long que times, or a que never popping at non peak hours. This will likely get worse the higher up some competitive ladders you go. Once you get into gold rank which should be easy to achieve, it is also likely you will be seeing some top 100 players on the server in your games. Yet because of the AVERAGE skill level of the lobby being at or below your rank (bots count toward that average) you may not get rewarded very well for outperforming good competition. Grinding ranked ladder at high rank is punishing and will require dedication. The devs have made some improvements to this over the last season, and it has made a positive change, so they see the problem and are trying to create solutions.
Some final notes: Early games you join will be almost exclusively bots to ease you into gameplay, even ranked. This is not reflective of overall game experience, there will likely be some bots even up to gold rank in your lobbies. I have come to love this game, having never played a fighting game or a battle royale, and have climbed as high as 150 on the solo leaderboard. If I have figured out gameplay, so can you. When your starting out please head over to Twitch.tv and check out some Naraka streams, and ask questions, it will greatly help with steady growth in the game. Also feel free to add me in game, my username is: Oni丶Onyxien (that is all one word Naraka doesn't allow spaces in name creation) we're always looking to help new players and hope you want to join our community. We look forward to playing with you!"

1762,More pop ups than on P♥rnhub !
1763,"I'm not a fan of long reviews so I'm going to keep it short and to the point.

The game looks amazing, its a very good looking battle royal. The combat is enjoyable and fun to fight with. Definitely more unique than the vast majority of battle royals. 

Main concern is the player base. It's not that large so finding lobbies is hard and you can be sitting there waiting for a match long enough to finish a cup of tea. However, once you do get into a lobby you will be greeted by 4 thing; 1 - bots, there are plenty of bots and its easily noticeable, at first is I assumed that because I'm new I was playing against other stupid people, well there may have been a few real players here, most were bots. 2 - Stupid people, as mentioned in the previous point you will find just bad players, not that it's an issue or anything but just a group you will find (me lol). 3 - Sweaty players. Biggest issue for me when I end up in a lobby is when I end up against players a good few ranks higher than me and they without a doubt have been playing for a while so they easily beat my ass without me even realising it. 4 - Hackers/ ping abusers. You will possibly come across players which are either just cheating or abusing ping to beat you to death without you being able to realise someone was even there. Though some of these are common issues in all battle royal games, I feel like it's far more noticeable here due to a smaller player base specifically the bots which is the largest issue. Further more, some of the animations feel weird and some things are a bit iffy when jumping around on specific things. One thing I noticed, the character can be climbing up and read a roof, the character will somehow manage to throw themselves backwards to grab onto the roof piece, regardless of how far away it is, its pretty funny but doesn't really make sense. 

Overlooking the negative's I do really enjoy this slower paced battle royal feel which the game has, it allows you to have time to do those little mini quests you can find which is a very cute feature (wish there were more types of those) as well as the assassination quests you can find giving you the chance to find a player easier (to realise they are a sweat and they kill you instead). The graphics are great, the map looks gorgeous, characters all look great and have some cool skills. The combat mechanics as mentioned before is fun with cool weapons and individual skills which can be found for them. 

Despite all those negatives, the game is fun to play. Maybe not worth the full price and if it was cheaper the player base would probably be bigger, but alas. It is what it is, regardless of everything I will still be playing and forcing friends to get it as well to make the most out of the game. I do hope that more people will get into the game, which would make it far more fun to play. However, it's still a blast regardless.

1782,"I spent 20$ on this game back in December, it was too seriously too easy. I don't know if i was going against idiots or AI or what, but after a few games I would just start dying out of no where from some one from asia on 1000 ping and it made the game unfun for a whole other set of reasons, so I refunded. Then when the free weekend came around 1 or 2 weeks ago I repurchased so I could try and play again, but the game just left my library out of no where, without my consent to refund. I don't know what happened but I would my copy of the game back. Back to the actual review tho, the mechanics are pretty fluid and the character system is cool, and the map and character design is solid but given the issues of difficulty, either impossible or too easy I cannot justify to my self or others a 20$ dollar game, so until the difficulty issue is fixed its a no for me."
1783,"to be honest the game is great, i like it, but 2 things that making me want to rage quit it, the optimization, my pc is not that bad, i run even more heavier games than this one pretty fine with over 100 fps yet when it comes to this one my fps even drop to 50-45 sometimes even tho im on low settings, second is that even tho you're in eu server, you meet a lot of chinese players, no offense but they come with heavy lags, you can barely touch them with their ping that in the sky which gets frustrating, you know you are doing right but because they are lagging it just ruin your game, if those 2 issues get resolved then its totally recommended, otherwise i wouldn't spend money on this game yet."
1784,"great game

1793,"Been giving this game a second shot, combat is really fun when you can play other people in your region. Huge problem with high ping players ruining the game for everyone except for themselves. Was trying to satisfy an itch from Elden Ring pvp, and this will hold your attention for a bit then endlessly tilt you once you pass a certain threshold."
1794,"If you're looking to get stunlocked by a purple skinned invisible girl twirling a staff while her duo partner (currently a 10 ft 4 armed ogre) spectral grabs your fleeing teammate from 50 ft away and proceed to suplex them into oblivion I would highly recommend this game. NA server is currently plagued by Chinese players under VPN causing some slight skill balancing issues as well as some lag issues, but matches are generally good and I have a lot of fun playing. You know a game is good when you rage quit at some bs but can't stop thinking about playing it the next day."

1798,"Dislike how experienced players are placed with new players. Kind of puts new players off from playing it. That said, there are heaps of things to learn & explore in the game. Being a martial arts related game, I would like to see limited special moves that can be found in treasures while playing in the form of ancient scrolls where players need to learn & perfect the skill taught within the scroll."

1800,"There are only asian smurf players in EU server and you cant play with these sh*ts. Producers should find a solution for this issue or they will lose a lot of players like me.. 

NOTE: Still same problems with chinese players.. They are banned in their servers cause cheat or other prohibited behaviors and they come to eu server. They cant play in their server anymore because they are using ID number for play so ban=you cant play anymore in asian server. I dont want to play with these chinese people. They are cheater or only want new noob players for their smurf fun account in EU."
1801,Game is full of with smurf asian players even in the lower elos there are smurfs everywhere they basicly dont let you play the game.Even in EU servers.

1811,"Good game, AWFUL team behind it. Balance has always been an issue in this game but when you play against chinese players using VPNs and have a jillion ping, IN A GAME WHERE TIMING IS EVERYTHING.... It doesnt work. It is insane to me this game has even made it this far. Also there is a serious problem of people blatantly botting ranked games. You all had a gem here and you are just ruining its competitive potential."
1812,would be a great game is the chinese stayed on the their own server and not come cheat and lag on NA servers
1813,"perfect  lot of mecanics, gams style but still ""easy"" sto start 
the game is beautifull 
i didnt see anyone abuse from ping or team up in solo 
hacker dont exist they re instant ban 
great game dont hesitate"
1814,"Loved the game at first but the increased issues with cheaters and Chinese players invading EU servers made it unplayable.
Not to mention it takes a century to get into any kind of match, to the point where it feels like the only thing you can do is play bot matches.

If you're not in China, don't waste your time. The devs only care about the Chinese player base, so don't expect to have a good experience if that's not your case."
1815,insane combat mechanics
1816,"Fun game with frequent updates and a consistent playerbase BUT it depends on the region.

Many matches on EU server will have some bots or just not even fill up to 60 because the playerbase is so low there (supposedly it does fine on NA and especially good on Asia servers)

I hope the devs will work on its anti-cheat and go F2P so we can have a bigger playerbase, there's no reason for this game not to be successful.

Plus, with all the monetization in the game it really does feel like a F2P game. Store with premium currency only, lootboxes that can only be bought with premium currency, battle pass with a paid track as well, etc. etc.

Has jiggle physics and voices in Japanese so it's worth it though"

1825,good game with unique play styles and way more in depth than at first glance. Make sure you watch some training videos
1826,good
1827,yes good
1828,Game is filled with bots. and matchmaking system is literal dogsh*t. we play in duo ranked with my friend and the lobby doesn't exceed 40 players. when i started the game it was near 100 people and i assume more than half of it was bots. When i looked up a guy that killed us in duo. he was silver 2 in duos and Solar rank in trios. what kind of bullshit matchmaking system is this. just make it a single rank for all ranked games. I'm waiting 10 minutes to play against 40 other people and most of them are smurfing in duos. I definitely do not recommend this game don't give them any more money.
1829,good game !
1830,good
1831,:)
1832,A fun melee battle royale game.
1833,"already got hooked to the game 
"
1834,chmy4fhjqn
1835,"I DO NOT often rate a pvp game before ive played it for at least 24 hours.. unless its like absolute garbage or i cant run it for whatever reason .. like.. but i cant rob these devs on the props they deserve for doing an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING JOB!!! its been a while since ive been lucky enough to stumble across a game that just does it right from the gate!! and Naraka's devs made that their goal with this gem!!! 100% killer job on this game and i cant recommend it enough! the combat is fluid and though it has quite a bit of skill required to master its not full of crappy bloat mechanics ! the variety is absolutely on point.. no one weapon or hero is a clone of another in any way!!! everything has a strategy and everything has a counter! its just great!
my only issue is the ping sometimes gets a little rowdy considering my homie is in Osaka so we have a tiny bit of latency to deal with but otherwise they just absolutely killed this game on quality and execution !!! KEEP IT UP GUYS FANTASTIC JOB!!!"
1836,"Naraka: Bladepoint is like For Honor meets Fortnite. The best of both worlds. A martial arts fighting style game which takes tactics and skill and competition against others and pits them against survival to the last man standing. The skill gap is massive, however, but that is a skill gap that is learned through time and patience and practice, just like all games. Every weapon has a counter, every move has a counter, and every skill has a counter. Knowing what works best for you, will go a long way to success and being the Last Man Standing in the Herald's Trial. This game will keep you wanting more like all battle royale's do, but give you the satisfaction of wrecking your opponents like traditional fighting games.

MAKE THIS GAME FAMOUS!"
1837,Kinda hard for new players but after you learn some skills it will be very fun and cool!
1838,Exactly What You Are Looking For
1839,"The game has a massive potential in terms of game play but it's quite bad for new players. They just gave tutorials on basic controls but missing out the mechanics of the game like combats or how to block or get away. 
So yeah game was nice but I just die like in a second when I'm fighting ._."
1840,amazing high skill cap game
1841,Nice
1842,"Fun, fighting-based battle royale."
1843,"- The game is crawling with VPN Chinese hackers/lagswitchers.
- Absolutely hideous paywall even for free-to-play game which it isn't. 
- Most of weapons and characters are feeling uninspired and useless. 
- Combat feels good but is very shallow and gets boring quickly enough.

Save your time and money and wait for a free weekend which happens quite often. That will be more than enough to fully experience the game."
1844,GOOD
1845,"gameplay is fun, but its honestly the most annoying thing to lose a 1v1 to 滞后很多 who is lagging all over the place because region lock STILL isn't a thing. 

spend your hard earned 20 dollars elsewhere"
1846,"incredible parkour, play with two of your friends, fun combat, quick gameplay

a unique BR"
1847,This game is a mix of a game that is plagued with bots to make the game easy and a game with horrible lag. Wiping your own ass with a $20 bill is a better use of your money than buying this game for $20.
1848,Not bad actually
1849,"nice community and love the style of this game
"
1850,"its good game beauty dress :> but hmph . about leohex style >_> they lock it with top price and for only 1 hero //good thing of leohex style. its instant cosplay . dont need to paid much for that outfit. but clothie style .. is too much .. expensive - _ -... for just dress .. selfie on wall TV . for just social . well 
. but that alright. *facepalm . this game just start. a few month ago . hope they release more dress :0 
cheer
"
1851,make it freee!
1852,nice
1853,ffff
1854,its a okai game
1855,This game has so many aspects that I love in a game.  The button combos must be learnt and is fun fast pace strategy game. if you want to dedicate hours to become competitive its possible. also look into using a controller. it may help with combos. Just try it out and stop listening to the crowd. some players still use controllers for certain FPS games.
1856, AWSOME
1857,Really fun game would highly recommend
1858,GREAT GAME
1859,"Great game mechanics, smooth. If you are getting owned by Chinese gamers then you suck and give up. 10/10"
1860,it's really fun :D
1861,when u play herald trial or (rank) game mode mus separate players for example im at bronze rank and im playing with emerald or higher ranked (gold>bronze) people its becoming impossible to win separate them for example silver=silver  gold=gold
1862,"big learning curve, and you need to have some friends to team up with. 
More and more fun after the first 50 hours."
1863,"Epic game, Pogchamp"
1864,"Make this game free to play as they make a crazy amount of money just from the in game cosmetic shop (hella expensive stuff in there), so more people can play!"
1865,a
1866,go get em son....
1867,The game is really good . But it's hard . Skills really matters...! there is a lot of bots in this game.
1868,"A rare exception to the battle royale formula.

Less ""I just spent 30 minutes combing through dead bodies trying to find armor and oops I got shot from 2 miles away and died GG no rewards for me I guess"", and more actual time spent in combat, despite the lower number of overall players compared to some of it's ""competition"" (For lack of a better term).


Fights are more about timing, patience, and quick thinking than just mindlessly W+M1-ing your opponents to death with a rocket launcher or laser accurate gun, since it's all melee combat with wire-fu inspiration mixed in with a little sprinkle of ""Anime"" vibes.

Death comes fast to the unprepared, and yet the game makes it easy to quickly sort yourself out, because it allows you to customize even how you automatically pick up items, and to what extent based on how many bag upgrades you have found on your mission. Find yourself using a lot of armor powder, but rarely sticking around to get hit HP wise? Tone down the number of stacks to 1-2 for health items, and claim the rest of the space for other essential items.

That alone should tell you that they care about the player experience, and the combat is no exception. Simple, but very tricky to master, especially once you step away from the grounded simplicity of Rock-paper-scissors and take to the skies mid combo, or use your grappling hook to slide past your enemy, carrying them off of a ledge to buy your team time to prepare for the inevitable counter attack.

Fantastic game, just needs to keep the content coming on strong, which it seems to be doing well at so far."
1869,definitely a good battle royale
1870,Good for reducing pressure :)
1871,Very addictive
1872,Best game after Apex legends
1873,"Melee-based battle royale sounds great in concept, but the gameplay wasn't executed well. The combat system is very choppy. Mouse 1 for a horizontal attack and mouse 2 for a vertical attack, but from what I've seen, you can't do combos. You can also counter, but only charged attacks (marked in blue). The poor translations from Chinese also make the game even more confusing. Game is also very guilty of alternate currencies, FOMO content, lootboxes, and other modern game-as-a-service cliches. I do like the character designs - these are some of the most handsome and beautiful characters I've seen. It's just sad to see them in a very disappointing game."
1874,"Fun game, but my PC can barley run this. Had to move this game to my SSD, and it still frame drops hard. Hopefully it gets it's console release soon."
1875,"Let me say definetly a fan of this game. not too big on the battle royal genre, but they did well with this game. Probably my favorite battle royal to date"
1876,hard as shit
1877,"I like it, it is very cool and fun"
1878,"Really tight combat that makes you feel like a bad ass when executed correctly, which is amazing for such a simple core system.

However, I can't recommend to everyone. The game has an egregious amount of micro-transactions that could rival, or even surpass, free-to play games. If you are susceptible to gambling or being a whale, I'd steer clear from this one. 

On the other hand, the facial customization is so ludicrous and malleable that it's almost worth the price tag alone. Almost.

tl;dr: If you're looking for a fun combat oriented battle-royale, and you're not susceptible to microtransactions, get it."
1879,"Almost all of these claims about Chinese hackers and lag abusers and whatnot are rumours cause the game is hard overall, and hard to understand if you don't do your research about it. It has an okay tutorial but it only explains the basics. For the more advanced tech you'll have to watch youtube videos or figure it out for yourself. I have a ton of hours and I only encountered very few people who I suspected that they may be cheating. But I was not even sure if they were just good or cheating. And yes there are a lot of players with Chinese names but this game is huge in China so it's expected. They are the same as you tho they are not cheaters, lag switchers or anything. They have normal ping and most defenetly they are just Chinese people living in your region. Acutally I met more people playing from NA in the EU server who lagged. The lag situation is weird cause most of the time it just feels like a disadvantage just like in every game, but sometimes I met people who's attacks I couldn't dodge cause I got sucked back into their attack mid dodge. That's the only advantage they get, they'll still have a huge delay on everything. I'm not sure if you have to have a certain ping to get this but it's not common. You'll meet this kind of people like once of twice every 100 hours or so. 


I can only speak for EU, I have no idea how things go in NA, AS or SEA


This game is really misunderstood cause some people started spreading rumours cause it's a hard game full of Chinese people. But there's nothing more to it."
1880,"I'm playing on NA and have hit level 25 on my account. I have not had a single issue with any Chinese hacking players that some of these reviews talk about. I've not even run into anyone that I thought was suspicious yet, either. Either these are just really bad players getting wrecked and going to write a bad review, or the situation has been helped. 

In any case, I'm having a lot of fun playing this game right now."
1881,Honestly surprised at how great this game is
1882,"I love this game, i play low bronze 3, and i know i could go way higher. I played alot of these types games as a kid, so right now im playing with a gold 1, and we get about a even score when we win the whole match. I figured out if i focus attack then dodge, i move faster, and crouch right click makes enemies airborne. Its small mechanics like that i like to figure out, i did this in Rocket League aswell, figured out mechanics to get ahead of the curve.

Would wish they made it free, cause i want my friends to play with me, but they are sceptic cause of bad battle royales like PUBG and Fortnite, where Warzone was top 1 over the best Battle Royale games we played. They in general just seem like their done with battle royale games, this games is just a different kind of fun imo."
1883,good
1884,Game itself is great but it will die if you let Chinese people farm stats on other servers or don't at least improve matchmaking
1885,"Nice battle royal game

1889,good fun
1890,1*
1891,"Good. Good for weebs.

You will get so many wifu/s here."
1892,"The gameplay loop is a ton of fun but between the rampant bot matches and the awful servers, I cannot recommend it in its current state."
1893,juhbniujhn
1894,"The game itself isn't bad but the queue times are absolute garbage. Sometimes, some very very rare times you get a match in a minute or less, other times it takes more than 20 minutes to get a match, even if you queue solo or in a full made party, hell even against bots it's taking forever and it's BOTS.

So yeah the game is nice if you can manage to play it that is."
1895,nice game
1896,everybody in uganda must know kung fu
1897,Its good until you go against a tryhard chinese man
1898,This game is the most poorly optimized game I have ever paid for. I even ran it on a SSD with a 3080 TI.
1899,good game
1900,"Its buggy 
"
1901,Its fun when it runs well
1902,After playing a couple of matches my thoughts on this game that honestly it should be free to play even though it costs money pretty sure to pay for their servers or give them donations  Even though they already make money like that through their loot boxes or chests. Overall its a really fun game just needs to be free to play so that more people join. It even more fun with friends but i have none to play with in this game :) Dealt with a hacker but defeated him lmao nice aimbot and speed hacks My favorite Character or hero is Kurumi :)
1903,very fun to play especially w fren
1904,"Great game, sooooooooooo worth the money! Keep it up mods and devs, this game is being more brilliant by day!! <3"
1905,game nhu con cac :)))
1906,"The game is pretty fun, if you enjoy whacking some bots lol. Otherwise have fun waiting ages to get into a queue."
1907,gasssssss
1908,"Amazing gaem!!!! i love so mush thank you
x"
1909,Good game fun
1910,"this is a battle royale that gives me the same feeling would get in fighting games back in the day, like a cross between sekiro and soulcalibur, Has a death match mode and even a good mode with bots if you want to play alone, Great quick action!"
1911,When you're addicted to punishing yourself.
1912,ok
1913,fun game
1914,VERY NICEEEE

1927,very good
1928,"Yowza! This game is so much fun! I played with a friend of mine on free weekend and i'll tell you what ( ! ) this game did NOT disappoint. Straight UP! Wow! Haha, you know I don't typically make a review for a game, but I felt SERIOUSLY compelled to write this. I realize I haven't written any details about it, but COME ON - DO IT! It's SOOO FUN!

-Chill bro

P.S. I purchased the game and it is DEFINITELY WORTH IT! (The DLC's are not worth imo b/c they are only cosmetic items) But hey, that means no P2W, right? (PORRFECT! :D)

P.S.S. The action is fast paced, as with any BR mode game you can take your time and find all the items and upgrades to fight with, or just DIVE right in off rip! Super fun either way. Plus there's mad cleave edge ( . Y . ) and everyone loves it.

Okay

-Chill"
1929,good game
1930,heloo
1931,good game
1932,"This exceeded my expectations, most BR games are all the same however, this one WOW it's much different and not just that it's different BR wise it's a combo of RPG elements and BR which I believe has never been done before until now. MUST PLAY"
1933,"Excelent, I'd like more than other battleroyale Games"
1934,"Great game with flashy combat mechanics

The game's biggest flaw is that RNG exists

You literally cannot kill an equally skilled player with worse loot

That's about all the flaws 8/10

oh yeah and also i don't have any friends to play with."
1935,"I enjoyed the game play at first, then i was stuck on a foreign server with people at a much higher experience time.  With the lag and unbalance it was just not worth anything.  The lag was the worst part about it.  I could do nothing while being cut down.  It was clear those people with out lag issues were from the origin nation of the server.  So if they get some global servers I might be interested.

"
1936,very good
1937,"i like it a lot..
but i believe its expansive..
i would like to help the dev but man 41,98€ is a lot for what this game offers.
its only battle royal Arena .. which means no offline mode, no rpg , no mmo..
so 41,98€ for it is sooo exansive."
1938,I aint even get to play the game Bruh there was a glitch
1939,good
1940,I like this game but it takes a lot of skills
1941,good game but need a lot of work

1948,"This is a good game if you're with the right type of people but the other players, I swear users auto aim or something because there movements are not like human interactions, running into walls/ceilings and just keep whooping you, even when you're doing your best not to get killed. If this was free to play, I would play this game often."
1949,good game
1950,ok

1954,"Nah, I don't like this game. It looks like a mobile game. Also most of Asians play on Eu server that's why everybody is lagging in game. It's okay, they can play on Eu server but they teleport and kill me because of the lag. What a game! I don't believe there is a Eu server in this game. It's not worth 20 bucks so I'll never play until it's free. Let's delete it!"
1955,"Game is fun, challenging, and full mechanic... i succk at this game at the very beginning and complaining about how i can't fight chinese player but after a while i still succk in ranked mode lmao... almost all negative review is just you succk at this game, gitgud mate"
1956,"This game have a beautiful character, easy to understand control with good UI"
1957,officially a naraka bladepoint enjoyer
1958,"just yes
"
1959,Game hay
1960,"Špatné to není, aleeeee...Sakra, co to jako je, když internet mám ping 8 a ve hře se to laguje, jak prase. Půl dne čekám až se ve hře načte okolí, pak druhý půl den až budu moc sbírat věci. Tohle je fakt úmorné a neskutečné. Zatím málo postav a já natrefil na super partu. Ovšem nechápu to sekání, pořád připojuji se do hry apd :D, jak kdybych hrál v pralesu. 

Grafikou hra neoslní. A díky bohu nemám štěstí, jako kolega, co čekal kolem 15 minut do hry, ale faktem je, že díky lagům trvá  tak 15 minut než budu moc hrát a vše se vyrenderuje a načte. 

Díky bohu, že jsem si to nekoupil, ale zase na duhou stranu je to lepší, jak PUBG :) 




Update 22.8.2022
104,000 players and it takes me about 5 minutes to get into the game ? 
Unbalanced teams. We often play 2 against 3. 

It's loading faster since the last time we played. 

2022
It's not bad, aleeeee ... Damn, what is it like when I have an internet ping 8 and it lags like a pig in the game. I wait half a day for the surroundings to load in the game, then the next half day for I to collect things a lot. This is really tiring and unreal. So far, few characters and I came across a great group. However, I don't understand the chopping, I still join the game, etc., as if I were playing in the jungle.

The graphics of the game do not dazzle. And thank God I'm not lucky as a colleague who waited around 15 minutes for the game, but the fact is that thanks to the lag it takes about 15 minutes before I play a lot and everything is rendered and loaded.

Thank goodness I didn't buy it, but again on the long side it's better than PUBG :)"
1961,"Great game and all.
But need to optimize it a bit"
1962,very nice but no oce server
1963,fun
1964,Its a fun game but ...
1965,"The trailers make it seem like it would be an awesome game. Unfortunately, I have no clue. As the first time i tried playing, i got stuck on a black screen while the music played, and i force quit the game after a few minutes. Then I tried again, and I get to the main screen where it says ""tap to play"" and it doesn't do a single thing except give an audio prompt that it seems to recognize my input. Did that a few more times, and now I'm just uninstalling this garbage. There's also something quite fishy with installing this game and it's permissions."
1966,"A cool design game. Played 1 match of a 3v3v3 (i think) named Bloodbath and it is pretty fun and 1 match of Survival (Battle Royale) for the first time and feels like only 2-3 squad with player only.

But they got battlepass... inside a paid game... that is something i really disappointed. But hey... somebody got to make some money... 
Oh well.. either way it is a good game"
1967,"i see a lot of people saying there is Chinese players and stuff, but all i got was fucking bots."
1968,Good game play however terribly optimised
1969,"Yes, but fuck these developers for making such a goddamn shitty ass, no mechanic explaning, ignorant fucking tutorial. They basically just teach you how move and press left click, missing out on the other 1,000 fucking mechanics of the game. Fuck you for that. But still a fun game."
1970,"[FREE Weekend Player]

its a bladepoint

won 1st game JUST SAYIN, 10 kills on the board quick play, then i stopped, ive attain god status or something

sword and heals seems to be the winning ticket

giant sword was cool

this is a terrible review

6.7/10!!! THATS RIGHT"
1971,"Worst melee combat I have ever seen. Who makes a melee game without a block button? Added to that the dodge doesn't even cover enough ground to actually be useful for dodging since attack areas are so wide.
Also it is impossible to run away from a fight as people can just grapple to you from crazy distances."
1972,just be quick like hashira XD
1973,"The game requires you to install it on an SSD. HDD or even a hybrid drive leaves the game unplayable with the severe loading issues. What is the game even loading, it's a BR with 1 map, if anything only the first game should be laggy, but it persists throughout your entire session. At the start of the round it's decided that loading the UI and menus aren't as important as loading the pretty grass and that highly detailed dragon thing in the sky which does not affect gameplay at all and you literally can't open the map or your inventory since it's just not loaded. After the initial loading debacle, you still get extreme stutters during combat which makes for a frustrating experience

Would the game be smoother on an SSD? More than likely
Would I consider installing it on an SSD? I wouldn't consider at all"
1974,all around fun game
1975,"So far so good really enjoying the trial. I’m thinking of actually buying it because it has a really fun play style for solos, I mastered the play style for the tutorials female character (can’t remember her name) in my first game and won the match! 8.5/10 would recommend!

it’s graphics are beast mode and everything is straight forward in the tutorial

definitely gonna get a few friends to jump in and come play with me sometime

I’d say it’s worth the money"
1976,Great game!
1977,katana
1978,"In a nutshell: just wait for Rumbleverse to come out, the open beta is coming in June of 2022. It looks to be a better version of the whole ""melee battle royale"" idea.

I played this game during the free trial period. The combat is very clunky and feels one dimensional. Imagine you are playing Dynasty warriors, but all of the generic rank and file enemies are removed from the game, and all of the Generals/boss characters are player controlled characters. Now imagine the combat is somehow even worse and slower paced than Dynasty Warriors. Now add a grappling cook that for some reason is a limited use item. The only thing that even feels somewhat good in this game is the movement, and parkour, that's it. This is one of the jankiest games I've played in a very long time. This game is also a free to play game that is masquerading as a paid game. What I mean by that is that you pay money to buy the game, but it is filled with microtransactions. Don't buy this game, it's really not good. This isn't worth the hard drive space, or your time."
1979,Solid
1980,Fun game. The Chinese usually kill you.
1981,"GOOD
"
1982,good melee
1983,This game is actually fun you got various game modes to pick from.
1984,Not friendly for new players and there are lots of people from other servers that are probably high rank on their original server that will destroy new players thus ruining the experience thats all over all its great once they fix this issue
1985,"The game deserves at least a 78/100. There are some server problems and ping issues but nothing that hinders the gameplay too much. 
It is also worth the price I guess. I didn't come across any hackers either, but the again I only reached bronze 2 so that might be a problem later on. 
I would also say that it is not a pay to win. 
The graphics are superb btw I hope they implement ray tracing at some point. 
I was also able to get solid 72 fps on max settings on rtx 3060 laptop."
1986,Not bad
1987,"Played NARAKA: BLADEPOINT during it's free trial window, it's not something I would pay money for, it's riddled with micro-transactions and the higher your level the more powerful you are over newer players. Combat is fun, hack and slash, but with some items not being balanced enough. The extra content for the game is useless, you will earn most of it within the first 2 hours. If the game went free to play, I would consider playing it, it was fun overall, but you aren't paying for a lot of 'content' just a lot of boob physics."
1988,no latam servers no buy
1989,lol nice
1990,"So I played this during the f2p weekend. Wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much! The combat has SURPRISING depth to it.

The entire dynamic between parries and focus attacks is an awesome idea. The entire skill ceiling derived from all the possible mixups, animation cancels and whatnot feels great. Some asian players that will inevitably wreck you are absolute monsters (and have high latency lol, but you can't deny their skill), spectating can be a nice way to familiarize yourself with all of this tech.
Different kind of weapons all have their specialty and they're fun to learn to play and to deal with. 3v3s can involve quite a bit of strategy and team fights can either end fast or be drawn out and intense with no clear winner until the very end.

There are downsides however:
[list]
    [*]it's a paid game with a f2p economy? (It's not too much effort to quickly get all the heroes and gameplay related tidbits through gameplay however)
    [*]It's a battle royale game, with all the problems of the genre, like being bored as hell when nothing's happening. Feel like TDM or conquest would be more fun. 
    [*]Population. This game should really be F2P. Even after 29 hours I sometimes find matches with some bots in it, and alot of chinese & other non EU players. (Now that F2P weekend is over, I expect this to get worse and worse)
[/list]

Srsly just make it F2P so it can shine."
1991,"the lag makes it impossible to play
its like playing dark souls with an input delay of 5 whole seconds"
1992,Actually... yep
1993,"A game created by Asians for Asians, but if you are an Asian at heart and can run a bumblebee backwards with your eyes closed, then everything is fine.
A wonderful fighting game in which any person with symbols in the nickname will not let you get out of a state of shock and will send you straight to the main menu.
I recommend it with all my hundred and thirty limbs!"

1996,Way too much contents behind paywall. This should be a free to play game in the first place.
1997,"Great combat & visuals.  
Every other aspect of the game is bad.  loot boxes are the worst trend in gaming since pay to win.  slow progression, ""talents"" are not meaningful and progress very slowly.  The ""Click on multiple sub menus to get all your rewards"" mini game is a bad design choice, It simply feels like work, and the ""rewards"" are effectively cosmetic.  I never played fortnight, but I understand that the basic game play is mostly the same, but with melee weapons.  I now know that I hate ""battle royale"" games, so there's that."
1998,Make the game free
1999,"Set up against bots when trying to play an actual match.

What a joke."
2000,Good Killer Time run around find good gear
2001,"Its a good enough chinese apex legends with swords, but its ruined by two major things:
1:The servers arent regional so chinese players with bad ping are basically untouchable and you dont even see them until the game catches up and you teleport to the death screen.
2:The game should be free to play, monetisation is more apparent here than in any other f2p battle royale, but it still costs 20 dollars. the prohibitive price is probably why the servers are empty and it takes 10 minuites to find a non-bot filled match"
2002,Mechanics and design are really good. Some voice lines sound really strange and out of place though. One big problem is that it is unplayable without an ssd. I tried it on my hard drive and it stuttered like hell.
2003,"I truly enjoy this game. The graphics are amazing, the mechanics are smooth and unique, and it's not hard to pick up for new players. Good game, well play !"
2004,"eng:
if the game was free, then the number of players would increase significantly. The number of donators will increase in parallel. And the donation, in turn, motivates developers to make the game even better. the rest of the game is just gorgeous, the graphics are on top, the combat system is excellent. in short top game. sennin recommends!!!

rus:
если бы игра была бесплатной, то число игроков значительно возрастет.  Число жертвователей будет увеличиваться параллельно.  И пожертвования, в свою очередь, побуждает разработчиков сделать игру еще лучше.  остальная часть игры просто великолепна, графика на высоте, боевая система отлично.  короче топ игра.  Сеннин рекомендует!!!"
2005,"A horrible experience.. I never seen so much lag since my days playing Duke nukem 3D over 56.6 kbps. I swear it took 10m to load the map before I could even move or pick up items. What is sad is I still managed to get a kill streak. Kudos to the devs that crafted the graphics and music, but your server performance and capacity are the worst I've seen so far."
2006,"Boring gameplay. Combat is floaty-ish. Art and character design are good but kinda inconsistent. Fine game for casual gamers. If you want some more depth in combat, this isn't the one."
2007,someone buy me this game pslsss
2008,"As someone who doesn't like Battle Royales I am loving this game, it's fun, fast paced, very polished, has a very solid and rather intricate combat system when you learn it and start to verse higher ranked players, ignore the crybaby Americans getting dumpstered by Chinese players, they are just crybabies, I play on SEA being Australian, so I verse Chinese players almost every game and still have a decent amount of Sole Suriviors."

2010,"I was disappointed by how much this felt like a regular battle royal (but with an emphasis on melee). There is an addicting quality to this game and I think that the general gameplay is relatively fun. 

But this isn't worth my time, let alone my money. Your mileage may vary."
2011,Bing Chilling
2012,"Trash game, really. Boring fighting mechanics meet with greed and incompetent devs. Game is only good for stealing your money. Avoid this cash grab BR copy pasta."
2013,游戏流畅多了，现在终于算可以正常玩的游戏了~
2014,Super interesting concept for a BR. Loved the stealth and movement mechanics. Only wish the community was bigger so there weren't so many sweats.
2015,good game
2016,the          bast  ~_~
2017,cool game fun too play they need to region lock china as most hackers are from that region.... the coffee shops they play at have hacks preloaded for these dudes... take a page from pubg their player base died because of the same issue.... it is fun if you get on early in the day when they hacking china men arent flooding the NA servers because they dont want to have to compete against other hackers in their region...
2018,Good game.
2019,"I have only played free to play weekends so take my opinion with that in mind. 

My main complaint from a F2P weekends standpoint is that the servers are not good. 
-Long waits for Lobbies
-NA server ping would spike as if nobody plays and I was switched without my knowledge to an Asia server upon entering a lobby
-Often times loading into a game I would have to stand around for 5 mins waiting for the Hud to load in before anything but movement would respond. (Unable to pick up gear or interact with caches)
-I would often get a red bar connection error when another player was near by, not all the time but enough to become frustrating.
-Often times unable to hit players or move in combat when you should have been able to
Other than that it is a fun game to play and would purchase if my experience during the trial didn't feel like I would be paying for a hacker fest. And for this I will have to say I will not be recommending you spend money on this game."
2020,brainless fun
2021,Refunded. I really dont like it.
2022,"truly the greatest experience of my life. This game cured severe depression i was experiencing from my other games like minecraFt and robox. Truly, the creators care about people and their experiences while playinfg this. They really put the time and time and time to think about each individual control, enemy variant, and playstyle. 

Sometimes ill get 500 ping but it never affects my experiences, i love going against chinese players in the US servers and getting absolutely shit on.


Thank you popcap, release pvz garden warfare 3 please. Muah 


' :D"
2023,It's a great game however there is a lot of bots
2024,Great game which is alot of fun so far. I like how it has a bunch of these stat things that are ultimatelyt usless because skill is all that really matters. But charging $20 for a battle royal with a battle pass? Buddy at that point My MGRR or DMC5 if you want a game like this.
2025,yes
2026,nice game ever
2027,this game is super dookie and booty that my mom thought i was playing with shit.
2028,This game is terrible you get put into infinite combos by literally anything and get jumped by 3 people and cant move its terrible im so glad i didnt spend money to pay for this
2029,"this isn't it chief, combat feel lackluster, have the formula of a mobile Free to Play and 80% of the playerbase are chinese"
2030,Super duper coolio game
2031,">:) 
"
2032,"Ninjas meet fortnite, results? This, 8/10"
2033,"Could be fun, would take way too long to get good enough to enjoy yourself constantly being matched against laggy semi pro Chinese players. Has the potential to grow but not if people just have to buy the game to get their shit pushed in."

2035,"Tossing down notes as i play

Pros
1.The combat feels nice overall and the only real downside is parrying has a weird delay.

2.It's graphics looks pretty good overall but once the fog rolls in while your in a forest, That 
b*tch comes to life.

3.Overall the game puts me a good mood.

4.Buy into the battle pass,keep maxing them out & you'll never have to pay for another bp.

5.The character customization is pretty decent.

6.Overall decent voice acting,besides tarkas jis english voice actor. Trash tier va.

7.The devs give out a decent bit of free stuff through the mail.

8.Overall both maps decent & the second map brings in weather effects,I wouldn't mind seeing some added into the first map.

Cons
1.They do the scummy thing with micro transaction where they just under cut you the amount you need to force you into buying more.

2.You get duplicates of items from loot boxes.I do not care that we get a higher chance of getting a better bit of gear, that is a non issue because if it was done the normal way we would of gotten all the trash gear out of the way and then only get the good stuff but that is the real issue since they only want to drop loads of money to get that outfit you want.

3.You can't change the color of your armor due to them wanting you to waste chest rolls on the recolors that are already in the game.

4.The game crashes, So far only twice.

5.Tarka ji english voice actor is god awful.

6.Need to region lock the game due to not being able to communicate with non regional team mates.

Thoughts
1.I would like to see a beast master,summoner or shape shifter hero added into the game.

2.I would like to see fist weapons added to the game because pridefall & starfall show off how cool it can be."
2036,"Another game tainted by the Chinese Government.

I'm getting sick and tired of these titles being pushed by communist agendas. 

I won't give this a negative review based on principal that the developers will see reason. 

Steam has already banned China from the international scene yet we are stilled forced to play with them.

Don't let us meddle with a toxic fanbase and expect us to just keep playing like there's nothing bigger going on.

This is a pretty solid game in its own right though the servers are pretty sketchy.

Naraka is much better than other Battle Royales that's for sure but it has a long way before it gets proper footing. 

They really need to make this Free-to-play like PUBG did. 20 standard USD is still a large asking price for shovelware.

Also pay-to-win is a big no. Shouldn't be a surprise China wants to take over the world at the expense of human lives.

Please just avoid this like it's the plague. Do not buy this or even play it."
2037,nice game
2038,"The game has a massive potential in terms of Game play but the fact that they don't look into the pretty much dead Player base doesn't change.to get placed in a quick match,the average queue time is around 10 minutes.and halfway through the game i'm hit by high ping warning around 10-11 times.Wanted to enjoy the game but couldn't when the game is only multiplayer and multiplayer is terrible."
2039,When punching is stronger then a repeating crossbow you know this game is terrible lol. Do not buy this game I tried it on the free trial and its not worth it trust me fellas.
2040,yes
2041,Gud pley
2042,very very good
2043,ok
2044,"So I was hesitant to get this game after reading some of the reviews.  But my thinking was like I spend 14 bucks on 2 coffees so no big deal. I'm glad I did. It's a fun game smooth mechanics, cool fighting styles and great graphics. I saw a few comments saying that the cheating was bad and there was a lot of lag switch use ... I didn't run into any of this granted I have played for that long but if it was as bad as was mentioned I would have ran into it at some point in the 2 hours I played right? Well I did not. But the way some of these others reviews talked about it was like it was a huge problem. When people say the cheating is bad.... ! First two games to pop into my head are GTA5 and CoD Warzone. That right now seems to me to be the pinnacle of cheating and modding.  What I did notice was a huge skill gap between east vs west players but even thats laughable at best in my opinion. So naturally I applied the most common excuses used by inexperienced or bad players to save face and that is lag or cheaters. Yes in the beginning you will experience a ton of bots but to be fair it says that as you load into games and it nothing new! Fortnite does it! PUBG does it! Again to be fair you don't have to make an initial purchase of Fortnite and now PUBG either but its neither here nor there.  The question is do you want to play a fun game? No its not gonna change your life. But its fun and fast paced and its great when you just want to play a quick BR. Take it for what it is and not for what others make it out to be and thats fun in my humble experience 💯."
2045,Good game. Weeb paradise.
2046,"- full of bots -> boring fights
- no FOV slider"
2047,"this game is a great take on a melee oriented BR - fast paced and fluid in nearly all aspects... now let me tell ya, I have been absolutely destroyed in this game by better players, and some how I have done some destroying... DO NOT LISTEN to the people complaining about players from other locations using VPN's... trust me when I say... SKILL ISSUE"
2048,nice
2049,"I don't really like Battle Royal games, but this is kinda fun. Unless you paid for the game that is. I understand how cool customization in this game were but I don't want to pay quite a bit of money to play PVP games that still need quite a sum of money to dress up my character or whatever the whole selection of costume are almost the same but changed colors. I find it boring as like any other BR games so I don't like it but If you do like BR games, this is some cool shit if you are willing to pay the price that is."
2050,This game has huge server issue
2051,this is basicly dark souls battle royale and its EPIC
2052,"Fantastic game, best BR on the market, no questions asked."
2053,Best BR game on the market dawg ^0^
2054,"Picked it up on the sale when a friend of mine told me about it, never heard of the game and looking at the page I assumed it was gonna be some terrible Asian-Inspired port to PC that's gonna be janky, poorly translated and just way too complicated. BOY WAS I WRONG. This game is CLEAN, the mechanics are tight, the movement is amazing, graphics have done me well enough and the overall playing style is just perfect for me. No poor translations, no janky mechanics, just a clean well polished game, and I look forward to playing more. I actually bought the complete game 2 hours after playing the Trial, it was great.

Plenty of glasses and abilities to chose from to suit each playstyle, plenty of customization options, battlepass and quest systems really have me coming back and back again! Deffo worth playing in my opinion!"
2055,"The ranked matchmaking system as trash, the Skilled, Normal, and pretty hard hierarchical system is unprecedented trash that only someone with a mental retardation could come up with.
"
2056,"first battle royal with close combat =) 
Interesting to play! 

Problems I found in first hours: 
- no master volume in audio settings
- default graphics settings too low for my PC
- default voice communication setup is a bit weird
- gameplay ping system is not so responsive as in APEX"
2057,Beans
2058,Most fun ive ever had playing a BR
2059,This review will change to positive once I die to someone with an English name on NA servers.
2060,"good game
needs better servers that aren't proper ching chong"
2061,กระบี่ผีเสื้อดาวตก 2
2062,It's a great game when its able to run
2063,Its fun
2064,vry fun
2065,fun
2066,"Uhhh... with all the chinese players stampeding arround it does not feel like I'm in EU -.-
Fun game but you should hear your players feedback..."
2067,anime battles but as a game
2068,"A fun game, just wish it was free...
Also needs a Japanese male character, maybe a ninja or samurai. There are two Japanese females but no male :("
2069,bro my fucking avatar is so sexy https://imgur.com/a/hFKUjrm
2070,"It is pretty fun, I may buy it when the free trial runs out."
2071,"After only one match I am hooked. The Quality and small details are really what makes up this game, This is one of a few games I have seen that has tried to make a gimmick battle royale and has worked with flying colors. I was never a fan of Japanese culture or animation but I still love this game and cant wait to see what the developers intend to do with it."
2072,Great Battle Royale game been wanting a Melee based Battle Royale for a long time now
2073,Can't play game unless i put it on my c drive which I don't have space for on their and it lags so much i can't play
2074,it's really fun with its combat and whatnot very fun so far
2075,"Ok, this is really wild action. I am only on wild weekend, but if you really have fast fingers, lot of time, and love Japanese anime and culture go straight for that. 
For me it was too wild, and game from another world, but even i spent only one hour in this, i can not say any bad words on this.
Loading time fast, optimaztion good, technologically all fine. 
Me happy and i can recommend to my friends."
2076,"Fun for like 3 games while fighting fellow noobs then you redeem your compleated quests level up 10000 times then get put into games that have players who have spent years of there life playing this game abusing the broken stun lock
"
2077,W game
2078,:D
2079,good game :v
2080,"Took me an hour to just get into the menu :<<
the character customisation is the only good thing"
2081,"Great concept, awful execution. Good thing I didn't buy the game."
2082,I Make Goblin People
2083,Game is pretty fun and combat is fun as well.
2084,great br wish it had more of a playerbase though
2085,Rank system is so bad when you get highest rank with this game combat system
2086,"Unplayable if you only have a HDD. I hope they release the console versions this year! 

Still recommenting though because of the gameplay/content I saw, and they clearly warned us in the first menu for an SSD."
2087,Big YES for this hen.. I mean this beautiful game.
2088,shing shing shing
2089,"This game should be on Unreal Engine 5
Unity is very shit
please developer if ur seeing this port the game to UE 5"
2090,"Not your average battle royale; You really should give it a try on a free-weekend and see if you like it.
This game can get really hard even for skilled players - even in QUICK GAME - there are many server-hoppers and rarely but it does happen to have a few cheaters.
Leaving that behind, the game takes a lot of skill to master the combos, parries, and learning the map can also help.
Graphics are decent, the animations are great, however, the game still needs some work from the devs. Though I really hope it won't become like ""NetEase"" games, with pop-ups and too many microtransactions, since a lot of chinese-based games do that. (I am not racist, this is literally a fact, you can try most chinese games and you'll see what I am talking about.) 
Just enough weapons, there are Greatswords, Longswords, Nunchucks, Katanas etc. and range-based weapons such as Bows, Cannons and Guns too.
The game has lots of customization for your characters, and even an option to scan a photo and generate your avatar based on that, it's really cool."
2091,After i played this game in free to play weekend i must say that i love it and i wish if it's free to play
2092,Yes good game
2093,"It's all about skill, the more you play, the more you learn, and the more beautifully complex and balanced the game becomes."
2094,Crashing atleast 30 times per hour
2095,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! THEY WILL BAN YOU FOR CHEATING EVEN IF YOU DON'T CHEAT!


Glad I only played the Trial but then got banned for no reason wtf?
I didn't even cheat but got perma ban? wtf?
there's so many things wrong with this game. . . 

In bloodbath other people get 60+ kills I only get around 20~. So why am I the one getting banned?

SH!!!T game anyways. Not cheating but they determined as using cheats wtf. Glad I didn't buy this SH!!!T game. No explanations or whatever from sh!!!t devs.

SH!!!T GAME ANYWAYS. NOT CHEATING BUT THEY JUST SAID USING THIRD PARTY FOR CHEATING! LIKE WTF I DIDN'T EVEN USE A SINGLE TOOL.

No explanations, no specific third party software. Just got banned for playing trial lol"
2096,This game is an absolute banger. Defenetly recommend
2097,funny
2098,I'll buy this
2099,This game ate my life. New map is absolutely amazing as well.
2100,The only BR game I've actually enjoyed.
2101,"good game nunchuks broken use them while u can
"
2102,gud as mate
2103,"Albeit theres a few complaints to things like the wonky parkour, and how sometimes combat can feel super distanced with how the free camera acts during combat, it still makes for a fun experience, jumping around place to place and battling it out with some cool looking weapons
"
2104,game god
2105,sexy
2106,really fun
2107,bretty gud
2108,"The game will constantly stutter if you don't put it on a SSD, the game tells you that as soon as you put up the game.

It makes the start of the game glitchy as buildings load in the same way a heavily modded minecraft will load, piece by piece, taking a minute or 2 for your starting area to even render.

Then in combat, the stuttering is so bad that 90% of fights have either you lag to the point you can't do anything for a moment or will watch enemies standing completly still while under fire and not do anything.

Add to that there seems to be either nobody or almost everybody at once, I played a solo game, found nobody at the first base and 20 people, 1/3 of the lobby dueling at the next compound. It was like that earlier when I played trios but it really stood out in solo"
2109,"honestly really fun if you like battle royale games and ninjas.
"
2110,"One of the worst games ive ever played. truly an example of awful developers trying to make a quick buck. do not spend money on this unless you enjoy shitty awful games. rather play cod vanguard. Go fuck yourselves ""24 Entertainment"""
2111,"lmao, loot floating everywhere, 3 frames per second, soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo worth"
2112,alot of stuttering and do i need to remind you guys are sending info and money to CCP China?
2113,"Looks, plays and runs like a mobile game."
2114,Most fun I have had in a while
2115,"Game would actually be really fun, but the amount of fps drops you get is unbearable.
I was only able to see my characters face floating around when I joined the match, had to wait about 5minutes after spawning to be able to pick up loot.
You'll get about 50fps with constant freezes on a mid range PC (note: every graphic setting on low)
I also loved having max of 20FPS whenever I entered the damaging zone, pretty sure the developers intended to make the zone slow down time but it just lagged instead.
I would NOT recommend this game at it's current state, the game is full of Chinese players which end up killing you within one combo."
2116,GOD TIER CHARACTER CREATOR
2117,"あなたをあきらめるつもりはありません
決してあなたを失望させるつもりはありません
走り回ってあなたを捨てるつもりはない
決して泣かせない
さよならを言うつもりはない
嘘をついてあなたを傷つけることは決してない"
2118,"It's a pretty fun game with pretty fun mechanics.
It's a battle royale, but unlike other BR games, this one actually focuses on melee and combos. Which makes this game really fun.

The battle pass also has enough in game currency to let you buy the next one, although I wish the game itself is cheaper since a lot of single item cosmetic are kinda expensive for what it's worth.

Issues I'm currently having in this game tho is the fact that it loads so slow even with a high end pc. and the fact that it usually just makes you start the game, missing the waiting lobby.
Another issue would be the connection and file issues.
Otherwise, there's barely anything wrong with the game, it's pretty fun. 7/10"
2119,"Interesting game, doesn't run well on low end pc's or laptops. I was in a bot match and I wasn't able to hurt the bots and they couldn't hurt me, so I won after like 20 minutes by the shadow shrinking. The character customization is really fun"
2120,wow + fortnite + assasins creed
2121,"Its a good change from all the other Battle Royal games. It has a lot of potential and even right now its fun to play. I would recommend putting it on your SSD (if possible that is) cos in my case the game worked way faster and less glitchy. But thats up to you, I can recommend that game tho. I'm not a big BR fan, but that game really is fun to play. It's easy to learn, hard to master"
2122,"Shit game freezing constantly in decent mid range pcs. Literally horrible optimization, the tutorial map is so small yet running only 60fps and freezing like crazy LMFAO. Unninstalled."
2123,"very fun, i can slice things 10.5/10"
2124,"The combat is great, but the game is bogged down by the stale hero elements and the focus on battle royale."
2125,this game is ass play fortnite instead
2126,"it's like a really scuffed battle royale. floating movment, combat, ui :P"
2127,game fucking sucks ass fix your servers retards
2128,Region lock china shitters :D
2129,Really great game!!!!
2130,buga
2131,"I had a blast playing the Beta. The combat is amazing and I loved the fresh take on the BR genre, but I wasn't convinced that the game was worth buying. 

Now I'm back for the free weekend to check out what's new and could sway my opinions on this game, and oh boy it absolutely got worse. I could not enjoy a single game as it would take ages for all the assets to load with medium graphics. The game would have already sent me into the battlefield long before the pick up function was enabled and the frame rate drops harder than the two bombs that changed the course of world history. I am using a GTX 1660 ti which i have no trouble running Apex Legends, Cyberpunk 2077 and Elden Ring at high graphics."
2132,This is my transaction id: 3030369639399627813. I paid and deducted from my credit card. But did not receive in-game items. ask the game publisher to support me immediately
2133,"PLEASE allow tattoos to be placed anywhere on the face, it would allow me to recreate features on characters such as moles that I have in real life. Other than that it's an amazing battle royale."
2134,same same new name
2135,I've had to change my review because of chinese smurfs ruining this fun game. Every ranked game is won by a chinese guy with 300+ ping that you are unable to hit or counter. MAKE SOME SORT OF REGIONLOCK
2136,"so basically,you start the game,it gives you the most useless fucking tutorial you've ever seen and then it puts you into the main menu...confusing ass menu,after you find where to click to play you're thrown into the most random shit ever without any explanation what so ever,the tutorial served NO FUCKING PURPOSE at the start and i don't get the game,when it introduces itself like this i don't want to get the game,it's a terrible experience for a first timer and unless you're going into this shit already knowing where and what things are you will rage quit like i did...worst of all you're supposed to pay for this? yea,lucky it was free so i didn't waste money on this garbage"
2137,"The game is crap, most of the players online cheat. 

They don't even allow you to buy the Bruce lee outfit they advertised with the game as it was only a limited one off event used to draw in more customers. 

You also don't really get much in terms of rewards and the outfits you do get are rubbish , they look like European or Western outfits even Pirates, It would of been nice to see at least see one Kung Fu outfit with the traditional white socks and black shoes other than just the expired Bruce Lee outfits or the one other character that has them as an outfit. 

Overall its a dead game that a lot of cheaters , pay to win and losers with too much time on their hand will defend. I wanted to love this game especially after seeing them adding Bruce Lee to it ,  but they messed it up so bad. especially with the limited events & pay to play almost everywhere."
2138,this 𝓼𝓱𝓲𝓽 bussin
2139,"Only played 1 game so far and had a good time, the character customisation is hilarious and I recommend this game."
2140,"Wonderful game, the main issue is the lack of players in western lobbies causing them to fill with bots or people using vpns. Other than that a very enjoyable game! :D"
2141,cool but laggy asf there is only 2 servers ooooffff it
2142,"So far I've enjoyed this game, although I have on 53 minutes on it. I like the melee based battle royale style, and I enjoy the graphics as well. There's many weapon classes and characters to choose from with their own abilities and builds. My only criticism is that the combat can be a bit strange at times because of the movement and how you can't (that i know of) lock on to the enemy that you're fighting. Over all though this game is actually pretty enjoyable and I would recommend the game to others."
2143,nice game
2144,i think its good
2145,not bad
2146,"Not recommended at all, buy other MMO or Battle Royale instead.
The menu looks like a mobile game and filled with adds and also has battle pass in it.
The gameplay not great. just smashing button.
Should be free to play. It's not a special game,"
2147,no
2148,"it gud
"
2149,fortnite X elden ring but more eastern
2150,shit
2151,"I love this game, but getting shit on my a fuckin china mofo every game is tiresome. They just need to region lock the game, separating the no-lifers from the casual players. Either that, or they need to implement ELO."
2152,Great game!
2153,not my style of game but it is extremely fun. Anyone who likes battle royales and for honour would love this.
2154,"Very sastifying game, easy to understand and very fun with friends ! Those 20€ were worth !"
2155,yes
2156,kuvasza
2157,"YAYINLANMA: 28 TEMMUZ
This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control."
2158,veri güd géjm áj lájk di fájting mehaniksz ju süd dávnlód it. ;)
2159,"Introduces a whole new mechanic for fighting another player that i have not come across in any other game, if you are bored of the standard battle royale and looking for a challenging game with guns I 100% recommend this game."
2160,git gud
2161,nice game
2162,".
"
2163,ping
2164,"Good game
"
2165,"Honestly, such a refreshing add to Battle Royale-type games, fun, fast and the skills are nice.
Biggest issue is that being from OCE is not helpful for these games, there isn't any Oceanic servers, and the next in line is the South east asian servers, which i get 120ping, EVEN THEN, havent found a game since the couple of bot-forced games they put you in, in the very early levels of the game. Central Asian servers were no different, no game in over 25 minutes whilst willing to suffer 160ping to just play. 
I'm not a professional when it comes to video game marketing or production, but the almost $30 AUD price feels its restricting the game from reaching a larger audience, if it were to become free at some point i feel a lot more people would talk about ""this fun game that's free"" bringing in larger revenue and player base. but thats just my opinion.
3/10 overall experience. would be 0 if the game wasn't fun."
2166,STOP CHANGING THE EFFEN BUTTON LAYOUT FOR THE CONTROLLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LIKE NOW I DONT EVEN WANNA PLAY THIS CRAP. GET GOOD PLAYING IT A CERTAIN WAY THEN YOU CHANGE IT. AND YOU CANT EVEN GO BACK TO THE OLD LAYOUT CAUSE IT WONT LET YOU USE LT TWICE AS A BUTTON LAYOUT. YALL ARE DUMB!!!!!! FIRST YOU TAKE AWAY THE GAME SO OTHERS CAN PLAY AN MASTER GET BETTER THEN GIVE THE GAME BACK AFTER A YEAR OR SO THEN START CHANGING EVERYTHING! LIKE MAN. WHAT NEXT.. THIS GAME WAS A BLAST BUT STUPID PPL KEEP MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE. THX FOR THE CRAP AGAIN....
2167,"What a trash update! Why change the button to three options but make it impossible to use the old one! Goddammit!!!!!! Asians are stupid. they are just as phony as everyone else and are, for the 3rd patch in a row, ruining their game."
2168,Ping diff

2173,"Good game, highly addicting. Sometimes server lag though
All the people posting about asians just need to get gud"
2174,"pogg
"
2175,"This game is really hard to master. So if you want to be good at it, consider it a hobby, a skill to practice everyday. I got my ass kicked lots of time, hence I quit the game a couple times. However, I still go back and play. I really enjoy this game. Consider it a good e-sport. Hope it will grow more in the future, maybe even cross platform."
2176,new taste of close combat battle royale
2177,"The matchmaking seems to not be working correctly, either that or there's not enough players. Overall though, this game is good"
2178,good game
2179,Best BR in the market
2180,Nice
2181,great gaem
2182,"amazing game the movement and the feel of the character in most aspects is fantastic great job on the development of this game. There is also so much customisation  and great stuff to learn with the combat skills, thanks on making this game so good!!!!!"
2183,"good
"
2184,Good game but as and na player come into play SEA sever
2185,Amazing combat system
2186,"Melee combat and playing with friends is fun, after playing for some hours the game become repetitive and boring, matchmaking takes 5 to 15 minutes to play with pro players (chinese mostly), lacks of options like block, evation or reflect. Like in other games, stunt lock is the key (there is not glyphs/jades for stunt/defense stats)"
2187,titty jiggle to the left.
2188,gg
2189,make free to play so it can be big
2190,One of the best games I have ever played!
2191,"READ BEFORE BUY OR YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY
CHINESE PEOPLE MAKE GAME IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY!!

Daamn. I was so excited when i discovered this game few days ago. Looks like something that ive been looking for looong time. So i bought it. I enjoyed tutorial a lot. Few matches with bots also. But then something hapenned. Im playing on EU servers (says ping 40) but still have lags. ALSO, some BUSH LANGUAGE people just jumped on me newbie and kill me in way that i could even do anything, like they were mega pro players or something. Also, matchemaking didnt works, only for 1 mode, i wait in other modes about 4-5 mins and nothing. Why BUSH PEOPLE are so egoistics, its really that hard for them to be original, so they must abusing other players to feel better? Im glad i didnt played 2 hours, becouse i can still try to get my refund.. Big dreams, Bigger dissapoitnment. WIsh for game like this working perfectly some day.. Peace and Love (not for BUSHMANS!)"
2192,rubbish game used alot ram and memory to run but still lag and shown connecting
2193,no regrets playing this game. give it a try
2194,"Plays like Dynstary Warriors with a better counter system.

The battle roayle is similar to For Honor combat with Fornite play style."
2195,"good game play, but the game fuking filled with cheaters, reported but got no reply."
2196,great game to play with 2friends
2197,"A really good game graphic-wise and game play. The only problem is that not many people play it in some servers thus waiting time would be incredibly long or you wont be able to play at all. 

It is a good  game, still. Recommended."
2198,"Great combat, solo kill!"
2199,you ethier face a bot or u find your ass clapped by a random asian
2200,great game. great combat with a very high skill cap.
2201,too much hacker auto parry auto aim
2202,"matchmaking is beyond slow 
"
2203,This game is incredible.
2204,Successfully wasted a portion of my life!
2205,good
2206,anime apex <3
2207,gut
2208,Best game ever!
2209,"I own tons of games on STEAM but am terrible at making the time for reviews. This game is so awesome, that I had to!1 It is a very precise skill based game. Love it!!! Beware some crazy good china players, but also good players from around the world. I'd like to think of myself as a decent player running at GOLD tier in Harald's Trial singles. The reason why people are complaining about the good players is because they lack the skill set {different combos of mouse and keyboard} to compete in such an awesome game ;) Bring it haters! I have spent almost 700 hours on this game and I am still figuring out combos and counters. You can use a controller if you prefer. Sometimes it is hard to find an active game, especially from about 10pm PST on. Needs more players!  Definitely worth the 20$. Please recommend to your friends so the player base builds. I don't think many people know about this game. Spread the word people and take my word for it. Def worth the buy!"
2210,yes
2211,when i find the game.it gave me amazing.the great game is created by china company.the only game in my steam from china
2212,"good game
"
2213,"The game is tough at first, you will get slapped around by Asian players even now I still get slapped around sometimes. But the game has more modes than just RANKED battle royal, there is a quick match, and my favorite mode BLOODBATH which is free for all. If you tough it out you will get better and eventually fight on par with many other experienced players, learn new tricks practice them in training and try them out in bloodbath. Once you're confident in your ability shoot for RANKED if you dare."
2214,Hands down the best Battle Royale i've ever played. I love the feel of the PVP and diversity in customization and gameplay. It truly feels good to play.
2215,havent had a match actually start since winnging the 4th match i played
2216,"Fun PvP game with high skill cap, but not hard to play."
2217,"[h1]Naraka: Bladepoint Review (English) [/h1]

[b]Disclamer [/b]
The following is my own opinion and reflects my experiences with Naraka.

I am playing [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203220/NARAKA_BLADEPOINT/] Naraka: Bladepoint [/url] for 3 months now and have almost 500 in game hours.

I have listed the positive and negative aspects of the game below:

[b]Positive [/b]
[list]
    [*] Outstanding graphics
    [*] Regular updates
    [*] Community wishes are taken seriously
    [*] Playable with controller
    [*] Unique combat system
    [*] Many combo possibilities
    [*] Good tutorial
    [*] Friendly community
    [*] Few cheaters
    [*] Own lobbies adjustable
    [*] Fun game modes
    [*] No Pay 2 Win
[/list]

[b]Negative [/b]
[list]
    [*] Low player count 
    [*] Frequent connection errors
    [*] Not beginner friendly
    [*] Feels like there is no matchmaking
    [*] Poor marketing
    [*] Awarding of points in Ranked is not clearly presented
    [*] Translation is partly wrong
[/list]

[b]Conclusion [/b]

Overall, Naraka is a top game, the combat system is quite good, the weapons and characters are for the most part also balenct. 

Currently, the publicity around Naraka is the biggest problem. It is almost impossible to find this game through advertising. Paying big streamers like Shroud a huge amount of money to play it once doesn't bring big amounts of players in the long term. In my opinion it would be better to advertise on Youtube or other social media platforms."
2218,beautiful game
2219,niceu
2220,Nice gemmmm
2221,shit is lit
2222,"This game could be a great game, but with too many issues.
5800x + 3060 couldn't run this game perfectly 1080p. WTF. Hackers. I don't understand why all the Chinese games either P2W or with a lot hackers. 
No. Thank you."

2224,Fck Chinese tryhard players.
2225,"so hard to run on a 1050ti i5 9400f, 8gb ram lmao i have spent so much it just got worse after running good, fix the game thanks"
2226,nice
2227,ggggg
2228,So far I have only played for a couple hours. Wonder as to why im leaving a review after only a couple hours? Well thing is the game seems like it could be great but where the hell is everyone? I can only get a match started by myself in survival. you can't find a match in any other game mode. And if you do find a match it appears to be full of bots. This game so far is a complete failure and waste of money. With the population as is this game should be Free To Play. Do Not Buy This Game As A NA Player.
2229,nice
2230,sad chinese players ruining the game for EU servers
2231,good game
2232,lots of teehee not so many oofs
2233,"This game is really fun, just q ing times a bit longer than other games"

2237,rampant cheaters... anticheat when??
2238,"Game isnt not fun, however it runs bad"
2239,nothing bad about it
2240,Game is very frustrating after a few hours. Almost no English players.
2241,goddamn hard game but enjoyable
2242,very fun game that is controller friendly. Once this game gets to console it will be a very popular BR. Lots of customization and plenty of content to strive for.
2243,nice!
2244,EZ
2245,ok

2262,hackers and hackers on top of more hackers its pathetic
2263,no
2264,"dope, long queue times tho"
2265,Extremely fun game if you can get past the incredibly small hurdle of messing around in bot games for a while to understand weapon combos and movement tech.
2266,"Một tựa game hay, độc đáo, đáng để thử.
Rất tuyệt vời!!"
2267,DONT PLAY THIS GAME. TOO MUCH THINGS KEEP IN GAME
2268,Nice
2269,Sweatest game since GunZ The Duel
2270,Toàn update mấy cái souljade vớ vẩn làm game mất cân bằng
2271,"⦁ [b]visual candy[/b] - seems like new games side step or down grade on graphics 
   nowadays. PLENTY of settings options to play with.

⦁ [b]Full controller support[/b] you could spend many many hours tweaking controller setup's 
   & kb&m does not have a huge advantage like other games imo. each method has it +'s imo. 
   [b]REwasd[/b] is worth checking out if you don't like steams controller software.

⦁ [b]Good amount of different play style[/b] s, and plenty to grind to unlock and buy. between 
  Hero skill unlocks &  different weapons combinations used with those skills, there is plenty to 
  explore.

⦁ [b]It's CHEAP[/b] I mean it's kinda hard not to spend a decent amount of time playing. I have 
  116.7 hours in and IF i bought Ult. Edition at the full price and stopped there that's about a 
  measly .43cents an hour to  play!

   While i would like more choices of hero's to unlock at some point though...but ""sigh"" it's free 
   to play and nothing gets released Done anymore."
2272,"傻逼游戏，各种奇葩判定，还有BUG，策划脑子仿佛有坑一样，爱谁玩谁玩去。

2273,a this game is the veri a gud it have gud costmaization and free loot. overall great game i like the bot options and the greit fov setting. 69/10
2274,"its a fun game... but in its current state? its not good at all.  pubg had the same problem with latency issues and hackers from other regions that the devs do absolutely nothing about. region lock the game, problem solved."
2275,SIGH killed by @#%$#@$% again
2276,"All the negative reviews that cite the issue with Chinese players ruining the game for the NA/EU audience could not be more true. I read them, bought the game anyway to give it a shot and your very first public match you'll be greeted to just how bad it is trying to play against someone from China using a VPN. You can't hit them, you can't counter them and they'll land 100% of their abilities on you no problem. 

The fact that more of an effort hasn't been taken to remove these players using VPN's, lag-switches and other nefarious methods to get the upper hand in this game shows just how little the Dev's care about porting this game to the west. It's to the point when you queue into a match, just look for the players with Chinese characters in their name and you'll already find the winners of each round.

Couple the above with the fact that this game is basically a melee-clone of Apex Legends with a generic ""eastern"" theme and suffers from the same lack of new maps (any), that Apex did for months means you'll get tired of the same play each time. 

If getting face-rolled for hours on end by Chinese players in an apex-knockoff battle-royal game is your jam, then 10/10 this is for you. For everyone else thats sane and isn't a masochist, look elsewhere."
2277,"because they don't region lock you wont have a fun time playing against outside of your region due to latency, it comes down to a random encounter if you win or not and you can't fight on equal terms this way."
2278,This game is fun but it doesn't work at all. There is no region lock so everyone gets stomped by Asian group spammers. The que to get a game works about 33% of the time. MMR is in the game but it doesn't matter because it still puts you in a match with anyone so half the time you are really outclassed. They counter balance that by using your mmr to affect how the results of the match apply to your ranking but all that happens is you end up constantly outmatched and even though your rank doesn't go down the game stops being fun because you can't do anything. Like I said the game is fun but it isn't worth it if it doesn't work.
2279,Pretty fun
2280,"Awesome game, well made, such an amazing game.  If you like BR but hate the warzone/fartnite trash this is your dream come true."
2281,"This game is very challenging and took me awhile to get into but a can say, after getting through the crazy learning curve, this is one of the most enjoyable competitive experiences I've ever had in a game before and that's coming from a gamer who does not particularly like BRs or fighting games."
2282,I want better Control mechanics for player...  now is feel like Kid game with standard moves on AOE battles. For now i dont recommend for adult players.

2300,Great fun action packed if you take the time to learn game mechanics and actually play the game.
2301,fun but lags like shit
2302,not the best game but its worth to try it out
2303,Its a decent game pretty fun but other then that i would not really recommend the game unless you are crazy about battle royal games and weapon play styles
2304,a lot of chinese players that will win every match... but its fun to play till then
2305,Netease gives its staff a lot of paid props in order to make their staff win the game. To induce you to pay
2306,"If you're up to new experience of Battle Royal this game is for you :D. I like the sword fight mechanics of the game, especially the character customization. It's quite frustrating to die right away hahaha, all i need is a little more practice. Still enjoyed it tho."
2307,good game
2308,ok
2309,To be honest this game was quite good when it was released and etc. Used to play with some internet friends it. Now since of boredoom i came back and i was shocked.... Played few games and 95% players were japanese or whatever ever players using vpns and other things to dominate eu servers..... I do understant a bit of japanese and i overheard how fun is see european players get nuked by their 500+ ping.
2310,"Well, as someone who played this game for a good while since it's first release on steam and bringing along a few people...I almost near forgotten about this game, but I though I will review it as a returning player and a older player.

The concept of the game was a great idea, playing it, it felt smooth and rather fluid in game movement and fighting. Absolutely loved the first few hours of the game (0-100 Hours.) And then things happened IRL and got a new better computer. Upon wanting to return to the game, I was now greeted with a brand new prompt never seen before. 
Prompt: Please Disable HVCI_KMCI

I started to think that was a bit off..I Mean I played the game before without the prompt before I built my new PC...So I did some research. Basically it stops Malicious code from being Injected into your PC.. which is quite odd.. So I asked a friend who does Cyber security who just laughed and said don't disable it. if a program begs for you to that should be a Red Flag.

Soo, I stopped once again playing and dusted off the old PC that didn't have any of that to Test the game to see just how far it came...and oh boy...My reaction went from ""Enjoying the Game!"" to ""What the fuck is this shit"" in a few moments. I was so happy to see other servers now released for the world..but upon joining them I noticed they seem to just be dominated by players that aren't from the region the servers are in. After a bit of playing I have noticed that they are using Ping to their advantage and afterwards just given up on the game...It's quite sad to see that this has happened to a otherwise fun game.

I see the Developers seem to be replying to comments, but they just seem like a bot posting messages with the same thing. I feel like they don't much care for the western audience...and even if so the fact that HVCI_KMCI needs to be disabled being a red flag. makes me think this game is more of a Please Avoid at all Costs. Until that gets fixed.

It should be really easy to get fixed..seriously approved by Microsoft..basically from what I remember being told..Which is kinda once again a red flag. 

Until they fix these issues within the game please don't buy or spend any/more time on the game so the devs understand things need to be fixed. Even though I don't think they would lift a finger to fix any of the issues."
2311,this is a great  game. Needs more players and maybe cross play.
2312,fucking chines eplayers playing from across the globe 500 ping stunlock insane devs.
2313,"At first I had tons of fun learning the weapons and just having fun, but it was until i tries matchmaking that i realized ""holy fuck why am i waiting 10 minutes for a match just to get longsword spammed."" It was during this time I looked at the player count and saw it was fairly healthy so i was confused? Well its mainly populated by high pinged Chinese players. I lost interest waiting in the lobby for most of my 8.6 hours, $20 for a waiting sim."
2314,  The game has potential but it's plagued with horrible matchmaking that makes learning the game a pain cause everyone else you meet in game is a pro from the chinese servers which are much more populated
2315,"Just played 4 duo matches in a row with my gf and got second place every game. The teams that won every match were chinese vpn players that were literally lag skipping around us, thus making it impossible to fight back.


Chinese VPN players literally ruin this game and make it pretty much unplayable. It's a shame the devs don't care because otherwise this game has a ton of potential. Everyone needs to boycott this game until they get it together honestly"
2316,get gud
2317,"it is well made imho and runs good on my cyberpower despite not so great internet, im not amazing at the combat but to me it seems like a system you can almost progress in which is cool as opposed to pay to win but then again im obsessed about it and simply in love with every aspect of it that i cannot explain otherwise (as in technical detail). may have fogged my vision but at least on the surface, i see absolutely nothing wrong about this game cus im havin fun on it. high highs and low lows."

2331,Top tier bayyle royal imo
2332,15+ minutes matchmaking times in EU. Unplayable
2333,Great Game . I am enjoying it
2334,"Really fun, mixture of For Honor.

Edit: After 91 hours into this game, I still suck. It is really hard, it is more difficult to parry and fight if you are a lower level. For Honor is more easy, but this game starts off tough. Why? The match-ups. My man, I am only in SIlver 4 and they are matching my boyfriend and I with Astro/Solar I players. Basically the Challengers on League. It is satisfying to get kills, but you are mostly going to get out-matched by skills. Not a lot of helpful videos on youtube, since it is not that popular like Apex, etc."

2338,good
2339,trash game filled with chinese people only
2340,Not the first person to say it; You'll never play a game quite like this one.
2341,"no this game is unbalanced garbage, every single match is a loss against someone who stunlocks you clean to death, i tried playing duos, took an extra 15 min to find a match every single time, then once your in the match finally you run around for upwards of another 10 min just to find one or two bots who run in circles and get stuck on terrain, finally when you do find people the same issue happens  but with double the cancer! , now PAIRS OF PEOPLE stun lock you through max health and max gold lvl armor, tried different weapons, dosnt matter when the most effective option is a wave of attacks that cant be stopped some bullshit ult combo and a bitch who can stun you for 5 seconds but cant be knocked out of her nonsense, i wouldn't be so pissed if i wasn't forced to wait another 30 min to get out of that lobby, get in a new one then find real people to fight so i can actually learn the game.  i literally had another game open in another window to play while i FUCKING WAITED. thats called bad game design. if you cant get players in a match in under 5 min your doing something wrong."
2342,"Ну начну с самого начала, ТУПОЕ ГАВНО! ТУПОГО ГАВНА! Сделать подобие побевки из секиро конечно инетерсно, но когда в вас специально зайдут азиаты, у которых пинг за 600 вам пиздец, потому что игра поощряет пинг, в итоге получается что банально прожимая пирирование(я блять вижу как мой персонаж загорается красным) тебя убивают, ну а что, у него же пинг, и так постоянно, если тебе повезло спарировать противника - пошел вон, а если ты ещё легендарное оружие или броню нашел в самом начале игре то все, можешь идти в казино и выигравать свои деньги, посколько часто бывает что лутаешься но оружия или брини нет, и тут вылетает чел у которого уже есть как мин ср оружие и топ броня, а у тебя кулаки, при этом ты лутал легендарные кучки мусора, а он простые, и так ты оправляешся на помойку. Играть тут лучше всего только в компании с друзьями, если у тебя их нет... Ну будешь получать персонажей которые разбегаются момента в разные стороны и каждого из вас убивает сквад из 3 человек, даже никаких комбо не нужен, они просто будут спамить М1, а вы охуевать от вечных станов"
2343,"DEAD ITS DEAD. NO ACTIVE PLAYERBASE...

IF IT WASNT DEAD IT WOULD OF BEEN A GOOD GAME.."
2344,game is good but the ping is bad since im from SA
2345,"it took ages to play a match and peoples lvls are so different, i was playing with 2 strangers and then we could beat anyone, after reached the top 20, 3 random people came to us and one shot us like wtf its not fun and wasting time"
2346,The gameplay is fun but the game itself is really poorly optomized. I have a decent graphics card and 32gb of ram and my fps is under 20 on lowest settings so I definitely don't recommend. It also feels like I'm playing on foreign servers instead of North American servers which could also be tanking the performance in game.
2347,"This is (OPINION) the best battle royale playable today for the simple reason that the game by design does not overvalue aim and favorable RNG regarding lootable equipment over player skill and good tactics, offered by unique movement and environmental interactions.

To put it simply, players can find ways to comfortably play and be competitive without having to aim well, as ranged weapons are strong but outclassed by good movement. Melee combat still requires some form of aim, but it is not as unforgiving as other shooters in that if you cannot manage recoil in firefights, you just lose. Players need to be able to fight well, not aim well.

Reliance on favorable RNG from lootable equipment also becomes a non-issue as the game has ways for you to complete your preferred load-out through shops, 'supply drops', and overall, the size of the map compared to the number of players per round makes loot very abundant.

Playing against bots becomes a non-issue when you consistently make it to the top few survivors. Surely you don't expect to fight bots there?"
2348,nice game
2349,"To be honest, this game damn cb one, especially u're getting gangbang by a whole team and ur team mate still sleeping at other site. so i only recommend u if u eno cb or either pls dont play this game."

2356,"I wouldn't say its a bad game. Its really quite fun, and has great visuals... but the game play feels like just running around in BR matches full of bots until you finally meet some players when you reach top 2 teams and get destroyed by smurfs.
Wish I could give it a more neutral review but I personally don't feel it was worth the asking price (even on sale), given transaction models."
2357,"It pains me to have to write this review because I love the gameplay in Naraka beyond all words.

Gameplay wise it is my favorite Battle Royale title out there. (minor issues like stunlock abuse and strength of daggers not withstanding)

I cannot however continue to support its monetization system, which I believe is one of the worst out there in the PC gaming market.

You have the battle pass, thats fine and passable sure - every game has them now pretty much.

On top of that though you have the standard cash shop which is whatever.

Even more so, you have standard loot boxes but also seasonal ones, and neither box has duplicate protection.

In theory, you could spend over a thousand dollars in one season trying to get all the cool cosmetics you want out of the seasonal box and get less than half of them, thereby being royally fucked out of the ones you didnt get forever - duplicate items giving you a piddly amount of spectral silk (which has its own shop) as a consolation prize.

Even in Apex Legends, a game published by industry demons EA, loot boxes don't give you dupes.

There's also the issue of lag and VPN  abusing players from asian countries on the NA servers, which overall makes the game less fun for native western players who aren't god level in skill. Couple that with high prevalence of bots in public matches, even ranked, and you've got even more issues to be addressed.

I would say if you DO buy Naraka, only buy it on sale or buy the standard edition, and don't give them any extra money. Statistical averages show if you try to get all the cosmetics, you simply won't unless you're either lucky enough, or you have deep enough pockets to endlessly throw money at the game."

I didn't even get close to losing. the list of greivences goes on and on. don't waste your precious 20 dollars on this video game, go buy a different game like For Honor."

2387,"Editing this review a few months later.
I am now Gold 3 in Duo Ranking and I do enjoy the game way more than before.
All those cheaters are gone. Ofc, there are Tryhard gamers in this game but it is not impossible to get as good with some practice. 
The current Event Mode is super fun to play and the rewards as well. 
There is no p2w, only skins for characters and weapons and you get a ton of free stuff too.
With the crossplay there are way more people playing and it really is fun.
I do recommend this game but you gotta learn how to play it to enjoy!
___________________________________________________________

Old review for comparison. They really did a good job.

If you don't protect your game it ends like this: 
infested with chinese and general cheaters. 
You have 24/60 players in a game.
Barely any NA or EU players because it's not fun to play against ""esport asians"".
All my friends stopped playing out of the same reason.
We asked for seperate servers but no.
You can literally just ""buy"" cheats from websites which are undetected. 
What are the devs doing? Sleeping on it. 
Amazing game but I just can't sit here 24/7, making 34947 different macros and do animation cancel bs to get out of Silver 4 because I get ranked with top players and cheaters at the same time."

2402,"Game is pretty good, love the graphics and the character designs, but needs more players, its more content"
2403,good game. tarka ji's boobs are amazing. thanks
2404,"The game is full of teamers and overpowered things. Like infinite combos, combo ultimates that stun you completely until your dead like Tianhai and Valda. There's literally no counter to any of it and don't count on anything being nerfed either, the devs love the overpowered things in their game. They actually posted the infinite combo on their twitter and said ""Look at this cool combo""

Not to mention the abyssmal support. Reporting a player in the first place is a big hassle instead of it being a simple process and even then they aren't likely to respond or do anything even with video evidence. I loved this game and it had so much potential but I really don't recommend it. Right now I think it's terrible"
2405,nice game
2406,Battle Royal
2407,"best battle royale ive played but queues are harsh on EU servers unless you play with a duo. quite sad, i dont wanna see this game die for eu or na."
2408,trash
2409,Fantastic Game
2410,ok
2411,"stun locks are absolutely bullshit, first to get a stun lock wins, basically"
2412,"This is a terribly-terribly-TERRIBLY unbalanced game. Matchmaking in the game is awful because not only do you have to wait for long time for a match ( longest wait time i've had was 20min), youre matched against players who obviously WAYYYYYY ABOVE your skill level. The tutorial in-game doesn't prepare you for the fights in game, there are ton of aspects of the battle mechanics that you have to learn or else you'll absolutely get demolished when playing against real players. The first few games you play against bots, then you are punished by laggy, Chinese players overseas with bad pings, who have more experience with the mechanics. As a result, it makes it incredibly hard to progress in the game. The battle mechanics are detailed however certain weapons dont allow players to fully make use of it because players just spam combos. For example, Weapons such as the spear, nunchucks, and dagger have long, unbreakable, combo chains that can't be cancelled once your opponent has executed them. 

It would really make the 100% more enjoyable if it was easier to break combos. Until then, I have given up on this game sadly."
2413,Pretty awesome game. compared to other battle royal games this one takes skill and precise timing of hits to be good at. the close combat can be a rush to play through and its very fun.
2414,"best game trust

2416,"i wasted 20 euro on this game i reported soo many chinese vps players you have no idea even i went to twitch,tv and asked one of the casters/developers in the game and he told me to get a life,for everyone who's about  to buy this game//// DO NOT DO IT! dont waste your money on something you are going to rage about, the devs dont care about this game,also it pay to play and it has a payble battlepass and cosmetic store. Again do not buy this game i do not recomend it to any of you."

2418,"This game SLAPS, be prepared to learn the fundamentals though as it is VASTLY different from any other BR/Multiplayer out there and is more close to a traditional fighting game. So don't be surprised if you get your ass handed to you. The only major problem that his game suffers from is its lack of availability due to it being an actual Pay 2 Play model, making it so that there aren't many Content Creators and the matchmaking could suck big time at times for servers other than Asia. Easily a 10/10 for me in terms of actual gameplay and would have been a 11/10 perfect game overall if it just went F2P allowing for more players to not only appreciate the beauty of this game, but also allow legacy players to get quicker matchmaking."
2419,good game
2420,6
2421,Definitely a fun game to play if you are able to start. The only things I hate so far after playing for two days is that the matchmaking takes ridiculously long and lag at start. Expect to wait for 5-10 mins min. just to even get matched up in a game.
2422,Great
2423,I love this game but I just don't have the patience for the wait time.
2424,Super β
2425,"Honestly I bought this game to keep me busy until Elden Ring was released. It worked. Over all, it's good, just not really the type of game to keep me personally from coming back regularly, or a game I want to review further."
2426,"The game is good. But Chinese players and Chinese hackers are ruining it so I cannot recommend it. I have no idea how they are allowed on EU servers. If you are not a hardcore player with limited time, I would recommend it to only play with bots, it's easy, but it will save you a lot of nerves. It's still fun. Those players get all gold/legendary equipment straight away when the match starts and kill you so quickly and easily. You don't have any chance to react or run. I know there are ways to do a good combo, but this looks either like cheating or terrible matchmaking where you're being matched with skilled platinum players."
2427,60% of the time it works every time
2428,It's okay. Lots of bots or chinese.
2429,very interesting
2430,Everything about this game is awesome. I just wish the game was cross platform so that i can play with my friends and with other people in a larger community.
2431,So ADDICTED GAME
2432,"i am not usually into asian games, but this one grew silently on me since first hour. its like apex, but with swords and spears, abilieties are cool, game is balanced, no pay to win, you can spend money on vanity though. very good game i reccomed"

2434,"I love this game, the art is amazing, and hacker every where, so much fun :P"
2435,i like the booba shape nice game
2436,good game
2437,"IF ONLY I COULD PLAY THE GAME!!! I love Naraka:Bladepoint and I want to continue to love it but this game really makes it hard. First, I waited MONTHS until I could go out and buy a $200 ssd, as the game says to do, to try and help with the lagging/slow loading and that STILL DID NOT WORK. I have tried EVERYTHING to get this game to run smoothly. Trying to get into a match gives me PAIN like scraping your nails against chalkboard. My 13 hours spent playing this game is mainly me waiting for the game to load so it's playable. Once you finally load into the wait lobby, the countdown apparently started while you were loading in and you load in at the literal last second, unable to select your spawn point or character. Then once the match starts, you're still loading. I died literally within seconds of match start because i was still loading in and a person got a shot in on me. I couldnt even load into bot mode properly!! Ping is always SUPER CRAZY HIGH even with my high speed internet through ethernet cable. It has its good points that are mentioned by others below but the fact that I cant even play it overshadows everything. 

This game is not optimized at all and at it's price point, I can not recommend anybody buys this until they fix the issue. If you're one of the lucky ones who has a super powerful pc made by the hands of god himself with the finest hardware blessed by Zeus and Athena, then maybe this game will be right for you. I wish I could refund it honestly but until then... it'll collect dust in my steam library."
2438,pretty cool and fun
2439,"Overall I love this game and hope it has a long future. It is an online multiplayer game that has battle royale, deathmatch and survival modes. I don't care for battle royale games but I love this one.

Imagine Jade Empire like environments with Crouching Tiger/Hero moves and gameplay with grappling hooks and climbing. The character models and environments look great and the gameplay is actually pretty good. Kinda reminds me of gameplay from Black Desert. Loose, fast but also pretty solid.

The game is fairly priced and if Chinese mythos and ancient martial arts are your thing, I think you would fall in love with this game. I wish a single player open world RPG with this style and gameplay was a thing but for now, I think this is worth people's time while people are still playing it."

2457,Game is a fun take on BR games. Weapons are a bit unbalanced and you will find some games to be very frustrating because you will get stun locked and destroyed instantly. However that's pretty standard for BR (unbalanced weapons and instant death that is) so i guess its to be expected. Those factors aside still pretty entertaining and character customization is great. Love that you can make your character look completely crazy with purple skin and pink hair if you really want so 10/10 on that. All and all I'd give it a solid 7.5 or 8 out of 10. Recommend trying it for sure if its sounds interesting.

even on low setting i got 70fps with freezes and fps drops.
dont buy this"
2482,"I think Naraka: Bladepoint has excellent in game mechanics and feel. When you start logging hours practicing, you can really appreciate the combat and how fun and rewarding the game can be. Also, I think it's really nice that the emphasis of the combat is more melee oriented. There are bows, a single musket, a pistol, the legendary swarm... but it doesn't feel like CoD/Apex Legends/Overwatch, as these games have multiple SMG's/Rifles etc. I LOVE how the balance of each various weapon combined with character specific abilities feels in your hands. I could go on and on, great game. Getting crushed a lot, but am always appreciating the skill ceiling. Loved not having to spend hundreds of hours leveling my character to get to the end game too."
2483,aint worth $19.99
2484,"Gorgeous game very very fun, biggest complaint is queue times. The game isnt as popular as it deserves so you can wait up to 10 minutes for a game. But that fixes with time!"
2485,"Constant Lag switchers ruin any fun. First game, we fight 2 normal people good back and forth match, second team we can't hit them at all and they destroy us. 
Wait 10 minutes for another match and the first team we run into within 2 minutes of the match, same thing, we can't hit them, they already have legendary stuff. We go res, then have to fight the same team and go back to waiting on match making. 

Combat is great when it's against players with normal ping, but almost ever match is plagued with people you can't compete against."
2486,perfect graphics
2487,I have no problems except for the queue time.you see I have 38 hrs play time but in game I have 15h more than half of that is queuing up.even quick matches takes more than 10 minutes oof

2489,A great game ruined by bad netcode and a lack of server restrictions
2490,"I was suddenly permanently banned from the game. Customer service says I use third-party software when I'm in the game. But I don't. I feel I am wronged. Obviously did nothing but got banned. I also charged money to buy game skins, and now I feel like I’m at a loss when it’s banned. They didn't do a good job of checking and banned me forever. This game experience is really, really bad."
2491,awesome
2492,1
2493,A friend and I refunded this because it felt like every single lobby were 100% comprised of bots. Pretty sure we never fought a human opponent a single time
2494,"While Naraka; Bladepoint has all the interesting mechanics and a very much ""For Honor"" Like combat system, the game itself has a few crippling issues.

1. Unbalanced matchmaking - You are getting paired with people who are 100 times better than you.
2. No Region-lock, making it possible for chinese people and alike to join.
3. Extremely low player-base, sadly enough, this game is already in decline, and it shows in the queue times. Especially when i played during the morning my time, this game felt extremely dead, with endless queues, or very long queue times. (longer than 15 minutes)

At this moment, i cannot recommend Naraka: Bladepoint due to these 3 point primarily. Do not understand this in the wrong way, the potential is there, but there is a lot of work to be done to get this game to a sweet spot, and to become enjoyable.

For now it's a experience like this:

Wait 5-10 minutes in a queue to only get matched with and against people who are way too good at the game already, or that are learning the game, this mix is not enjoyable and quickly causes you to just close the game and forget about it.

Also occasionally has terrible performance, with lag spikes, textures not loading in and in my case, the game files even got corrupted by themselfs, which without any other option kicked me out of the game and gave me a penalty for leaving a game in progress. This should also be changed so that people who encounter problems like this and are forced to leave don't get penalties for leaving when the game basicly forces you to leave.

Maybe in the future this game will reach a point where it's enjoyable to play, but for now i cannot recommend it."
2495,"It's not too bad for a BR. Or at least, I get kills so I like it. The spiderman-like hook travel mechanic is interesting, and I like how you can edit most characters' appearance straight away. Gotta buy lootboxes for clothes, but hey, it's a BR."
2496,"The only BR I like, honestly. It's fun if you play casually, but if you care a lot about rank and winning, rather than just enjoying a game and being in an online community, maybe look elsewhere.

I love character customization, which is a rich feature of this game I wasn't expecting from this. Each hero has cosmetics, but nothing comes free, of course (which is annoying, but can be overlooked.) 

As a casual player, I recommend this game to others like me who just want to try a fun hack and slash BR"
2497,Not bad
2498,Naraka has made it into my Top 5 most favourite games so far. I LOVE IT. It's one of the most interesting Battle Royale games and I love the MMORPG like style ^^
2499,"hello,you should abandon other games to play this legendary production[although my PC can't afford it,but I still like it]

2525,"Let me start by saying that this game is easily one of the most difficult games I have ever played in my life. The learning curve is more of a learning 90 degree angle. They give you bots to smack around for the first two hours so you think you are good at the game and play past the refund time. Then you get hit by a brick wall of pain. Your cock will get ripped off. Many times. This game is unforgiving. The players that populate this game are either hapless newbies like myself getting free vasectomies every 3 seconds or ultra hyper pros that really should touch grass once in a while. (Insert comments telling me to 'get gud') Now, I was aware of all of this when I bought it. I read the negative reviews and watched videos. What bothers me the most is that I paid $13 for this game, (got it on sale), and was met with the most free to play system of monetization possible. You got a battlepass, which is to be expected, but also lootboxes, premium currency, and paywalled characters that you have to grind for.  You do get lootboxes through unlockables here and there, and you can buy them with the common currency, (although they are stupidly expensive and everytime you buy one the price goes up, which is bs. On top of that, you can only buy 4 or 5 every 3 days or so.), but that's about it. As far as I am aware, you can never earn the premium currency, and the prices aren't cheap. With this system of monetization, it should really be free to play. It feels like I paid for a slice of a game. Yeah I can play it, but all the sick costumes are locked away. Now I don't have a problem with this type of monetization, even in paid games, but in a paid game you expect it to be obtainable in decent amounts through gameplay. Don't buy this game. If it ever becomes free to play, go for it, but unless you are a serious masochist like me, forking over the cash for a cock and ball torture session with lootboxes is not wise. I will continue to play it though, because while the combat and gameplay is overwhelmingly difficult, struggling through to get that flawless katana combo triple kill triggers more dopamine receptors than crack."
2526,Good
2527,Yes
2528,Sooooo Sick!!!!!!!!!!!
2529,"Great combat, great movement, okay progression mechs, but all plagued with no region locked servers. Playing against high latency foreign players is unfair when the split second action combat fails. They can tout latency compensation all they’d like but it’s not a secret all the leaderboards for NA are filled with out of region players. You can even set your city and state to any in the world, a feature by the devs, why?? It should locate the closest cities to you and let you pick if anything."

You do play with bots thru silver mid way then its full lobbys of real people that match your skill! Its very hard to cheat on the game and idk how you can get away with cheating anyways on this game! I came to this game for the anime ancient hung kong feel. But most of all FPS games are going into the gutter... with the new strike pack controller mods non detectable with anti cheat and this game you gotta be smart but combo filled cant just push, have to know when to retreat!"

2543,"Naraka Bladepoint is one of the best PvP competitive games I've played.  It's a very high pace, filled with actions that will keep your blood pumping and heart moving.   I've started watching this game since it was in beta and purchased it when it was released, and I have to say that it's worth every penny I paid for.   This is one of the to-go games that I wind down after a long day at work.   The game has a diverse set of character choices as well as weapons.   You will always run into players with a different play style on the battlefield, and it forces you to think before you act.  I love the outfits! When you look good, you play better.  It has minor bugs here and there, but the game update frequently.  If you're still contemplating whether or not to get this game, you should just invest and start having fun! Whether you play with strangers or your friends, it's an endless experience.   Sometimes I find myself playing this game for 7+ hours straight because it's THAT addictive.  Don't mind the Chinese players; they're there to help you improve your skills.   The game would be boring if you didn't get challenged by better players.  Just keep practicing, and one day you will defeat those names you can't pronounce.  I'm looking forward to SEASON 20 and beyond of Naraka Bladepoint! <3"
2544,Fix your fucking server. Cause it’s a waste of money buying your game! Put a OCE server!
2545,Boring
2546,ok
2547,"I love this game.

In general battle royal is a fun aspect for me, but having the abilities to fight with swords and different abilities is quite fun!

Is it hard to understand the game? no, took me maybe 10-15 minutes to understand fully what I am doing yet I HAD and still have fun playing, manage to get first place in two matches (did quick match, my guess some are bots? can't really tell, yet some are players for sure, you can see the skins and outfits and so on). 

However, and this is minor I guess, connection can be a problem sometimes so make sure you have a stable connection without something that can effect it (don't browse or download anything while playing), also I advice a good PC, because the game is still taking a lot. 

So overall ? I love it, graphics are great, sound is good, weapons and the whole system is fun, I guess some heros are overpower yet it make sense, almost every game has this issues (Call of Duty with stronger weapons, StarCraft and so on).

8/10."
2548,good
2549,"every battleroyale is free WHY this game is not free?
Even PUBG is forever FREE."
2550,Nothing but Bots. I couldn't find anyone playing the game at all. very disappointing!
2551,"This game is amazing. It would be cool if there were more US servers, with better ping. The Hard Bots, are bad enough to feel great about yourself, but not quite good enough for higher level practice. The fact that the XP gains are giving it bot matches is sweet, as who knows what kind of player base this game will hold.. I purchased on a sale, and have now spent some IRL$ to make the cost difference to MSRP. Hopefully this game gets the full support it deserves. Could be the next Warzone, or fortnite, or even a solid choice in the moba space; given time."
2552,Nice game
2553,I love this game totally skill based and 0 skin to win
2554,boobies
2555,As far as a pvp battle royale experience I prefer this to most of the others out there. I do like that you can play with bots if you wish. I love the way everything feels from the combat to the graphics. Its a unique take on an aging genre. Is there some weird balancing issues at times yes and do some of the other issues mentioned I have only seen occasionally.  I do recommend for fans of the genre and basically everyone in general.
2556,"Poor combat, balancing, netcode. Game is boring and dead devs dont care about it and just want to milk whatever they can. Incredible disgrace to the BR community and disappointment of a product."
2557,"If you like battle royale but you are bored of the same shit all the time like jumping of a plane, looting, shooting etc.. You should try out this  game.  At start you will feel like  you are trash  at the game but a lil bit  of practice  should do the job and the cosmetics in this game are out of limits. They are too good!!"

I am a victim of a randomly select group of people who cannot play this game because it will not run properly. The game will run and randomly freeze/crash during a game. I've done hours of searching to fix this problem but have not found a solution. I'm not bothered getting rek'd by some dude with chinese letters in his name. I want to play, but the constant crashing has turned me away. Would revisit if this issue ever gets fixed. And no, this isn't an issue for everyone, but I fall in the affect group."

Other than that really fun gameplay, and very unique characters. I wish they would work more on server managing, but that's my only issue 8/10."

hope this game is given for free so more players will play."

2582,Enjoy anime style dueling like crazy without the masochism of a shooter royal.

2588,"Played whole first season. Awesome combat, weapons and characters. Sadly there is no new map or any bigger changes that would make me play more... Still if you like high skill combat I do recommned checking this game out."
2589,Goood
2590,Do NOT Buy It! Use the money to buy any other game!
2591,"Really smooth gameplay, actually better than latest Assassins Creed. Interesting combat system which looks like For Honor.
A nice introduction for begginers and an adapted matchmaking which raise quickly in difficulty. 
I recommend playing this game even if you are not particularly interested in battle royale.

I would enjoy a story or coop mode."

2600,"Overall good game but a lot of unfair matchmaking in games, for example in a competitive game you'll be matched up with people who are way higher than you even though you've just started and getting into the game. There's also an issue with people using VPN's to play on EU servers which makes it hard to fight against them as they lag. Combat is good, easy game to understand but matchmaking is a big issue"
2601,very good game
2602,Just try to create more characters. To create more posibilities to play
2603,SUPER easy to start and get playing loved the fighting and looting system
2604,"Great game, I enjoyed playing it while using the free trial. Definitely a better experience playing with some friends as opposed to solo but fun nonetheless. The game in itself is a breath of fresh air in a battle royal style. It doesn't feel like you are playing a battle royal at all. It's almost more of an open world mmorpg type of feel. It also has controller support and you are easily able to map the controller to your liking. (ps5 controller)"
2605,Really fun if u want a battle royale with sword combos and new abilities to unlock.
2606,"very nice
"
2607,"once u get used to the control scheme, its very enjoyable,do not skip the training"
2608, this game is so much fun to play I like it so much
2609,Ayo just know it's fun. But these servers are being invaded.
2610,"Good, Very good!"
2611,"the network connection is really poor, good game but bad connection can't play a decent match"
2612,good purchase unless ur pc sucks
2613,POGGGGG
2614,"Great game but lack of players, make it free to play or watch it die completely, dumb developers these days..."
2615,first time playing the free trial ...liked the game .The only problem was that my character moved in slow motion when she ran and battled other players . I don't know if its because I'm a USA player ...I didn't see a NA server. You guys need to let the player hold more food in their bag .
2616,this game is fun the only problem i have with the game is the price i wish it was free i feel like it would be more popular if it did not cost 19.99$ other then that it is a grate game
2617,"TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD"
2618,"Don’t let the negative reviews steer you away. Personally I’ve been having a lot of fun playing Naraka and haven’t had any issues with this lag or Desync everyone is talking about. The game looks great, runs great and I can tell there is a high skill ceiling to this game and a lot of different abilities and possibilities in why can happen in a fight. There’s the survival mode which is just a standard 60 person battle royale basically, and there’s “bloodbath” which is like a free for all deathmatch which is nice to get some practice in against other players. The combat is really in depth, this game has movement to master, combat, parrying, dodging, abilities and aiming with ranged weapons. The queue times are somewhat long sometimes ~5 mins but not too bad and sometimes they are instant."
2619,Was sceptical but its a fun game. Don't usually play BR but been having fun.
2620,AMAZING GOOD GAME !!!
2621,not bad i like it but the dlss look like nothing improve in this game at fps
2622,not balance at all

2625,MAKE THIS GAME FREE TO PLAY THE SERVERS ARE DEAD

(Edit: the Chinese are too strong, also not enough players for proper matchmaking but i still like the game)"

2631,Asian invasion on European servers.. They are using a VPN and have a bad ping which gives them an advantage.. Don't play it if you don't want to become a racist..

2640,"+Nice concept
+Can make chinese friends, that don't speak english

-Bad Execution
-Can't fight chinese players for obvious reasons

6/10 We don't need more battle royale games."
2641,After playing free trial i would love to play it again cause its diffirent from other survival game nice graphic and skill but the problems that stop me play this again is i dont hv any money left to buy this :(
2642,"If you aren't bothered by the 5 minute queues to get in a game, then not be able to pick your landing spot because the game doesn't load, then when the match starts, experience even more loading problems, you can love this game as a unique sword-fighting battle royale. I love the game regardless but I gotta be fair, they should've fixed the optimisation long before I even bought the game, the game is out for 8 months man. Plus, You can only buy stuff from the virtual shop via USD, no other currency. Why is that a problem? My country's economy is not doing so well, I would love to buy stuff but it's too expensive. If the optimisation gets fixed and things become less expensive for foreign players, I'll be happy. BTW I have this downloaded on my SSD too, just so all of you know."

2666,Good battle-Royale gameplay with amazing swordplay mechanics and movement.. Sad that no Indian servers though.
2667,this game is free more fun!
2668,"really good game, i have lots of fun playing it"
2669,yes!
2670,Love it when the chinese players come to Eu servers and completely destroy you.HATE IT!!!
2671,I don't do reviews but I will for this game. it sucks. 0/10 would not fight robots again.

2678,"Game is either dead in EU or it purposely makes matches where 90% of the enemies are bots. It seems like per games theres only about 1 or 2 real teams, rest are brainless, running into walls bots."
2679,Downloaded. Couldn't see any friends. Deleted. It's f*cking trash.
2680,"Matchmaking times can be a bit long on solo... but aside from that, wonderful game, Nice change of pace in the battle royale genre."
2681,"There are Hardcoded keybinds, i play with ijkl instead of wasd as i'm left handed, i literally cant move because j is hard coded to a Pop up , so it's simply unplayable (there's a few more like p removing UI etc).

If your not left handed or don't plan on rebinding anything as to not avoid landmines than it feels pretty good, love the grappling."
2682,"Love it when the chinese players come to Eu servers and completely destroy you by pressing m1, literally no counter play to lag because you get sniped by a dagger"
2683,Hmmmmmmmmmmm
2684,this game is so good for competetive players i recommed
2685,"Might as well be free with the amount of transaction to the game. Rather play games like FFXIV where I know my money will be spent making the game good and not cash grabs. For 25 usd you can't even buy a skin. Need to double buy for that. Rather spend 25 usd on upgrading my ship in Star Citizen where it will retain it's value by melting.
Recommended anyways.
(edit)Was going to buy it but matchmaking is utter $###."

2689,I am actually surprised by this game. Lots of fun! Too bad it's not free to play so that would be a larger player base.

Update: Many months later and still can't fine a game in a reasonable time. Waited over 10 minutes only to close the game and INSTANTLY gets a match in BloodHunt. 

If youre an NA gamer then this game is sadly not for us. No one is playing it, might have something to do with the chinese VPN users and long as hell wait times."
2700,10k ping
2701,"great combat, awesome design, fluid mechanics. great game"
2702,"nice , but marketing like...."
2703,"I absolutely love this game, it is unlike any other I have played in terms of movement and mechanics. The graphics are great, there are fun events, and it is a great game for those with a competitive attitude. That being said, the player base in NA is quite small, which can lead to newer players playing against the top rank NA players. While I enjoy this most of the time, I sometimes find it discouraging and can see that it may have an impact on new casual players who are not so competitive. While there are some imbalances with each season the team generally listens to the community and corrects them. One issue i would like to see addressed better is anti-cheat and prevention against teaming in some way, these are both serious problems to have in a BR. Overall the game is amazing and easily one of my favourites, it is fun solo and even more fun with friends in duos or trios. I would highly recommend giving it a try and if you enjoy it then you will not only have fun, but help out the rest of the player base as well."

2714,"bad optimization, the ranking system in this game is bad, u can be put in a lobby with people who have played more than 500 hours even when u have only played around 30 hours. This causes the new people who have just bought the game to not have any game experience unless u keep playing day and day until you're good enough at the game."

2719,very fun

2721,Such a good game for hitting
2722,ok
2723,"A battle royale that is actually about discipline and skill instead of who can scope the odd dot in the trees a mile away. I wish the team ranked (trio and now duo) system was a little more punishing than it is, as well as having requirements before going into ranked - many lower skilled players will treat ranked as their tutorial/time to learn the game instead of just booting into a quickmatch. Im enjoying the seasons, the metas, balances, etc.
As per every competitive multiplayer game - this game will bring out the toxic rage induced side of you at times. But no other BR compares to the sheer adrenaline rush you get when you are battling for the last team standing position. Chef's kiss."
2724,"Probably the only Battle Royale I liked.

I fell in love with the aesthetic of the game at first which is what made me want to try it. The character designs, and the maps are exquisitely designed. 

When I actually tried the combat, it felt so seamless and realistic. I love it. The learning curve is quite large and actually requires skill and not just spamming the attack button. I like that they also managed to add in nun-chucks as a melee option. It's also not P2W as you only pay for some cosmetics, all the characters and some skins can be bought with in-game currency and there are also a lot of events that give out free cosmetics through limited-time quests."
2725,"good graphic
realistic
enjoy"
2726,its a great game but the sweaty people who are not from NA make it hard for people just starting

2729,Nice game especially for the combat system
2730,6666
2731,i got no balls
2732,"I love this game, it's superb, absolute killer in terms of mechanics and gameplay. However, the matchmaking times are mind blowing, which is certainly not something you'd want on a BR.

I'd recommend playing this game when the player base gets more beefy and/or they optimize their matchmaking times"
2733,.
2734,didn t know it was a battle royale
2735,dead game & take long time for finding room
2736,"Stun lock makes this game miserable, Trios is a spam fest as well"

2738,"Message of the medium: marvelous sugar baby

Symbolizes the forced labor of african slaves used to produce a sought material commodity for the rich (aka capitalism)
Excessive consumption of sugar leads to diabetes and obesity = segregates the poor and the rich with how sustainable their food and quality of health is

Sugar used as a stereotypical metaphor of the hyper-sexualization of black females
Sugar degrades over limited time j like self destruction of black females imagery 
Fragmentation of african women's bodies = labeling body parts = used to disenfranchise and sexualize black women 
"
2739,"the game itself is really nice. has a high potential which its already kinda using and the characters are really pretty (+skins). but one BIG problem: chinese high ping abusers via vpn, which always kill you and you cant do anything against it. sucks and kinda ruins the game, which is just sad because the game is quite fine"
2740,NICE
2741,"needs more players
7 minute que times just to get into lobbies with people 10 ranks higher and insta die to some random with no counterplay on 120 ping non oce servers"

2747,"Pros: The combat system is compelling and interesting.  The visuals are stunning.  It's the only Battle Royale I've ever *enjoyed* playing.

Cons: Despite my thumbs down, that has more to do with my region than anything.  The NA region has a painfully small player base.  People are VPNing over to us and it's not great.  High pings, light attack spam and brutal queue times (15-20 minutes, per match) even at peak make this game hard to love.  There are also some minor cheating irritants. The skin sales are a little excessive, but that's *every* game right now.  

I got to Gold IV in the season I played a lot (about halfway up the ranking system), and was consistently paired against top 500 players in my region (platinum, solar, etc.).  The gulf of skill between me and them was massive.  This is a great game let down by a lack of promo in North America, and subsequently, a small player base."
2748,"Resulution 5120 x 1440 Force close. ! Please Fix!!!!
Last update event imlek force close !!!!!!!!!!!!"
2749,"its good, fun, hard to master, and a refreshing feel of a new genre BR

get it on sale"
2750,"Don't buy the game if you like being respected as a consumer. This was THE game for me, but I started to realize that the devs don't care about the western playerbase. They don't take feedback from regions outside of CN seriously and refuse to change. Community managers exist to just quiet down the 12 westerners that still play. There's a reason the playerbase is smaller than even most fighting game communities and it's not because of the skill gap. Hopefully a different developer makes a game similar to this, I'd play their game in a heartbeat."

2771,nice game
2772,GOOD GAME
2773,OP GAME
2774,"Horrible competitive / pvp experience from launch till now Feb. 27, 2022, EU servers predominately filled with asian players (oft VPN abusers who lag a lot, even randoms in duo or trios are losing connection through the whole match in your team ... therefore your stuff doesn't even register on similar enemies / players against you), unbalanced skill gap, players from Bronze V that die like flies (cuz they don't even know what dodge or parry is) ... face in the same match Platinum and even higher ranked lagging asian players against them! Very oft you'll die to an epileptic masturbation 2-3 hit kill no-life player that swallowed every possible YouTube tutorial on how to be epilepticly efficient with combos (especially keyboard+mouse vs controller) ... vs a silver guy that is trying to understand the game (a silver guy dies in 3 hits from a platinum or empyrean trio player on spawn as he gets highlighted on the map because the no-life activated a bounty quest = minus reputation points for the silver guy = depression = refund or removal of the game = playerbase cuts in half). In addition, bad performance and big fps drops with a 3080ti and a 5950x overclocked, on any graphical settings (currently using lowest settings for competitive and it's still very bad)! The asian invasion into the EU has been an issue since the release ... but nothing has been done yet.

I just can't believe how they queue up empyrean ranked trio players against silver ranked in solo (I faced it a lot) ... yo! If the guy's rank is so high in trios, it's obvious that you should NOT queue him against anything lower than platinum, even if the empyrean's guy solo rank is bronze 999 ... where's the common sense!? It's like putting a butcher vs. sheep in the same lobby ... Oh let's queue him against bronze cuz he's bronze in solo, and, we're just going to ignore the fact that he's fucking empyrean in trios!

All I see is more and more donations in the shape of very expensive skins and gambling. BUT, where are the quality of life improvements?

Very bothering cons up till this day:

- Very unbalanced PVP matchmaking (also the non-competitive ""Quick Matches"")

- 95-99% 3080ti GPU usage in the main menu (Home, Heroes and Weapons tabs), on lowest graphical settings ... Crypto Mining while the player is AFK!? GPU goes up to 75-80ºC in the main menu, while idle, are you for real? Bitcoin or Ethereum!?

- Very annoying news feed popping in your face every single day (with the majority of the time with nothing new to show), if you click on any of them accidentally - they'll open externally, in a browser. Why can't we have an option to simply disable it forever, or at least for a week!?

- Begging to follow their social media, on every game exit ... why!? We got that you have Twitter, ok? We got it ... why EVERY day!?

- Also the game still freezes / hangs for about 10+ seconds on exit. Even though it's installed on an NVMe! (while hanging, the CPU temps reach their peak)

- Despite having full screen enabled in the settings, it's actually running borderless ...

- The store is in $ U.S. Dollars globally, no regional / local currencies ...

- Still no DX12 (half a year after release)

- No region lock

...

The amount of swearing, hardware harming (broken key caps, dead mouses) and wasted nerves due to these issues was not worth buying this game (from a PVP perspective).

_

*Don't get me wrong, I like how the game feels, plays and especially looks on max settings, it's great! BUT, right now, pvp the majority of the time is a big unbalanced disappointment ... PvE on the other hand is extremely boring! For me, it would be a game changer if we had some 2-4 player Co-Op PvE modes, against a bigger / smarter amount of bots, Vajras, Terracota Warriors (in waves, all after you, like zombies) ... more challenging and entertaining PvE mess! It would turn the toxic pvp experience into some great time spending with friends! (because I have a feeling that competitive pvp will never get fixed)."
2775,"I'm not a battleroyal genre lover but this game can provide very different feelings toward to the genre.
The mechanics and the concept is unique which in the first hand deserve a call.

In this game you are a warrior/ninja type of player, you have to gather different kind of weapons which is suitable the best for your style of gaming.
If you like samurai fights, you can find a Katana
If you like warrior or swordsman style, you can find many different kind of swords from dagger to long sword and heavy sword.
You can find spear and marksman weapons, so if you have a favourite style, you can fight in it.

The looting system is easy to understand and the fight mechanics is like in BDO. If you start feeling comfortable using the combat system, the game is becomming an easy game for you.

Graphics is beautiful. That's it. 

Also you will find bib anime boobs which is a bonus :D

For me it's a 7,5/10

+ Visuals
+ Characters
+ Combat system
- Loot frequency
- Battle Royal
- Expensive expansions while it's not a free to play game."
2776,Great BR game with Melee combat element which is not easy to come by. Wish player base was larger.
2777,"There is a lot of great things in this game. The design and the combat system are both worth for a try. But on the other hand there are things that can be really frustrating to a regular player. VPN cheaters, totally insensible ballance among higher and lower level players, a bit boring gameplay and the meaningless of nowdays Battle Royale insanity. Because the Basic idea of these games, namely that every player enter for glory, with exactly the same chance, it is a lie. But its not just the devs fault. 
Maybe if the game will recive a co-op mode against Npc-s or something, i will play it again. Till than i rather play with Sifu. 🥋"

2784,good
2785,couple fun hours also damn im good
2786,"Great until latency / ping / faulty hit-reg dictates the outcome of a fight.

In other BR's, having one instance of bad hit-reg costs you about 10-40 hp. Which still sucks...

But in this game, failing to register your block/parry will cost you the 20-30 hp from the first hit, but also the subsequent stunlock and combo resulting in 60+% of your total health.

And trust me it's not fun watching yourself die to stunlock- when the reason is because of bad reg / netcode."
2787,"Cool new take on the BR genre!

Should be free to play imho.
Played a fair bit of the beta but haven't got around to play the lanched game that much yet.

2800,Good game
2801,""" WHICH WEAPON DO I USE"" :
Here is my best Analysis of each weapon

Katana :  Anime-Style, Multiple slashes in one swing, flashy cinematic feel

Sword: Floaty, one handed, elegant, can charge up & throw Mid range Energy slices projectiles that will essentially kill you. (edited)

Greatsword: You want to kill in 2 hits because you dont need to learn combos if no one within a 10 meter range is alive to use em.

Spear: Longrange poke, Quick stabs and swings, very evasive. And none of that matters. because once you learn what Nezha is, all you'll be doing is trying to land it and running away until you do

Nunchucks: Defensive, Low damage, fastest combos, Stun-lock, slow windup/recovery animation. A weapon for when you want to get your ass beat 99% of the fight and then use the last 1% of your hp to kill everyone infront of you. (edited)

Dagger: The most ninja-feeling weapon. spammable iframe dash in between attacks, high damage, single hit combos, basically if a mosquito had a Knife for a stinger. Also, drops the anime-feel for a second to grapple someone like a serial-killer (edited)

2802,"[h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]

[h2]Foreword[/h2]
I got to know ""Naraka: Bladepoint"" through a friend.
At first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.
First of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.
Exactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.
Unfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.
Nevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.

[h2]Positives[/h2]
[list]
[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content
[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly
[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends
[*]Pleasant graphics
[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent
[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame
[*]Different game modes and events
[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons
[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)
[*]Well thought through character designs
[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.
[/list]

[h2]Neutral[/h2]
[list]
[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.
[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.
[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions
[/list]

[h2]Negatives[/h2]
[list]
[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially
[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat
[*]Voicechat is not well thought through
[*]Partial performance losses
[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)
[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation
[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta
[/list]

[h2]Review written out[/h2]
Naraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.
I love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).
So while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.
Only the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.
For example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.
This is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. 
However, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.
(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).
However, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.

Unfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.
The game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.
There are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.
This is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.
Unfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.
Sadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.
You partly punch through enemies bodies.
Various focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.
This is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.
For example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.
According to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just ""memes"" . 
But you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.

Another big problem is the matchmaking.
Even with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.
This is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.

As negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.
I love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.
This reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.
In addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.
Especially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.
The map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. 
Great lighting design really highlights some of the locations.
You can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).

But my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. 
The ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.
Getting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.
So does slaying a moonbane.

[h2]Epilogue[/h2]
All in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.
I love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.

Even though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.
The accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.

I would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.
Just visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].

I would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.
I'm looking forward to your opinions :)
With best regards

2803,In this game you feel like a Jackie Chan [spoiler] but only in bloopers [/spoiler]
2804,game good
2805,nice
2806,"I haven't played this game a lot, but I can already tell that this game still has a ton of space to improve.
This game combat is really fun, but.. that's the only thing good about this game
The game server is super bad, its almost impossible to beat the same skill level players with lower ping.
And the game optimize is uh... just don't play it with bad computer, unless you want a stutter mess.
Bunch of smurfs, low elo game are almost bot and smurfs.
And this game has tons of bug to ruin your day, just be prepared :)"

am also bad at the game so my wife dies a lot and this doesnt feel good

originally purchased because of the nudity and sexual content tag. I have not discovered any.

The gameplay is still fun."
2813,Nerf katana.
2814,Good
2815,"Game itself is a BLAST!

Main problem: you cannot play it normally because there are so many SEA Players lagging around. 
Means, timing is totally screwed up. You cannot parry/dodge/attack the way you can when playing against non-lagging players.

2816,good
2817,GOOD GAME
2818,"Slashy Slashy Dodge Dodge, with poor optimization"
2819,Nicely done
2820,"Fun dynamic game who like to fight with mele weapons.
Good game but it is hard, also don't buy boxes they are p2w.
"
2821,78% of 80% who recommended this game are chinese for sure
2822,yummy tummy
2823,"This game is absolute it has really good graphics, it is different from other battle royales because it has both melee weapons and ranged weapons each doing something different both in quick attacks and charged attacks, but lets not forget about the fact that you can counter someone when they attack you to make them drop their weapon meaning you have the counter-strike combo and the weapon advantage.
Furthermore there are stuff like souljades that either apply boosts to your hero or they chance/enhance weapon quick and charged attacks
Then we have grapples which can either help you maneuver around the map or help you engage/leave fights
Now lets not forget about a really important thing in this game which is that every hero has their own ability and ultimate ability which are sure to turn the tables on a fight if you know how to use them
This game also allows you to make talent pages which could be more grapple distance faster ultimate charge or even getting more dark tide coins for the shop
There are a lot of customization for each and every hero and if you don't like how they look you can change their appearance
The sounds of this game are beautiful and there is a different sound for pretty much everything like walking on grass sounds different from walking on a rooftop the charge of the weapons also makes a sound (and has a cool outline effect on the hero) dashing/dodging countering someone sliding etc.
This game is a 10 out of 10 it is really awesome you should try it
(Edit #1 only problem i have with this game is that in EU servers ranked takes some time to find a game but that isn't the game's fault so i am still keeping the 10/10 score)"
2824,pretty fun game been playing it nonstop combat is nice and fluid and each character has their own abilities and you can customize them. It also isn't very hard to find a game plenty of people play just a small learning curve when playing but once you get more comfortable you'll be having loads of fun

2830,I LIKE IT
2831,"Fresh and new type of battle royal game. It combines the PVP feels of MMORPG including the high quality graphics and the intensity and strategical play style of battle royal. You can do tekken-like combos, team cooperation and timing of a MOBA game, have specific roles in a party, or even just go all out attackers. Great game. A MUST TRY game"
2832,Its a Melee Version of APEX; but not free
2833,Yes. much recommended! Could play this game for hours on end
2834,"Chinese people flooding the EU/US servers with VPNs.
No chance to fight anyone of them cause they are desync as hell.
If you report them for abusing high ping and VPNs you can get banned for racism.
Dont recommend as long as they are tolerating this shit.

Ah and they have no idea how balancing works :D"
2835,"A game with a lot of potential, the idea is good, the character art is decent, but the execution is just atrocious...

The combat feels incredibly floaty, but that in itself is about tolerable once you get used to it, but then you start playing online matches instead of bot matches, and things really take a turn for the worse.

The netcode in this game, the way it handles desyncs and large latencies, combined with the fact that you will be matched with people across the world, make for an utterly miserable experience online, even when I was winning it felt bad.

Overall the game has a lot going for it, let down by the one thing they needed to do right the most, sad."
2836,It ninja BR game very excite
2837,incredibly fun and the combat mechanics are amazing. It has a unique take on the battle royale genre and its very enjoyable to play.
2838,fun

2843,"As a Chinese, I want to say that this game style has always been loved and missed by Chinese people, but NetEase is also notoriously bad in China, and the bad thing is their operation. In the past, many good plans and themes were wasted on NetEase's operation team. NetEase started from mobile games and PC games to open up foreign markets, but it was obviously unsuccessful. From the simple and hasty first global game, to the game optimization problem that has never been solved, and the maddening server network problem. These are all factors that make people gradually disgusted. Even if more characters and costumes are introduced (the in-game recharge is very annoying), a game that cannot run really smoothly is a failure."
2844,"Trying to make money with skins and matches every day, not optimizing the game, getting stuck after every update."
2845,good
2846,Great game!
2847,Awesome battle Royale game forthe weebs and fan of Asian culture and their aesthetic and fighting style!
2848,"So far. this is the best BR I've played as most BRs are always about guns. Some minor glitches are bearable but never a major factor when in a fight. Slight concerns are the clunky grappling hook mechanics. One is when shooting a hook at the top of a tree when you are on a higher ground which will 9/10 not land you at the top of the tree but drop you and at times the grappling hook does not fully take you to your targeted position and just drops you.

Overall, the game is great! wish that they give more RNG boxes though after level 40."
2849,"It's decently fun, unfortunately it's monetized exactly like a free-to-play game, with a huge amount of microtransactions filling up the screen at nearly all times, so I will not be keeping this game."
2850,bomb
2851,Hours and hours of fun!
2852,"It's performance is pretty bad on a rig that can play all recent AAA games on high settings

Its a fun game, BUT isn't worth 30$ at all, I have seen free games with better performance and more content."
2853,yeees veri nais
2854,"Naraka has a very unique combat style and flow to it. Every movement  has a sort of weight to it that makes sense and gives a sort of satisfaction with every hit, grapple, roll, or dodge. With skill you can over come just about any situation, that being said, this game has a bit of a learning curve and is about as unforgiving as they come when talking about time to kill. Overall though, great take on the battle royal genre"
2855,New BR Expreience and ez RNG for all box
2856,very much
2857,"ugh
"
2858,"Game finally adds something interesting to the battleroyal genre, the combat in this game is honestly done so well for a br, along with the combos it gives you an introductory course in and the level of movement you can have if you put time in to the game, I've only played 3 hours thus far but would highly recommend atleast giving it a shot if you're over Apex Legends, Fortnite, etc."
2859,gg
2860,"Gameplay 10/10
Visuals 10/10
Optimization 8.5/10

Game is fucking fun. Downside is newer players might get destroyed. The devs tried compensating with bots in game, but it COMPLETELY fails in comparison when fighting an actual player. Bots are pretty much just punching bags. For newer players I highly recommend looking up guides and tutorials on youtube. The skill gap is pretty heavy, but once you have a general idea, its incredibly fun.
One last thing is, you need homies to play this game lol. Playing by yourself is literally cancer.

Best of luck!"
2861,Very NIce games i like it
2862,"Kurumi, buy this game. <3"
2863,"I love this game, its very well make, however! im very disappointed there is way too many hacker in this game and the maker dont ban any of them. u have no way to win if u dont use hack..."
2864,"Great concept, poor execution. Couldn't log in a few hours ago, getting an ""account error"". Now it takes 2-3 minutes for trees and houses to appear on the map, at which point I'm getting ambushed out of nowhere."
2865,"If you're fighting someone and they have a non English name, ggs to you."

2868,"We need Oceania server. Otherwise the game is totally unplayable.
"
2869,ye
2870,"Pretty unforgiving to new players. after 2 games of AI, you'll run into specific people that dominate the whole lobby. after 20 hours of play, i only got top 5 once, excluding the 2 bot lobbies. the combat is pretty fun but clunky. Just don't expect to have much of any chance of winning if this is a game you'll play casually."
2871,5 hours in and I'm impressed. It's a typical battle royale but its not... The combat is complicated and rewarding to learn. I enjoy that there's actually new in-game ability to unlock as you play. It's the only game in its category that has this feature as far as games I've played atleast. 4 and a half stars.
2872,Wish there were more EU players.
2873,pvp system is amazling :D
2874,Love it
2875,"It's a fun game to break the ""battle royale with fire guns"" mindset. It is very cool to focus on some skill-based combat and character builds instead of picking a weapon and killing from afar.

The problem is that the servers in this game are a joke, there are no SA Servers and even if there were, I'd still have to fight 都没你的甜 with 300ms. I had a match where the opponents just stood still on the sky for some seconds before engaging in a uncounterable combo.

Very fun game but very bad experience."
2876,.
2877,"If it were not for the small playerbase in NA and the scam-like lootbox system especially, I would give this game a thumbs-up. However, what they are doing rn is literally sucking every possible penny from their loyal players by making those tempting outfits/weapon skins unpurchasable in store and only via overpriced greedy crates :("
2878,More ping abuser and smurfer than normal player.
2879,"Game is great but, ping spikes when there are clashes even with a reliable internet provider and smooth experience at the start of the game. Otherwise, it's great! :D"
2880,Nicee
2881,"Game is fun, but matchmaking is not balanced, you climb ranks even if you lose all your games.
Huge lag and desync issues. 
Some players literaly are teleporting, and their attacks hit even if they shouldnt, its impossible or hardly possible blocking their attacks cause you would have to predict what did they press a second ago which is a lot in this game.
Fixing such issues requires not much tbh, but apearently not much was done in this game so far besides skins so there is not much hope for improvement."

2883,best game ive played in a while. Chinese players OP though
2884,"game runs like a potato, ping is so high as if im in a forest in the middle of nowhere playing on my android mobile phone hotspot (only this game) and if those aren't the problem then im usually getting killed by

2885,best game
2886,"great game, high skill cap. can be somewhat intimidating or tilting to beginners but if you give it a shot to improve the game becomes so much more enjoyable. right now the main problem seen is that there arent enough players in the community to maintain a balanced matchmaking system. this would easily be fixed if the game was more publicized. Everyone tell your friends to try naraka! the Visuals, Combat, Movement, and attention to detail are all amazing. The game just needs a little more love."

Unfortenatly I do not have my yellow outfit for my bruce lee character, which kinda of desapointed me at first, but it is possiable to unlock that cosmetics, with out paying and if you have the money, well enough said.

2938,Great game
2939,the combat is flashy and rewarding
2940,"Not a bad game, very enjoyable and every game feels different so you can never be bored. Game is not pay to win and it's very skillful. It's one of the games where when you put in the hours you're gonna see yourself improve more and more , one of those where you can play it ""casually"" or play it in a very high APM pro level."
2941,Yup

2944,good game but i'm noob

2946,good
2947,This game delivers what it says it does. I'm impressed with how immersive the game is and how easy it is to get into while managing to have layers of complexity at the same time. If anyone was ever interested in a ninja battle royale then you can be sure that this game is worth it.
2948,"bad

2949,"Now Hear me out, its a good game, not a great game. What I mean by that is there is so many good elements to it and on the other hand its handled poorly by the dev team. Too many hackers, too many asian vpn users breaking the region lock, not to mention they had a month head start on the America users. They aren't stopping or fixing it so it makes the game very difficult, BUT BUUUUT, it is fun. I keep coming back to get better and do better, just makes it difficult when you have two VPN users rolling up on you with more practice and juggling you around."
2950,Enjoying the multiplayer combat.
2951,"This game is probably the most fun I've had playing a battle royale, its a unique and original Idea.

the graphics are amazing, the character customization is awesome, leveling progression on everything is decent.

but please, never get rid of the bots and being able to level up everything playing against them, sometimes its rather difficult to get into a match, or there is to many players from other regions desycning and hacking. sometimes I just want to play and have fun while being able to level up playing against CPUs instead of dealing with people from china and EU lagging and making it hard to fight against them."
2952,"Very fun game to play with friends. Prefer 2 or 3 people at a time.
The performance is a bit laggy since I updated the game last time, don't know why.
But overall it is a very solid game.

I try to play more and learn moves more, but still got ass kicked lol.
Maybe I'm easily panicked person.

I hope the game run smoother and not stutter much like old time, cause it affect my gameplay with friends."
2953,its fun different and a beautiful game to boot im not normally a fan of pvp games but love this
2954,Very fun and challenging game.
2955,"Really nice game, got alot better features than PUBG. But are ofc still missing some finish."
2956,I would love to see in future Demon Slayer crossover!
2957,a
2958,This game is very complicated and will take you a very long time to understand the basics. It's very mechanically demanding but as long as you get the hang of it then you can hold your own in game but even if you have an Ethernet cable be ready to lag because the servers are unstable and it does have some annoying bugs that need to be fixed but other than that it's a pretty good game.
2959,Very fun Battle Royale type game with a focus on melee. Challenging and requires more than just spamming attacks. Great challenge.
2960,"I normally enjoy playing battle Royal Games and enjoy that Naraka is different than most of the ones out there.  When the game is working, the combat is dynamic and the usage of combos stands out above your regular point and shoot or button mashing game play. 

When the game isn't working, there are constant frame drops, textures don't load, and there are constant warning to install the game on a SSD despite the fact that I have it installed on a SSD specifically designed for gaming. 

Somethings to consider: 
I am playing on a gaming labtop that is above the system requirements with giga speed internet. 

All of my graphic settings are turned to the lowest settings that can be set for this game ( inorder to make it playable). 

I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game on a few occasions to see if this games works better but i am often met with a warning that the game files are corrupted and it makes me back out of the game. 

I really hope that the team can work on these issues as soon as possible."
2961,"Personally Streamed this game and Its a really good Battle Royale. The community itself has been the key for this games amazing population. I actually got a lot of tips first day from official tourney players which is fantastic from a beginners that found out this game only for a few months notice! Really like the combat system as for what It stood out as. Not too easy, not to hard to handle each weapon and ability. There truly is a lot to master but its super fun to play! I cant wait to continue to play more!~"

2966,"f you don't have friends to play this game too, I don't recommend it because it's very difficult to play. I had to randomly meet someone I didn't know, almost 100 percent lost. Being attacked is death alone. AFK player penalties are too weak and team members are not compensated.
Now I think the team randomization and ranking scoring system is too bad. should be improved to be more balanced and reasonable"
2967,boring game
2968,"The game is actually pretty fun to play casually once you get the hang of it. 

In game super expensive cash shops and season passes on a buy to play game are always bad even if it's only aestethic items. But yeah, overlookable...

It lacks that something to make it big and long term enjoyable in my opinion but I enjoy just jumping in, playing a couple matches and leave.

Would recommend but probably not at full price and only if you don't have much else to play at the moment.

Pretty sweet graphics, really nice and intresting world loads of colors its just pretty. Its alot better than fortnite. Did i mention special attacks and grappling hooks.
8/10:) happy with this and actually have an addiction to it. I know I dont have a lot of hours but its pretty good."
2983,"This game is amazing and actually has a skill gap, fix a few things and this game could be big. The main problem though is that ranked and this game being competitive outside of LAN is pretty much pointless. The game is set up so that people with high ping have a huuge advantage. So as a new player on NA servers you'll end up seeing a lot of Chinese names taking advantage of the ping issue. This makes it incredibly hard to register hits on them or block while they get multiple combos off on you. Also I've noticed some players using cheats watching them as a spectator after dying and they can be hard to notice sometimes. I'm conflicted because this game is so good, but I don't think I can recommend anyone to spend money on this game if they're looking to be competitive until these problems are fixed."
2984,"The game is fun and awesome if you have a decent computer.
Even with one, it could turn my room into a Sauna, the game seems not so optimized as my friend with recommended Hardware Requirements still faces spike and lags everytime."

2993,to begin with it takes about like 7 min  just to to set u up in a game. whole lot of bots and who ever isnt a bot is a china man that spends all his life playing the game so kiss any win goodbye. im pretty sure theres people hacking this game too. i have 33 hrs playing this crap and i cant recommend it to any body

85min in game, and i played only one match with bots, rest time spend in lobby.

3013,"A fun take on the br formula, but at this point almost impossible to get into a real match in the US. If you do happen to get into a match after waiting 5-10 minutes your likely to get murdered by somebody outside of your region using a VPN with high ping. This game needs more players and should go free to play before its too late."
3014,"Okay, I NEVER rate games, but I decided to with this one. 

CONS: This is where I cannot recommend this game. You get laggy Chinese people who don't know how to stay in their own servers. You will see a guy running into a wall or stopped in mid air hanging there for 10 seconds and BAM he's behind you already with a full charged attack and just 1 shots you. These people aren't good, they rely on lag to teleport around the battlefield and destroy you. I have 40ms ping and 1 gig internet. I'm not the problem, all the chinese players are the problem. I will only recommend this game if they do a country ban or a personal ban of someone with over a certain latency. Anyone lagging should not be allowed to play games that require pinpoint accuracy. 

GRAPHICS: Great

GAMEPLAY: Awesome, I feel they punish you for doing focused attacks too much, they already require you to stand still and take hits to the face while charging, but being punished by doing an easy block, you also have your weapon dropped when your attack gets blocked, it really is a poor mechanic. Everything else is fine though. 

STORY: I haven't encountered one besides character backstories which who cares really. 

MUSIC: It's okay, I think it could be better.

"
3037,"This game offers players with most of the intense mode available, and with some slower pace which can be played with combining different movements for faster game play. [b] Martial Arts + Swords Play + Gun Play + BR + Parkour + Grappling + Extreme Movements + Unique Skills + Combos + CC + Counters [/b]. As this game favors teamwork the most, try playing ranked solo in trios. The highest difficulty in the game.

With only 180 hrs played, I can say this game is quite hard to master but easy to learn. It's not for everyone. Especially people who don't like a challenge and motion sickness.

Hacker wise, never met them once. Maybe not on my server (SEA). Idk about others who said they had met them before. Guess I'm lucky :D

The Chinese players are friendly and funny (most of them), until they got serious. If they shout and scold, that's when u know the enemy is better. They got the skills to be funny and chill, had better time playing with them than the others. Or maybe I just know how to communicate with them and the haters don't. Idk.......
Tip: Try to comm with them, they're not too bad to talk to.

Maybe people got upset from the constant cc by the enemy's sword play and skills. Well, nothing much to say about it. They're just better. After all, it is [b] NOT [/b] for everyone.

Overall great game, definitely should give it a try. Nothing like the others. Tho better to play at least at constant 60 fps, it will ruin your combo and mess up your timing if they are any spikes. Take it from experience."

3061,Fun combat. Would defently recommend
3062,"Fun game with a lot of different modes for several types of players.
Survival - like a kind of battleroyal mod
The Bloodbath - like some kind of Deathmatch where you can practice your PVP skills.
There is also a ranked version of Survival where players can compete with each other and see who is ranked in the region or world by rank.
Each character in the game has their own skills that are upgraded by playing and become stronger for each specific situation. If a skill is last unlocked, it does not mean that it is the best, because sometimes you will need a skill that you unlocked at the beginning. So each skill is based on your type of play. There is also a customize option in the game where you can create characters of your choice. The game is made so that everyone can have fun in it and it is also very easy to learn to play but it is really hard to master it."

3070,"[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
I really enjoy playing this game, but I can't recommend it to anyone; in fact I would recommend you never touch this game to begin with. This was finally a battle royale I had fun with, even playing it solo (I usually only play BR games with friends for context). However, due to server issues, pricing issues, cheaters and horrendous staff. No. You will have more fun watching someone on Twitch.

[h1]Pros[/h1][list]
[*] Complex movement and simple controls streamline the game's systems. This game does not play like For Honor, and this is good. You would get cheesed way too much
[*] Movement is also really fun, bolting around or hooking someone (despite the cheese) is a great feeling
[*] Quick spawning, this is nit-picky but I'm so glad there aren't drops
[*] Winning fights and fighting in general is fun in my opinion[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1][list]
[*] Sad pricing, this game has loot boxes that can only be bought, expensive skins and weapon skins, tiny-tiny drop rates on good cosmetics, tier skips and more with the random flash events or seasonal events. Pathetic in Apex, and it's pathetic here too
[*] Terrible support and staff, you will not hear anything good come from dealing with them. The Discord is in a massive disarray with peoples problems being chalked up as castaway notes
[*] Unbalanced characters and weapons, you can easily do a 100 to 0 combo. Some characters are just cheese if you learn their basics
[*] Server instability and general high ping
[*] Region lock is useless as high-ping players can still enter using a VPN
[*] Matches take a long time to find
[*] There is no way to buy previous battle passes, this game is not doing well in the US so it makes no sense for them to have all these great cosmetics that no one will ever have... silly and stupid if they're gonna charge so much for them
[*] Battle Passes do not give enough for the next season and then some. You literally have to level it up 150+ just to get your value out of it.
[/list]
[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
So, despite me liking this game I just feel like there is no boundary of respect between customer and seller. I've played enough to no longer find the game fun because the issues that were nagging have just taken over. I just think you would be better off not playing this anymore. I'm sorry, because as someone who pre-ordered and loved the game, even being a community mod at one point. I think I'm moving on

3071,big booba hero
3072,Amazing Pvp Game
3073,"Terrible netcode and issues with high latency. Counters are inconsistent most of the time again due to latency, not to mention that heroes are not very well balanced for 1v1 gameplay (I doubt they'd even be balanced for teamplay either, but since I've played mostly solos, I can't be the judge of that). The game also desperately needs a region lock. There are too many Asian-region players in NA servers and it messes with the gameplay because of latency (again).

Queue times are very long (3-5 minutes) and they really suck if you die quickly since it's a battle royale. Again, there are caveats to this with teamplay, but solos means you're screwed if someone kills you early. It doesn't seem like that many people play this game, although the numbers on Steamcharts are high considering this game's presence in Asia.

Long story short, rock-paper-scissors based gameplay isn't fun if the scissors don't even work half the time. Unless this game gets rollback netcode or overall improved netcode, this game is a waste of money."

my problem is why would i have to spend 20$ on a game and afterward spend tons of $$ on the ingame skins. you can't even earn them with grinding you have to buy them . i want to be able to some cosmetics for free but no each weapon have 5 good skins wich cost you tons of money to buy."

3095,first battle royale game i actually liked
3096,yes
3097,"In short this game is very fun, imagine Sekiro meets Battle Royale. 
But game also has problems, many of them.

First of all ranked/competitive:
Its very broken and unfair, you will be matched against high elo players even if you only started to climb (start point is Bronze V for everyone but you play vs Plat + players for some reason).

Connection: As you can read other reviews, there a LOT of ping ""abusers"", what that means is  that they play with high ping making your attack not register or impossible to counter their attacks and that can bring frustration. (Mostly in ranked matches). 

Gameplay: Very fun. You can dash, do combos, grapple everywhere, jump/climb etc. Also every weapon has unique combos and there are many heroes (9 atm) to choose to play. 

Customization: Every hero can be altered as you want. Think of it as Character Creation and its very deep, better then a lot of RPGs even. There are also rewards for outfit and skins for weapons etc. But some you have to pay for (sucks).

Graphics: Beautiful visuals and effects, map, weapons and heroes are very detail. But its suffers for poor optimization, even on high end PC.

Game is buy to play and also has Battle pass and many in game items that cost real money. A bit strange and most dont like that, including me.

General opinion: I think Naraka is very fun game, that can give you fun you want, but for now, avoid ranked. Game has many mods (Death match - my favorite, casual play, events etc) and all can be played up to 3 players in party or solo.
They are working to bring Directx 12 that will boost performance.
Game should be free to play (imo it will be, its just matter or time) with that ""in game store"" but as of now if you get it on sale you will have great fun. 

Just dont play it as ""competitive"" game and you will have great fun.
"
3098,我在一个游戏里玩到了无数的游戏，钱花的值了
3099,yes
3100,"Played it for the free weekend. 
Main issues are that it's a buggy nightmare to play, that's with a 2070 super/9700k. The only way to get this game to be remotely playable is at the LOWEST settings which is pretty suspect, assuming the game isn't just poorly optimised. 
As well, the gameplay itself isn't very deep, fights are too fast with most weapon combos one-shotting you so most fights end up being about who has best internet or who gets the drop on the other person. And even if you do get into a decent scrap ults are broken, specifically the Vajra form and the water chick's ult. Both of which stun lock you while still doing damage. That combo is instant death and isn't fun to deal with at all.
Lastly, the UI is terrible and navigation is awful and there are way too many currencies that don't mean anything, felt like I was playing a fucking gacha games. 
Save your money, get absolver, sifu or a fucking dynasty warriors game."
3101,"Enjoying it so far. I keep hearing about players quitting because of the skill gap after the first few matches. We'll see, but the visuals and mechanics so far have me hooked. If I can manage to learn a few ""pro tricks"" from some YouTube vids, this will end up being my next BR game. Every game has its exploits and secret mechanics. Learning how to chain all that together is no harder than mastering the next multiplayer game. So I'll suck it up and get my ass kicked until I git gud"
3102,if you like sword battle and combo you should play this
3103,"I have played this game for 110 hours. I would not be surprised if I ended up at 250+ hours. The graphics are nice. The characters are all pretty cool and unique, I hope they add more. The combat is easy to learn and hard to master - overall, very fun. The grappling hook is sweet, but make sure you press your horizontal attack button towards the end of your jump, to go even further. Learning to counter will be difficult for some, but try some practice bot modes or something. There's a lot of fun to be had in this game if you like intense melee combat and sword-fighting action. I guess my one gripe about this game is that I always get killed by guys named ""冰淇淋"" so I agree with the other reviews here who complain about region locking. GET THIS GAME!"

I have to fight people with dodgy lag, some how the best timing, and just over all a region advantage, in My region, I'm fighting the Chinese, EU, hell I bet Australia is getting in on this. the lag is horrible, and new players like me are just not around any more due to this bs lag and shotty connection. Don't get this game, I love this game and i'm telling you not to get it."
3109,"It's an awesome game. I've been playing every day that I can, and I really enjoy it. When you think of battle royales, you don't think of swords and bows, you think of guns. But this game really breaks the mold of what battle royales are, and brings it into a different perspective"
3110,"Sword go slash 
Boobies go boing"
3111,Great Game i like it ))
3112,"Do NOT recommend for 1 simple reason.  The mechanics of the game are sloppy and regardless of what button you click, the game registered to continue attacking (even if you counter).  The game would be 10/10 otherwise, but because the mechanics are poorly designed it creates a frustrating response for the user when the command you use is not respected.  So I give this 1/10, hopefully they get this fixed!"
3113,Definitely one of the best BRs on the market. 10/10
3114,only 1 days then i bought the skin
3115,"yes veri nice gem, yes veri recomment"
3116,"Good game overall
"
3117,CURVES!!
3118,nice gameeeeee
3119,fire
3120,overpriced and pretty much dead on EU game filled the entire battle royal with more than half of the bots instead of players
3121,REGION LOCK PLAYING AGAINST LAGGY CHINESE PLAYERS BC THEY FUCKING SUCK AND CANT PLAY IN THERE OWN SHIT WHY
3122,combat takes some getting used to to really have any fun but overall its worth the price especially on sale I am having a good time when I have the time to play.
3123,not good

"
3130,The weapons and the abilities make the game so complex and fun. 10/10
3131,"I nominated Naraka for ""Best game you suck at"" and that is an accurate description of my personal experience.

Reminds me how much i miss fighting games like Tekken 5 and Mortal Kombat 9. But also reminds me how long it takes to master a single combo while having to defend yourself."
3132,cs go 2.0
3133,"A very fun twist on a battle royale feeling like it got meshed with a MMORPG. Dorito bod dudes with hourglass women like many mmorpgs, but the combat is fun and very different being mostly melee based versus the gun based popular mmorpgs. Game has traditional Japanese and Chinese elements. The game does not feel weeby at all but has a focus on waifus and cringy voice acting.

Game is great until you get 100 to 0 in a single combo by some random party that transferred from a different server. Any cosmetics that you want are in the gacha system and will be almost unattainable due to low odds even if you spend 1000 bucks. Chests are littered with rerolls"
3134,gud
3135,"This is the type of game where you die to a better player and you're not even mad. It's the perfect game to grind and get a sense of satisfaction increasing your skill. 

Only downside is that Australian region servers are low population. I have to queue SEA at 140 ping, but it's still enjoyable. High ranked play is hard though and can sometimes be rage worthy due to latency."
3136,"Fantastic game, love the cool unique physics the fight style of rock paper scissors , light >parry>heavy>light mechanic, the world is great. This game rocks! 
50 ping to SEA servers. A perfect absolutely awesome investment on sale. Get it!"

3141,"This game is a breath of fresh air in the jungle of battle royale games. It has combined some of the best features of different already amazing games and yet has so much unique content to offer. It has everything to keep a veteran battle royale player entertained while also having something for the newcomer to enjoy.
Must buy for $13.99."
3142,nice game
3143,"It's really easy when fighting other new players, very hard fighting vets."
3144,"I hate battle-royales but this game is amazing. It has its issues, but the combat system is incredible and deep. Overall just a refreshing experience with the ability to go as  complex as you want into the combat."
3145,"This game is super fun for all skill levels that I have played so far. The movement is very fluid and is =< to apex and the rng doesnt feel terrible that you are at a disadvantage constantly for not getting the ""right"" gear. every weapon feels useful and everything you do flows well into a fun time"
3146,Challenging but very fun
3147,"The most difficult BR games I've ever seen, but it's worth it to learn the movements of the game and basically it's always depends on your movements to win and outplayed your opponents, especially if you going solo rank. It's really fun and satisfying. The skins are lit lol."
3148,Game would be good. But not big EU community and a lot of china laggers and hackers come to our server. Devs do nothing to fix it.
3149,Super fun and interesting take on Battle Royale.
3150,"CHINA PLAYERS RUIN THE GAME - MAKING OTHERS LAG FOR ADVANTAGE SHALL NOT BE TOLLERATED or be worked on against in some way...
This game could be so much better if you would say every 1v1 is just a skill difference... but at the current state ITS NOT! 
For those sceptics --- if you get mad by ping problems SIMPLY DONT BUY THIS GAME china or what ever defuk this players are ....they will ALWAYS HAVE A ADVANTAGE ON YOU"
3151,not bad !!!
3152,huge player battlegrounds with swords and basic ranged weapons.. asian style and great art with some attractive characters.
3153,NICE GAME
3154,"This game is awesome, BUT::::: Playing in NA is....rough....to say the least. The market for this game seems to be very dominant on the other side of the globe, and im not sure if that is what causes this, but sometimes the game is down-right unplayable because the servers feel like they are about to break under themselves. 
Let me state that this game is seriously awesome. It takes a lot of the best qualities from other battle royales, and blends them together seamlessly. This, plus the aesthetic and the idea of a melee focused BR is really awesome. The gameplay, (when it works,) is fluid and fun, and I have had some really amazing moments playing this game already.
I REALLY hope that these server issues get fixed. I can guarantee it's not my internet, this is the only multiplayer game that I have these kind of problems with, especially with a 1gb Down 500mb Up internet connection. The game will completely freeze, and sometimes fights will be over before your game even decides to show you what's happening, and before you know it your name is in the kill feed dead by some guy with a bunch of Chinese/Japanese characters in their name. 
The game is fun. Super fun. But that fun is constantly hindered by shoddy connections to people on the other side of the planet. Please fix D: I really want to love this game and keep playing it but 50 percent of my fights, Im not even there to witness because the server wont let me stay connected."
3155,certified bad boi game. enough said
3156,wow
3157,"Unique battle royale that I highly recommend, and this is coming from someone who hates BRs. Classic shooter battle royales are too repetitive for me and I really hate the idea of spending 20 minutes running around to possibly die, and requeue to experience the same thing. This game has a MOBA-esque feel that is super easy to grasp and a great combat system that I don't mind the BR radio silence, and you get to analyze why you lose fights more in-depth from a mechanics perspective, whereas in shooter BRs it just comes down to bad aim.

A little tip tho, I ignored the warning to install this game on an ssd instead of an hdd; I REGRET IT. On an hdd this game will stutter like no other and ruins the otherwise amazing experience."
3158,Interesting take on battle royale game mode. Very movement heavy and the game is much deeper than it may initially appear on the surface.

3180,very nice. i like.
3181,I LOVE JAPAN VENDING MACHINE EVERYWHERE
3182,It's fun
3183,Amazing game 10/10 what are you waiting for?
3184,"Definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves melee close combat. I have played other BR games and I didn't like any of them but I love this one. Super fun combat and gameplay, beautiful world, beautiful girls, amazing weapon animations, what more do you need from a game like this. The only complaint I have is the aggressive micro transactions on the skins which is really greedy and annoying."
3185,"To be completely honest with you, I was excited for this game. Since the day I first saw it, before the full release. After that I didn't had the chance to actually buy it so I had to necessarily wait for the right occasion, but now that I did it... I wish I didn't spend the money.
Unfortunately right now I can't request a refund anymore because I got past the 2h, but this is because I really wanted to believe that this game was something else, was another BR different and interesting from the usual COD or BF. I mean, gameplay-wise is but the fact that the majority of the playerbase is Asian, doesn't really help with it at all. What I'm mainly complaining about is the fact that:

- First the SSD problem. Like, why would you even ""lock"" the game performances behind this simple yet annoying thing? Not everyone can buy it or some probably are not even interested in buying it. So honestly this is definitely a sh***y move from you devs. Like everytime I boot up the game, I have to wait at least 10/15 minutes for the textures to load. IN THE MAIN MENU. And before some intelligent folks come here blaming my setup, no, it's not that. I play other games which doesn't NECESSARILY requires SSD to work correctly, while this one here instead it's literal hell. The same problem happens also in another game called ""Super People"", but while here after waiting at least 1H you can actually play, there it's totally impossible to play it unless you install it into an SSD.

- Second problem, the fact that the playerbase like mentioned it's almost all asian and they have high pings. But I won't add anymore since I don't think that region locked server will be a thing, mostly because otherwise the game might die here in EU and NA as well since it's played by really few players compared to asians. I mean, technically it's already dead here in EU and NA so that's why you allow CN people to play with everybody.

- Third problem, the fact that is not skill based. It's just ""first come, first serve"" type of game, there's no strategy at all here. The first that starts the fight win, simple as that, also the counterattack it's broken as fuck. Sometimes it works, other times not so much. It's a gamble 99% of the times and I hate gambles.

Long story short, no, I don't recommend this game unless you'are a masochist and want to be beat up from CN players with high pings and a terrible counterattack system. Otherwise feel free to buy it and do like me, play 99% of the games with bots in casual or hard, your choice, and still unlock stuff (battlepass and such) because yes, you don't have to necessarily play ranked or quick matches against other players. You can just play bot and unlock everything. Of course minus the ""team-based missions"", but those are really few and just in events (of course you will earn less than playing ranked or with other players, but it's not like you're going anywhere, right?). And the rest 1% just go, survive for five minutes before a CN player comes and beats your a**."
3186,Very cool game... good story game line and cool graphics... I have bad PC but it runed in 60fps <3
3187,Got fed up with the game within a few minutes.
3188,Buy First >_<
3189,Game is fun but the lag ruins it ...
3190,Swords go SHWAAAAAN and the guns go bang bang and oddly enough crossbow does a BRRRRRRRRRR then the bow is a fat THWAP and spears and daggers are bullshit fuck anyone who uses them. Good game very challenging for new players would recommend grinding bot mode to really feel the game before heading into casual then play casual before heading into Trials(Comp).
3191,"Had high hopes for this one originally.
Interesting game on the surface but quickly fails, with a bad loot/invent. system, lame br, and over-detailed cosmetics to distract from the actual game. The controls overall also just feel unsatisfying and poorly integrated into the whole gameplay experience, that killed it for me. Game would be more appropriate as a f2p title, if anything."
3192,This game nice
3193,I'm suck at this game so i don't like it
3194,"Good game, good optimization, very fun battle system that has a high skill cap. However there are a few problems like with higher ping players runining your experience sometimes due to how netcode works in this game, and much lower EU/NA population than asia. But devs constantly improve the game so I have high hopes.
As for recommendation, might not be for everyone, but definitely worth a try."
3195,Useless Jumparound.
3196,"Honestly given the state of current FPS games, this BR type of game has been a HUGE breath of fresh air from FPS and I would highly recommend purchasing this game. :)"
3197,asd
3198,"This game is Just too good, finally found a very good melee PvP game.

I highly recommend this game. Just one issue I have is lack modes, wish Xmas mode that are introduced mainly Shadow Surge remain permanently"
3199,cool flying thingy with sharpy sharpy blade
3200,"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! It's really recommended for those who want to play battle-royale using sword, spear, bow, etc. This game is unique, not really depends on loot, it's pure skill"
3201,"So Naraka is Basically a Battle Royale but in a For Honor Style. You get summoned to a land with 60 people and duke it out until the last person standing. The design of the game overall well put. Combats not too fast paced or too slow, Easy to learn controls with tutorials to get you squared away with the game. You can even practice with bots before you go in a real match. The character models are Actually Really good, My fav being Yoto Hime, Than in the combat theirs melee and ranged weapons, pretty much make combos, certain attacks beat others, than you have a counter which unarms the opponent which nothing beats landing a counter and your opponents starts booking it. You can zoom around the map with the Grapple hook which is very handy and just fun to goof off with. Each Hero has their own unique skills, Yoto Hime probs the best beginner Hero to start off with. Ive only played Quick matches going in and it feels a little to easy especially when you win your first few games with 10+ kills. Maybe their actually Bots or just idk but either way theirs ranked and ima give that a go next. In game currency for skins, Battle Pass, and yes a Lootbox system but you really dont need it. Naraka aint that bad honestly and for the price its not bad but if you can get it on sale which i did i think its Def worth it."
3202,This game do be fun.
3203,Ye
3204,>=(
3205,"After playing for a few days this the first BR i really like the matches are fast (when you get them) and the movement in the game is awesome feel like a fight anime or a kung fu movie.

they are some things that need to be address first not all people are equal not sure of the cheating but i believe its there.

this should go free to play soon its fine for now but if it was FTP we would see more players and the wait time would not be so long.

finally for new players this is for you i suggest bloodbath to test builds and training room to tune your movement cause if i see you in BR or any high rated player for that matter its dead no mercy.

this game is if naruto ninja storm and fornite had a baby with kung fu movies being the uncle really fun game."
3206,"Movement? GREAT
Combat? GREAT
Ninjas? GREAT

A really fun game that relies heavily on player skill and quick thinking. A little bit difficult to learn, but very rewarding when you do.

Great game to play with your friends and the better you get at the game, the more it shows in really big ways.

Couple of beginner tips:
-Luck stat isn't worth it, don't waste your tae investing. Go for Grapple distance instead.
-Go into free training and test out the default weapon combos
-Don't commit to ranged weapons
-Embrace countering
-Stun locking is very common, some ults and abilities can prevent it until you learn how to avoid it entirely"
3207,Play it! thumbs for Yoto
3208,"Yeah, this game is another battle royal and I really hate battle royal games. But this game is an exception, probably the first battle royal I actually enjoy playing because instead of guns, you get motherfu*cking great swords, nun-chucks, spears, daggers, and so much more! Sure, there are a few range weapons such as bows and muskets, but you really gotta hit those shots to make it count. overall, this game brings something new to battle royal games and plus, there so many more game modes you can play. highly recommend."
3209,ninja parkour battle royale
3210,"I really try to like this game but its just so bad. low frame even with good pc. teleport, hackers. not fun in any way"
3211,OHHHHHHHHHH BOY! WHERE DO I START WITH THIS ONE... WHEN I WAS A WEE LAD MY MOM TOOK ME TO KARATE CLASS... AND AS A KID I WAS LIKE WTF AM I DOING IN A DOJO WITH 2 ASIAN KIDS NEXT TO ME... BUT AFTER 2 MONTHS I WAS HIIIIIIIIYAAAAAAAAAAAING AND ROUND HOUSING DUMMIES LIKE JACKIE CHAN ADVENTURES. IT WAS GREAT. FAST FORWARD 20 YEARS AND BAM HERE WE ARE AGAIN MOM. EVERYONE IS CHINESE BUT GOD IM LOVING IT. BRUCE LEE NUNCHUCKS... YES PLS... FLIPPING AND JUMPING AROUND LIKE A HOKAGE... UMM YES??? AND MOST OF ALL CUSTOMIZE HOT ASIAN WAIFUS. What More Could You Want???????? 10/10 Buy the game Dl the chinese spywhere LIVE A LIL.
3212,"This game is grate, but I played it just for 6 hours because I really don't know why!

3228,"You can no longer get Bruce Lee's hair, but you get his face right off the bat. His outfit is also locked behind a gacha system, with a very low chance of actually getting it. All I wanted was to play as Bruce Lee in a martial arts game, I didn't care if it was just a skin. But now I can never be Bruce Lee."
3229,get gud
3230,A great time if your into getting railed by 冰淇淋 for first 10 hours then transcending into 冰淇淋 yourself.
3231,"As much as i would like to like the premise of this game, i could not do it because of balance and feature reasons.

1. I cannot properly practice in deathmatch because they artificially fill it with bots. There is already a bot br mode out there and having bots in dm is redundant, we go at dm to make practice with people which makes human patterns and build our personal strategy upon that matter

2. the game was designed to be rock-paper-scissor in mind. 
rock for basic attack
paper for charged attack
scissor for parry
the biggest problem is only rock and paper are the only functional actions out there. parry is broken in a bad way where it is too punishing only but only for people with high skill level, the duration of parry only exist for half a second making it hard to actually use it against charged attacks, but in the same manner, the reward for parrying is too great because it drops the weapon of the enemy. 

This satisfies the concept of anti-fun, it is infirurating make it's intended use and it is also infirurating to play against. They should remove the demounting feature of the parry and but make the duration of the parry to last at least a second"
3232,smooth cool cooperative amazing it was a good experience ty
3233,"Ping is such a problem in this game that its getting to the point that its unplayable. If it wasn't for that I would highly recommend playing, I love everything about this game, but having 100+ ping all the time makes it hard to win fights."
3234,Very fun take on a BR
3235,Its just not fun
3236,"Really fun game. I really don't like royale games, but Naraka does not feel like one. There are plenty of other things I like about this game, but I'd rather keep this short."
3237,great game
3238,Huge boting problem and Rank means nothing you get matched up against everyone playing just to fill up the lobby
3239,this game need more rework! game was to jam when enter at lobby and also when at war!
3240,"This game is alright, the only problem is when 陳港生 with 9001 ping grapples you and you have your back turned. Once that shit happens, you're done for, just uninstall. The amount of Chinese players on the NA server is ridiculous.


Other than that it's an alright game."
3241,i cant start a match stupid game.
3242,"Do you know what the most potent predicament that humans face in this world? Arbitrary twitching. For some inexplicably reason, whenever I fancy masquerading as an Asian martial artist, delving into the deep ravines, I involuntarily twitch. Oft, my neck jolts, as though I have been seared with a thousand volts, or as though a chill has enveloped the air and nested upon the nape of my neck. It is an enigma, for not often do my senses become distorted and result in spasms to such an extent that it would put an elderly woman having a seizure to shame. Nor, is it normal that my fists clench when the sudden jerking moment occurs. After extensive analysis, I have deuced two possible motives for my lurching posture whenever I open this game.

The first is that I bear a cold seething hatred for all who carry Asian descent. Not a jolly day goes by, where I do not lambast the Asians who dwell in my precinct with a disparaging remark, or when I jog past an elderly Asian couple and smash eggs into their face. Why, for Christmas, I recall writing uplifting messages in permanent marker upon electrical power grids, calling for an Asian pogrom, whilst simultaneously wishing all a Merry Christmas. I know, I know, I'm too kind, but the motto is to never kick a chínk down on Christmas, for that is the day of jubilance. It could be that my negative disposition exhibited towards the yellow herd, has channelled itself and fused within this game, flaring my fury whenever I load into the game and see Bruce Lee's furrowed brow and coal black hair. This would further explain why I have gradually become rather tolerant as of late, except for when I play this game, which inspires me with the zeal to cleanse the streets of the yellow vermin like my ancestors did of yore. 

The second, more plausible theory is that my dearest Bunnykins, who has captivated and entranced me into being her lawfully wedded, has decided to frequently massage my back whenever I go on racially motivated rants, which is quite frequent believe. Whilst this sounds benign in principle, she is ingenuitive and occasionally utilises a hammer in her massages, lightly tapping the bones and asserting that she is referring my 'muscle figments', whatever that could fathomably mean. Not often do I disagree or raise objection to my woman, for I fear that she may drug my food and sexually assault my ailed body at night. Why, the only thing I raise against her is a chiding remark, alongside a backhand, as all affable, loving husbands should, for if a woman is not smacked about like a tetherball, then how will cease acting like a petulant brat? No, no, they all need to be smacked, preferably across the rump, where I can cop a feel. Anyhow, I digress, for these massages are pleasant enough, omitting the fact that she uses a FÚCKING HAMMER AND IS PROBABLY CRACKING MY SPINE LIKE A COCONUT CRAB!

In summary, I still remain perplexed over why my back spasms exclusively whenever I play this game. It could be due to my repressed xenophobia over lesser, inhuman races, or alternatively it could be due to my marital partners 'loving massages'. Fortunately, after incessantly protesting her antics, she has thus refrained from utilising the masseurs instrument and has now proceeded onto rubbing either peppercorn or lip balm across my back. Furthermore, she occasionally plays my back like a pair of bongo drums and frequently straddles me, whilst proclaiming that I am Prancy the Pony. This, I fear is the burden of marriage that I bear. It is only with my vast collection of Welsh literature, alongside my punching bag, shaped distinctively like an Aboriginal newborn, am I able to stay sane and take solace in these trying times."
3243,"[h1] Actually laughable elo balancing. [/h1]
[i]I was wrong to give this game a positive review at first because it's just another title buried deep in another greedy corporation's pockets who don't care about their game and community's health.[/i]

The biggest issue with this game are the Chinese and Japanese (but mostly Chinese.) - No, this is not a racist thing, and it's not entirely their fault for causing this problem but as well as the developers because they can't seem to bother pulling their sh*t together. This game has the worst case of smurfing i have ever seen in any game and it is on such a large scale that it is literally digging its own grave. I mean, who's the smartass from the board room who gave the green light to implement three different ranked modes with separate elo across [b][i]ALL FIVE SERVERS?[/i][/b] Smurfing has never been easier ever before than it is in Naraka. 

- And yes, the game does have consistent patches with weapon and hero balancing but it is on such a minor scale it hardly fixes anything. Instead the game is drooling for your money with overpriced cosmetic chests and purchasable apparel and weapon skins while the dev team's main focus are never ending limited-time events and other gameplay content updates. Perhaps consider fixing the game [b][i]before[/i][/b] you add a ton of new stuff when it is in such grave danger? Continue like this, there will eventually not be anyone left to buy your cosmetics anyway..

What do you get when you create a game with a steep skill gap and give it poor marketing? You get a game with a medium to small player base and struggles building a larger community because new players are chased out almost immediately by veteran players. So the game is then left with having all the most skilled players go up against each other as the very few new to familiar players get their cheeks clapped.

It is [u][i]IMPOSSIBLE[/i][/u] to elo climb in this game because unless you're playing at a time where most Chinese are asleep, they [b][i]will[/i][/b] invade your ranked matches and they won't be anywhere near your lobby's actual elo. 9 out of 10 games i and my friends play, there are always at least 1-3 top #1 players with platinum and up elo in a [b][i]BRONZE[/i][/b] lobby across all the different modes. Yes, you read that right. [i][u][b]B r o n z e.[/b][/u][/i]

The game's mechanics however are pretty decent but the star of the show is definitely the unique mix-up for combining martial arts with battle royale. - Brilliant idea and something new in the battle royale genre for once and felt refreshing to experience. 

[i]I do understand it is quite difficult to make a fighter game without a steep skill gap though. As fighter games just have that [i]almost[/i] inevitable factor, especially with so many different variations that are embedded in a looter battle royale, where there are so many various items with each their own statistics and abilities. So of course there are going to be some imbalance within said items and a challenge to equally scale them with each other, but locking the ranks to be the same globally server-wide and only separate across the different modes; solo, duo and trio, would be a [b][i]GREAT[/i][/b] step in the right direction.[/i]

And for those who are thinking ""but you're just bad, so get better."" [i]- I'm not all that ""terrible"" which i'm not saying to brag but rather to prove a point as I soloed to nearly gold my first season after starting to play.[/i]

[u]As of now, the game isn't very fun anymore.[/u]"

3254,Naraka is a cool game however it is not yet optimized. I am playing naraka using a RTX 1060 GPU and i still experience some lags and delays. I thought since i was using high graphics it was like that then i put all graphic settings to low but i still experience some delays. Devs need to optimized the game a bit more. I heard that some of my friends tried playing it on lower GPU and they experienced worst. Dear devs please fix the FPS of the game and optimized it. Thank you.

3256,"I love this game to death. It has one of the best gameplay loops I can think of and is nearly the perfect BR for me. Which is why it sucks having to write this review. The staggering amount of eastern players on US/EU servers is frankly unacceptable. You can go from a 30kill game to a game where you can't even react because the enemy is desyncing so much it makes a mobile seizure look like a  stock image. You never see them get banned but they flood the leaderboard and every match. You're only hope at a good game is doing quick match and praying the chinese players with VPNs are only looking to MMR climb in ranked. Blood bath is usually extremely fun as there is no competitive scene behind it so you're 99% of the time playing with players with a decent ping.

When losing against players who are simply better than you, it is still fun and satisfying. You can think back and go ""Oh I should have done this,"" or ""if I would have countered here I could have turned that around."" Losing in such a manner almost never makes you rage. Losing against a player dysyncing who is pulling off combos then teleporting behind you or somehow countering you 3-5 seconds after you've swung does not feel good. It can completely destroy an a good time and will genuinely make you drop the game for the night or entirely.

Until a strict stance is taken against VPN and desyncing players I refuse to spend another cent on this game and will advice others to stay away. 
"
3257,Super Fun Game
3258,"Updating my review to be a bit more descriptive (and less salty).

TL;DR: An interesting take on the battle royale genre that is sadly overshadowed by technical issues. 
Things like high ping (no SA servers), unfriendly new player experience (b2p, veteran players have some advantages) and small player base. 
If/when you find a good match you might have a ton of fun.
Unfortunately most often than not you will spend a long time waiting in queue, only to join a match and proceed to get destroyed and sent back to it a few minutes later.

-- The Good --

- Fun melee take on the battle royale genre*
- Gorgeous graphics
- Well optimized (I have medium specs hardware and have no issues)
- Bots which can help new players practice*
- Multiple different modes, if you're not in the mood for BR*

-- The Bad --

- No SA servers
- Bad netcode
- No region lock
- Bad matchmaking
- Small player base
- Unfriendly to new players
- Progression crawls to a halt after a couple levels
- Bots which fill the server and pad the stats
- Loot boxes on a b2p game (cosmetics only, but c'mon aren't we past that?)

-- The Ugly --

All of the above together. 

My average experience can be described as: 

Spend over 5 minutes waiting in queue. 
Join NA server with around 150ms ping. 
Server is filled with bots, a couple players here and there.
Kill a couple of bots.
Die to a player that's either a veteran of the game or abusing high-ping (or both).
Go back to queue.

-- Thoughts --

An interesting melee battle royale that's unfortunately burried beneath a host of technical issues and design flaws.
Given the major problems this game has, most of the positive things that sound good on paper don't actually work - and in some cases might even contribute to the problems.

Melee combat:

First and foremost, which is the bread and butter of this game and what entices players to jump in.
The main combat revolves around three actions, Regular attacks, Focus attacks and Parrying. 
Focus attack beats Regular attack. Parrying beats Focus attack. Regular attack beats Parrying. 
Simple enough right? Well, it all goes through the window due to the ping issues (lack of regional servers, people abusing high-ping).
When fighting high-ping players you're often not able to hit them at all, or what it feels like it.
Regular attacks that hit on your screen just go through them. Want to parry their Focus attack? Good luck.
It is by no mean a one-sided issue as I've noticed that some times enemy attacks that clearly should have hit me completely missed.

Bots:

They help new players learn the game and can also fill servers so they don't feel empty, which is good. 
The problem is, after you're past early learning curve, they just become a nuisanse.
Other than their 0ms parrying ability, they just become pushovers. Most of them die mid-match because they're stuck outside of the zone somewhere anyway.
It is nice that you can play against bots and still complete make progress towards your account/hero/battlepass levels, but this is mainly a competitive game, I shouldn't be forced to play against just to get a stable match.

Small Player base:

Given the above, it's no surprise that the player base for this game is small. REALLY small.
Most matches are 90% filled with bots, which is awesome to start with, but quickly becomes boring.
Some times I run into the same few players over and over in the span of a couple matches.
There are a variety of modes by itself that's good. But when you have an already small player base, splitting them into different modes only serves to worsen the issue.
If the small player base is a result of the issues, or if the issues are more aggravating because of the small player base, it's hard to say.

New Player experience:

New players don't get their own queue so unless they play against bots they will get matched with veteran players, who will usually just destroy them.
Adding to that, the game boasts an account progression system called ""Talents"".
As you level up you unlock slots which you can fill with ""glyphs"", which can also be upgraded using in-game currency.
These give passive buffs which range from worthless/niche (less damage outside of zone) to must-haves (higher energy cap, energy recovery speed).
This puts already new and inexperienced players on an even worse position compared to players that have already unlocked these buffs.
Also, unless there's an event going on (which there were plenty when I joined) progression quickly halts to a stop.
There are only 3 daily tasks, after completing that you're stuck with end-of-match experience, which is low. 
That coupled with slow/bad matchmaking and the small player base makes it very unsatisfying.

-- In conclusion --

There are a number of fundamental problems that bog the game down and prevent it from being great.
I'm no game developer, but if I had to change one thing it would be to lower or remove the barrier of entry. 
Transitioning to a f2p model - or at the very least hosting more regular free-weekends -, this might inject some energy into this game.
Of course, resolving the other issues is also a priority, without which new players will probably not stick around.

This is a good game, I wouldn't have written this ""essay"" if I wanted it to fail, it's just sad that I and many others can't enjoy it because of these issues."

3287,"A real disappointment. Especially as someone who likes alternate BR games 
So many generic/bad things I despise copied from other games.

Negatives: 
1) Lootboxes from Overwatch
2) Challenges from Fortnite
3) Battle Pass à la Apex
4) Generic Inventory/Menu UI
5) Shop overpriced (paying close to 20 bucks for a single skin)
6) They advertise ""Bruce Lee"" as a playable skin, but he is nowhere to be seen, hidden under insane paywalls and RNG
7) They FORCE you to wait 2 hours, before you can open your ""Deluxe"" boxes, so you can't refund the game.

As for the gameplay itself: 
Was fighting Bots constantly and getting tired of it, so didn't even get to enjoy that.

Im writing this review to save others the time and trouble."

3310,"TL;DR - This is a GREAT battle royale game with fun high skill ceiling combat and great graphics that is 100% worth a purchase. Biggest complaint = latency issues in some games.

The combat has a great rock paper scissors mechanic with the addition of some animation cancels and tech chases to give the game a high skill ceiling with a lot of room for player's to learn and improve. You can just mash left click if you want to but that won't work against people who know what they're doing.

There's a small learning curve with a lot of items/weapons to learn but the game starts you in games with a few other players and some bots to start out so you have time to learn the game. I read about the bot games in another review and it honestly put me off at first but once you'll be out of the bot games in no time and they will let you pick up items and READ what they do without someone grappling you from across the map and destroying you when you still have no idea what's going on.

The graphics are great but for some reason the game will lag horribly in my first game each time I load the game for the first time, like it's loading in different assets and freaking out but in the games after it's fine. The game does recommend installing on an SSD instead of an HDD and I think it's for this reason. My game is on an HDD.

The only big complaint with the game is the latency. In some games, you will watch your attacks go through player models whilst they hit you you you'll watch a parry-able focus attack go THROUGH your parry animation and hit you. This is all clearly latency issues and as mentioned in another review, they should region lock the game or do SOMETHING to help with this. Maybe the devs are worried about player count if they region lock? Just speculation."

3315,"10/10 for me!

This is very likely, in my honest opinion the very best Battle Royale game on the market. Sure it suffers from vpn abusers and region hoppers, but when that's fixed - it will shine even brighter.

Naraka is a true gem - a mix of BR and a fighting game. If you haven't played it, give it a chance. It has a steep learning curve, but feels so rewarding.

Hopefully we will see a console port soon - with true cross-play we will have an even vaster playerbase!"
3316,"The game is quite fun actually. But it has a huge learning curve that's really hard for new players to get used to. Many hard mechanics weren't explained in the tutorial, and you either have to figure them out after a long period of trial and error or search on youtube for player-made guides. These are basic knowledge required for competing against other players, so, they are VERY important. When you get used to everything and start getting the hang of it, the game becomes a lot more enjoyable, especially with friends. 
Why i didn't recommended it was because the lastest Xmas update had messed the game up, lag spikes, fps drop and input lag was the worst of it. My PC was average and could run the game smoothly before the update, and all the mentioned problems didn't even occur."
3317,"Game is easily a 10/10 in terms of combat and graphics and completely different from all these other BR's, However, expect to get smoked by 猫婊子 everytime you get confident in a game. Anytime you see this name, I'd recommend you look the other way and just grapple as far away as possible. It isn't worth the humiliation. If you see a red bar next to their name, that's even a bigger reason to run. You may become racist whilst playing this game but don't let it affect you like it did to one of my friends, he doesn't even enter china town anymore."
3318,"This game crashed so many times while I was in game. Game is good, but this unknown crash issues need to be worked on. Deleting the game because the crashing issue make me lose interest in playing it. Do better at your error handling when writing code."

3324,goood
3325,"the game-play, graphics and combat are all fantastic but like most people say there's a lot of outstanding issues that i think are keeping players away

apparently it really benefits you to have an SSD for this game. If you don't and have a semi well-performing computer you might be able to get some okay load in times but sometimes it just sucks

I play a lot of online games whether it be on steam or otherwise and this is the first game where I try to start a match , in the NA region where i live, and my ping jumps from 800 too 500 to 200 and then finally down to a respectable number, but by that point the game has already begun, so i've missed the character and drop zone select and THEN i STILL have to wait for the level assets to load. Ill be looking at loot i know i want and try to jump to it only to realize its inside a building that hasn't rendered for me yet.

even with that being said, i still go through my day finding myself wanting to play it and often do, I just really hope things like this get fixed before the game dies because of its issues"

3334,"I'm a bit conflicted about this game.

It's really fun and runs very well. The controls are smoothe as butter and it feels good. That said I can't stand the amount of cash grab systems I'm seeing within this game or the fact I feel like the MMR let me win my first games to try to hook me into it's cash grab systems. 

Being 'rewarded' with currency that expires so I can buy a limited time available cosmetic is really lame to me and being able to buy that currency with irl money defeats the purpose of working to unlock such things. Plus seeing that loot chest system? Big big big no. I came here to play a game not to gamble there's a reason that shit is banned in several countries and why the CCP hates gaming. And the nail in the coffin for me is the fact that you asked me to follow you on all the platforms and if I still wanted to play when I tried to exit the game. I'm even less inclined to follow you now or play again after it put that crap in my face.

So overall, while this game is a blast it will try to manipulate you so hard into you paying irl money for cosmetics that it turns me off for the same reason I don't date gold diggers. If you respect yourself, your time, and your money, don't play this game. Take care, and peace."

3341,"Naraka is a is hero based battle royale game with fighting mechanics set in an asian playworld.

[h1] Pros [/h1] 
There is a high skill ceiling due to combos and enhanced gameplay features, multiple game modes, ranked solo and trios and with duos currently only playable as quick match (but in testing phase for the ranked duos). 
Game looks beautiful and runs rather smooth (except for some stuttering in larger team fights)
The currently 9 heroes have their own abilities with multiple customization options and fleshed out tutorials and guides to help you learn and understand the game and heroes. Also, there is an active community to back the game and share news.


[h1] Cons [/h1] 
The game has no region lock or ping lock, meaning you get to play (as an european) with asian or american people, which is not neccecerely a problem... but it becomes a problem when upon region switch you rank is reset (if u are NA rank 1 you will be placed in eu bronze 5). Many players use this to their advantage, to swap servers and play with 400ms ping. Since the game has no Region, nor Ping lock, and is client sided, it means that those players lag behind and can easily outplay you, even if they are not that good at the game itself, robbing players who play on their home servers of their gaming experience and fun.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1] 
Overall i recommend this game to people who are looking for a challenge and the experience to witness yourself growing and learning in this ""marshal arts"" styled BR, however, be prepared for some frustrating encounters with people, who are not from your continent and are lagging around and/ or will completely destroy you even if you are only bronze 5"

also the match making is so turd you place bronze against plats....wtf, sort your head out...(angry because this is such a good game but the developers are so numb in the brain to notice whats killing the game..)

3381,"This is an amazing battle-royale game for people who want a skill combo based mechanic instead of a looter shooter. i enjoyed playing it very much ........... while i could. Sadly, after a month since buying it,  its connection are never stable. some of you might be thinking that the lag might not be that bad. IT IS SEVERELY BAD!!!! the game is almost unplayable. i only play this game now to get the rewards i got from the pass i BOUGHT and hope that i can use them when the game's bad connection actually gets fixed. I do hope that the devs fix this issue. in the meantime, I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NOT BUYING THIS GAME (unless you're in china. you wont have any problem there, i assume)

PS: yes. i have checked my own net. its working fine. i play other multiplayer games too like valorant and dota 2. they all work perfect. so, there is no issue from my net"
3382,"10/10 would parry again to be parried. 
Had a blast playing this instead of buggy COD Modern Warfare 2019 since Vanguard integration."
3383,"poor balancing, bug+hack alot"
3384,"Ranked is not region locked and matchmaking doesn't work, so as a complete beginner good luck against some of the top ranked Chinese players in every game you play. I hope you like losing. If by some miracle you do get into a balanced game, good luck against the horde of hackers."

3386,Alt+F4 when u see nametag 哟妈妈
3387,this game is very good. high graphic setting but mmorpg and fair gameplay. i do recommend this game because it is very interesting. btw thank you fot letting me play the trial. see ya
3388,Even tho i loved the gameplay i just cant recommend it right now. Its pretty bad optimized and stutters quite a lot. Wait for next sale maybe they have fixed it then
3389,"This game is really fun when it works but it's so poorly optimized it will literally crash your computer if you play multiple games in a row without restarting it.

After a few updates now the game crashes so hard it took down both my computer and my router."
3390,fricking good
3391,Pretty fun and challenging. It's not a game for everyone for sure.
3392,"Fantastic game! I've played mmorpg's most of my life but I'm tired of all the grinding required to compete with the mass. Naraka Bladepoint games are like the exciting launch days of mmos. The combat system is really fluid and engaging, also being more skilled makes a huge difference.
I have tried other battle royale games in the past but Naraka is the only one I enjoy. I'd recommend giving Naraka a chance even if you've tried other BR games and didn't enjoy them."
3393,Lots of fun. Great graphics.
3394,Best game ever! Interesting
3395,NICE GAME
3396,love the game!!
3397,"This game is so fun and the characters are so gorgeous.  The game mechanism like a perfect union of overwatch, pubg and blade & soul. It has a lot of quests for different progression systems, which may seem too confused and time consuming. However, the cosmetic rewards all looks beautiful and exciting."
3398,matchmaking not region locked
3399,fun but requires skill
3400,Love it since the first day come out ! Will stick forever !!!

3403,wuchen is hot
3404,This game has lag issues and some character are unbalanced.  It is fun but i would only buy it on sale.  It has ton of in game purchases.  I would say it is a bad game that has potential to be good in the future.  Right now it is bad.
3405,Got jumped then 1v3 the team after my friend rez'd me fun game
3406,very fun
3407,such an amazing game ruined by the fact all servers are overrun by squiggly named players who out fight you without being able to fight back even in bronze league.
3408,"yeah this is really fun
"
3409,"Hi, I must now express my opinion about this game after I have over 100 hours of play. This game has a whole new battle royal brought to life that is very fun if you meet the right opponents, unfortunately that always happens only at the beginning of the season, because the game has sbmm. The first 5 rounds, you just win and then it goes, you only meet Chinese who grind this game on the other level, you no longer have a chance and die against everyone. Please just remove this sbmm from the normal lobbies it's no fun anymore. playable for me this game will only be back in the next season.... (btw. I am for Germany how is it possible to face Chinese players at all...)"
3410,Good game if u want to play it more serious.
3411,"Love it! But Im broke, sorry"
3412,"Legit a fresh breeze in the otherwise stagnant BR scene. Fast paced, most heroes feel balanced, good weapons and skills. Recommended"
3413,Best game
3414,Very good
3415,"nice 
"
3416,"this game is unplayable because of poor servers 
if you are in MENA do not buy this trash game . because the server is so bad you can't even move your character.  
 
i got 5G internet  my download speed is 656.11 Mbps and my upload speed is 68.58 Mbps  
 
so i even changed servers still very laggy i can't move my characters sometimes internet connection Lost . the problem is not in my internet the problem with the game servers even my friends they face the same problem so we refund the game .   
why i pay for this game if the servers are so poor 
 
NOT WORTH IT."
3417,"Money grabbing. Way too many skins and unlockables hiding behind paywall. Pay up or just grind for hrs.
gameplay is quite good, but as with all competitive game once u queue in with human not AI it's not fun anymore."

3447,"Graphics and design are very nice. The game pace is quite fast when constantly encountering opponents. Moreover, this is a game that requires skill when each weapon, each character has their own combos, which makes the game much more challenging. In short, this is a game worth playing, especially when playing with friends."
3448,"bad performance even on decent rig + installed to SSD

has been this way since launch."
3449,"Insanely good combat mechanics, more like a fighting game than a battle royale. VERY VERY high skill ceiling, generally the better players almost always wins in a 1v1 situation.

3458,"I had high hope for this game. Very big let down. Let start with the controls.
Not once I found the option to play with the controls or keyboard layout. Let alone even to change the graphic within game.
First try the game crashed on me just getting the sword. The analog stick sensitivity felt higher than my mouse. both were hard to control just to play.
I did enjoy creating my character. even had the option to use a photo to apply within game to make them look like my character. 60% match but that good enough for me. Heavy crash grab just passing the tutorial. you exit one screen and another page pop up asking you if you want to buy more skin for your character. This game not for me. best to buy it when it on sale. didn't get the option to play with bruce lee :("

3476,"Naraka: Bladepoint is one elegantly sculptured hand reaching out to you, palm upwards, for more money while the other elegantly sculptured hand raises its middle finger in your face. Beginning characters get immediately thrown into combat with seasoned, hardcore players. Weapons wear out almost immediately, too. How do you fix them? With repair kits! Where do you find repair kits? Everywhere. Where do you find new weapons? Everywhere? Trouble is, YOU HAVE VIRTUALLY NO INVENTORY SPACE UNLESS YOU BUY MORE. Buy inventory. Buy goodies. Buy customizations. Buy outfits. Buy THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY MORE STUFF. Until and unless you feed a constant stream of requests/ demands for more purchases, you get your ass handed to you within minutes, if not seconds, of a match's beginning, then spend the rest of the match watching other people have fun. Want to avoid that fate? BUY MORE STUFF! 

Look, I get it. Game production isn't cheap. But the core purchase of Naraka: Bladepoint buys you nothing except some very pretty promises that other games meet better and with far less naked greed attached.

Screw this game. I'm uninstalling it, and I consider my purchase price to be money wasted on zero fun."

But its hella unfair sometimes. Especially because people from other regions abuse having a high ping."

Once you no longer fight against bot player. Real player can kill you really fast, especially if you against squad of 3. Bought it on sale for only 13. Def worth it IMO. 
"
3480,Kurumiiii
3481,"This game appears to have EVERY thing you could want in a game. Amazing graphics, fast paced action combat system with fluidity and no jankyness, movement system just as good as the combat, story lore, variety of content. These are the things I look for in games. And are absolutely present in this Naraka. However, all that being said, I just can't see myself spending anymore time on it. 

I'm sure a lot of people will see that meager 16 hours I have and think to themselves ""this guy don't know what hes talking about with that pathetic low play time"". But trust me, them 16 hours were more than enough for me to figure out EXACTLY why I don't like this game and also why I'm sure a lot of other people will dislike it too. 

---What I liked---

- Graphics - Top notch, on the level of games like Black Desert Online. The best of the best in terms of graphics.

- Fluid movement and combat - This is sometimes difficult for games. The more fast paced it is, the harder it is to make it fluid and clunky free. vice versa for slower paced combat systems like traditional RPGs. Naraka turned out absolutely perfect with its fast paced fluid movement and actions. No clunkyness at all from what I seen.

- Assassins Creed parkour - When I say assassins creed parkour, I mean take the parkour system from  - for example AC Unity(arguably the best parkour system in the AC franchise) -  and upgrade it to a point where its the best it can possibly be x1000. Thats Naraka's climbing system in a nutshell. Ubisoft could learn from these devs. 

- A little bit of Lore - Of course there is world lore that you can experience. But the lore I liked most involves the individual characters. Each character has their own lore. I like this as it makes the player feel more attached to the character by progressing through their ranks to unlock their story. 

 ---mixed feelings---

- The customization - You can customize the characters a little bit. But for the most part they have preset features. Thats fine. I just feel like its unnecessary to put hair options in the game and thats it. There are different costumes too. But most of them are recolors of the same sets. Obviously this means dying your outfits ain't an option.

- Ultimates - Ultimates are awesome because they look cool. But they don't really spice the fight up at all. They seem like added extra abilities to make the combat feel less boring and simple. But in reality, they are just cheap ways to get a free kill or two on an unlucky player who decided to get into a fight with you while your ultimate is charged. Half the time, I don't even use it because I want to just straight up outplay someone in sword-play. Also, its absolutely clear to see, some character's ultimates are far superior than others. At the very least, the devs should try to balance them.

---What I disliked---

- RPS combat - Yes the combat is extremely fast paced and fluid. And yes that is absolutely a plus. But none of that matters when it revolves around a system that will have you - p1 - trying to counter the opponent - p2 - when they charge up their blue attack(BA for short). Don't know what BA is? Picture this in your mind:

You - p1 - can do regular attacks that just simply do damage. Or, p1 can do a charged attack(BA) that does a lot of damage and possibly kills p2 flat out. Sounds fun right? Yes, it is. But that fun is quickly replaced with rage here soon. Now picture this in your mind: 

P1 and P2 can do regular attacks which are 1-3 hit combos. Anywhere in this 1-3 hit combo, you can do a BA. This means that p1 can't just go into a fight mashing the left or right click button. P1 has to pay attention to p2 and wait and see if they just do a regular combo, or trys to pull off lethal BA. Same goes for  P1 if they get the first hit and can initiate a combo. P2 will have to pay attention for when BA comes around.

Whats more, p1 and p2 can also do a parry action(PA for short), which is designed to counter a BA. If p1 successfully PAs a p2's BA, p2 will be disarmed and stunned. Making it a lot easier for p1 to kill p2. 
So thats fine right? You just need to watch for when p2 decides to do a BA in their combo, which you will punish with a PA. 

WRONG!

Lets forget the fact that combat is already difficult for p1 because p1 has to get the first hit, to initiate a combo. Which is harder than it sounds. You have to dodge p2's attacks at the right time and then attack yourself. This will hopefully put p2 in a flinching sequence which will allow you to combo their ass. Whoever gets the first hit, more or less will boil down to dodging skill, and of course, ping. 

Lets also forget that p1 has to watch for the BA, p2 trys to unleash, assuming p1 failed to get the first hit. Finally picture this in your mind:

BA's can have various stages of charging. What does this mean? This means that p1 has to watch out for p2's BA and prepare to use a PA. But also, p1 has to guess whether or not p2 will unleash the BA on the first charge, second charge or third charge(most weapons only have 2 charges). Making that PA seem kinda useless right? Right! Not only that, but you can even FEINT the BA, and just go back to regular attacks. 

So to summarize: There are regular attacks which feature 1-3 hit combos. There are BAs which can be comboed within the 1-3 hit regular attack combo, or just charged without combo. This BA can be charged once, twice or sometimes even thrice. This BA can also be canceled(feinted) and swapped back into the 1-3 combo. There are PAs which you will use to counter BAs. But predicting when that BA will unleash, is very very difficult, making the PA a bit useless. 

And this folks, is why Naraka's combat system is what people call rock-paper-scissors. And is also why, I'm done with the got damn game. 

Yes, I recommend.

Thanks for reading!"
3482,everything
3483,"Excellent game, but the koren players are strong"
3484,nice idea for a game but bad game in general. Everything is made for you to avoid refunds because the moment you start playing against real people all the cheating and tryhard ppl come. Bots vs Humans skill is like day and night. You can solo 6 bots but if you come across real player its gg. Hated the experience i had.
3485,"Played during free trial. If not overpriced I would buy it. Better then any other Battle royals by far.
PS: I actually hate battle royals.
"
3486,good idea
3487,china not number uno
3488,yes this  game is cool but just be aware of chinese hackers that just slices you in 2 pieces.
3489,"A fairly competitive battle royale game that I personally like even though I'm not a BR fan but this game can change my mind.  The weapons are unique and each fighter has his own abilities such as healing or turning into a giant.  Even though I only played it on free weekend, I thought about buying this game."
3490,"Very good and fun game , Only issue is against people with lag but it's not that big of a deal , a fun game to enjoy yourself or with friends :D"
3491,"why cant i play this game free if i have installed it and even played it before. butt when i played i thought it was pretty fun
 (i had incredible much fun with the face customation)"
3492,trash
3493,smooth and fun
3494,kul
3495,';...;'
3496,"Well this game is really fun, i played this game in beta and its still rock, i don't know about lags but this game runs perfectly for me, smooth and no lagic. Even invited friends and we insta buyed. Gonna play much more in deacent time and will enjouy this amazing fighting game. It's just hell of fun too play even solo runs."
3497,meh
3498,"How to not sell a game: Advertise that Bruce Lee is in the game. Buy the game, play the game. Find out Bruce Lee is nowhere in the game. Ask for refund."
3499,"This game is a reskin of the mobile game ""Super Mecha Championship"" and is just as janky. It plays poorly, is very laggy, and isn't worth the space on your HD. Honestly, go to SMC and look at the HUD and abilities. Plays the same. 

THIS IS NOT WORTH PAYING ANY ACTUAL MONEY FOR. NOR PLAYING FOR FREE.

I have no idea how this has so many positive reviews. Oh wait. It's a NetEase game. Willing to bet money a considerable amount of these positive reviews are paid for."
3500,"good game ,but it expensive to me"
3501,pay to play battle royal game that sets up a kernel level anti cheat. good game but full of sweaty neckbeards who think that being a good swordsman in game makes them a samurai irl.
3502,"I wish i could give it a Neutral rating.

It's an interesting game when compared to normal battle-royales, it definitely has its own flick with their open-world movement system, climbing / grapple-hooking / all that acrobatic third person stuff.

However i feel like the screen is really cluttered, full of everything. There's a lot of interesting mechanics to get acquainted to when it comes to PVP (most of the time its melee weapons but you have your occasional point and click ranged) however it just feels sluggish when fighting, unpolished too. 

It's just not my cup of tea, it feels like PUBG mobile with all the odd progression system thrown at you, I don't know why but this game really throws me off and gives me an odd vibe.

The characters aren't as customizable as you'd think, face-wise yes but body-wise most of the stuff is locked behind paywall / progress.

idk man it's ok but at the same time pretty mediocre.."
3503,nice wifu game
3504,good game !
3505,real good when i tried free for like 50 min but not gonna pay for a battle royale it not worth to pay to play even tho its a good game
3506,Game is fun and i like it
3507,This game is quite good
3508,good game
3509,love this game yea there can be some laggy bs moments but the combat the maneuverability climbing up walls hanging from rafter i especially love playing this with my husband we work well together and pretty easy to learn hes pretty new to different kinds of gaming other then fps games. but if your good enough at reacting you can still survive multiple people attacking you at once. its really not unfair i just started playing during free weekend it worked it got me into the game i got to try it and now i'm glad i bought it helps i got it for 10$ less too trying to get others to join. too. there are different modes the main mode is battle royal which is also done well no falling into the map from the sky like most battle royals no you spawn randomly in the location you picked. so people with better connections don't really get an advantage. the other mode i played was also fun its a big blood bath you fight a bunch of people in a small zone you get to choose out of all the weapons and time based with re spawns get the most kills/points before the timer ends and you win. Cosmetics i really like too there are battle pass related cosmetics but there are also ones you can earn for free and loot boxes you can earn from playing the game as well. multiple characters to choose from all have there own unique styles or abilities and specials. one can turn into a big giant that grabs you and through you to the ground i gtfo when he shows up another that stuns you or another that basically mermaids you sucking you up in water holding you so it can throw a watery spear at you. oh and the map yes it stays the same but you don't load into the same spot every match parts of the map are open for selection and it changes what available every match i have still found some places i haven't been and i have a good 13 hours in the game already anyway thats my review love the game hope more join in.

3528,"UPDATE: Ping lock is still not a thing but having pc and console players in the same game makes for a more balanced field. More balanced.. Still gotta git gud scrub.. there's always an Asian better than you XD and they could indeed be playing anywhere in Asia... China, SEA, Japan, etc. Coming up on 3 man pro teams trollin as Kurumi Pack in norms is gonna happen on occasion. But if everyone keeps giving up on the game because they don't want to get better or really any other reason, is just going to hurt the western scene in it more. I can appreciate the Devs trying and realizing it's too late in life for a ping lock unless the player base grows more. Skins are still amazing. Map updates are seamless. New heroes and their abilities are epic and varied. It's a Looter FIGHTER Battle Royale. Not an FPS. Closer to Soul Calibur than to CoD.

The game is beautiful. Well designed. Movement is amazing and battle mechanics are fun... if you can see or participate in them. The developer never issued a Ping Lock so everyone can play in what ever region they like and lag all the way to victory. And if you're in NA... well you're that region! Get used to Asia in majority of your games splashed with some EU and South America (they at least share the server). Also you're own ping will be too high to be able to play the game! So if you're an amazing theory crafter/mind reader/predictor of movement... this game is for you! I played in hopes that it would get better but it has actually gotten worse. The developer doesn't care at this point and is just leeching money... How do you have Bow/musket weapon description for LITERALLY EVERY WEAPON?? I sacrifice rate of fire with my katana? Yeah fo sho! Lazy. Lazy. Lazy. Which sucks for the reasons first stated. I kept playing in hopes of ping lock being issued and I enjoyed the game despite its flaws

"
3529,Super awesome wish it was free but damn a must play.
3530,the gameplay is good but the problem is the server
3531,Fun from what I have played so far. Great sword ftw
3532,"Free trial review:
Game is honestly fun when it works, has a lot of mechanical depth and interactions between characters and weapons, combos and animations look and feel great, movement is surprisingly very detailed, flawless and clean with only climbing being slightly janky. Sadly it mostly doesn't work due to ping, disfunctional parry mechanics and being unable to do anything once you're stunlocked even by one player, god forbid if it's more than that. If either proper parry starts to work reliably when I make a read and press it or animation canceling starts to even MAKE it work as it is explained in many guides I've found on youtube I'll likely buy it. On top of it I don't understand whos great idea it was to make it a lmb+rmb input combo to be an unchangable parry input that will work when it isn't needed and not at all when it is due to issues mentioned before.
[Update]: did end up buying because it's fun enough, but the parry issue didn't go anywhere even with me getting better at managing my inputs and getting off significantly more parries. The laggy enemies and input issues are still there sadly. Hopefully it's something to be fixed in the nearest time, and overall I'm more inclined to give it a ""Yes"" after learning it more."
3533,"this game is super dooper fun and if your looking for a fun online PVP to do with your freinds i would 100% recomend naraka thank drumsy for introducing this game to me i checked out this game and i knew that this would be my new favourite game >,>

this game has to be region locked!!!

fun game,, bullcrap parry physics. all the real parrys are from the code of this game being bunked!

will still play this over other games because of the idea that it will one day be updated to help the western players!"
3545,this game make me chill
3546,"Update - Game is F u c k e d, Server is F u c k e d, Its trash now.

Free Weekend Review - A good mele combat battle royal where you can actually enjoy rather than those other battle royal games. This is a good game and I would love to play it but the price tag is way too much for my region. Even at 30% off this is expensive when there are free battle royal games available.

I would actually buy it if they would have considered regional pricing. Despite having over 100 ping on sea servers and constant ping fluctuations which I was not expecting from this game, it is still playable.

The battlepass costs way too much as the game currency is really high priced. I mean I get the not free battle royal to avoid cheaters but seriously overpriced battepass when we have to buy a BR game is absurd.

I did like the free rewards and gameplay so I am gonna give it a positive rating, but please give us a good regional pricing or a good discount as for India its a bit high priced. Unless this game goes to 60-70% off I am not buying it myself. I do want to play this game but I am not gonna pay that price for a BR."

3550,Nice style. I really wish it was a single player game.
3551,"TL;DR : buy this game if you really like the combat system, otherwise i don't recomend it.
(End up buying this game and edited my review i write during F2P week) 

Love the combat because it feels like a souls game and for me personally it's still balanced as long you train  how to combo everything so rank or level doesn't matter here if you know what you're doing. Other than that, this game is mostly a cash grab without giving the player insentive to do ranked match. There is almost zero purpose why i should rank up in ranked match other than increase my matchmaking time, no skin, no special accessories, only avatar border that no one cares. Sure sometime they give you a lootbox and event to get free accessories but other than that there is nothing to keep me motivated to play this game.

After the battle you only get exp for your weapon and battle pass and it's capped at level 25 for weapon and 120 for battle pass. THAT is the only source to get basic currency (Tae) outside event. I don't  know what happen after you maxed a weapon since i'm not reach a level cap and it will take a long time to do so."
3552,this game is quite fun with your friends and perfect to be a Christmas gift
3553,"Genuinely one of the funnest games I've played recently, had tons of fun learning the characters and customising my characters. Really enjoy the swordplay and abilities. But i do think the reaper crossbow can be a bit dumb and the new guy Yueshan his ult seems a bit annoying to deal with but ive learned to just hide up in a tree and wait it out. But other than that the combos are really nice arent hard to do but arent one button easy would 100% give it a try when its on sale or f2p weekend"
3554,"There aren't many battle royale games I enjoy. I used to play fortnite but that time is long gone. I occasionally play apex legends but it doesn't hit the same as before. But this game, this game, Naraka: Bladepoint is different. It is and isn't like other battle royal games but also has its own special and unique features. I feel that this game will the best battle royale game in no time."
3555,grapple grapple grapple
3556,unique battle royale game i have played
3557,"The combat system is great, mixing cleverly skills and vertical progression.
- Each weapon obeys to the same rules while still having their own combo and special moves => awesome game design
- Visually speaking, not only the AD is great but the combats really look like martial arts movies. You can see people jumping on roofs, catching an opponent who just flew in a tree, an so on. This is amazing."
3558,"Matchmaking isn't fair.
Game doesn't explain more then the basics to the newbies.
Ambient audio is glitched? can't seem to hear a thing ex.: wind,water etc... ( audio doesn't look smooth )
The movements is a mixed of spamming shift and space, basic and stressfull when it comes to combat 3rd parties and u are trying to escape but u can't cause u keep getting stuck on the "" movements ""
The combat is based on spamming and get staggered, can't dodge while stagger to u are force to take hits.
Over all , I enjoied playing the game but I wouldn't give more then 10£ for it."

3572,Fun though not really my thing.
3573,"Really fun game until you play against some dude from Asia with a 400 ping. It's not that these players are particularly good, but it's the fact that they don't feel their own high ping. Meaning if you play from Asia and connect to the EU server, you can just crush people because they literally can't hit you. Until they do something about that, I'm not touching the game. Other than that the game's pretty good."
3574,great and fun game! love it!
3575,"Do I recommend this purchase?
No. Primarily because it's following a ""Free-2-Play"" model and the game nags you for money all over the place.
PUBG follows a similar model and will be available completely FREE from Jan 2022. If anything 24 Entertainment should follow their lead.

Do I recommend this as a game?
Yes. Personally I really like the theme and the martial arts feel is a refreshing change to the norm.
The environment is really pretty and everything feels like they belong there, as opposed to being forced in place.

I tend to find Battle Royale games to be very slow (Especially PUBG) which doesn't suit the style and goes against its roots (See Unreal Tournament). Thankfully Naraka Bladepoint moves at a reasonable pace and it doesn't take too long to traverse the maps with the help of the grapple hook and wall climbing.

Word of warning: For those trigger happy chappies out there. This game is designed for close quarters combat using swords / spears / nun-chucks etc, although the game features some ranged weapons you will need to quickly change to a melee item as you cannot rely on using guns alone."

3584,"Very fun like very fun it is been a while since i had this much fun in a game.

Edit: The games player base is mainly asian which makes it extremely hard to find games in the west, which is a massive problem. If u check the player numbers u see them peak at 100-120k daily making it usually one of the top 10 games but during western hours sometimes it disappears from the least or has around 10k players.

I am not sure how they can bring and retain a large playerbase but the game is amazing and i wish i could play more but 3-5++ mins queues is a bit much"
3585,addictive gameplay
3586,"TLDR; Great game, somewhat held back by hackers and a feeling of p2w elements. Still worth it to me.

The long version: This is a great game. If you like martial arts action with some general mixture of Asian-themed mythology, without looking too closely at some of the bits, this game scratches a lot of the right itches. Many people don't like it because it's similar to f2p games, but it's not free. I'm not one of them. 

BUT, and here's the warning for those who are on the fence about getting this game, it has two major failures: Hackers and the pay-2-win thing. Now, I'm not saying you have to pay anything to win, but there are characters who feel very much OP hidden behind a grind/paywall. You can grind for them, or you can pay for them. My suggestion, if you play this game, save your coins first for one of the pay-2-play characters. The chest you could get for 4,000 will only mostly get you a cosmetic, though some are admittedly cool, but that 12,000 will feel much farther away if you go that route. 

The far worse issue is the hackers. To be fair, it can be an issue in any game, especially since competitive esports has helped make those hacks into big business. Fortunately, not too overly common, but definitely there. When you first start playing, you will get a sense of accomplishment, but you will soon realize that you're being placed against bots. They'll run right at you through objects, though they couldn't possibly see or hear you beforehand. Sometimes they get stuck on objects and terrain and keep running. That's a major problem. This helps in the early parts of the game because you are shielded from the best players and worst hackers. As you face more real players, however, it makes it hard to tell sometimes who's a bot and who's hacking. In their defense, devs promote reporting of hackers. After you die, there's a report function if you observe the player who killed you. There may be other ways to report other players, but they aren't as obvious in-game. Going to the official website (and Google will help you here), you can find a page where they ask players to help them combat hackers. You can either report in-game or submit a report on their website. Players who submit a valid report are rewarded with a legendary spear skin. I feel like that's a pretty good deal and shows at least they're trying... unlike some others I could mention.

So, the take away. The game is a lot of fun, and it's possible to complete achievements in matches that are mostly bots. Though it's pretty easy for the most part (not much of a challenge), it's a good way to help players practice and get better. The game is beautiful, features decent mechanics, and offers a refreshing change from standard battle royale games. The change is mostly thematic (there's still a storm). The character customization is decent. Clothing and hair options are limited right now. Re-colors of other outfits are too common. Loot boxes often give you things you don't want or need, for characters you don't use, but I've made some very good finds. Hopefully this will expand greatly as the game continues.

Should you get it? On sale, for $15, it's not bad. There's a battle pass (thanks, Fortnite, Rocket League, et al.), which costs more money after buying the base game, and some feeling of p2w elements (though perhaps a lot of it is just smart players choosing to use more powerful characters), and some of the complaints raised in this area are valid. Is it a balance issue? Is it p2w? Still, at the end of the day, I'll be putting a lot more hours into this before moving on. Nobody says you have to spend anything more on the game after buying in. And that's a good thing. I recommend it, even with the ugly stuff, if you think it's something you'd like.
 
Game on.

Update: Things have changed a bit since I wrote this review. There aren't as many people playing in my region as there were before. Makes it easier to climb ranks, but it also makes it more difficult to get matched with players of equivalent skill level. With all of the promoting of this game for North American players, I suspect that it isn't just my region experiencing this issue. Having said that, you may want to consider carefully whether you really want the ""battle pass"" since there may or may not be a Naraka next year or the year after, depending on their choices. Another thing, and this is only a warning for those who find demonic possession troubling, the most recent hero draws his strength from a demon which is inside him. There are many different spiritual elements in this game, and this isn't the first time the developers have included things that might be troubling to a few players, but this is the first time I've seen a character who clearly struggles with an invading entity within himself. Since I supported and encouraged others to play Naraka, I felt it necessary to make the changes clear to anyone interested in avoiding that subject matter. Many will think this foolish, but some won't, and I'm writing this for them. 

Also, the problem with hackers has only appeared to get worse. I find the competitive modes mostly unpleasant for that reason. And when hackers turn up in the bot modes, you'll know because they'll target you before they should even be aware of your presence, catching up to you when it should not be possible, and you'll be dead from attacks that happen much more quickly than they should. They'll teleport away to evade you, and drop back in when you're not looking for them, crossing huge sections of map in the blink of an eye--and no, I'm not talking about the characters with teleportation abilities. A true shame as this game has so much potential."
3587,"OKI
"
3588,"The most fun I've had in years with a battle royale, the formula becomes addictive thanks to the combat mechanics 
The graphics look amazing, the map is pretty, the character customization is INSANE, the gamemodes are enough to keep me playing for hours nonstop, styling on your opponents is extremely satisfying.
Just add RTX and its perfect  :0

3589,"This game's assets load so slow I'm tempted to reinstall Ark Survival every time I play a match. Seriously, what the hell, I get it that you recommend an SSD... but freaking asset loading shouldn't take me 5 minutes in an approximately 20GB game even on a HDD. That said, I love the game, been waiting on my 1TB gaming SSD to play more and see if it performs better.

Edit: It all makes sense now... After a while I decided, you know what? Lemme see what engine this game uses. Well guess what, it's on Unity. No wonder assets load slower than my grandma can walk. Unity is notorious for extremely slow asset loading speeds. If you've played other Unity games, you know. BUT, here's the thing, not all Unity games load their assets this freaking slow."
3590,nice maps and cosmetics but these chinese devs can't update or remake the bad combat system or optimise the game and also the animations aren't well synchronized and chest drops are ptw you only get blue items.
3591,"you spend the match killing bots then you get jumped attack by a real team and they kill you in one combo...

either make the game PVE vs all bots or remove the bots all along its really stupid to see bots in a hardcore competitive game , its like giving a kid 3 wheeled bike and then roll him down hill..."

3594,i love it!!!
3595,"Cons
 -Expected a full game and got a mobile game micro transaction and this game comes with the worst of it.
 -Level progress is basically a loot box with no duplicate protection.
 -Expect VPN players to teleport around you with katana and great sword
 -There is three currency and the in-game currency are barely use that the gold and silk is basically the only transaction.
 -You will hate the Chinese players because their own server is so toxic full of hacks and network manipulation, that they will go get on other server only to do the same thing.
 -The best player on your city will be a guy in Asia with a VPN.
 - game balance needs to be work on

Pro
 -Game play is almost perfect, and most duels are fun.
 -Character design is great.
 -Character customization could be work on but it's not really that great.
 -Environment of this game is great but it has some weird geography."

3604,"I cant recommend the game, even though it is pretty interesting and the combat system is actually fine, the fact that you start getting people with chinese characters as usernames that absolutely shred ass because they have 10-20 ping all the time, makes it pretty frustrating to be honest. This game needs regionalized servers, without them just prepare to lose to asian kids all the time because of ping difference."
3605,"Meh games region locked, the only way to play the english version is to VPN and play on 250 - 400 ping...How about making it possible to change the language in the chinese server?. I get why region lock exists (politics) but theirs no reason why i should be able to change the main menu text at the very least."
3606,pretty good
3607,"Edit: While I had the free weekend version of the game the Dev response made things a little better and hopefully they will improve the initial experience as I can only imagine this might leave a sour taste in the mouths of new players. I changed it to Recommended because as stated in my review it is a fun game once you start playing it and everything works.


Playing during the free weekend I learned that this game has a huge problem that is only fixed if you have a 100 dollar piece of hardware (or cheaper if you want to dedicate just having this game to it) in order for it to function properly on current hardware. Although the core gameplay loop is fun I cannot recommend a game that you have to pay for that also doesn't function properly without an SSD, and while I do have that in my PC along with the latest graphics card the game on launch should not stutter like that on default out of the box. Its beyond excusable that you can lose a match because the game itself decides ""Actually how about I take a smokebreak real quick"" and you end up losing. Fix this and that barrier to entry will vanish."
3608,"More bugs than actual gameplay, impossible to fight once you're knocked over, and grapples are more broken that Pathfinder in season 8. Not worth the money aside from making myself look like a monster from Wrong Turn."

3614,"Fortnight, but aimed to an older audience. It was a lot of fun. You pick between different characters who have a similar move set with two skills that change between the characters. Like fortnight, you team up (in groups of 3) and hunt down enemy teams to be the last one standing. Also, a shadow slowly moves inwards to force people together or they lose health. Gear tiers felt the same as fortnight too (white, blue, purple, gold) and each upgrade is noticeably better. But it doesn't automatically grant an edge since skill plays a part. I noticed there was likely a high internet or graphic requirement as a few times enemies would just be running at a wall to get away from me or something. It's worth a look if you enjoy these types of games."

***************************************************************************************************

                             I tested the game prior to its release, and then recently on the free weekend. I am very happy with how the game has turned out. I have to say, I really like grappling & the combat. Though, it does at times seem like the first hit can dictate the outcome, as you can click a few times while theyre down,  pause then click to immediately stagger them for a final beat down (wont give away which char, you can take the time to figure who's broken) though there are quite a few tweaks i would suggest, One big one being an afk timer. A smaller one that i enjoy a lot, (but should probably be fixed) is how easy it is to sit atop a tree and afk until someone comes around where you literally maul them like a leopard. :shrug: do whatever, games fun as it is anyhow.

Hopefully they fix this issue but I also couldn't do anything in the menus. It was like it kept switching between the controller input and the mouse and keyboard. Anyway, if you can get around the SSD issue and the problem I experienced, it's pretty fun."

3638,"It was a very fun weekend, but the game lacks depth. There are only two types of attacks and a parry ability.
The movement is smooth and the grappling hook works really well. Jumping from tree to tree and hiding in the treetop is a very unique experience. The customization is deatailed you can even do unsymmetrical designs.

But what is the end goal? You can only get so good at the game and the fun is going to be dependent on your teammates, as I personally don't like the solo mode where you can get caught up between multiple combatants too quickly. If the enemy team just ""gets"" the few mechanics, you are going to be stomped.

The battle royale setting also feels like it was only made to make the game more popular and I think it would have been better off being like For Honor.

I think the game is worth the price tag in general, but not for me at this point."

3641,I am enjoying this game so far. I think the movement is comparable to apex (imo its slightly better). The combat is fun but frustrating. The worst part about this game is the predatory microtransactions. They are the worst I've seen on any non-mobile game.
3642,Yay
3643,"Don't really think it's worth buying, at least not at full price but it's definitely fun (if you can run it haha)"
3644,"Joined free weekend, grinded 6hrs and just to find out I cannot unlock a new character without buying the game. First 6 games was like fighting bots, then, when you pk with human, I got stomped so bad that I feel bad. Sometimes, I just dont know how did I die because of their absurd amount of damage dealt towards me."

3654,"Characters control well, but thats about it. 

If you have fun clicking through hundreds of menues to redeem each little thing individually, this is the game for you. The game is laggy and badly optimized. If you install it on an HDD it keeps complaining each time you start the game. I'm playing better looking games from my HDD, which all manage to run flawlessly. The HDD message is just an excuse for bad optimization. Also, with the hundreds of ""unlock this by doing that""-buttons, the game presents itself more like a free to play title that needs to monetarize on everything, even though it isn't. The icing on the cake is the ""follow us on youtube / twitter / ..."" popup when you exit the game...

Btw. you need to remove the anti-cheat manually from your windows installation after uninstalling the game."

3657,"As mush as i love to play this game but it doesnt let me. Nearest region is CN which im getting this error "" Login have been restricted from your region :| "" ,which is stupid, and also its impossible to join other regions ...
"
3658,"BE WARNED: Sometimes the  game  just randomly puts you in games with bots when you que Ranked or casual. And it gives no explanation why. My guess is server issues and not enough people in EU playing at that time. This seems to be a problem in group ques primarily. Solo que is looking good. And the best part is you get ranked points anyway when crushing these bots (bots are terrible). This basically makes ranked a joke cause now i don't even know if someone earned it or just got carried by bot matchmaking.

The game itself is fun, not as hard as people make it out to be tbh. It is suprisingly ok balanced for the type of game it is. I would say 80% of characters and weapons are viable. The netcode is  pretty ok you wont notice severe lag issues. However it has been shown online that parry inputs can be screwed with rubberbanding inputs. 

6/10 for me. Has potential to become very good if it is shown some love with updates."

combat is fun though sometimes it feels a bit too spammy since stunlock is the best way to eliminate someone.

Customization while complex is only limited to the face. Outfits and Hairstyles have to be purchased / unlocked the same way you do it in Overwatch. All characters are genderlocked. I expected gameplay closer to what you can see on the trailers and footages."

3685,"Not usually a fan of battle royale games however this is fun. Pretty much an exciting ninja royale to play solo, duo or trio. More close combat than ranged with many different weapon types. Lots of interesting mechanics and movement, broad character design, great visuals. Have not yet struggled to find a match."
3686,"Combat is braindead, servers are bad, and this installs chinaware on your PC that sends your browser history to the CCP."
3687,"This game is like PUBG with martial arts but mixed with the Chinese game development. It crashed 3 times in 1 hour, fighting seems a little unbalanced and it is full of bots. I don't recommend a pay to play game to have this much payment in game including battle pass. This game is a mess in total."
3688,"This game is scum. It is a Free to Play(arguably Pay to win) game you pay upfront to play

Bittersweetly, Part of this scum is a fun and unique melee fighter BR. 

If you like paying for multiplayer only titles that are designed like free mobile games, you'll fit right at home with Nakaras nickle and dime economy, relatively slow cosmetic progression system, and constant bombardment of ads and promotions."
3689,FUCKING AMAZING
3690,Good game
3691,Great Game and It's currently free don't miss out!
3692,"If your idea of battle royale fun after a long day at work is getting gang-banged by a bunch of chinese players using crappy VPNs to avoid their governments online gaming time limits with big unga hurta swords spamming the same move using perfectly-timed macros, then boy have I got the game for you.

My more serious review is that it's a poorly done fighting game with a BR twist. It's a battle of wits as you race to out-cheap the other players, usually by having more grapple hooks in order to effectively stun-lock anyone and everyone to death. If you can manage this and get lucky with purple or gold armor, you've basically won the match, greatsword or not. No other mechanics function consistently."
3693,"GAME IS ALRIGHT, OR SHOULD I SAY THE TUTORIAL IS ALRIGHT... OK, SO I GOT THE GAME DURING THE FREE WEEKEND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PLAYING AS BRUCE BUT HES NOT EVEN AVAILABLE TO USE. THE ONLY THING I SEE IS A CONTENT CREATOR BANNER W HIS PIC ON IT. AM I MISSING SOMETHING?"

3695,"Was having a blast with the free weekend, but it was quickly interrupted by a ridiculous amount of cheaters with horrible anticheat. Don't get this game until it goes free to play, the devs give the same canned response for everything and people will defend it saying they've never had that issue ever. The second you get out of bronze or you start to improve you will find a cheater in almost every match. Killed all the hype and enjoyment I was having."
3696,"Fun game, little bit unoptimised, and some of the servers lag, but overall a pretty good game!"

3703,"so honestly not was i was expecting, which is my own fault for not reading the description of the game, here i am looking at this like, ""hey this looks like one of the best mmorpg's ever"" nope it just another battleroyale. me thinking it was actually going to be a better game but no im tired of battleroyales, its a very good one though i do admit but i lost interest very quick simply because the game concept lowkey needs to stop being made and i had higher expectations when i downloaded it."

3707,"really good combat, and this game fixes what to me is the biggest downfall of Battle Royale games: there's usually nothing exciting to do before battling. Running around getting loot in common battle royales is honestly boring, but the movement/parkour mechanics in Naraka honestly have me engaged just a little bit even in the offtime between fights. Plus, huge fights between multiple squads are much more exciting than in other battle royales.

The combat itself is good and there's enough skill gap in it where you can pour some time and feel like it's worth it

All in all, I really recommend the game."
3708,Kinda feels like Dark Souls PVP on steroids. Lot of fun.
3709,I like this game
3710,"Took only 3 matches until I found the first cheater. Just blatantly one shot me at purple armor.
Besides that, the netcode is UTTER TRASH. Run into some laggy incel, and there's plenty of them, and every purpose of this game is void. You're just randomly taking damage and fighting some loser that teleports around. And even when you're not fighting another player, the movement is so bad, you'll want to quit playing it just for that.
Another garbage game I wouldn't even take for free (played during a free weekend). If anything you ought to pay me for playing your trash.

Edit:
Also why the hell do those guys reply to tons of negative reviews, using the same off-topic template response? I am not even supporting your game at all. I paid nothing for it. ???"
3711,"yes, very good game"
3712,"nahbro, jankyAF"
3713,"As a long time player(5 months), I cannot recommend this to everyone. The game looks nice and plays quite decently, but there are too many foreign ping abusers, laggy servers, long game searches, and the drop rate on chests are insanely predatory as well as the store itself."
3714,"- If you like close combat pvp stuff, this is your game;
- Battle Pass, Challenges, new modes, new events, new updates;
- You face a lot (a lot) of 500 Ping 他妈的胡说八道 players;
- It has everything and every reason to keep you hooked for hours and hours."
3715,good game fun mechanics but queues are a bit long at times.
3716,"i tried it for free weekend, you couldnt pay me to play this trash its even worse than dark souls netcode pvp jank"
3717,This game is ok ok but after open exclusive box that only available in a limited time the drop rate is the lowest and duplicate drop is so bad.
3718,this game runs like ass with top of the line hardware
3719,fun mayb
3720,not a bad game altho it is kinda easy.
3721,"This game really just needs to go free to play. Everything about its gameplay is fire, continuously improving and learning new skills even with the time I've put in. You can mainly play ranked solo/duo/trio, bloodbath, and custom 1v1 lobbies. My play time is split between ranked solos and bloodbath. Ranked is what you'd expect, sweaty lobbies with 70% real players and 30% bots usually. Sure there are bots but I treat them as walking loot bags, there are a handful of actual players in ranked matches who will make you wish you ran into a bot instead. If you want to chill and relax a little bit you can do bloodbath which is what I love the most. Simply a free for all with 16 players usually about 5-8 of them are real while the rest are bots. match lasts like 10 minutes, full loot on spawn allowing you to practice against real players and bots, yes you need to practice against bots they got auto parry which will be the death of you if near a real players. Wish it went f2p but if you end up buying i'd suggest only getting the season pass if you plan on putting money in. Lootboxes are trash and there are multiple events that give you skins for free that originally require purchase. Great game m8"

3731,"The artstyle is alright, but thats about it.

The most important aspect, melee combat, feels very awkward and laggy. Every attack stuns, controls feel like have a significant delay. Combos arent satisfying. Yes, you can parry, but its also unresponsive and unreliable even if you react in time.
UI gives off cheap mobile game vibe, but maybe its just me. Movement is nice i guess, but nothing exceptional.
Dont know what other reviewers are on, definitely not worth its price."

3740,Why are you letting me win against bots?
3741,"Just played my first game and my impression is:

[+] It looks great;
[+] not lagg;
[-] it's a paid game with full of micro-transaction in game... with an initial buy you would think at least all heroes would be unlocked... a skin is around 2.000+ gold and 12.000 gold is 92$...
[-] people are allowed to team up on you if you have more kills apparently - I got 15 kills in my first match and ppl just ignored each other and just went for me... do keep in mind that if you have more kills doesn't give you anything of a bonus, actually people being allowed to gank on you it's a really a big minus - not sure, but kinda looked like I was also marked on the map because I didn't even have time to heal before more ppl showed up; also, how can you be top 7/20 when you have 15 kills?
[-] outside of match talents that are also unlocked by levels - really doubt that's a good thing for the balance of the game;
[-] no spectate camera after death;"
3742,"I've been waiting for such game for a long time, but I'm disappointed because : 
- can't change language to English. yea yea I tried but since I'm in China, I think it's locked to chinese language only. 
- devs really need to work on games optimization ( stream and LOD ). I run all my games smoothly on my predator helios, except this game. 
- I'm gonna follow and wishlist the game, hoping it will fix the lag and language issues soon, then I can buy it. 

cool game but I can't recommend it now.

"
3749,"This is game is fun with all the satisfying combat and cool upgrades. But i'm not a fan of pvp or battle royale so take this as a grain of salt and enjoy with friends. There are bot battle royale mode for practice but don't bother looking for a match with duo or trio If you try to. If you like combat with a mix of br then give it a try even there is free for all gamemode for casual game. But it has a steep learning and a very competitive community if you dare challenge them.

This review is written on free weekend."
3750,Not bad!
3751,"Not for me but I don't like Fortnite either and this is essentially Chinese melee Fortnite. Was hoping for more strategic combat and not swinging wildly against people lagging and hoping for the best. The fact that I came second in my first match while still figuring out what was happening says a lot. 

Just wasn't that interesting but even if it was I don't think you should support a game you have to pay for that also has in-game stores and battle passes. Very surprised this isn't F2P.

Looks nice though. Pirate lady is sexy."
3752,"This feels and plays like any other Chinese battle arena but with upgraded graphics that's all there is to this one.  The controls are floaty and the fighting is one sided either your overgeared or ungeared.  I've gotten lucky a few times and got good armor and weapons and solo a group of people early and late game.   This game should have been free from the start but they charge you for admission and what does that ticket get you?  Some starting characters and nothing else you have to either grind or pay cash to buy your next character or a costume.  If your charging for the game at least give all the characters for the paid game.  This is not worth it.  If your looking to pick up a melee BR there are plenty to pick from however, if graphics is your top pick than I guess Naraka got it on that point."
3753,Bad controls - laggy as hell and I'm pretty sure it gave me digital herpes.
3754,'interface error' even after reinstall and verify game files - can't get into the game - avoid
3755,"I didn't like this game, the visuals are stunning for a BR game with lush environments and detailed characters and weapons, but the controls are janky, and the fighting mechanic feels disorganised and is also janky, like some cheap game from 2010.

Just another example of the MANY other BR games out there since PUBG back in 2017. Not just uninstalling this, i'm setting Steam to ignore it forever! YMMV."
3756,"Interesting pretty game, but not really my type."
3757,Played during free trial.. My thoughts are.. Not a bad game.. but not good enough for me to pay to play it.
3758,Nice gameplay and great controls but terrible because it's a battle royale. They should've made this into an MMO real talk...
3759,boring
3760,i cannot believe that this is a paid game
3761,Game is fun for a bit but then you realize its the most un-optimized laggy sacks of wiener poop you could ever mistakenly download. Go ahead and waste your money I dare you. The game should be about weapon combat and player skill but SURPRISE NYUKKA its not. It's literally about un-counterable ult combos which btw will one shot your ass from full purple armor so good luck
3762,This game is so fun until you fight someone with a golden katana and you didn’t even know they were close to you
3763,I wish I was good at this game. Good game tho but am trash
3764,"If i wanted to play a shit game, I'd play among us."
3765,great game . kinda easy for yall if u ever played sekiro and its heroes are so well developed and the weapons are cool too. a rare BR game
3766,I was killed by a chinese while writing the review.
3767,"Played this game with 2 friends and had to refund it.
As much as I wanted to like it some criterias just didn't tick off due to:

Complete lackluster combat. This is the most important to me. I don't know what standards some of the people have in this comment section but the combat seems out dated by 5 years. Sure you have parry, have some decent attack animations but it ends there. People literally swarm in a group and bash each other randomly, if you jump 3 v 1 or 2 v 1 on somebody they have absolutely no chance, they just get staggered constantly, fall on the ground then get up, you see them trying to attack but you just overpower them, cancel out their attacks. Yes none of the 2 my friends died a single time in there, including me. 
Played games like Vindictus, Black Desert and Dark souls, yes that is amazing combat in there, you have the power to do anything just as equally able to escape no matter what situation you're in. I generally felt bad for people getting killed so easily in this game.

They give you 2hrs to refund the game but: 
You're getting matched with bots until you get your rank slightly up. So you get to see people only after an hour or so of gameplay, which is already bad.

The game is extremely boring. 2 out of 3 of my friends said it was boring. 1 tried to play more but eventually had to refund as well. The map is same, I played so little I already got sick of having to go through same location 4 times in a row. If that gets updated in the future, sure, but we're talking about now."
3768,"Played a bit in free trial and i have to say that the game feels pretty balanced , the combat is very fun . The only thing that should be done is region locking cuz 2 out of 5 matches you will die because some chinese guy with 500 ping kills you. I really like this game and I'd say its worth buying"
3769,without region or ip range locked servers = trash game
3770,"I’m not sure what to think about this game, I am not a fan of BR games as they all have been done to death, however I played the free weekend and really enjoyed it so much I bought it.  I have seen many players say they don’t like the Bots they play against, but for me its not bad and gives me a chance to learn the game. 

I went into an actual game against others and yeah some of them were teaming in Solo, but I held my own and came out as #2. I am not sure how I feel about the buying new outfits for like 10 bucks and the microtransactions. By completing quests and tasks you can earn the chests to get most of the things that you can buy, but it seems more challenging to fight to get them than for those snowflakes with rich families buy them. 

My overall thoughts are that I like this game and it’s a nice change compared to what I normally play.  I would recommend this game."
3771,you cant play as bruce lee ... you can only get a transmog that makes you look like him if your lucky enough thru RNG by looting chests to even get it ..... it was only done to get people to buy the game which i think is kinda crappy and false advertising for fans of bruce
3772,"First two rounds may be fun because you play against bots , but when you see the chinese names you know, you have nothing to say anymore. Just leave it be, its terrible optimized and full of hackers, so a big nono from me."
3773,"This is like black desert's shadow arena except it didn't flop , it's actually pretty amazing and tons of fun also it probably has one of if not the best movement and combat systems in any BR game , would really recommend this to anyone"
3774,Love this game and Having so much fun playing it
3775,"Yes but no , i swear every match i played was vs a.i and it was terrible, cool gameplay , cosmetics are w/e (optional) , but the match making felt terrible, like the people i played against did not feel like people i swear people cant be that bad to the point i win . 💀"

3777,"They really put all the Bruce Lee stuff in a loot box

3780,"Stupid, Greedy, Expensive in game payment like Smite. And therefor Smite is a free to play game but still much to expensive. I do not buy a game where I have to pay for stuff on top. What a greedy producer dont buy and support this kind of philosophy!!! 10 bucks for a costume WTF = 3 beer

Others are also talking about bad server with lags and chinese cheater kids. I can't tell about cause I dont waste my time with a game lacking of the points above. So you pay a lot... for less ;)

Fighting style is far away from a good beat 'm up and feels like stupid button smashing in the end.

If you wanna play a game with a good philosiphy do it with Outriders (but different genre and no pvp). With Outriders you get a lot for your money as it should be."
3781,gud
3782,This is actually not bad BR game.
3783,"Fun game, But once again Chinese player base is ruining it for the entire planet. So i cant recommend paying for it, play it for its free weekend see all the microtransactions for a b2p get killed by a chinese sweat lord and uninstall."
3784,not region locked

3786,bring rock from fortnite
3787,"I really like the concept of this game. The fights are cool, the progression is cool, grappling is fun. However, there are a few things holding it back. 
1. No region based matchmaking. Lots of lag.
2. Loot Boxes in a fully paid game. You don't get to double-dip on that.
3. This is personal, but I'm not a huge fan of the Fortnite/Battle Royale formula. I don't enjoy having to rely on the rarity of weapons during a match for loadouts.

So until they fix 1 & 2, keep your money in your pocket."
3788,ok
3789,"Not a bad game, but too generic and plagued by high pingers. Combat is good when it works and you dont get stunlock. Hope they improve it to be a little more ""dark souly"".
Oh, and there is TONS of bots in the matches, ranked or not.

Woudlnt recommend if you are already burnt of the BR genre.

PD: Forgot to mention, theres NOT region lock, meaning you will find a chinesse guy that plays 24x7 as a work on some random ESport club that will kick your ass while having high ping.. They really need to do something about it."

one counter attack is RB+RT, so unless your double jointed, its tricky to control"
3807,"Highly recommend it as a game that's unlike other Battle Royale games out there - you can be good with ranged weapons, but honestly, the meat is in the melee combat. You will constantly feel like you're getting better and learning as you play - of course, the hurdle to learning is big but it is extremely rewarding when you put in the effort."
3808,Good.
3809,good when playing with friends.
3810,This is one of my favorite games to date. I've never really bean into the BR thing but this game genuinely did something i didn't think would work so well. Highly recommend if your into fighting games or just samurai style games. It is a newer game so there still are some bugs but everything smooths out after a few seconds.

3814,"the game it self is great good idea but unbalanced heroes monk and youshan are too powerfull in rage mode yet for the other ones the rage mode is just some rusty second hand ability 
too many east asia players on EU servers its not the problem the problem begins when area get populated ping goes too 4 digits some times

3815,This game was basically a trial by my standards and I think it was good. This game gives you a feel of both an RPG and Battle Royal. My only concern with this game is that there is many bots not that it is bad but does this signal a red flag? This could mean there aren't many players on the game or on my particular server who knows. This game is so fun to play with friends as well!

ASIDE FROM THAT THIS GAME IS SUPER FUN!!! LEARN THE GAME AND FUNDAMENTALS! AND YOULL HAVE A GREAT TIME"
3834,"Naraka: Bladepoint has got to be my favorite PVP game of all time. After 400 hours of gameplay, I still play almost daily. I have yet to find a melee fighting game where the combat feels so smooth. If you like samurais, ninjas, sword fighting, martial arts, and parkour, this is the game for you.

The game has a difficult learning curve. It matches you against bots your first couple games, giving you a bit of confidence, only to lose it once you start fighting real players. Practicing combos, counters, dodges, etc against bots in free training will go a long way. Also, a recent addition to the game is bot mode, allowing you to play the survival mode against all bots whenever you want if you find you are getting wrecked by more seasoned players of the game. If survival mode and battle royales aren't your thing, there is a deathmatch mode called Bloodbath where you get to fight and revive endlessly.

The character customization is very detailed allowing some fascinating (and horrifying) creations. I personally enjoy playing as a Super Saiyan Pikachu and get a good laugh every time I log on.

I see lots of complaints about high ping abusers/cheaters and although I am not very high ranked (Plat V) I frankly have rarely encountered this, if ever. While  it may be an issue at the highest ranks, the majority of the player population (new players especially) should not encounter this. 

On top of that, plenty of Americans (my friends included) will name their characters/account in Mandarin even if they speak perfect English. You may feel you're getting wrecked by some Chinese VPN ping abuser when in reality It is some dude across town who has played a few hundred hours more than you. If you need to win every match, this may not be the game for you.

At the end of the day, slashing people with swords and zooming across the map with grappling hooks akin to Attack on Titan is my favorite thing to do right now. Patience is a virtue in this game, and accepting the difficult learning curve and embracing the process of always trying to get better will hopefully allow you the enjoy it as much as my friends and I have.

See you all on Morus Isle!"

Hyper mobile, quick looting, and a large variety of weapon options made even more versatile by souljades, this BR is fun from start to finish. With constant updates adding new modes and heroes, this game is growing and becoming even more enjoyable. This game isn't for the casual gamer. It's for competitors and people who want to be the best. I play on SEA servers so fortunately don't have to deal with the high ping abusers of other regions, so take that with a grain of salt, but if you enjoy BR's, martial arts, Asian themed games, definitely recommend it.

Also you can turn your legends into yourself via a image and it works pretty well, and I just think that's fucking awesome."
3849,"I love this game, one of the best BR game's I have ever played, such a fresh and unique concept. However, I won't play it anymore until the servers are region locked - it's not beneficial to play this game if you have good ping, just VPN to some 700 ping place and you'll win ever fight - it's stupid."

3855,"This Game was to beginning a good Game but after few months its just turned into a Chinese Laggparty on EU-Servers. This Game is ruining itself by not adding something that punish you to have a bad Ping, 
on the contrary you get an advantage when you are Lagging because the others cant hit you easily, but you can.
I try to give the Game in his current State an chance but every game there is plenty of Chinese Players in Lobbys and i think everytime why do i play this, when they all are Lagging as hell.
Its look like they dont even try to do something against them, you just have to take an look on the European Leaderboards or the most European Cities their ""Top"" Players all have Chineses Names."
3856,love it
3857,"Naraka: Bladepoint is a battle-royale game (ranked & unranked) with a few other modes like a sort of Free-for-all or TDM. it's a skillful game & you've got to be on your toes having multiple combos, strong attacks, movement, etc etc. It's crazy to get into as a new player, but you can train yourself in the practice mode against a stationary or active bot. It's a wonderful game & I prefer this over Chivalry or any other melee game. Talking about bots, there was a reddit post saying 'you'll be matched against bots for the first few games' this is wrong. Naraka also fills games with bots if there are not enough players which makes you feel invincible. next to it, I enjoy playing against EU people as you can clearly see they are either better than you or equal, but when a chinese appears you're sure that you'll lose. They abuse their MS to win the battle. No region lock, ping lock, cheaters, abuse of mechanics and balance issues.. I can't recommend the game as of now, but I hope the devs will finally listen. (I have nothing against the chinese, they're nice people, but the abuse of ping is just too much for me. It feels like I'm playing against an impossible bot.

Edit: the fact the devs copy paste answers says enough about how much they care about the community"

Updated: They promoted the character with hair made iti seem like you would be able to unlock it BUT NO you have to PAY money on a event WITH SHIT LOOT box rigged shit. There is no way to even it for free!!!!! I am done.
3869,"I am not a huge fan of the Battle Royale format, but I did enjoy the moment to moment gameplay of Naraka.  Due to primarily focusing on melee combat the pacing and odds of each engagement seem much more enticing than a lot of battle royales available.

Combat typically feels high in action and offers a decent balance across characters and weapons.  That being said though, there are of course going to be prevalent metas that pop up; and unfortunately constantly dealing with them can suck the enjoyment right out of a game.  The nature of balancing this game will be interesting to watch as I imagine the strategy would be much closer to a fighting game than a FPS BR.  The combat in its entirety though can be a bit shallow, and won't offer quite the same skill ceiling and granularity that the major fighting titles do.

Character creation was a great surprise.  While you are limited a bit by the base characters, the high level of tweakability for each more than makes up for it.  You can make some stunning characters.  There is a cash shop, battle pass, and loot boxes.  Some people hate all of these things, and while I don't parttake in them outside of the free/progression based offerings they didn't ruin the experience for me.  In fact I thought there were some very cool offerings in each, and I was also very pleased with the solid selection of FREE/Play to earn customization options.

If you enjoy the battle royale format and melee/fighting games you will probably like this.  If you are a fan of fighting games moreso than BR, you will likely find this game a bit to shallow.  If you're on the fence either wait for a sale, or wait for it to potentially go free to play down the road.

Edit:  I realize I forgot to mention one of my favorite aspects of the game -- the movement. It's very quick and responsive as a whole, and each motion feels as you expect.  The grappling hook works exceptionally well, and the dodge, crouch, run, slide, etc. are more than up to par for the melee combat genre.  The grappling hook adds a huge balance to the game that rewards positioning and forward thinking well."
3870,good game
3871,amazing game love the combat love the mechs please make more game modes and a bunch of maps u guys rock
3872,"+15 Social Credit Score

Hard to learn, hard to master, me getting addicted to Naraka was a pleasant surprise as I'm normally a FPS guy. The movement/combat feels stiff at first, but that's the (very) steep learning curve. Once you start getting it you GET it, it's immediately noticeable, and it's sooo rewarding. I'm still learning new stuff to do in fights 200 hours in, and I still feel like I have so much more to learn. That's evidence of the fantastic combat system Naraka harbours, and the constant events, healthy playerbase, updates and in-touch rapid balance changes is the cherry on top that keeps the game fresh and makes me look forward to playing it each week.
I almost forgot to mention that this game has a lot of features most battle royales wish they had, on launch. Like custom games, a blacklist system for bad randoms, a full profile with stats, MMO style character customization, and a match history

This game is HARD, especially if you're new, but if you're willing to put the time and effort into sinking your teeth into this games complex yet incredibly rewarding combat, I recommend Naraka: Bladepoint wholeheartedly."
3873,"This game encourages its players to have fun.  From time to time, you'll get a little sweaty just because it's a PVP game.  However, the really fun exploration and simple fight mechanics allow for a really fun sandbox battle royal.  If you're curious, you probably won't be disappointed."
3874,"Just another one of those typical Eastern made games that gives you a dopamine hit for the first week and then goes to complete shit and turns into a heavy money and time sink. They obviously admitted to using ""strategic bots"" as a way to gently introduce new players into what ultimately turns into a brutal ass pounding that I personally feel does more harm than good honestly, they are just there so you can toot your own horn and make you think you're a god and then you fight 西方渣滓 for the rest of your career and realise your garbage. I love how every trailer is some dude beating down what is obviously a bot and not showing much if any real player interaction. Like ""This could be you dominating the battlefield!"" but the reality is you are basically that bot, helplessly savaged by the Eastern hordes.

It's been a long while since I played it but I figured I should write something. I don't imagine they've done anything about a proper region-lock yet or found anyway to stop ""CHINANUMBERONE"" VPNing into EU and US servers (Or if they even give a shit) to dominate the leaderboards with their lag. Sure, the skill ceiling gets extremely high too but I always remember moments where lag gave them distinct advantages in moments it shouldn't, like completely ignoring your attacks when they aren't even focused, or their attacks phasing through a well timed parry, or when they manage to somehow interrupt you with a normal attack WHILE you are focused.

I honestly have better things to do than sweat on NARAKA all day long so I of course fell well behind the skill gap too and ultimately what was for the first 50-60 hours a somewhat enjoyable experience, just got worse and worse. It has its fair share of hacking too, having witnessed it first had a few times, one such instance when this guy had a hack that every time they charged up and released their focus attack they teleported behind you instantly from pretty much any distance and just juggled your corpse. Didn't really seem like they were bothered about combating it or other issues...just pumping out pretty skins for your weapons and characters so you can roleplay.

An otherwise very aesthetically pleasing game that masks its truly ugly nature underneath, I wouldn't honestly bother unless you hate your life, have no job and want to sit playing it 24/7.

The mechanics will be pretty straight forward but the community has found a way to abuse said mechanics which seem pretty straight forward and bland into for honors mean older brother, you'll also be fighting bots early on in matches and real players will slowly be faded in but understand you will get smacked your first game against actual people because the bots are super basic and use the mechanics in the boring way intended while the real players are extremely fast agile and ruthless all in all a really fun game if you like super fast paced melee combat and have time to devote getting good. ^-^"
3904,"game yg bagus

3905,"Fine in gameplay, bad in everything else.
Gameplay is fast paced and fun, if you train enough, third parties are pointless. Tutorial could use work for the new weapon types and combos.

Menu. It’s like a mobile game on aids. So many pop ups, when I quit the game, I want to quit the game not get more popups. Awards and coins are unexplained and same thing with the events. It’s so much garbage on the screen that it reminds me of p*rn ads popping up everywhere. WTF. it was so simple and clean in the beta/alpha, wtf happened

Game is good. Severs could use work as we do get mixed up with the Asian servers and get destroyed by a guy who is warping around the map with bad ping, killing everyone making me think I’m the one lagging but its him lol.
Giving it a no right now untill they fix the servers, and menue. 
"
3906,"Don't grab this game, not worth your time. This game is fun and all but it rewards laggy players such as Chinese players. They are not really the problems. They got good players and shitty players but this game is client based. For example, in your screen they have not moved since its delayed to get to us but in their screen they are already attacking us from behind. Either you will live in low elo with bots or high elo with red ping players who would basically ignore counters or attacks."
3907,The game can be really fun with friend but it has some flaws like you have some big input delay sometime and after the latest update the performance is really unstable.
3908,I really dig the game and actually stand a chance in a fair fight but when i approach a chinese guy who stays in his appartment all day IN EU SERVERS mind you using the governments money to live then idk they use the lag to their advantage and it fucks my game up maybe you guys can please do something about this???you guys let us choose our servers for a reason

3929,"Its pretty fun, a solid game all around. I wish there was a mode for people to play that are new to the game to play, it would help a bit with the learning curve. A lot of people unfortunately start to fight others and don't know how to deal with the rock-paper-scissors style fighting or know how to deal with the weapon attacks themselves and they give up after a short time. I hope to see the game continue to balance the weapons some more and bring them all in line with each other given how few there are, and I would greatly the game having less bots.

Edit to my review after playing for a bit more. The characters that have an ultimate that transform them are really, really cheap. In a 1v1 I can run usually but if I decide to play with a friend and run 3v3's (definitely not running duo's because when we did that in quick play we only fought people way out of our league) you simply run into a group and if the one using an ultimate that changes the character, there goes his low health that you worked so hard on, he's got that back and now he's after you with a monster that can't be stunned and you just get blown back or grappled every attack so you have to run and then you just get grappled by his teammates. I'm not changing it to a negative review, but I don't know if I will play much more. This is incredibly frustrating and I really don't get why with a game of what is supposed to be rock-paper-scissors combat you add in two characters that ignores that completely."

3959,sweat lord simulator.
3960,no
3961,yes
3962,"""Naraka: Bladepoint, is a battle royal with action elements.""

I agree. Gameplay-wise it has to be the best battle royale game.
Thank god it has customs and other modes. Because it's wasted as a battle royale.

The visuals are very nice and the customization options for each character are awesome.
(Whoever decided to have yotohime off the customizable chars - Eat shit.)

Melee fights in Naraka are usually skill expressing and exciting, sadly there's a bit of an issue with the balancing and I won't talk about the souljades or weapon ability upgrades if you will. Remove them from competitive and remove different armor types atleast.

It's enjoyable with or against friends.
If you dive in to deep however you will get hunted by teaming angry chinese people sitting in one discord that are in seperate teams but in one battle royale lobby to massacre all players together before they have their own custom lobby to fight each other while you wanted to get a few ladder points with friends on the eu server. And you can't report this behaviour unless you have it recorded and they somehow acknowledge the situation, which they won't as the company is led by chinese.

I can recommend it somehow if you keep it as casual as you can for your own sake.

On the other hand it's a meh for a more competitive player like me in this case."
3963,worth !
3964,"This is a sad review to write.  This game is actually really good.  However, the cheating I have seen playing this game for the past few days is easily the worst and most prolific I have seen.  It is bad enough that your only real chance of being in the leaderboards of any match without getting extremely lucky is to cheat yourself.  I have never used a cheat and have no intention of playing a game where I would have to do so in order to enjoy it.  Very sad."
3965,I highly recommend this game for people who are wanting to try a fresh battle royale game with new play styles. Be prepared for sweaty players or be a sweaty player yourself. Also try to avoid 朝香明 he can clap you in less than 3 secs.
3966,"sometime there much hacker ingame, cause only one hit u could die, that freaking thing inthis game, and using weapon skill without cooldown? and one more, wallhack inthis game are true."
3967,I am not the review leaving type but this game has absolutely blown my mind by the quality of gameplay and beauty of the world! I cant believe i've never heard of this game and just happened to stumble upon it in store. the Monster Hunter like play style and Dark Souls like pvp works so well together! 10/10 would recommend
3968,good
3969,its got the bigg pee pee energee
3970,
3971,"RNG is not bad
"
3972,Fix your damn servers
3973,Needs region-lock and higher pop or a complete overhaul of the counter/parry system.
3974,
3975,fuck this game because this game fuck me hard
3976,"Generally speaking, it is a good game, but the defects are also obvious. I hope the production fee can speed up the production of new maps and reduce some useless weapon skins. I hope the balance performance of the game will become better. At the same time, we also need to optimize the game to facilitate more players to join in."
3977,I received +9999 social credit upon opening the game very gud game
3978,"A fun game where the fun ends when that 混蛋 player arrives and just spams that charge attack without you realising what happened, I'm assuming those 6 million players they bragged about was only in china, cause I barely see people from Europe in this game, in an EUROPEAN SERVER. I'm mad i didn't refund earlier, but they baited me with those bots. I only found out about that later when the reality hit and you realise you're fighting against high ping and not other players. In the name of us in America and Europe, make a SEA server for the chinese players. Thank you"
3979,good
3980,"Played all of the BETAs, Balancing needs a little work and people with terrible network conditions seem to have an advantage, but overall it's very fun if you're not taking it too seriously."
3981,"[u][b]Game's dead[/b][/u], it has a declining player base with no new players, only ones left are just bots or 100hrs+ from SEA teleporting in short distances.
❌Queue Time
❌Skill Gap
❌Disconnection
❌Lag

Furthermore, the [u][b]Leveling Talent System[/b][/u] created a staggering amount of [u][b]Base Stats Gap[/b][/u] just to disincentivize new player and new account, makes you inherently crippled, fighting uneven matches, not due to lack of skill but rather lack of play time, or in this case, time spent being a bot getting killed boosting preexisting player's experience. 
Just die more until you unlock all the talents? Who's the genius came up with this?
❌Balance
❌Level Gap

You either destroy bot with m1 spam or you get demolished by fulled decked out player in seconds."
3982,"Even I have a lot of fun i cant recomment the game because there is no region lock so basicly 80% of the players on EU-Servers are asians with 200+ms ping so you cant fight them fair because try to parry attacks that got no animations because of the ping normal charge animation about 1-2 seconds high ping asian dude you`ll see like 0.1 seconds and lose half your hp while he gets 0 dmg because he already is at another location walking through your hits.

To close it Naraka has the potential to become the best Battleroyal in my opinion if the devs start doing something against that high ping abuse because right now looking at it as competetiv player its unplayable if you just wanna smash some heads casually its still good but if you seek for a fighting game with fair ranked options get the hell out of here"
3983,Very nice game
3984,"This is incredible lag and delay , everytime update is getting worse,screw you"
3985,"poor balancing, slow queues, lack of feedback from devs. Overrun by lagging chinese players because it's funny. Lot of teamers, abusers. Poor representation in worlds for EU/NA only trios allowed and very few teams"
3986,Amazing combat that will have you holding your breath from the first clash of steel until your dying breath.
3987,pretty much spiderman but with your favourite waifu's
3988,"Left click battle royale. Bots who literally have 0 AI, or people who seem to body you in a second without any real fight. Good idea for a game, bad execution."
3989,Good game.
3990,Its a good game.
3991,Chinese Battle simulator
3992,"Enjoyable and highly skill-based, I do recommend it however there are a few caveats:
1. Best played with friends.
2. Steep learning curve, your first few games will be almost entirely against bots.
3. All regions, especially NA and EU are plagued by region-hoppers with high ping, usually from China or Southeast Asia, and sometimes lag is an advantage (rubberbanding targets into an attack, hitting people through clash or parry). A region/ping long has been promised by the devs, but it's not yet implemented.
4. Some recent buffs to certain weapons and the two newer heroes (Valda Cui and Yueshan) are adding potential 100% to 0 combos with no means of escape in a 1v1."
3993,"The BR genre isn't my cup of tea, but i must admit that this iteration of it was the nearest to my liking so far.
If i've to underline something, i would go for the combat system. I've played plenty of melee pvp games, and this is the one with the less fluid combat of all. During the execution of combos i feel to be a slave of it, even cancel it by crouching it's so imprecise... and i've not cited the netcode which is very poor, added to the fact that lot of non-EU players gets into EU servers making the latency problem a real thing when talking about combat.
In my few hours, anyway, i've managed to become more effective in combat by getting more knowledge on how read some situations and how to approach to them keeping in count the lag and the combat system, overcoming some choices which remains poor imho, the game remains an original interpretation of the BR genre"
3994,A really cool freshner for the Batlle Royale genre. It rarely becomes stale and is a ton of fun. Specialy with friends
3995,This game has huge potential for further development

4002,"Matchmaking ping difference is huge. Sometimes when you parry, it won't go through, or there is a person that is lagging so much nothing hits them and you get hit from nowhere. If they fixed this, it would be one of the best games."

4011,You shold try this game it fun :3
4012,"1. Amazing game although the server still have a few problems
2. Design of the character are very epic and the face custom system is very attractive
3. Grapple system adds the action of the game very much makes it very fun
4. Counter for the melee attacks is very well implemented
5. Climbing is a very helpful and goes very well with the gameplay

This game is very fun in either going solo or with your friend. Although this game is very much going forward, and slashing your way through. This game still very competitive and also relying on your eye and ear very much as you go in the field to notice what happens around. Some of the weapon still feels OP and a few character skills also feels overwhelming. some of the audio still goes very loud but that can be configured in the settings.

Overall this game is a different experience and recommended"
4013,its good
4014,"A more melee-oriented battle royale

If you're tired of the usual game in the genre, then this is definitely worth giving a shot"

4025,"Have you ever played a game that your terrible at but can't stop playing, that's Naraka,  It's gameplay is insanely addicting, combat is fast and furious.  When you score a kill its bliss when you get wrecked you're in awww.  Even watching the matches finish is quite entertaining.  If you like high skill, fast combat games this is your jam.  Love this game, just wish I was better at it."
4026,"nice game 
really good BR IMO because the fight is more focused more on melee and i enjoyed it even though i'm kinda suck at it :x"
4027,"When Steam asked me for the ""Best Game I Suck At"", this is the only thing that came to mind. I was having fun with friends playing ranked, and that's when 雪花飘飘 shows up and decimates me and everyone I love. 10/10 would queue again."
4028,"<- SEA Region Player Review :)

Pros:
- Fun And Intense Combat
- Sekiro Movement Systems
- Unique Martial Arts BR
- Insane Character Customization (Jiggly booba physics 12/10)
- Great Graphic (even for potato pc)

Cons:
- Need SSD for game to run smoothly (unstable optimized, worst loading time without SSD)
- High-skill ceiling aka learn to fight better or died without land a single hit
- There are some cheater (Met some but rarely)

4046,"Despite this being a pay to play game, I think its well worth the cost. This game being as fun as it is, with or without friends, is so great. The amount of combinations you can do with weapons/characters seems nearly endless, especially if you're playing with friends. 

Few down sides: 
-The bugs you can find is astounding.
-Lag play on other people parts is astounding. 
-Chinese players will DESTROY you.

I enjoyed this game a lot when it was released, nowadays it just sits there. 10/10"

Chinese players are just another mini raid bosses. They are useful for whose desire improve your close combat skills."

4055,yes gAem gud
4056,Fun game
4057,"Very fun to play, the grapple hook mechanic is what sold me on the game. Battles are very high paced and exciting. The only downsides the game has are that there are no duo modes so if I want to play with friends I need at least 2 to make sure we dont pair with a random. Also a lot of my games are lost to players from the asian region who want to move servers to play against weaker players with less experience. But the upsides outweigh the downsides for me when it comes to it."
4058,yes

4079,just do it. your welcome :))
4080,"Amazing mash of different game types: Naraka brings together the thrill of a Battle Royale and the anxious button smashing of fighting games in very smooth way. In addition to the exhilarating gameplay there are also stunning graphics, which are accompanied by delightful music - creating a very enjoyable setting."
4081,"Holy sht this game is fun. During a clash, You breath, you lose. Each weapon and each hero have counters either trough positioning/witty timings/picking or utilizing other weapons. 

Do not believe to what people say that X is broken/OP. Everything have a workaround specially if your'e skilled on wits and proper positioning. You panic, you lose. Do not panic. I cant count how many times i managed to turn the tables on a fight and it felt so satisfying. 

Pros:
1. Unlimited combo possibilities to the point you get your own combo personality
2. im using a GTX 1650 4GB and with Nvidia NIS i can get stable 90fps on an ultra-wide monitor scaled to 1707x720 resolution 50% sharpening with Nvidia NIS 90fps average lowest setting but 100 render scale in-game and Medium Shadow. and everything looks crisp. No game-play disadvantage.
on 2560x1080 resolution 100 render scale, lowest settings with medium shadow. i get 60~70fps average. 
3. English voice is nice but i set mine to japanese and its perfect. 
4. Each weapon is completely different. and no re-used move set etc. 
5. Fun challenges.
6. Low floor with High ceiling trio matches. 
7. High ceiling solo matches.
8. Lots of Parkour 
9. Parkour is actually fun
10. Skins don't provide advantages. Actually most of the expensive ones are Pay to Lose because of their ambient animations if you want to play as sneak 100. 
11. The game is open for COLLABORATIONS! Huge Plus for me i love collaborations.
12. Emojis are fun to use.

Cons:
1. Server is not so good compared to valve dota 2/csgo. it says i have 35ms on the menu but in reality in-game its above 60ms ping. 
2. Performance hick ups when an enemy entered your area of vision 1st time. It freezes for a second and then you'll see your ping go red 300ms+ for 2 secs. I have constant ping monitoring and my ISP never does these fluctuations. therefore its on the game side when the game lags. it might have something to do with the client itself. Yes i have the game on an SSD.
3. No enemy voice chat after the game starts.
4. Emotes are just pointless at this point. do not purchase them or spend money for the sake of them
5. No lobby area. A lobby where players can just voice chat and talk to each other using emojis and emotes wouldve been nice. Like VRchat. 
6. Prematch talks voice chats are pointless as its hard to find whos talking. 

Love the game. Its very hard during your first encounter/fight with a player  but it just gets better as you develop your own combo.

"
4099,"Fun game with a pretty big learning curve. Seems like a big chunk of their playerbase is from China which could be using a VPN. Otherwise, fresh and different from other battle royal games."
4100,"What can i say about this game that might be meaningful...

The visual and audio for this game are superb. As far as the gameplay goes for a battle royal its refreshing. A mele focused battle royal away from scifi and far fetched realities its really a breath of fresh air with a full eastern theme to the weapons, skins and characters. The combat isnt hard nor is it easy. Certain weapons can be a little confusing at first however they are very easy to learn at the same time. There is some great level of customization to the characters and some amazing skins for weapons you coan choose from. All progression is tied to playing, leveling up and the battlepass. There is  both a free and paid battlepass, anything optional to buy in game is only cosmetic and there isnt a true way to make yourself better with money which is a huge win in my eyes. This game only gets better and easier with friends, coordinating attacks and having callouts is a huge bonus for this game like any other battleroyale. The only issue is the chinese playerbase seems to be all over the EU servers and i think they are working on this, Cheats have been seen but arnt common atall and ive only had a couple of experiences with them in my almost 30 hours."
4101,Good game play with friends
4102,It's the best battle royal game in fighting style. It's super duper combo game.
4103,"Extremely fun, even better with my friends!"
4104,"It has a really steep learning curve, due to the first few games being bots which makes it feel too easy at the start. But once you get into it and start pulling of 1v3  plays, you'll feel like a god."

4107,"Unbalance game, Yoto Hime champ so fking strong 1 ultimate can kill immediately"

4110,when i initially made my review i was mad at the state of the game now its pretty solid i feel like i only fight bots every game but its better than the chinese players i was getting penetrated by a few months ago
4111,.
4112,"very good, i like it"
4113,"This game is legit as they come. 

It has all the inner workings of a game that will keep you coming back. Fantastic fighting mechanics, battle royal system, fun character designs/customization/unique abilities, collectibles, achievement system, loot boxes(if you like to partake in that sort of thing), non-toxic community(from what I've experienced), etc. 

Highly Recommend, this will be my daily driver for a long time coming. Stellar work Naraka Team!"

4141,"10 /10   recommend. So much things to learn . Game is bit hard but awesome. 
yea worth for $16. 
Unique experience best BR game ,Skins are awesome and fair prices.
40 -60 fps smooth as hell.(1080p with medium graphics)

4144,"While all the players learned to be the martial arts master of various deadly weapons, I learned the best weapon is to hide. This allowed me to become the best treetop clinger."
4145,Quite a fun game i am terrable at
4146,"This is quite a challenge to learn and to play, but once you get the hang of the melee mechanics, you'll have a lot of tense and adrenaline pumping fights."
4147,a
4148,"Great game, just like any other battle royal, but with SWORDS!!! CHA CHA CHA YOUR ENEMIES!!!"
4149,its a very fun take on a battle royale
4150,a true game
4151,kewl
4152,Chơi là bị nghiện ^^
4153,"Game is fun. Game is hard.
Movement and combat are very satisfying.


Also sidenote, somehow, this game has one of the most in depth character body/face sliders customization I've ever seen."
4154,"I don't Say its a bad game, the graphics the skins the gameplay i love it..

But there is always a but that's why i gave it a thumbs down.

You will see very fast that you will be deleted by Hackers with Chinese symbols.. they are even in Europe.. they don't have lag or anything they just one combo destroy you.

The game is fun Overall but it gets annoying pretty fast cause of Hackers... Maybe they will upgrade their Cheat Engine.. otherwise the game will die as fast as it became popular.."
4155,"Great game with 2 of your buddies, only problem is they need to work on fixing other players from linking to the US servers as well as location for leaderboards. Other than that good game would recommend for being 20 bucks."
4156,"really love this game really do BUT WHAT IS THE MONK MAN, this guy is so busted in every aspect. every time you fight one he has a free parry and an ult that heals him, he can grab you from range and up close and beats out the only other transformation ult in damage, speed, and health. anyone who plays this guy is straight class carried and you are scum."
4157,"Watching Youtube Gameplay , seems easy...
try to play it myself, apparently not easy..."
4158,"Game sometimes gives me a headache and it feels kinda of unpolished. I played the Beta and loved it but coming back to it I can only play it for a little bit at a time. This game is kinda iffy when it comes to play you will destroy a team of bots no issue and when you run into actual players you will get deleted haha. Game has unique grappling system, specials, and battle royal formula that everyone loves. Overall would recommend if you like battle royals."
4159,Super fun once you get the controls down!
4160,"Pros: Amazing character design. Love the vibe of the game. 
Cons: Unfortunately, me and my squad stopped playing because we encountered a lot of cheaters. There were also serious server lags. 
Hope they fix this."
4161,Play this game if you want cancer.

4167,I actually complete battlepass in this game!~
4168,"Just buy it, it's worth if you like the trailer
"
4169,Yes.
4170,its pretty fun
4171,"As with most Battle Royale games you will get your bum-russled quite a lot while you learn the ropes; this one is no different. The game play is amazing, the characters are neat, skills are interesting, and pretty clothing.
I can live out my fantasy of having pink hair and healing my teammates while getting air juggled to death. :>"
4172,"The game is pretty fun if you keep playing it, but it sucks when you just got started. Okay let me explain that.
If you are just new in the game you will come into a lot of bot lobbies. That is implemented so you can get used to the combat/game. But when you join your first (real) online match and get matched against good players. You will get absolutely destroyed. And that will happen a lot in the beginning. 
It will be so bad that you want to refund the game. But if you keep playing it will become fun. Because you will start turning into the player that destroys the new players. And even if you don't become the noob slayer. You will end up having a lot of fun learning new combos and improving in combat. Because I think that is the core of the game the combat and the improvement of combat. That is the core of the game and the reason you will end up liking it.
The flow of combat and the feeling of improvement are the best things in the game!
So keep playing and improve!"
4173,Like the Asian style melee BR
4174,Battle Royale but more emphasis on close combat. Really fun until you meet some of the hardcore players. It reminds me of other games that instantly deletes you out of existence.
4175,"been playing for 3 hours and i can tell this game has it all
im hooked."
4176,I enjoy it.
4177,10/10 would main Kurumi equipped with a dagger *whoosh-whoosh-shing*
4178,Good
4179,NB
4180,"Horrible servers, that would be a first, the difference between skill it's impossible to match almost, the dodge system works with channeling combos, okay, lets say you can master that, you can't dodge basic attacks and the only way to counter them is to slide to the sides, preferably to the left or just use the same attack, so you can just spam the enemy with 1 right and 1 left attack and keep doing this until he's at 0 hp, if he tries to you you graple him, so you can't mostly escape, it's a game with horrible mechanics mostly, interesting theme and battlepass but that's pretty much where you realize this is just a battleroyale where you just like the skins and hate the game. After the servers were changed, no more chinese players were on, but the lagg is impossible, the map doesn't load, lots of connection problems. It's not a finished product"
4181,Good game
4182,"Pros:
Extremely fun once you get all the mechanics down
Lots of combos and variety in weapons and fighting styles
Not a BR that's focused on winning
Super nice customization

Cons:
Not easy to pick up and extremely hard difficulty curve
Latency issues can screw both parties over in a fight (even if you have good latency)
A pretty aggressive free to play strategy with a lot of micro transactions and lootboxes (That being said it is NOT pay to win, all of the transactions are for cosmetics)

overall would recommend, the cons are not deal breakers for me"
4183,its a really fun game to play with friends and combat is really good too a must try game
4184,"[h1] Cool game no players [/h1]
The game in itself is really good and cool. Nice land scapes, cool different characters and beautiful weapons. When you have some friends to play with it makes a lot of fun. But there is the problem. EU servers are dead. There are no people playing this game due to different reasons. Some say its the chinese hackers which I have also discovered but only 3-4 times and the other problem is the ping abusers due to no available region lock. So anyone can play on any server. But the biggest problem is the people stopped playing this game. If you are an EU player I will not recommend this game to you."
4185,"Usually I hate battle royals but this game knows how to do it. Everything is balanced, plus most of this game is just melee. You just need to learn how the movement works."
4186,Stab-stab-stab
4187,Much Katana much Wow
4188,For Honor + SAO + Attack on Titan + Apex Legends
4189,Finally there is a cold weapon battle field game and with excellent graphic!
4190,"naraka blade point is a good game which i liked to play it has goo mechanics, nice combat, beautiful graphics and some nice characters/
i stopped playing the game because it is less my type of game i usually play fps games and this is fun very fun but i just like other games like valorant or cs or rpg.
if u like this type of combat games with special abilities u should definitely consider this game/"

4196,Nice and great game. Interesting graphic!!!

4211,"Above and beyond what I paid for. Been a while since I've run into a game I was willing to play without a group of friends, and this hit the spot. Simple mechanics to understand, and not as hard to get into as most battle royales. Visually the game gets a 7.5/10 as well, with the filters being a great addition."
4212,I changed my IGN to a series of random Chinese characters and ever since then I can't stop winning.
4213,Good game
4214,Quá đã

4216,This game is so fun.
4217,"yep, 300+ hours and I still suck at it"
4218,really fun game makes me feel like i am playing a classic fighting game.
4219,I have no idea why it took so long for a melee BR to actually play like an open world fighting game. The level of customization insures you'll never see your likeness on the battlefield. The parkour and how you interact with the environment is another key to the amazing gameplay. Don't get caught lacking.

4226,"4/5 for this game. 
Less network issues occurred after the 11.25 update. The key to this game is PRACTICING! During my first 50 hrs in this game, I believe there are so many hackers but when I started to learn some battle techniques, I realized that those movements are legit. 

Tip:
1. set low video quality settings to enable high FPS even if your monitor only supports 60. This makes your action detected by the server faster.
2. install this game on SSD instead of HDD."
4227,"nope, just nope, after 1st season its enough for me
-lag china's playing eu servers
-skins from crates are same, u only get silk, silk, silk, silk, silk, and 1exclusive red skin in 100crates, (me and my friends get red skin at the very last box)
- battlepass is trash"
4228,boobs and swords
4229,"Edit: The quality of this game has dropped even further since I wrote this. TLDR; don't buy this. Cheating is unbelievably rampant, game quality has fallen off a cliff, the devs do nothing but release new skins and balance patches as though those have any meaning. Spend your money on something else.

I really want to give this game a good review and if things change I eventually might. Right now however I can't in good mind recommend it. When it first came out the game seemed pretty good, was fun to play, and I convinced a few friends to buy it. I even did some streams of it on Twitch. I stopped playing for a bit and then today decided to drop in and give it a try. After a round I decided it was time to write my review. My feeling is that as time has progressed quality of the game experience has declined. That being said I want to be fair so let me list the positives and then the negatives:

Positives:
(+) Visuals: This may be one of the best looking games I've ever played. 
(+) Sound: Another massive success here. The biggest accomplishment though is how well they've done with directional noise. The footsteps of another player match where they're coming from, they match the terrain they're walking on, and really give you a great sense of where other players are in the world. Running through these environments, hearing the distant sounds of combat, and listening for approaching players is this complete sound experience that demonstrates just what the developers can achieve.
(+) Gameplay: The gameplay itself is another massive success. Combat has a great deal of depth and tactical structure. Movement in this game is total wish fulfillment. You really get the sense of being a graceful martial arts master, running on walls, and flipping through the air. They nail the gameplay.
(+) Customization: Usually games like the have some skins or items you can buy and that's about it. Naraka however has an incredibly robust and fun to use character customizer that let's you adjust even the facial features of your characters. I've never seen this in any other game of this style. Another huge bonus.

Negatives:
(-) Learning curve: The learning curve in this game is brutal. Many souljades only have brief descriptions of what their effects are. This is particularly an issue with souljades that modify how your attacks work. There is a great deal of information that's just not ""visible"" and so creates a great deal of challenge in learning the game.
(-) Matchmaking: There currently isn't a good limitation on the skill range of players you'll face in a match. You can be bottom of silver and face gold tier players. I imagine this is because the player counts range pretty heavily given the time of day. Still its an issue that creates results in lobby's being absolutely destroyed in their first few minutes as high skill players obliterate weaker ones. Since the skill curve is so high there is a massive gap between one rank of players and the next creating a situation where the inclusion of one higher skilled player throws off the entire balance in a game.
(-) Cheating: While much of the community wants to pretend that cheating is rare or not a big issue, it's a really massive one that the developers just haven't really done anything about. Now I've been playing competitive games for most of my life and I'm not a young guy. This game probably has the most rampant cheating I've ever seen and probably the broadest range of cheating. Cheats you'll see include:

Macros - You see these come out a lot in the end of matches. Macros as you might guess allow players to take advantage of input cancelling to jam together multiple actions into a single move that no human could achieve manually. I've sat in matches after I've died watching the last two players (both using macros) autocancelling each other into oblivion until one of them knocks the other into the corruption and they die. It's both funny and sad.

""Wallhacking"" - What I really mean is just that this player can visually see where everyone is on the map at all times. It's happened to me where people know exactly where I am inside buildings and I've watched it happen to other people. It is at its worst when people just start firing bow shots into walls because they're shooting at you without being able to see you. This hack is often paired with an aim assist.

Luck Hack - A simple hack that allows players to adjust the drops they receive. I've been in matches where I'm killed by a player who only has legendary soul jades and equipment within the first three minutes of a match.

I think the thing that really bothers me about the cheating in Naraka is how blatant it is. Cheaters make no effort to hide their cheating because they believe that nothing will happen. Thus far, I have not seen that anything has. All of this is piled on top of the current issues they have with ping abuse and player regions. I've also seen people talk about optimization but the game recommends that you have an SSD if you want a reasonable experience. Once I got one and installed Naraka on it I haven't had any loading issues.

Conclusion: Naraka is a game I really want to like. I want this game to succeed. The developers have shown they have an incredible level of skill and love for the game. That's why it's a shame that the game itself just isn't all that fun to play right now. To me the anemic response to the game among western audiences and its weak performance on Twitch is indicative of this. I think this game could be huge. It could have a massive e-sports following. The problems it has though hold it back from the success it deserves. I'm going to leave my review negative for now but I hope that eventually things will change and I can make it a positive one."

4231,fun gaem
4232,fun games with homies
4233,"A review from a long time player of super competitive games.  This game has a MASSIVE and i am not undercutting it, MASSIVE learning curve.  

If you are patient and do your research and learn this game, this is by far the most fun battle royale games around.  at 30 hours in, I still have much more to learn but I am competing against others very fairly except for maybe the top 20% of players at this time, but being good at a game takes time, it's not something you just magically are good at

A major downside to this game is the amount of Chinese players, some hack and some are amazing at this game, but they have 100, 200, 300+ hours into this game so naturally they know all the tricks, combos's fake outs, etc. 

If you are not a patient person and can't handle being whooped in a matter of seconds until you learn the game, this game is not for you at all.  But if you have the patience and truly get good at this game and recognize a very amazing battle royale concept with sick weapons and combo's, this will turn into an all time favorite for you."
4234,cool game
4235,.
4236,"Have never been a fan of Battle Royale games, but Naraka Bladepoint was a surprise hit. The game is so fun to play and it contains other PVP modes as well. An easy game to pick up but difficult to master with very high skill cap. Although the base game is not F2P, its definitely worth the purchase.

There are additional monetization push in the game which includes skin purchases, lootboxes and battle pass. But they are fully cosmetics and does not affect the game balance.

The early phase for new players will mostly be matched to bots for getting familiar to the game. As you progress through the game, you will start to match with real players and the challenge level will gradually increase. Overall a masterpiece and is highly recommended!!!"
4237,goof
4238,Naraka is unlike any game on the market and it's a wonderful thing. With a battle royale setup moving away from the FPS Genre and more focused on Fighting and Melee Combat creates some incredibly fun and cool looking fights. Simple to pick up the game has a lot of depth into it's fighting system and gameplay. It is not perfect though with some current weapon imbalances and a netcode that does need work at the time of review I would still pick up and play the game. Don't be fooled by the Public Discord or community some of the highest ranking players right now have very welcoming and open communities to help you play and get better at the game.

4316,"
PROS:

Good gameplay
Not Pay To Win.
High skill cap (Hard to master the game)
Souljades (Runes) are Balanced really well, weekly patches that care about users.
Cool cosmetics and character creation. (You can even make your character look like squidward)
All characters are viable. All of them have their own specific uses while all of them can be used in Solo game modes as well.

CONS:

No local pricing
Refunding is a mess if you bought on any other platform.
Counter used to be really buggy, now it's kinda better.
Some weapons tend to dominate the meta like Dagger and Greatsword. Sometimes they are nerfed to the ground, sometimes not.

8.5/10 Game,
Wish it was Free-To-Play and had more players to queue with. Gameplay is so fun to watch as clutches happen so often. So much mobility and reflex based abilities (counter, dodge etc) feels good to have. Free roaming is more fun than other BRs. Rank system and community events are also great."

4318,good play for fun

4320,"I'm a person who generally dislikes the format of battle royale games, and yet, I find this game a hoot. 

Pros:

1) A high-mobility battle royale that rewards one for for constantly moving, hunting and looting rather than just sitting in one place.

2) Great looking visuals and a slew of customisation options for your characters.

3) Snappy combat and traversal mechanics that are easy to learn but daunting to master.

Cons:

1) The servers aren't as strong as one would like. Expect to face ping spikes once in a while.

2) The anti cheat system is weak and needs to be replaced with something better.

3) The battle passes are pretty useless to grind unless you buy the premium track."
4321,:::D
4322,"Game became unplayable after last update, it's like the matchmaking system just doesn't exist anymore, full of top tier players that doesn't let you spawn, before the update the matches were way more balanced but now it's just not fun anymore. Also optimization is still garbage after many supposed performance patches."
4323,"This game is awesome. Beware players with names that aren't English, they will delete you."
4324,Titties physics
4325,bruh
4326,This game  is  different from Other BattleRoyal Games.  It has great mechanic and  it's gameplay is fun. But Beware of Chinese guy or Hacker. Great Game Play with friend .
4327,fun as hell
4328,"One of most fun battleroyale game at all, easy to learn hard to master. For  longer replayability u need to find somebody to team up.
Low price tag is compensated with buying battlepass and skins, but its only costum.
Kinglike feeling when u pull out 1v3 final fight is priceless :D"
4329,Nice game ever

4358,"So fun to play, especially with friend, as teamwork always priority in this game"
4359,.
4360,"Fun game overall at the beggining and beautiful art
Ends up getting pretty annoying, specially when you go against multiple people, certain combos, RNG loot...
It got a bit better with the last update"
4361,Enjoy as much as you can before 手捧阳光 destroy you.
4362,"In terms of the actual game play, the game is solid and fun. But it is definitely in the category of easy to pick up, hard to master; you will need to explore/find out and practice all the game mechanics to be able to have fun (especially at higher ranks). 

So if you are looking for a Super Smash Bro style game to chill, then this game is probably not worth the money. 

"
4363,bouncy anime pubg
4364,"This game is fun, its quick, unique, interesting
Overhall its a great game.

The thing that makes me not recommend this game is the matchmaking.
It just doesn't exist, 1 hour into this game and i was put against people that probably shouldn't be with people that just started.
people that uses strats never seen before, people that literally kills the entire lobby, people that does both the first and last kill without loosing a single bit of health, people with so many cosmetics that they either have been playing for months non stop or have spend at least 2000 dollars into the game

The first game you play there's not a single player, its all bots that can barely fight and gets stuck into walls, and the next game is against stupidly skilled players.
If the matchmaking gets fixed, i would greatly recommend this game, but currently i can't."
4365,Very nice games specially with a friends

4370,Excellent
4371,likr
4372,great!
4373,The combat and movement systems are solid. The characters are forgettable and uninspired af. It's a BR so it gets pretty boring pretty fast.
4374,"Great game. 
fun combat."
4375,"Having a lot of fun (and stress ) with this game while playing with friends, not soch fun when you are alone but still its unique battleroyale game with good customization and interesting skills (some kind of OP tho) . The combat is another strong point of Naraka, aswell as graphics (tho not so great on my pc because optimalization and such ) There are some things that will annoy you , some will make you go into hulk mode even, but overall i can recommend this game. 7,5/10 i would say. Have fun and good luck..."
4376,If you're reading this right now -- I wanna kiss tf outta you. I'm talking about that wee wee french kissing tf outta you. I'm so lonely I need someone GAWD DAMN AND I BRICKED UP. . . I mean pretty decent game 8.5/10

4379,Great game and combat but at least add ping lock so 可以理解的 players can touch some grass and stop deleting NA players
4380,so hard

4410,nice gameplay on this game. Very fun melee fights :^)
4411,"I first left a positive review because I genuinely had fun with the game. However, it has a lot of issues and is not properly optimized. My computer has no trouble running any newer games and heavy games, but with this game it just lags. It lags and chugs constantly and in almost every fight I will get a lag spike for no reason causing me to be unable to react. It is sad how poorly optimized it is.
Another issue is there is a lack of a region lock, which normally I wouldn't complain but because of how poorly it runs, people from across the globe can hit me without even needing to touch me.
It is a fun game if it ran well and if I wasn't getting smacked from 20 yards away by a stick."
4412,Naraka: Parry
4413,","
4414,feel free to  play
4415,great
4416,"I tried this game during beta, and what can i say, it did improve much from beta. Learning curve is quite high since the gameplay is fast and high pace combat. It is fun and very enjoying, unless you are sore loser."
4417,I like this game is very good.
4418,.

if your willing to get shit on by 机器人比奇 until you get good then its worth:)"

4421,"Fresh take to battle royal genre, loving this game so far!"
4422,"Horrible buggy hit-reg with unresponsive movements, but still pretty decent when compared to other hot garbage came out this year."
4423,Very nice gameplay
4424,Amazing game but unfortunately I suck.
4425,Nice game but 關羽 so OP.
4426,nice
4427,Gut diese
4428,A blade on point. cheers.
4429,the battle pass is good when full lvl
4430,Interesting game!
4431,"I really like the idea of the game and in my opinion, it is really innovative I have to criticize is that if you are a new player you are not gonna have fun the game has been in early access for too long so a lot of really good players basically destroyed the new players at the actual release. And because of that the feeling of discovering a new game as a community and getting better all together was missing. as I sad I really like the game especially how they made the movement and combat there was a bit of missing content because you just had one map but it wouldn't have been a big problem if there weren't the mention issues"
4432,better when play with friends
4433,"so good
"
4434,LOVE IT!!!
4435,amazing game
4436,Fantastic combat system but heavily plagued by Chinese players who have some the dumbest china lag that will mess you the fuck up
4437,tilting but fun ^^
4438,Just snipe people with the bow forehead
4439,good game but need more modes and characters
4440,very fun :D if there was a star system i would give it a solid 6/5 girls are hot and guys look bad ass. at first it might be hard but when you learn the basics its actually pretty easy to pull of a few wins here and there.
4441,very nice when play with friends
4442,Noice!
4443,"Hermoso juego, lastima que salio muerto en LATAM"
4444,"Very pog multiplayer game. Needs a good pc to run tho and its skill gap is very high, so if you already suck at BR games, look away."
4445,This game is awesome. It has unique combat systems and mechanics I've never experienced from a Battle royal game. Highly recommended even at full price.
4446,love and dislike at the same time i dont like the bots in game and also dont like people that region swap  and make it less fun for players in the server  otherwise its chill fun with friends or solo
4447,good
4448,BEAUTYFUL!
4449,Awesome and exciting until you found .... that will instantly delete you.
4450,"Basically it is a sekiro where instead of bosses there are people with nicknames like 大 香腸. So just like in Sekiro, after many trials, a sea of shed tears, and broken keyboards, you will learn how to win against this boss and enjoy the game, or 大 香腸 will make you run out of money because of broken keyboards, ending up with the game abandonment.

4464,"I was excited to hear about Naraka from a friend and how he compared it to a battle royal in dark souls but with samurai. I was skeptical at first but Naraka has turned out to be my favorite as of the last few weeks.
"
4465,The game is filled with Chinese hackers and smurfs on NA and EU servers do not buy.
4466,Good Game
4467,It has really good potential to be the best battle royale game.
4468,Good
4469,nice game
4470,"good hack&slash , getting better by time"
4471,Something that makes you wanna keep playing and never get bored
4472,funny game with a good gameplay

4474,.
4475,My items in CN server not available in other servers！
4476,big titties
4477,"This game is an amazing new rendition of the commonly known battle royale genre. With melee combat being the main way to fight it is very different from normal battle royale games and offers a lot of potential for new combos to be developed and to have an extremely high skill ceiling. At first the game was a bit iffy on its character balancing and game optimization but they have made it clear to me that they do really care about the game and are always looking to the community for ways to improve. Just in the recent patch notes that will come out the day after this review, there will be much needed optimization and even if it does not perfectly fix the problem I am glad they are making the steps towards the right direction. Although it is hard for me to play the game so consistently because the skill ceiling is so high I do enjoy the competitive environment and playing casually with my friends. There is a lot of potential in this game and I think I can strongly reccomend this game now as the base of the game is quite solid."
4478,"So many hackers, 10/10"
4479,"GOOD STUFF:
- great graphics
- deep combat
- fluid combat
- fast games
- every char looks hot af
- Kurumi best <3
- git gud casual

BAD STUFF:
- 猫驱逐舰 destroys you 
- in game purchases are expensive
- lootboxes (fkin grey all the time... I am not ADDICTED ;   ^  ) 
- 前將軍 destroys you 
- hard to get into

4480,must buy if u want to hack and slash
4481,almayın bu oyunu
4482,i like swords
4483,Fun Br with friends
4484,Fun twist on BR games. Worth a buy. Wish they had better ranked system though
4485,GG
4486,I went like ching chang slash and killed someone 10/10 would do again
4487,is ight
4488,"pros:
-high skill gap
-doesn't rely on items and abilities too much (even with no armor, you'd stand a chance)
-graphics are pretty good, just enough for a battle royale
-character customization is fully developed, you can literally customize almost everything
-interesting new concept of battle royale (swords and bows)
-abilities are flashy and cool, many cool particle effects

cons: 
-extremely bad optimization 
-fps is low
-there are too many bots in matches
-due to bad matchmaking, you get placed with extremely high skilled players
-some abilities are unlocked through playing or you could speed it up by buying ig currency

all in all, gameplay is solid and is a whole new experience for battle royale. however, game needs to better optimized and needs more working on for a better experience. but for a good feel of the gameplay, you need to buy yourself"
4489,Like a PUGB
4490,"Cool UI
Good Animation
Creative skills
"
4491,Nice! very fun for playing.
4492,"fun to play
"
4493,Fighting mechanics are clunky if you don't know the movements
4494,I'm new on this game!
4495,Unique BR game. Has potential
4496,"If you looking for a Wuxia PVP game, if you used to play Meteor-Butterfly-Sword lan PVP long ago and looking for similar game, here you go, Naraka never disappoint you.

*Update for nomination task*"
4497,play and forget the past
4498,This game is not for eu players. Because there is no eu players. You are playing with the Chinese who do not have a life from playing games. Also they are playing with high ping and thats make them unconquerable. It's not a game for the self-respecting person.
4499,"This game is AMAZING! i love it, the movement, the combat, the graphics, all of it! combat is a little hard at first but, practice makes perfect, thats why I like it."
4500,"Feels like a beta. Lots of glitches(albeit very minor ones), lots of teaming and cheating with a painful report system, takes forever to get back into main menu, lag and server issues, etc. Menu is clunky at times, and being unable to use left click or esc key to go back is kinda dumb. And worse is that you're unable to remap keys. Balance is way off, too. Some people have hacked the game and have max everything, so their characters get boosts in looting, better grapple distance, etc. You can 'earn' these by playing a LOT, but that only makes it more difficult for newcomers to jump in. In-game random items is kind of a pain in the ass. You can be op one game, and have next to nothing the next. Sure, it a br, so you have to kill and loot dead bodies to get better loot, but how are you going to do that when they've lucked into purple armor, blue spear with helping jade rune, and three blue attack jade runes? May as well pretend to be a bot so you don't look so pathetic. Speaking of bots, the a.i. is kinda stupid. They get stuck very VERY easily, and they have this annoying attack and retreat gimmick that makes it easy to discern from real players, but hard to enjoy a fight. Also, there needs to be more bots so we get into games faster. Waiting 3+ minutes just to die in under a minute sucks. And let us ready up after we're killed. Going back to the main menu is a pain. Especially since it takes forever to close every stupid pop-up screen. Doesn't help that you have to push space sometimes, and for that one exp screen you have to push esc. Would be nice if you could just hit esc or right click to close all of them quickly, but no, we NEED to see how much exp we got and how much points we have towards the next level of the battle pass. Speaking of, it honestly seems the reason they released this very beta-feeling br is for the money. Not to mention everything I've listed so far, the game feels unfinished and with 'meh, good enough' polish. You can't go into face alter mode on any unlockable characters, which is dumb. Two game modes aren't even available. And those who cheat or grind are too op. This is stuff they should have ironed out BEFORE release. For right now, I really can't recommend this game to a friend, as much as I would like to and as much as I have enjoyed the game. Just too broken in terms of balance, and too unfinished."
4501,"Didn't know what to expect, but this game delivers a very unique and well-made experience. A well-balanced, melee-focused battle royale with fantastic movement mechanics that make me feel really cool."
4502,"Devs continue to ignore outrage over high-ping players, and even seem to condone and encourage playing in competitive scenarios with extremely high ping. Do not buy. Do not play."
4503,great games not for newbs thou
4504,This game is great but i have a gaming pc and on low graphics i still lag for no reason
4505,nice. epic. I like it.
4506,Games alright now.
4507,everything besides not being able to mfkn move whenever i get hit once
4508,"Absolutely amazing game, its easy to learn, its especially fun with friends. the visuals are stunning and so smooth. honestly one of the most beautiful games ive ever played"
4509,much wow
4510,It's a good game but the report system sucks and the EU servers are full of fucking gooks who are too shit at maths to win in their own region.
4511,"like pubg, just without guns, and vehicles and everything else about pubg. you can use grappling hook and go weeeeeeeeee, the most enjoyable BR i've played in a while"
4512,"The combat is really fun the only problem is its not really challenging, there are so many bots in the game that you always win."
4513,game đối khang tuyệt vời
4514,SHIT
4515,"amazing but too many chinese players
"
4516,"First of all I wanna say that this came at its core is amazing and extremely fun. The gameplay loop is fun, the combat is stellar and the movement is some of the best I've felt in a while.

However the problem with this game reels its head in a way that's not even really from a mechanical standpoint. Reading numerous other views its likely already clear that the Chinese players coming to EU and NA servers with VPNs is an insane problem. They have extremely high ping most times and its incredibly difficult to hit them let alone parry them because this game benefits players with higher ping. Their matchmaking also doesn't seem to carry over, though at the moment its difficult for me to tell if this game's matchmaking even works. 

This game needs a cap on ping allowing you to play. It sucks to gatekeep players, but these problems need to be addressed for this game to survive. 

I love this game, but in its current state I can not recommend it."
4517,$10 battlepass is worth it guys
4518,Best martial art battle royale game !
4519,"This game is fun and I'm not a big fan of Battle Royal games, but this is an exception. Read the recommendation if you don't want to lag because I made a mistake installing the game on HDD instead of SSD because there would be a night and day difference. I Also don't leave a review on any game, so that says a lot how much I Love this game. I suck at this game in the beginning because of the skill gap, so I suggest you watch YouTube on tips, strategy and go on tutorial in the game like everyday. Go learn new combos and learn every weapon, so you know when to Parry or Focus attack, also learn all the characters.  Start building your SoulJade build, especially melee resistance to survive more. Communication is key so learn how to press ""I"" to talk to your teammates, I met cool people around the world by talking to them. I know there is a lot to learn but don't give up because I haven't. If you see me on the game, username FakedRaptor and also on twitch, say hello and if I'm your enemy, I'm sorry but I have to win lol. All I can say is Git Gud. 

Pros: 
-Combos 
-Meeting new people
-Killing Players
-Thigh Highs 
-Graphics
-No Toxic teammates (Haven't met one)
-Getting good stuff

Cons:
-Skill gap (that's your fault so Git Gud and train harder, we need more players in the game)
-Not enough Thigh Highs :c
-RNG for good weapon/souljade so you better have Luck on your glyphs build!!! (Not really a 
 con but a heads up).
-If you meet any Character with a Username Name ""假猛龙"", don't parry b/c it might not 
 register due to lag on there end, it may or may not register, better careful then not.
-People who lag due to different server or VPN tend to have more favor on them, so be 
 careful, just dodge and attack, and Git Gud."
4520,"Combat system drew me to this game and i really like it. usually i aint a fan of royale type games but this has kept me returning and have fun and a challenge.
But always watch a video to see if it is your type or not."
4521,w
4522,"Its a great game, but be prepared to rage on account of the numerous bugs, inexplicable events, and the players you encounter. Aside from that the basis of the game is incredibly enticing and quite fun."
4523,"Broken mechanics, TERRIBLE matchmaking, inconsistent"
4524,Its like a real life Battle Royal Anime
4525,"Full of BOTs. The only thing they released since launch is new heroes, skins and other cosmetic garbage. 
The game did not improve at all. Attacks are bugged AF: horizontal attacks do not hit if your enemy is on slightly lower ground. 

Every hero release is like in league of legends, OP at the beginning so people spend their money then they nerf it because people cry on forums and reddit. 

Laggers and cheaters, its worse than PUBG up to a point where you can't land a hit if they lag. 
Not to mention people landing hits behind walls, multiple teleports and more... 

Trash community and trash dev team."
4526,very unique game
4527,GOOD GAME

4529,你会振刀吗
4530,Been in here because of the game system and for a friend. It is a refreshing take on Battle Royale. You must try too! :)
4531,bettter than bugfield 2042
4532,fast paced and challenging game with varieties of gameplay strategy to try.
4533,"amazing game
but full of chinese players lol"
4534,"I have played a few battle oyale games before i came across this, its different but than other BR games, it not any like shooter game when u can get shot from a mile away. Its just close combat wich makes it fun, u need to learn a lot more wich can also be fun, the scenery can be beatiful when u have time to look at it. U can also get some stuff for free and of coure u can pay for stuff, so its honestly the best BR game i played."
4535,best battle royal game ever!!!!!!!!
4536,good jod
4537,Nice game
4538,Rank system is BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!! Other than that... good game.
4539,add region lock
4540,this game is 100x better than apex and 1000X better than fornite 10/10 would recommand to anyone who is sick of the FPS BRs.
4541,"Good Game lots of Fun, Amazing Cosmetics. Only Bad thing is that you'll often get Stun locked into oblivion."
4542,"Good variety of weapons and heroes. As long as the developers continue to work hard at balancing and releasing quality content, this game should last for a few years."
4543,the best
4544,"Really fun game.

Either play it solo or with 2 other friends, there's no duos available yet.

Amazing game for MMORPG and Battleroyale stans !

Played 20 hours reached level 20, couldn't be more accurate on leveling.
"
4545,good game fun
4546,Downloading and start play it's very nice game
4547,game looks cool but i can't find any info on the anti cheat system which concerns me.
4548,#SALAMATAXIE
4549,Its like apex legends and anime had a baby! super fun and a bit competitive.
4550,"I have been play for quite sometimes, and still didnt get any cosmetics that i like for my main at all. the lootbox in this game is one of the worst. it's design to sucks u dried and left u wet trashy duplicates of useless stuff.
ruin the whole exp of the game. stay away and spend your bucks somewhere else"
4551,good game
4552,Enjoying the game so far
4553,very fun
4554,if this games stun lock didn't last 20 minutes then maybe but honestly don't waste your money on this shit.
4555,A fun well verse game. I enjoy the combat and team behavior. The grappling hook makes it easy and fast to get around the map.
4556,Garbage.Straight trash. The block is worthless there is no counter and you can just get knocked to the side and coutered right off the bat. This game is terrible. The beta was good but this final version is doodoo. The ads for it are also misleading. It makes the game look fun but no when you really play its just a bunch of sweaty tryhards and ppl using grapple all the time. The charge ups cant be countered or anything it's all trash. I think the creators should ave just stopped at the beta. This game is worth no where near 19.99.
4557,"Honestly, the game itself is fun if you play with friends. However... after you get a couple of matches in, queue times are long and you always seem to get paired with asian players. Possibly the worse matchmaking every in game, they pair you with players that probably play this game to either make a living or is the only game they play. The Counter mechanic is based on each players pings (Super inacurate) you basically gotta spam it and hope for the best. 

PROS:
Fun and new game with new mechanics and fighting system.
Cool cosmetics and characters with lots of skills and ways to build them.

CONS:
Huge skill gap.
Trios playing should be aware of perma stun via spools.
Way too many asian players (Not a fair game when it comes to skill level).
Weapons are unbalanced.
Character skill exploits make the game extremely toxic (Tarka jhi infinite basically doesnt let you touch ground and can kill you while in the air, Tian hai ults and gets full health as well as Yueshan, Kurumi's absurd ressurection range with her F skill, Viper Ning's Ultimate is bugged and is currently stunning regardless of the skill improvement you take.) 
Developers only listen to asian people, since they are the ones that are keeping the game alive.

"
4558,"The gameplay is good as someone who havent gone in battle royale games
"
4559,Enjoyable until you run into that one Asian guy who manhandles you.
4560,very good i hvae played Naraka 72 hours in one day
4561,Fun game. Definitely worth it for pvp lovers! <3
4562,two thumbs up
4563,"Bad perfs, catastrophic camera. Long waiting queues to find a game."
4564,"This game is a trash dont buy it will ruin your day when you play, just play apex legend is better waste your time playing this game, worst game ever. Rank system is trash silver rank can meet gold rank."
4565,ok
4566,good
4567,"Pros: 
-Good Charakters
-nice cosmetics
-nice fight system
-nice graphic
-good sounds

Cons:
Some Chinese Guys will delete you in 2 seconds."
4568,Unplayable because of the lag.
4569,Good game
4570,Unplayable due to the poor optimization. Game decides to tell you your connection is bad when all it is doing is loading assets. Even during an offline tutorial.
4571,Underrated
4572,"It's Literally All Fun and Games until you see one of those 猫驱逐舰 for a bounty or god knows 毛泽东的右臂  is on a 26 Kill Streak, That one English  mofo who takes ALL your kills, and God Forbid you run into 美国之死 and 
猫の破壊, and NOTHING is like being tree Ambushed by 最绿的人 and 铁靴士兵 
those Neon Green Japanese Skinned Players who will melt your ass from 50 ft away 
and those random ass lettered  Malaysian People

4573,Very fun game and i rarely like BRs lol
4574,Good game
4575,Combat play is awesome. i don't do these types of games often but this one if fun.
4576,stupid optimize engine dropping fpx like dog poop even my laptop spec higher than minimum requirements hundred times
4577,"you people are discriminating against people without screen capture capabilities and let teamers running wild, you should have added a death camera to review the clips yourself, stop making this players problem"
4578,"i love the gameplay mechanic, pretty unique"

Just now, it suddenly crushed for the 8TH times !"

4581,china numberone
4582,good
4583,"Fun for a while, but unfortunately, it's too unoptimized to be worth playing at this point in time. Aside from the ping, it randomly stutters during combat, and my pc should at least be able to play on low settings"
4584,Super fun but also challenging. Great game to to play with friends
4585,Good soup
4586,"Game is frustrating because the core game is pretty fun, but the game is either so horribly optimized or the netcode is show shoddy that it's more or less unplayable. Most matches I'd load in and be unable to select my spawn because it would take too long loading. Then when I would spawn in, either the game would take a good 30-50 seconds to load in before I could pick up an item, or someone would walk up and gank me before I could react.

Could be good with patches to make it playable, but avoid for now."
4587,yes
4588,"new content 
like it"
4589,"Naraka is a totally unique battle royale:
- The game starts with 6 free playable characters and there is 3 more you can buy with in-game money or gold which is real money you can invest in the game and hope to see more upcoming characters.
- There are many weapons you can use to battle other players and you can level them up or get skins for them from chest or with gold.
- Every character has very good customization like skins or accessories or even you can edit the look of all characters."
4590,"Naraka offers a unique take on the battle royale genre, focused around fast paced, hero based, melee action combat. The heroes are unique and offer a wide array of different abilities and tools to help your team win. The combat itself is easy to learn, but far from easy to master, featuring a wide array of melee and ranged weapons to fit a variety of play styles. As far as the battle royale goes, the game features a fairly streamlined looting and equipment system that's (mostly) intuitive and easy to pick up.

Overall, it's a lot of fun and there isn't really anything like it out there. I've had a lot of fun playing with friends and introducing new friends to the game!"
4591,pretty much still like it
4592,"I have fallen out of BR games and this one has definitely made me enjoy them again. If you love BR games with swords and bows and magic then check this one out, it is very fun with friends and it is even enjoyable playing solo's"
4593,nice game
4594,123456789
4595,Do I hate it ? Yes. Would I recommend it? ABSOLUTELY. Quite fun to play. Just a bit annoying to play against laggy chines players on EU servers
4596,nice and easy    and piceful game XD
4597,"This game is quite good for the following reasons:
1. The game is optimized quite well, my GPU is very low mid-tier and I can run this game at 75+ fps easily.
2. The combat system leaves massive room for improvement and there is an obvious skill gap between players who have learned to manage their resources, perfect their combos, and master their movement.(None of the above applies to me btw lol)
3. The parkour system is smooth and the movement is clean.

The only downsides I've encountered are more preference based like:
A. For the first few hours it puts you against bots unless if you choose bloodbath. It does this for a few reasons, 1. when someone is bad at a game immediately they tend to quit, 2. it wares out your 2 hour refund period on steam, 3. once you get past those bot games you're hit with the harsh reality that your buttonmashing skills will get you seared by the eyes of god by korean name who immediately disarms both of your weapons and promptly takes a shit on your chest. All in all, 8.5/10 game, the first bearable battle royale. It would be 10/10 if they added boob sliders.(Joking)
Also fighting people with high ping is shitty cause you CANT counterattack them"
4598,"good
"
4599,"Hi, everything worked fine until days ago, entered the game and when I get to the title screen where it says i have to ""Click to start"", when i click nothing happens."
4600,"played the beta a lot and really enjoyed it.  the finished version is fantastic. i really like the hack n slash take on a battle royal. game play is fun and graphics are great. though the big issue is the PLAGUE of HACKERS in every single game. you cant do anything to defend yourself cuz the hackers just freeze ur character and you cant do anything EDIT: since beta devs have done neglected the game allowing hackers to plague every match so anytime you get attacked you cannot dodge, block or fight back in defense so essentially every game youre forced to just let the 1st person you see kill you because you are cant do anything. not only does the plague of hackers ruin the entire experience but the developers of naraka know full well and REFUSE to do anything about i. 2ndly they have not made ANY updates to the servers since beta and with the large influx of players and hackers most of the time you spend searching for games you end up lagging out and the server crashes to which the developers penalize your account due to their laziness and refusal to update server capacity. this game was an excellent concept but unfortunately fell victim to the same greed and micro transaction cashgrabs so developers only care about selling in game skins not the game itself, not the players, and certainly not the plague of hackers that ruin it for everyone. ."
4601,nice
4602,"cool
"
4603,"Yes Its a BR Game, but it feels fresh. It's a difficult melee fighting game with special skills. And it's not easy. If you enjoy Wow Arenas, Guild Wars, Soul Caliber, Dark Souls PVP duels, or the like, this game is for you. The fact its a BR is really not huge. The fights are typically two teams against each other at a time as you work thru the map."
4604,nice game! wish my friends are playing this game though...
4605,ive tried to enjoy the game but there is so much Chinese character players that are obviously not suppose to be there just messing up the game for almost all of us. there's a lot of cheaters and there is no skill based match making. if you were to play the game for the first time and drop more then 5 kills 2 games later you will be thrown into games where people do complicated mechanics and crazy unbalance techniques/ weapon usage to there advantage. i thought buying this game will be fun but i really regret spending 13 bucks even after the sale. i could have brought a better game with that tbh im highly disappointed. unless your ready for actual competitive battles immediately don't buy this game its just a complete waste. oh and also game has the worst optimization ive ever seen.
4606,i like it
4607,"This game is unplayable. It's fun, it's nice but destroyed by an overwhelming amount of cheaters using macros to map full combos and insta parrying. Meanwhile if I try to parry during a combo the character continues to attack the full combo, sometimes even after the combo ends (all 3 attacks - 2 normal 1 blue) it starts a new combo. I need to dodge, jump or crouch during attacks to parry. This takes a lot time. More than a human can use to time a parry. The buttons don't do what they are supposed to. Even the extra parry button, easy parry or fast parry, whatever it's called in the settings, it's just one button that only AND ONLY parrys does the same.... continues the combo... continues to attack... I guess China has better keyboards and mice that actually do what the settings page says they do"
4608,good
4609,good game
4610,nice
4611,The best battle royal game i ever play.
4612,"Absolutely an awesome game, cant wait to see new heroes and weapons that they might come up with! So far so good!"
4613,bought it and it crashed next day i tried to play again and it did the same thing
4614,nice gameeeee
4615,awesome
4616,"So far from what ive seen and this is from 50+ matches already is this game is. 60% bots, 35% hackers, and 5% real players like you and me. Youll destroy an entire lobby only to be killed by some chinese hacker thats permanently invis or invincible. Fun comabt tho"
4617,Very fun and addictive game. Only problem is due to lack of players you are playing against very experienced players.
4618,"DragonNest(PVP) + MHW + APEX + PUBG + LOVE CHINESE DESIGN Players ?
~ OK NARAKA MODE ON ~ THAT ALL"
4619,"GOOLLLLLLLLƠ\

"
4620,"Been playing for awhile now, every game i lost in had a chinese top player. i like the game mechanics but im starting to lose interest when every player that beats me is 猫驱逐舰 in a ""NA"" server. Thumbs down for now unless they stick to their own servers. Not for casual players because chinese players will wipe you out. Lag for the game is super bad now, was never like this when the game was first released(for me)."
4621,Long time no such game let me so addicted
4622,"I don't recommend this game to anyone in Australia, the best connection you can get to any of the servers is about 200 ms, if this game were to have a server in Australia then that would be another story otherwise this game right now is unplayable."
4623,"I really wanted to like this game, I really did. I think it had so much potential. The lootbox system is unethically exploitative, counters barely work half the time, and when your whole game is basically built on countering and your basic move sets don't work... What do you have? A truly beautiful, but vapid game. This game is everything that's wrong in the modern gaming industry. It's just so incredibly empty."
4624,good
4625,Sparky Sparky Boom Man and Sharp sticks
4626,theres gotcha too
4627,"very fun
lot of potentiol 
great graphics and gameplay for $20"
4628,If you live in any region in Southern Africa this game is probably going to be completely unplayable for you . Servers are just too far away so latency is absolutely insane
4629,fun game until your left click gets deflected
4630,"Great game gotta be honest. I wasn't to sure a BR like this would work too well but was pleasantly surprised.
It does have some high skill play and there is a bit of an overwhelming amount to learn at first.
The character investment is a great touch. You can customize with a surprising amount of variety.
It does have a large amount of mirco transactions but thats nothing new. It is balanced with how rewarding it can be just by playing and leveling. If you like assassin's creed and sekiro then this should feel pretty good to you."
4631,One of the most intriguing games I've ever played. It's right up there with Dark Souls and Dota 2.
4632,"Failed to connect to server. Please check your network connection and try again.

meanwhile 64 ping to NA server LMAO."
4633,This is such a nice game
4634,good game takes a bit time to get into but once u do oh boy
4635,Hi Justin Gie here from South Africa. I have now played Naraka for 38.7 hours and must say that i really do enjoy this game. Once i started playing this game i must say i got hooked. The actual game play is fun and quite challenging. i would really have liked to see a campaign mode but the overall game i would rate 8/10
4636,"Just click repeatedly, you can become a master swordsman"
4637,"This game is great, although know as a battle royale game but during play this game its feel like there are something more than a battle royale game. Graphics is awesome and the gameplay quite hard little bit but its only take little time to get used to with it however i enjoy playing this game :3"
4638,"After played many type of BR's game, Naraka is the most unique amazing BR game i had ever experience.

Pros:
- Allow you to freely customize your own heroes.
- Good Combat System.
- Nice and cool skill.
- Cool cosmetics."
4639,funny game
4640,The game is amazing it's like i'm the real warrior
4641,"My Buddy bought this for me and im diggin the vibes, improving every update."
4642,TO LAGGING
4643,good game
4644,"nice game
"
4645,"I just cant recommend this one.  Its far too unforgiving to new players.  After 1 or 2 matches your thrown in the deepend against players that are far better than you.  Sometimes you will die within a minute or so because you couldnt find any weapons, leaving you defenseless.   This wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to wait 5+ minutes in queue every time you want to try.  Waiting for 5 minutes only to play for less than a minute and get killed due to bad luck is not fun in any way

Despite there being bots that are capable of playing the BR mode, there is no way to play a bot-only match so you can get used to the map, how the game mode functions and just practice actual real world combat.  The tiny arena where you get to fight one ai is highly inadequate for actual training for newbies as it does not prepare you for fighting in large spaces with structures and elevation changes, which is where most combat occurs"
4646,"I was able to make the hall of fame and top 30. What I can say about this game is that the combat is incredibly fun and good. It feels like a hack and slash, but it absolutely isn't. There is a crazy amount of depth to the game play and it's really tactical. You need to learn combos, parries, skills, attack types and feinting. To do well you need to have a lot of situational awareness to read enemy attacks and know how to respond and more importantly WHEN to do them. The combat system is so addictive and fun, it's what makes this game such a blast to play. The character customization is also better than pretty much any game i'v ever played. 

With that said there are a lot of cons to this game...

-The game costs money but it has a battle pass and lots of other F2P mechanics such as runes which make your character stronger and have better luck / be able to dash/dodge more, etc. You unlock runes by grinding the game (takes a lot of time to unlock one set of runes, and even more time if you want to unlock extra rune pages for other characters). Of course you can just skip that by paying money. 

-Balance is awful. While it's not difficult to find a game, you'll find you're constantly being put into matches with top tier players. I went up against my first hall of fame players while I was in bronze and encountered my first world ranked players when I was in silver.... This is a very high skill-cap game which means you're going to get absolutely destroyed with 0 chance to even damage better players. 

-Ultimate skills are stupidly strong and most of the time the counter is ""playing the correct character that counters it"".... it's a 60 player battle royal though with a big cast of characters so the likelihood you are playing a counter character is low.. You can try to run away from some of them or dodge, but it's quite hard. 

-The game pace is really strange. The beginning of the game is fast paced and really fun with a lot of action. By 30 players though it has slowed down significantly. At 20 players the map is usually gigantic and you could run around for like 10 mins and not find anyone. IMO, the circles need to speed up significantly as there are less players in the game bc it just gets so slow later. 


Is it worth buying? I'd say yes if it's on sale. Like I said, the combat is just so fun, especially when you get well balanced matches. I'v played mostly solo and solo is the most fun in my opinion. Teams would be really fun as well but you lose the ability to revive teammates quite early in the game. It's also incredibly difficult to win against a team of 3 if you're down a man or 2."
4647,GAME CHÁN KO TẢ DC HAIZZ MUA 1 GAME  CHƠI CHO HẾT CHÁN
4648,100/100
4649,love this game
4650,"Pros:
Innovative BR: no need explaining do I.
Controls: It's really well designed, although it has its flaws like automatically locking out an enemy like wha- or poorly designed default mapping and other stuff as well, but decent overall
Combat: Really fun and enjoyable, hack and slash with slight gun action
Characters: design and skills are great, (my girl from my fav game is here as well, main reason why i bought it)

Cons:
Poor matchmaking: First game I was carried by teammates against bots. Was fun nonetheless, second game was destroyed during a team fight in less than 10 seconds, third game was destroyed in 5. Mind you my teammates are random and have dozens of matches already meanwhile Im at my lowly 3, against enemies with obvious dozens of matches as well
CONTROLS: unoptimized, janky and just confusing, tutorial only gives you the mapping and doesnt explain why the actions is important
Poorly Optimized: My specs are decent, it should run it smoothly at low, but even at the lowest and minimizing the resolution to the point of minecraft quality level, it still lags. Hence, making it harder to play.
Non-Casual Friendly: Reason? The above reasons.

The game is fun, and I would like the play more however, it's not playing when I'm just gathering for the first 10 minutes then destroyed by a veteran player who is clearly outside my rank. 

You can say I can play more and grow, however, in the first 2 hours, all I was able to learn is that if I am already struggling at my first 3 matches, would it really be worth it in the long run?

As for me, I don't have enough time to find out as the 2 hour is already close.
Is it a great game? Yes!
Would I recommend it to others? No."
4651,Fuck your mother，
4652,play with your friend really fun
4653,Its Apex but BETTER~ ApexSwords!!! UwU
4654,cool
4655,Tbh this game is really fun but 30 games later you seem to always get killed by 猫驱逐舰 in 3.2 seconds
4656,"good game boobs are good too
"
4657,"I usually don't like BR games at all. I find them far too boring and reliant on gathering skills and playing like a coward. While NARAKA: BLADEPOINT  still suffers from general BR issues, it still feels worth playing, and has several ways of forcing conflict.

Along with the classic ever-shrinking ring, there are quest scrolls you can pick up that promise great rewards if you can complete a small task. One of these is the ""bounty"" quest, which marks a certain nearby player as your target, allowing you to track their location to a certain degree. That player is also notified of the bounty on their head, and whoever survives the encounter comes out of it with a hefty coin advantage to spend at one of the game's many ""merchant"" chests.

Melee combat is the game's main focus, and verticality plays a huge role. On the surface it's a simple RPS system: lights beat counters which beat focus attacks which beat lights. This ends up being a lot deeper due to the varied melee weapons with different strength light and focus attacks, and further deepens once you get used to the game's dodging, sliding, and grapple hook based movement systems. All of the weapons have their strengths and the fact that the community has jumped from calling at least 4 different weapons OP and broken is a testament to their balance.

Finally the heroes are small in number but varied enough to be interesting. None stand out as particularly op, although some of their ultimates are more annoying than others. Once again the community can't decide which hero is the most broken, meaning they're probably all pretty viable at this stage. I'm sure in the future the meta will develop towards favouring one or two, but so far I haven't felt like any choice has been overly weak."
4658,really good game

4660,good

4662,"Tried to play this from Australia - lag was spiking randomly up to 300+ms during tutorial missions. Only managed to get 1 queue in an hour of playtime that ended up being bots, still with random lag spikes. I spent the rest of the time watching the queue timer tick up. Game looks like it would be fun if you played somewhere with local servers, but cannot verify because it is unplayable from here."

4679,"I have a PC in the recommended status, and had big FPS issues anyways.
The game seems fun, just shame I can't run it on a consistent frame rate."
4680,"While a lot of the community seems to have issues with certain balance aspects, the key issue with the game atm is both western marketing being lacking and a lack of comprehensive tutorial. The game is very high skill, and the gap between a new player and someone who just learned the basics is still enough that the new player isn't gonna feel like they stand a chance. With a larger player base and more people being willing to learn this game would be perf. As an average level player tho, I think the game is fine as is. A lot of the balance issues people have are at literally top tier, and a lot of the problems people complain about (certain weapons or w/e) are mostly cause they're bad lmfao.
"
4681,"The game that looked so promising at first, but it is slowly destroying itself in my opinion.
Just because the dev have no idea how to balance a game.
First of all.... making a longsword that fires projectiles????? we have range weapons for that.
Then especially for the noobs..... The Great Sword. The great sword is the noob weapon to have.
It has more pro's than cons. The great sword has long range. it has serious damage. and it has insta counter attack after successfull blocking enemie attacks. result.... all noobs using it because you dont need skills with this weapon. And oh they also think they are good with it when playing the game.
And finally the new hero Yueshan. WTF guys.... do you guys at 24 Entertainment do not test your stuff before releasing?
this godly creature is there, just to do some mass slaughter? not balanced  compaired to other hero's. it has great damage and takes almost no damage? it has great speed. ===> result many are taking this hero (and it also has a bad dialogue when it kills you).
the first hero's are just good to play in trios but when you just do quick pvp, you are no match for them
GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER 24 ENTERTAINMENT. never saw a company messing up a great game so badly.
"
4682,High Intense gameplay that requires skill and the know how to use combos and the weapon unique ability to win in combat and to use counterstrikes to render your target incapicated from his weapon this game does not soley rely on RNG compared to other Battle Royal games(this game may be one but it plays massively differently compared to others of the same genres)

4690,"[b]''NOTICE''[/b]
Of all heavy-games i've played, this is the first game that requires SSD

so if you use HDD, then suffer with me with freaking stutter and long loading times, i didn't expect this to requires SSD
and no, there's no issue for the game or whatsoever in fact im enjoying it minus the stutter, this is merely a notice to those who still uses HDD (sad peasant noise) like me"
4691,controls are kinda shit
4692,"Mastering the game is the treasure you get here.
I've never liked a single battle royale game yet this one captivated me in the first 10 minutes.

4698,ok yes
4699,FUN that's all I have to say
4700,Awesome
4701,I have fun with this game... I love that its mostly malee based... is there stuff that needs to be fixed??? YES!!!! but does it take away from the game... for me no. BUT !!! its a fun game.
4702,hly shit this game is fucking crazy SWORDS GUNS FUCK IT FLAMETHROWER and people who have powers 10/10 buy this game
4703,"its a pretty good battle royale, havent really tested the other modes yet"

4706,this game actually take MAD skills to master
4707,"Ok dev if you don't want your game dead before one year, please fix matchmaking I'd rather play with more bot than top 100 leader board on silver lobby, and separate sea, na especially chinese, if you don't fix that 100% this game will die faster than my first night."

4712,"Really fun game, difficult mechanics, hard to master but enjoyable, a BR game where I might spend more hours than other games.

Only problem is the amount of sweaty chinese players infesting the game and ruining the fun out of it"
4713,"ehh,  good mechanics but so far all i got is people spamming AOE's and A LOT of uninterruptible nonsense and a counter system that works maybe 50% of the time. certain characters ULTs and abilities seem to be massively overpowered compared to others . overall eh"
4714,Def a fun game

4727,"Fun game, the melee combat gives a good refreshment to the battle royal format but at the end of the day it is another battle royal style game. If you like this style of game then this is a obvious addition to your library. If you don't then I don't think the martial arts inspired combat will change your mind. Personally this will be my go to in the genre."

4738,"A lousy written piece of crap with textures and meshes are not loading in properly. The game stutters even on the low quality settings. Not just by loading, but also commands thrown away mid-play (eg. grappling hook detached in air due to staggering), the controls are rigid and sometimes hard to manage, and the camera is more of a nuisance how it works.

Would I recommend? If you want something more frustrating and uncontrollable, staggering POS, then feel free. But you still would be better off with some Digital Homicide games. Otherwise, just wank it."
4739,Chinese
4740,"The game was great at release and a month after because NA servers had LOTS of players now its just ASIA and SEA servers that have players thats why there is a long wait time in NA. The bots are to help you learn because you will need some practice if you want to get good because at release Gold+ was actual good players but below that the players played like bots and yes I mean the real players.

 From my experience right now do not buy the game if you are NA but ASIA and SEA this game is 100% worth it."

4746,"Great variation on the battle royale genre.
The combat can be tricky but its so satisfying once you get the hang of it.
Needs a few more characters but definitely worth the price, especially if you can get it on steam sale."
4747,"100+ hours and I must say I enjoyed it, not as difficult as people have said it. It didn't take me that long to get the hang of it, and on top of everything, this is a perfect game for a PVP lover like me who didn't have the time to grind to compete. 

The biggest downside of the game is not very populated so queue time does take a while and you do still encounter bots even if I am at solar rank. Overall a neat PVP BR game that you should try out."
4748,Great game ♥♥♥
4749,"With all the hype, I expected much more.

Character selection, as of now, is not so great. The few existing game mode hardly vary.

You login, fighting the same fight you did the day before (often with foreign speakers, making team chat useless, if not annoying). No strategy, no planning. Okay for a quick burn of 20 minutes. Otherwise, disappointing."
4750,"Its a very fast paced hero-styled martial arts Battle royale.  oh sure, there's guns here and there like rifles and cannons but honestly those projectiles fly slower than....molasses on a tree so if a sword closes in, yea you're screwed.

I Do not like how a retail game also has a microtransaction store, AS IF THIS GAME WAS FREE TO PLAY...but that's just about every game nowadays so whatever.

Also there are players with hours under their belt so don't be suprised you get knocked into the shadow realm quickly."
4751,GOOD
4752,"Really fun til you find out there's a complex combat system, then it gets really crazy and even more fun"

4763,Played for 67 hours now competed in multiple tournys and have had a lot of fun with this game and not bad at all
4764,Enjoyable until you run into that one Asian guy who manhandles you.
4765,"I'm neutral on the game but overall I can't recommend it for newcomers. 

A fun game when you win but a horrible game when you lose.

It's not the loss that tilts you, it's the fact of how these losses occur.

- ~300 ping players who are extremely good at the game
- West v.s east mentality in Solo so expect to get teamed.
- Newbies get farmed in the game after the initial  few bot ""games""
- Smaller player pool introduce matches with varied skilled gap. (Leads to either hardcore stomps or head scratching losses)

Besides all of this, It does have it's charm. The fights are wonderful when you are fighting someone around your skill level but those are too infrequent especially with a shrinking user base. 

In its current state a 6/10 game but easily could be an 8/10 game with some improvement on match making. (Smaller Games with region lock players if ping exceeds a certain threshold) 


"
4766,yes
4767,Pretty fun
4768,"Great game visually 9/10 fight 9/10, glitchy Chinese players that spam 2 skills plus charge in the time you are hitting once 10/10 they should fix the server in Europe, they just mini-teleport or hits don't connect because of delay.

edit: lets add the presence of people using absurd auto aim hacks, 1 shooting you full health and armor, attacking faster than normal, and doing charge attacks 2 times faster, and lets not forget those using wallhacks; 
didn't notice this at the beginning as there are combos or ways to cut animations,etc..,  but after being able to do them correctly, is easy to notice when someone is to fast or is doing more damage than normal."
4769,"nice
"
4770,nice
4771,i have the power of god and anime on my side (and big boobas)
4772,"Require a official server to play. You CANNOT host game by yourself.
In other words: you can only buy a period usage right of this game."
4773,Super awesome. combat reminds me of a weird mix between black dessert/darksouls/for honor. progression system is great.  highly recommend
4774,game runs at 100 ping constant and its laggy as f why i was just gaming warzone fine
4775,"Nice game<3

4780,recommended
4781,good
4782,"* Buys game for full price*
*Goes on discount literally 1 day later*

But for real, it is a really cool new perspective and take on Battle Royale. 
More of a traditional combat style with its swords, katana and more
At least you wont get beamed by a rifle from a mile away like in other Battle Royale games :)
Takes a while to learn how to properly engage, counter and basics of fighting

In short, it has similarities to Apex Legends mechanics wise and it is a splice between traditional chinese combat and Apex Legends

Pros:
- Cool character customization options
- Unique Souljade items which is similar to perks/power up


Cons:
- Somewhat uneven matchmaking
- Cosmetics/Skins seems to be roughly the same but in different colours
- Ranking up seems a little tedious as you dont get many points even for winning
- Super high chance of getting duplicates from their lootboxes called ""Immortal Treasure""
- Customer Support is literally useless

Additional things that i think would make the game better:
- Rewarding players with Tae as random reward after each match
- More events with actually nice cosmetics/skins/etc
- Duos game mode(UPDATE: Added)

Score: 8/10."
4783,request play
4784,I like
4785,one of the best game.
4786,"Fun, quick, skill ceiling is big but worth learning. Optimized pretty darn well. Every time I try a new game, I end up coming back to this one - it gives me very fond nostalgic memories of GunZ The Duel and just feels great. The developers care a lot about this game, they are always adding new things, adjusting balance properly, asking for surveys that really do get to the heart of the game. At $20, it is 100% worth it."

4790,"I did not play a lot, just some hours during the first season and it was kinda fun. Tried to update today and this time the update contained a Virus/Malware so the procedure was blocked by my antivirus-app and for now I cannot play this game anymore. Tried to contact the support but nothing happened. Think they are busy counting the millions they made with those sales - so who cares about one player complaining about a virus... Have fun installing some nasty data... Naraka: Malware Point ftw by now!"

Btw this game is awesome,"
4794,"good game but a shame the optimization for the game not really good, I already used the above the recommended for the graphics card but only can play in low graphic for smooth gameplay If you okay with that condition go for it"
4795,game is good
4796,good game
4797,Great game. Love the combat. yes there is a learning curve but once u get the hang of it then u are gonna love it
4798,"Dont buy this game. Bought it 2 times, refunded 2 times.   The game looks promising, but once you play it you notice that is a very basic game, the combos sucks,  just dont waste time and money in this game. Is not worth it.  Play for honor instead. Or any other pvp game but not this thing."
4799,this game is so good
4800,Good Game
4801,"Swords go swiiiiiiiiing, hook goes brrrrrrrrrr"
4802,"So this game is super fun.  Wish there was a better tutorial on how to play since there is so much tech to learn on how to be better at fighting.  There is a lot of characters and all of them see play.  All the weps also see play they are all super balenced.  One thing that may need tweaking is tianhai's ult give my boy some damage resistance in his spirit form because his ult makes him easier to kill with a repeating crossbow, like he just melts super fast.  Other then that i feel like it is in a good place.  The main gripes i have with this game is the high learning curve for newer players, poor matchmaking on having people be 100x better then you, and the fact most of the player base is chinese nothing against it but they usually have red ping and it is frustrating when the time to kill is so low.  One misplay and it is usually death.  Other then that i would say it is super solid it is worth the shot.  All add on content is cosmetic and uses real money but thats the most you can spend real money on.  Also i wouldnt say get the other editions besides the base unless you really want the few skins that come with it i would say it is worth just putting that money into the gold used for skins that you choose in the actual game itself.  also unlocking characters extra abilities is kinda frustrating, i think they should all be unlocked at the start instead of the cultivation of characters.  Also the solo play for the normal mode i hate so much i feel like the trio rez mechanic which just promotes aggressive play is a much better mechanic then getting ambushed and one shot by some dude with insane loot.  Also blood bath is a mess but it is so much god damn fun.  In the end i would say get it and hopefully you can add to the pile of more native players.




Also optimize the game better this is the only game i own that runs poorly at times and crashes"
4803,For all its jank and lag consistency issues its so incredibly fun when you do some real ninja shit.
4804,if u see some dude with chinese words just dc
4805,good
4806,"Full of Chinese bad players who abuse ping or macros and ping, and the devs are deeply tied with the Chinese so they blatantly allow it.
Disgusting.

4807,gheeeee
4808,its fire
4809,qws
4810,this game is interesting
4811,"I've tried the game but instantly refund this, Why?

1. According to the review long queue time & bad QOL
2. According to steamcharts, playerbase peaked only in 80K as per now i write this
3. You MUST install this on SSD for fluid gameplay

It's fun actually a great BR other than the big ones, but the players already invest so much in the other game that they don't want to spent time/money on these newly release BR that obviously more better than usual BR in the markets.

Kinda sad but hoping some miracle will happen if the playerbase can be active and more player play this game.

Player base not consistent

UPDATE:

I rebought this game with Ultimate edition!
Why?

1. Support the dev obv
2. Nice skin
3. Gacha addiction"
4812,"Not sure why all the negative reviews, but this game is fantastic. There has never been a fully 3rd person melee focused open world game that is as fluid as this is. The combat may seem simple on the surface, but there is much more depth to be had once you start getting a feel for it. 

This game being a battle royale game might turn some of you off, but I suggest trying it out for yourself before making a decision. As someone who normally steers clear of any battle royale game, the combat is far too enjoyable to let that stop me. Not to mention they have a free for all versus mode called ""Bloodbath"" if you ever get tired of BR shenanigans. 

All and all, its a solid package with lots of things to unlock for free and no paid gameplay benefits, purely cosmetic. The game is beautiful, fluid, and frenetic with unparalleled 3rd person action. I highly recommend this game to anyone ready to test their mettle and dismantle their foes with a smile on their face.

P.S. Looks like the negativity is about the 10 loot boxes in the deluxe and ultimate editions. It states very clearly that you can open them after playing for 2 hours. Apparently many steam users cannot read. Happy Hunting!"
4813,"(old review almost a year old )I've put over 100 hours in this game thinking it would get better after the first season, and guess what no it did not. Starting of the second season theirs way more lag especially from the Chinese players hopping over to the NA side extreme lag its horrible. Don't even mention the Tarka ult and stun system and with abilities was a horrible idea. I am finally giving this game up where i should have a lot sooner guess that was my fault. I recommend don't buying this game 100%

(New Review after a year) Coming back as a returning player things are more or less the same but the lag seems a little bit better , a few more characters have been added with crazy ults and stuns yadayada etc. this time around there are more bots since most of the player base in the west has dipped but a small growth since the release on gamepass so thats nice. The rank system is still busted doesnt make much sense getting pinned agianst top 100 players when your still a low rank. but i will say this the game is fun for being different from a shooter BR."
4814,Very good melee combat Battle Royale game. at first you might be struggling because the game mechanics is pretty hard to learn but it's very fun and challenging to play after you learn some basic stuff. you have to try it if you love competitive game.
4815,bored music and skill too diferent
4816,deadgame
4817,"- Bought it with my girlfriend to play together.

- Play it before she gets home to test it out.
- Read about long queue time in the reviews, so I spammed finding match as soon as possible.
- Find the match real quick, very interested in the game. Thought the combat was too easy and this might be my favorite game.
- Found out that they let you play with bots until you reach 1300-1500 ratings. From that moment onward you will face a 8-15 minutes minimum queue time and you will stuck mostly with SEA players and Chinese hackers even if you are playing in NA server.

- Uninstall the game quickly and request both refunds before she even gets home."
4818,Fk good game
4819,YES
4820,its good
4821,Melee Parkour oriented BR Love this shyt
4822,"The combat in this game has been really addicting, the player base and server activity can very greatly depending on your region and time zone. Understandably games like this have there hot moments. 
with so many recycled BR experiences this was a great change of pace. 

not noob friendly but fun to learn, sweaty to master!

EDIT:
After an additional 200+ hours and about a year of content updates as of august 2022, the game is really coming to its full potential, the PVE modes are promising, (limited to playing on the weekends as of this review) with at the very least fun other activities to grind outside of the same BR experience daily, With a new map, heros and features also being released for the standard modes this month. 

the game still has some issues like friending people who play on game pass not working but  still being able to fill lobbies with active players has been a real benefit since the mid year of the games release. 

Highly recommend this game for a real adrenaline pumping competitive experience where your skill and commitment to the game mechanics actually matter.

This game should be an E Sports Hit with its combat mechanics and meta, and would like to see it become much more than a base battle royale."
4823,"Optimization is bad, first 5 hours are boring as hell, the game only pairs you with bots that are dumber than someone with 1 iq..."
4824,good
4825,"Fun at first, wish I can still refund."

4828,"The report system is too difficult to use.
Enter your own ID and the person who wants to report it is quite difficult because that shit ID is not show in profile kill or profile. I still have to sit and shoot video by myself to sent you all about that shit player. In other games, they also check for themselves so I can go back to enjoy the game.
I play solo but have duo kill me. i watch that shit player till the end they help each other and get kill"

They need to figure a better ranking system. you will mostly see chinnese names, i watch streamers playing naraka and also get burnt out after 2 hours. You can make it to plat or higher BUT you need to play 14 hours a day. If you trying to have a good match after work, i would not recommend this game."
4835,hehe katana go brrr but my dick is still small
4836,Devs are lost but the gameplay is fast paced and unique.
4837,"WAYYY too high skillgap.

Started playing when it came out, and i was somewhat decent. Came back 4 weeks after not playing, and all my lobbies are full of ass sweating mouthbreathing 0/10 apperance looking whitesnow crackers that havent seen the sun since they came out the hospital at birth.

you get into a lobby after waiting 3-4 minutes to get in, then wait the religous 80 seconds for the game to start just to die. its horrendous with this timewaste, i could start a family and die before i even got into a game. and then when the game starts = die.

You have amazing gear and weaponry, but out of the blue a mouthbreathing idiot with a grey greatsword comes at you and perma stuns you. Might aswell take my hands off the keyboard and let me die.¨'


just dont waste your money, please."
4838,"The game play is nice, graphics are amazing.
Only downside is the waiting Que for some game modes. It should be helpful to have an estimated que time"

4841,Fun melee focused battle royale. Balance can be iffy but it's not game breaking usually
4842,"to many chinese players using VPN to 800 ping perma stun lock you with cheese combos from longsword or dagger   OR   just flat out hacking and legit flying around the map without touching the ground or just moving at super sonic speed. Can see your loadout from across the map to pick and choose who to kill in what order to get the ""best"" gear for them to just do it faster. Vpn chinese users have ruined this game not only in gameplay but also even local leaderboards. 

- Chinese Vpn users matching with people make a shit 800+ ping match.
- Chinese hackers have bled into every single region bcuz of vpn's and lack of legit any anti cheat.
- Legit no anti cheat what so ever.
- Chinese players/hackers basically ruin every single game they log into.
- Not even hard to find proof of these claims live on twitch or on youtube


@Naraka_UX  Go. Fuck. Yourself. The company/tream/devs/ WTFEVER working on this game are literal scum. Every person in the world besides hacking pos chinese players are BEGGING for changes to the ping system. The servers NEEEEEEEED to block chiunese players from using VPN's to play on american and european servers with 300+ ping!. 

Fuck this game. Fuck these devs. Fuck Naraka. pos game by pos chinese devs"

4851,"Skill Gap is massive for new players. You won't be anywhere near the other players's level unless you sink in a lot of hours into learning every little detail/combo. If you're in NA servers, prepare to go against Chinese and EU players that benefit from the lag as lag actually helps them land more difficult combos on you.

Combat is pretty nice since you can always learn some new things for every weapon and the characters are all pretty unique, although some can be very annoying to go against."
4852,cool game
4853,this game is awesome XD
4854,game is very good but at the beginning always connecting and so i can't play
4855,"The combat is amazing in the characters are as well would love to see more weapons different modes maybe even a real in-depth Cooperative story mode that could still be played single-player and more characters from onmyoji in other series I want to see more Yokai characters the only thing I can really say I dislike is not having some kind a story mode this is an amazing game and I want to see it grow and not just stay a Battle Royale please expand this world

4880,"I'll be honest, I want to fucking recommend this game, I really fucking do it but there are so many critical bugs in this that ruins my experience with the game. I have looked at many guides to see maybe if I were doing something wrong, but I am literally doing the same thing what most pro would do. 

I usually tends to get mad at competitive games when I lose, but it is normal and I have fun because I lost fairly. However, for this game, I have gotten angry  so many times at this game not because I lost but the game does not work the way it intended to. I don't care if I lose from a person, I care and get deeply upset when this game does not work the way it intended. 

Many people has already pointed out that the badly-made buffs and nerfs on weapons and unbalanced characters, so I won't point it out in this comment but it is one factor for the decision of not recommended. I am honestly not sure how these bugs happen, but I will just point out what I encountered. 

I have always notice that whenever I know the fact that I dodge someone focus attack, for some reason, my character would teleport back and the game assume it register as me getting hit despite clearly seeing that I dodge it. I assume this has something to do with the other players ping maybe, I am not sure but I do get very much infuriated when this happen.

Greatswords, while they are easily can be counter, they are easily also the most broken weapon in terms of the way the weapon is design. There are many times that I know I should have parry the greatsword at this animation, as shown in many video guides, sometimes they do not parry as intended. Greatsword are also a pain to fight against to whenever I encounter the dodge bug mentioned above in the game. 

Another problem, while is not a bug, it is map design in general. Even the tiniest hill can impact if your hit registered or miss  which infuriated me because it shouldn't have any effect but it does for some reason. 

Parry in general, it a hit or miss in this game, just like the greatsword, whenever at this specific animation, I should have parry the weapon but it doesn't register as a parry. I have again look at guides to see where people parry, I follow it and it the same hit or miss. Parry have been very inconsistent in this game and its infuriates me that it does not work the way it intended to. People have talked about doing normal parry is more consistent then quick parry but that illogical, shouldn't they be basically the same function. 

Stun locks still a big issues in this game, in my opinion despite them nerfing some weapons stun time. I swear that it feel like seconds and I am not able to move, dodge, or do anything despite me spamming the buttons. It literally like if you are stun lock, you are basically dead in this game. 

Another fucking problem that I don't know what the fuck is going on. Buttons responsiveness are crap in this god damn game. I swear to god most of the time it respond, sometimes it doesn't. I want to dodge, whenever stun lock i can't do crap. I want to charge my focus, for some reason it doesn't want to charge after I did an attack despite me holding the button and waiting a few seconds after I already did an attack. I literally and clearly click the parry button, red thing doesn't want to appear at all and decide to take in the focus attack instead when the opponent release his focus attack. This game literally forsake me pressing anything. I cannot tell how many I lose against a person to unresponsive buttons."
4881,"There are layers game that I just won't ever understand.

Gameplay: Difficult as nails to get the mechanics down, but so damn satisfying when you do. But even then, there's always someone who knows the mechanics much better than you and annihilate you. I'll never fully comprehend the mechanics.

Costs: The game costs money. Okay, fine. But then you see that the game also has Free-To-Play systems in place. Battlepass, cosmetics, unlockable characters, etc. Why does it cost to play but also have microtransaction in-game as well? I'll never understand

Matchmaking: As per above, the mechanics and learning curve wouldn't be a huge problem.... if I matchmaked with folks on my level. Instead, I get matchmaked with Chinese players who know how to cancel moves and pull off insane 1-shot combos.... The skill gap is very evident and I just don't understand how.

Enjoyment: Despite what's mentioned, the game is actually stupid fun. When you can string a combo yourself and read your enemy's attack before they can pull it off, it's madly satisfactory to down them. The character customization is also top notch, the same level as what you'd get from an RPG (Skyrim, Cyberpunk etc.). You can make your player look yourself if you really want that. It's just difficult to fully recommend this game at this present time as the enjoyment can quickly dwindle within minutes of playing."

4920,"Hi, please support this post! The game has a very big problem, ping boost. With the help of ping boost, foreign players (especially Chinese) get huge advantages in the game! No hits are recorded on players. I have tested played on foreign servers with a ping of 160ms. I managed to find out that about 1/4 hits are not registered for foreign players! The registration of mini stuns has been tripled. The display on the monitor of the players does not correspond to reality, they sometimes disappear or move. This is not fair play! And that's not to mention cheats and scripts (autoblocks, macros, aim, etc.). If the developers do not introduce a regional ban or a ping ban, the game will close (except for China). Personally, I hate to play when opponents use cheating !!! I pay money for the game and out-of-game items, and I have the right to demand changes! I hope the developers will turn over to this post m similar to him and take action. I really like the game for its unique gimple and stellistics! I give a bad rating because of this problem. if it is removed I will change the grade. I ask those who agree with me to support this struggle, because now is the decisive moment!

В игре есть очень большая проблема, пинг буст. С помошью пинг буста инностранные игроки (особенно китайские) получают огромные приемущества в игре! По игрокам не регистрируются попадания. Мною была проведена проверка сыграл на зарубежных серверах с пингом 160мс. Мне удалось выяснить что по инностранным игрокам не регистрируется примерно 1/4 попадание! Регистрация мини оглушений увеличена в три раза. Отоброжение на мониторе игроков не соответствует действительности, они иногда исчезают или перемещаються. Это является не честной игрой! И это еще не говоря о читах и скриптах (атоблоках, макросах, аимах и т.д.). Если разработчики не введут региональный запрет или запрет по пингу, то игра закроется (кроме Китая). Лично мне противно играть, когда противники используют мошенничество!!! Я плачу дениги за игру и внетреигровые предметы, и имею право требовать изменеий! Надеюсь разработчики обротят на этот пост м подобные ему и предпримут действия. Игра мне очень нравиться своим уникальным гимплеем и стелистикой! я ставлю плохую оценку из-за данной проблемы. если ее уберут я изменю оценку. Прошу согласных со мной потдержать эту борьбу, так как сейчас решающий момент!

您好，请支持本帖！ 游戏有个很大的问题，ping boost。借助ping boost，外国玩家（尤其是中国人）在游戏中获得巨大优势！玩家没有命中记录。我在国外服务器上测试过，ping 为 160 毫秒。我设法发现大约 1/4 的点击数没有为外国玩家注册！迷你眩晕的注册数量增加了两倍。玩家显示器上的显示与现实不符，他们有时会消失或移动。这不公平！更不用说作弊和脚本（自动块、宏、目标等）。如果开发商不引入区域禁令或ping禁令，游戏将关闭（中国除外）。就我个人而言，当对手使用作弊时，我讨厌玩！！！我为游戏和游戏外物品付费，我有权要求更改！希望开发者能翻到这个和他类似的帖子，采取行动。我真的很喜欢这款游戏，因为它独特的 gimple 和 stellistics！由于这个问题，我给了一个差评。如果它被删除，我会改变成绩。我请同意我的人支持这场斗争，因为现在是决定性的时刻！

4922,"First game put me into a server with so much lag I couldn't hit anything.

4925,"great game, if only there were more people playing it though."
4926,"Editing my review after a couple more hours of gameplay. I wish I had never bought this game at all. For the first 2 hours (Funny enough the amount of time needed to be able to put a refund in for this crap game) they group you with nothing but bots to make you feel like this is a game that has some substance that you can actually see yourself enjoying. Fast forward 120 minutes and you're thrown in with a slew of Chinese players who are using VPNs to bypass the region lock(Good luck hitting any of them with ping that obnoxiously high) it's not a mere coincidence that the top rated players are all Chinese. You literally can't hit them. Every now and then you'll get a match that you're sort of on an equal playing field with everyone when it comes to ping or just equipment. That's when the ridiculous skill gap comes into play. You either run into players who will mash the first mouse button and are typically easy to counter or you run into ridiculous sweats who can just melt you in 2 seconds without you even having an opportunity to realize there was anyone around you let alone you being attacked. The optimization for the game is just crap, takes almost half a minute just to exit the piece of shit. All in all is this game worth purchasing? Yeah maybe if you're located in Asia and you don't have to worry about the ping of the other people playing it but until they get a grip on region lock there's really no point in trying to get any better at this game when someone can just prevent you from doing any damage to them no matter how good you are."
4927,"I'm not a huge battle royal fan, i've played all the popular ones and none really kept my attention but Naraka I've been playing it for 10hrs straight and i can't get enough it's a great game  you can pay real money for gold but it's ONLY for Cosmetic items. Down side is the wait times for ques get up there sometimes, and that if you queue for trios solo you rarely get a teammate that speaks english. Pings definitely help, basically the only way to acctually communicate because of language barriers. Matchmaking is pretty good i allways get matched up with people of my acctual level. All in all good game, good graphics, smooth game play, deff would reccomend especially for just 20 bucks. AND GRAPPLING EVERYWHERE favorite part."

Good for making your swords go ching ching for a few rounds? Yes. 

Invest the time to become good at the game? Not worth it"

4936,Balancing issues aside this game is insanely addicting. Nothing else really feels like it. The only thing holding naraka back is a well built community. Hopefully going f2p will revive it
4937,"sha bi
"
4938,"Developers fail to see that their player base is declining. 
No Region Lock on China. 
Apparently the game is easy to hack and the hackers are abundant. They can just push 1 button and turn the fight. 
No NA player base due to China invading NA servers to hack & using VPN to exploit the hit detection.

Until they decide to region lock China, the game will turn into another PUBG.


Update: Decided to return to the game to try out the new character. The game has only progressively gotten worse. The hackers are way too abundant to the point where I am no longer interested. You will be outplayed by these no-names who will hit these unbelievable counters and combos now. Still being placed with Chinese players that I am assuming are using VPNs. 

Mind you I was sitting around Mid-to-High Plat the previous season, now I can't even beat these Gold players who are playing like they are Solar or Emperor players. I am not saying I am great at the game, but it's really disappointing what it has come to.

Save your money elsewhere."

Every time i try to fight against a player from another country my game glitches and lags really bad i dont even see myself dying at times until its too late, or it will lose connection and respawn me somewhere else.

This game will be on sale from the 11th November for about a week.

This is a fun game and interesting take on battle royale, as someone who enjoyed the souls games etc it is rewarding to beat people in a skill based game but also have access to rarer weapons that allow advantages. Overall its not an overly tryhardy game especially in trios, it is a lighthearted but still complex enough system to allow for satisfaction and skill progression above simple game knowledge.

There is also a new character and *free battlepass starting today (11th) so its a good time to get in.

BR is fun too don't get me wrong but this game is more about the combat rather than survival. There are surprisingly a lot of things to do in this game and lots of gameplay elements in general. My only complaint would be the monetization methods. However, its all cosmetics so its atleast not game breaking or p2w. :) 

If you're tired of playing shooter games over and over, I would highly recommend you check this out. You wont be disappointed. ;)

Note: I play in SEA and the player population here is very healthy. If you're in NA or EU, you might face ping abusers and matchmaking time may also be higher.

4994,"One of the better battle royal games I've played. Really love the look and the feel of the game. Make no mistake about it, it is a challenge to learn the tricks for the game. I personally do love it after about 24h of game time with a lot of practice time to learn the system. I would recommend it as long as you are willing to put the time into the game and have realistic expectations about success in the begining..

For the developers: there really has to be a bit more of a balance system. There's a good amount of Smurfs in the game at the moment which does make the matchmaking dissatisfying. There is no way these players are at my rank by the way they play and once that is fixed I think this will be a great success. Keep working on it please :)"

5006,"Actually a pretty fun game, doesnt ""feel"" like a classic battle arena. Has alot of customizable options for your character. The only real down side  that i see is the game is not region locked. Also the fact of alot of repeat content unlocked from chests"
5007,goodd as shettttt
5008,"game looks aight; nice concept, was looking forward to this for a long time; lags make the game simply unplayable; no, it's not my pc config as i satisfy what's in their ideal pc build description; no, it's not my internet connection as that's under 30ms all the time, no spikes, as i'm playing warzone as well and game doesn't go nuts. game simply rolls >1k ms every 20 seconds and dunno how it's coded but it seems very single-thread as it waits to reload all assets again every time the spike stops, making it double laggy. imma give it another 2 weeks or so and ask for refund after. at their POs: please stop rushing it; this is killing my will for the entire genre.......

Update: installed it on the ssd; game still crushes unexpectedly (not even displaying an error courtesy) and still have fps drops; not as bad as before but still makes it unplayable if those fps drops happen exactly during a fight. call of duty warzone still runs smooth. this game cannot compare.

Update 2: standing with my previous points + a couple of extras: game quits unexpectedly at random times. don't have any other running applications (not even browser) and every 3 or 4 games, it quits once; sometimes during a fight, sometimes while just looting stuff alone. and then there's the hacking problem; there's LOTS of hacking cheaters in this game. it almost seems to me as if they never get banned. i meet hacking cheaters every 2nd game (wallhacks caught watching a wall and then killing their target instantly via some teleportation hack, macro exploiters that get you in a stunlock until you die, and many more). these cheaters usually have skins on their characters, making me think the people that should ban them, don't. also the fact that you can find at least one every 2nd game you play."
5009,"this game is pain nerf great sword.

5011,"Although there is not a huge player base especially in the EU server, the game has so much potential to go huge in E-sports as well as it is very mechanical and hard to master (kind of), having said that, the game is very funny and thrilling at the same time.

Also at this point I have not met any hacker yet in any of my lobbies.

PLEASE! use this code when u buy the game for the first time. chdntn8raa I really want Tarka's accessory"
5012,"Fun game, but not friendly to beginners."
5013,Nice game

but it start to fall 
please make it for free for new player"
5015,"Gameplay is quite nice. But some character is quite imbalanced ( Takar Ji infinite uppercut). Last but not least, hack/cheat is everywhere"
5016,good game
5017,its fun and a good way to past the time the only problem is the player base is very skilled
5018,1
5019,Apart for hackers. this game has my attention xD
5020,game is serious fun!!!!!!  GREAT WORK!!!!
5021,Great take on the battle royal genre.
5022,the best
5023,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
Something different when compared to the typical Battle Royal game genre, where instead of using modern weapons, players use medieval eastern-styled weapons. This game is somewhat similar to ""Monster Hunter: World"" where you use grappling hooks to move around fast, or use it for defensive/offensive purposes.

Each weapon has it's own abilities and combos that can be enhanced with ""Jades"" in which players can acquire throughout the map. With enough ""Jades"", the player can become near invulnerable in certain scenarios.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
A melee battle-royale game where you can fight solo, or a team of three. Players will need to find better weapons before opponents do and fight until the last man standing.

With grappling hooks to move around, dodging, running away or used offensively, this makes the game interesting. 
Finding enviromental advantages, like being on the high ground, gaining the ""Moonbane"" to blast an area of the map or mounting Ballistas is also a strategy within this game. Hiding and re-spawning at the very last second is also another strategy which includes less fighting and more of a tactical retreat. Spawning of special shops, treasure chests or locked caves throughout the map is also one of the environmental advantages to be weary of.

Depending on your playstyle, you may incorporate skills and talents to fit the scenario to win the game. During the playthrough, many quests can be performed to obtain points in levelling up your heroes. Each heroes has multiple variations of skills that can be upgraded based on three playstyles, either offensive, defensive or a merge between both.

Characters and weapons can be customized by the player through the battlepass or purchasing of chests as most multiplayer games. The character customization is very good wherethe heroes appearance can be edited based on the player's preference. This includes copying picture of a face to make a 3D rendering version within the game automatically. Only facial details and body skin tone can be edited, not the whole body of the characters.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics are quite decent, however, if not using an SSD may cause stuttering and very slow load time, causing a disadvantage as the game still runs even whilst you are loading.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The music is quite nice, but the default setting is too loud. Changing the audio settings is somewhat of a requirement. Using Surround Sound is an advantage to hear opponents movements within the map.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Controls are quite basic and some commands are merged together, example: Horizontal and Vertical attacks if pressed together will Parry, this cannot be changed

[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]
Not much game-breaking bugs, however, a lot of weapon/skill balances issues like most multiplayer games:

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
1. Stuck within the terrain and cannot move - Can happen randomly throughout a playthrough
2. Falling through the map
3. For some reason certain players will auto-disconnect and re-connect upon the first time accessing the ""Backpack"". Tested this on various occasions both on HDD and SSD (only happens on the first time accessing backpack, on the first time loading the game)
4. Many occasions, when players are lagging, a red ""Wireless Connection"" icon appears next to their character in the game, even when hiding. This causes opponents see where they are hiding and perform a pre-emptive attack

[h1]Issues[/h1]
1. The primary ongoing issue is Multiple Ping Abusers and no Region Locking, this causes opponents with high network latency joining the game having an advantage where they can barely be hit as the hitbox does not register the attacks, whilst they hit you without any issues - Especially in SEA, where [AS] or [NA] region players join in and you can see them lagging, having a severe advantage in the game (most of them using VPNs to access the game region)
2. Script/Hack users, these variants of users include:
a. auto-parrying (most common cheat used as can be barely detected, but if you have 360 degrees 100% perfect parrying, especially without seeing the enemy, is obviously cheating)
b. auto-attacking (attack-stun and cancels continuously)
c. auto-aiming (automatically locks-on to opponents, these become obvious when spectating the cheater)
d. auto-tracking (it will show all player hitboxes even behind cover)
e. auto-headshots (Shooting moving targets from a distance and getting 100% headshots every single time)

These cheaters can be identified through spectating, as it will show the player perspective and camera movements showing that they can perform 360 degrees parrying or knowing exactly where enemies are, even behind cover. These are among the cheats these players used. These hacks are available on the internet which is still not addressed by the development team up till now (now there seems to be reduced hackers, but sill quite a lot)

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall a decent game with high replayability, especially when played with friends. Rather frustrating when constantly playing with cheaters and ping-abusers where constant reporting is required, making it a hassle for those whom want to have a clean play. Upon a successful cheater report, players may obtain an in-game item, this however, DOES NOT FIX THE ISSUE. Certain meta-weapons and skills are too broken and possibly will be nerfed in the future. For those whom enjoy character customization, this is a great game to experiment with."
5024,Fortnite Mmmm
5025,"Game is good, 
but some chars ultimates needs to be reworked for ex tianhai ult is just a big huge target for everyone decent enough, and matari's ult is also not so fun and stale, maybe needs a rework to be like tarkas ult, yotos ult going through walls and trees is ridiculous in trios.

matchmaking can be better in ranked aswell:
everymatch right now is with ease, we lose so much when we lose and win so little when we win. if we can only be matched with neck and neck more often would be more fair for the point gain system.

Either than that the game is fun and very playable on my minimum specs (1080ti ryzen 7)
would recommend to other players with 1070 above and an SSD.

P.S .IF ONLY MY FRIEND RUDY WOULD PLAY

"
5026,"Many hackers do not handle. The game prioritizes the network, whoever has the weakest network will lose. The matchmaking system is not based on the player's skill or understanding, just a mixed arrangement. The game gives priority to players with Chinese names only. Bad game brings anger and frustration by pressing the keyboard a lot of times to use the character's skills when fighting. The game is worse than PUBG"
5027,Great
5028,BEST GAME of 2021!!!
5029,Tệ :(
5030,This is one of the most amazing game that I have ever played. Tks Naraka so much for this
5031,"No idea why this game is so popular. The core fight mechanics really are not good as its a heavy-hit spam fest. no actual block button which is just a plain dumb system. everything has huge aim assist on it, grappling is a joke and can stun lock people, some characters are completely redundant making major balance issues. the game is stuffed full of chinese hackers and bots, even more so than normal games. 

The game would be 100x better without abilities to be hoenst."
5032,great game. i like how the battle is mid to short range. unlike other battleroyale games where u get sniped from afar
5033,"Great game...Had a hard time thinking if i should buy this..but I took a leap of faith and here I am after nearly 60 hrs of gameplay I can say, that this game is purely skilled base BR with additional modes like TDM and 1v1duels. I love the weapons characters and the fluency of game mechanics...the BR is not boring like PUBG but more towards like Apex...It is fast paced and the melee combats are awesome but only once you master the Rock paper scissor fighting strategy. The Devs know their work and are doing it well.

CONS:

- So many Micro-transactions and the worst part is how little silk currency you get while playing in game...which can take 
   several Seasons for a free Battle Pass player to buy something good using it.
- Please make parry easy...I literally broke my mouse trying to cancel the attack to parry.

Overall, Best game I spent my money on...no seriously I just uninstalled Warzone because it was getting repeatedly boring...but THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE...just keep adding things and events with good rewards. ""KUDOS"""
5034,good
5035,Great Game!

5037,fun
5038,"Forget my old review.  Game's been ruined.  Devs have completely ignored most of the issues that have been plaguing the game since day 1 (and even earlier into betas) or even worse some of them they've actively made worse repeatedly buffing what are objectively the most overpowered characters and weapons because solely and exclusively the Chinese region players (who almost exclusively rat and rarely fight) say they're fine, despite every other region saying otherwise.  Outright and blatantly lied to players about implementing a ping/region lock to help stop server hopping abusers.  Instead they keep focusing on stupid ""crossovers"" and other stuff that doesn't matter so they can push HORRIFICALLY poor RNG lootboxes that you'd have to buy hundreds of dollars worth of to guarantee even 1 decent item, otherwise be prepared to see ""Duplicate"" 95% of the time even when you own virtually no items. Oh and if you're NA hope you like playing at 7-9AM because that's the only time there's any population (almost entirely from China server hoppers of course), otherwise servers are dead and you'll be in queue for up to and over an hour in many cases. Honestly could've been an absolutely FANTASTIC game if they just listened to literally anybody besides their Chinese audience, but apparently nobody else matters.

Only reason I play it anymore is to try and get my money's worth back for the poor investment made earlier on when there was still hope for the game.  If you wanna try it for some reason, use my code at account creation to get some extra bonus items: chynkdar7f"
5039,"Game is a great idea but the developers are lacking in the keeping up with the idea of listening to the community. My biggest problem with the game is that players other regions are going to different servers and abusing ping difference, also these same players who are going to different servers are teaming in the solo br mode which is a bannable offense but the devs do nothing about it. the devs think its a good idea to keep tweaking weapon stats that dont need to be tweaked and ignore everything the top players in the community are complaining about. they can vpn lock there home region but its ok for there home region to use vpns and go to other servers and make the game unfair for other people. im literally watching the player base die daily because of these issues"
5040,"Awesome :3
"
5041,"Just bought Naraka last month and have been absolutely loving it. I've dumped nearly 100 hours into it within the first week.

I love this game! I thoroughly enjoy combat, and I think every character has their place, either in solos or trios. I'd say probably 85% of the time I die, I could have done something better or different to avoid dying. Yea getting 3v1'd sucks but outside that I think this game is outstanding.

I think before you harp or combat or specific skills you need to find out what YOU can do better :)"
5042,sure I can't move for the first 2 mins of every game but I simp for valda and matari's skins sooooo...
5043,g
5044,Chinois ruine ce jeu de merde
5045,"It may seems fun enough, and have some nice mechanics in it's core but huge problems are killing it. EU and NA servers are absolutely populated with chinese players (like above 70% of lobby players) with huge ping, add here auto parries (you never know tho if it was just lagging chinese or a hacker) and tons of other cheats that you can encounter in high elo plays. 
Devs don't care about their own game, so why would you? 
Not worth your time in current state, not worth it's price considering ingame battlepass and tons of others cosmetics that you can't buy with ingame currency, only paid one."
5046,Super fun and competitive a great change of pace from other fps
5047,hay
5048,Game is practically dead when it comes to any new events they have out. You can try for hours and even days and still not get a queue into the game. They should really just add a bot mode for this since they did a bot mode for the main. Currently waiting day 3 of the Omni's nightmare with no queues again. Unable to complete week 2 or 3 of this.  Just gonna pack my things and stop spending hundreds on a dead game.
5049,"Don't buy this game, its BS. Its not beginner friendly, most players are much more skilled than you, skill cap is huge and that ruins the little fun you may have playing this game and customizing your characters. Waiting time in lobies are huge for every mode, its simply dying game because of how difficult and annoying it is, you almost always play with Chinese players that are like gods in every PvP game. You will always die to a player with better gear, which you get by luck. You will always get stunlocked to death by some weapons that will render you unable to move or do anything. Game lets you play with bots first few matches so don't get surprised when you get pwned later against real players. Waste of time."

the game has ping issues changes through out the day for some reason , does not have a lot of servers , the combat is not smooth putting aside the ping issues . all this game needs is better and more servers , smother not clunky combat and it would be a 10/10 this is my first review on steam ."

5070,"It's a fun game - really cool to have a battle royale with short range weapons instead of always guns. The gameplay itself is challenging and I do think that you can get pretty good if you try, but I wouldn't really play it to get a good rank or something, people complaining about asian Players with bad ping are valid, but if you just wanna have some fun it's totally managable. Worth the 20 bucks for a bit of fun with my friends, but I won't buy battle passes and stuff - that's for free to play games"
5071,"Too much CN players, feeling laggy in a way. Do not recommend"
5072,nice game
5073,"Naraka is personally a 10/10 game for me. Most fun PVP game I've played in years. I have over 1000 hours in PUBG and Apex Legends, but this game does not really feel like a traditional BR. It's more like a fighting game somewhat similar to Mordhau while being hands down the best action combat/melee multiplayer game I have ever played (and I've tried several). The overarching BR element takes a lot of inspiration from Apex Legends, while feeling different enough to not feel like you're playing the same game.

Pros: Every weapon and every hero is very well thought out, the Souljade system adds a lot of variety in gameplay. Each melee weapon has a variety of options for attacks and combos that make the game not feel repetitive, instead becoming very addictive and rewarding for improving in. The skillcap is not that high, so even new players have a chance against the best players in the game if they read a few games and get enough practice. Unlike other games, in Naraka you never feel like you can't beat even the sweatiest player. The grapple and free climbing system is absolutely amazing considering that you can grapple and climb almost any object you see. It has the best animations I have seen in an action combat game (and its not even close), even subtle things like shimmying around corners has its own animation. The game does not feel janky at all unlike other games I have played recently (New World, BF 2042 Beta, Elyon). I have not encountered a single bug like falling through the map, getting stuck, glitching through objects etc which is remarkable considering you can traverse and climb EVERYTHING.

The textures and model designs for the heroes, weapons and environment are fantastic, the audio for each weapon and hero abilities makes them all unique and you can easily tell what is going around you. The UI is very intuitive, minimalist and easy to use. The gameplay is very fluid and you can even cancel animations without the game feeling janky or glitchy.

The downsides: The downsides of the game have nothing to do with the game itself. All the downsides come from the player base. The most complained topics are meta picks, region switching, long queues, strange ranking system. But all of those issues all boil down to a low player base (at least in the West). Difficulty is the other issue, this is a game that will turn away a lot of new players because those who are experienced will smash their face in. It is a hard game to start as you will get rolled...a lot. But for those that stick it out they will [hopefully] see what a masterpiece this game is. 

And lastly many players complain about the RNG lootboxes. The lootboxes are purely cosmetic, there is no pay to win in the game, let me repeat, NO pay to win in the game (incredibly refreshing for an Asian developer!!!)! The shop has plenty of great skins that can be bought outright to balance out the best cosmetics being locked behind RNG. You can play the entire game without being disadvantaged for the base price. The only thing locked behind a grind are the glyphs but it takes only a few days to get all glyphs maxed out to be on fair ground with all opponents and teammates.

I have played many games this year that were an absolute embarrassment (particularly New World and BF2042 Beta) in terms of gameplay, fun and fluidity. I primarily rate a game based on how FUN it is to play and for me 99% of that comes from the gameplay, not how shiny the environment is. In Naraka, everything WORKS, it feels GREAT to play, its a whole lotta fun if you invest the time to get better. It feels rewarding to duel someone and come out on top, or hunt someone down, third party, get a multikill, a clutch play, a snipe, a satisfying ulti, etc. The game feels incredibly well made and I think the developers put a lot of thought and love into everything.

I wrote this long ass review in the hopes that more people give it a shot, it's a real gem that is sadly being overlooked in the West and I really appreciate that there's still some developers out that are focusing on gameplay over glitz and glamour."

5078,"It's unplayable for me,

On Beta and first release, there is no problem at all, no FPS drop, the map is load fast and i even set the graphic on high, after update and update, it become worse. 
loading the map is super slow.
i need at least AFK 1 round in one area, so the asset of the map will be loaded and spawn in the exact area because if i spawn on different area, it will load the asset again
If there is fight, the fps drop down so much.
even with minimum setting (my laptop spec is better than minimum spec) .
I already do something about the graphic (as the Admin said) but its not getting better.
"
5079,Dev's not doing anything about blatant hacking and focusing on releasing more skins instead. Was a good game but no longer. Not worth buying.
5080,"my friend bought me this game, and we spent 7 hours playing it that first night. havent touched it since, but a real solid battle royale. i main the invisible/teleporting girl (cant remember her name). please nerf hime!"
5081,"I will not recommend this game for any of my friend. First, the mechanic of this game is weird. The reason I say this because the stagger animation is loo long. The first right-click-move of long sword could stagger people for a long min. I could not escape that because of the ping different.  Blocking is better than counter, the blocking system like dynasty warriors should be great and that will increase survival of player which make the game more fun instead of getting stagger. The animation of getting hit is too long"

5092,"One of the best ""Battle Royale"" games I've played, and I don't really like the genere. The swordplay is phenomenal, and you need more skill than just a simple shooter.  The Battle Royale mode is the most popular, but there are several modes that one can play if thats not your style.  The amount of cosmetics is amazing, and it gives me more reason to keep playing to have my character look just the way I want.  There are a few issues with the game, and the devs know about them.  Whether they can get them fixed or not only time can tell.  For me it's nothing too game breaking or making me stop playing.  TL:DR There are a few issues, but the game is a fun experience and well worth playing."

5095,"Concept is nice, game needs optimization"
5096,"This is the first review I've ever written on this account.. It's more going to be me ranting a lot so if you don't want to read the whole thing that's fine, highlights include:
-NEEDS REGION LOCK
-reputation point system is kinda iffy
That's about it. Otherwise this game is fantastic and defiantly one of my new favorites

 So far, I love a lot in this game. The fighting style of it is unique for a battle royale title, the champions and abilities are all pretty cool(could use some adjusting ofc), not to mention the visuals are pretty nice for a battle royale like this. It's a lot of fun, for the first three-ish matches of any given game mode. After those first three matches, it's pretty much useless to try. Even if you put the effort in to practice, all of it is pointless when you run into players from other regions. With the way this games combat system works, it is a MUST that they add a region lock IMMEDIATELY! I have no idea how some people can say they can put up with it. I legit cannot do anything against players from other regions. They swing right through perfect blocks, teleport behind you as you swing, and once they start attacking you and get you knocked down there is virtually no way to recover. This is literally the only major complaint I have, even the fact that it cost $20 AND is littered with skins and items that cost money isn't as big a deal breaker as this. I would probably be willing to spend $ even after buying the game itself IF the game was fair. Think about that, this game is a buy to play game even though its competition(95% of all BR titles) are 100% free to play and I would still be willing to spend money on cosmetics even AFTER BUYING it IF it had one simple thing. PLEASE ADD REGION LOCK! Also the only other thing worth mentioning is that this game has a system call reputation points that could result in a BAN if you leave games to often. I understand why this would be a thing for comp. I could even understand if it held up for quick BR matches but it's kind of stupid that you get penalized even in the tdm type mode. I joined a bloodbath game and couldn't move or anything, couldn't even open my inventory so i left early and it resulted in me being penalized. That's honestly stupid, implement some sort of join-in-progress mechanic so empty spots can be filled and remove that mechanic. What if something happens that's simply out of our control like the power going out or some sort of emergency where we had to leave and come back to find we were banned? That's a bit lame honestly. Well that's all, just implement region lock and well all be happy is the moral of the story here. sorry for venting _/(-_-)\_"
5097,"Amazing game!

I wish it would go F2P soon, and that the fix the matchmaking, so the playerbase increases. Devs can earn more than enough money with cosmetics.

5099,Nice battle royale
5100,good game
5101,good
5102,Is gud
5103,You can have the best gear in every single slot. Multiple soul gems that make you resist melee damage. You'll still be beat by someone spamming with the greatsword. Don't waste your money on this
5104,Very immersive and relaxing game.
5105,玩法很好玩！
5106,"I love this game, Its very skill driven and the combat/movement is some of the most satisfying I have experienced in awhile. Once you make it past the bots and into the lobbies with actual people is when you really start to learn the game, However with time and practice you get better and landing a smooth parry, or working another player in a match is incredibly rewarding, Highly recommended"

5114,"I threw a man from a mountain
8/10 Points"
5115,"This game is a breath of fresh air. Yes, it is a BR, but it's different. Easily to learn but there's a lot of skill to it. There are other modes as well like the deathmatch that will help hone your skills before a real match. The thrill you get from the melee combat is amazing. I hate root motion combat which this game has, but it's done right in this, in fact, I think I prefer it in this particular case with this game. It's not fully root motion is why. Now for the negative, you are limited to only 8 heroes, though all but one are already unlocked. I'm sure they will add more later. The voice acting while decent, doesn't match the lips because it's dubbed, but who cares really, the gameplay makes up for it and the low cost of the game make it acceptable. One of the best games I have played in a very long time. If they keep this up and keep adding content, it will be played all the time. There is a cash shop but that makes sense because of the low cost. But not offering the game for free helps keep out some cheaters, though I haven't seen any yet."
5116,the graphics the gameplay the mechanics everything is amazing i love this game!
5117,"Naraka is hard, like really hard."
5118,Now this is a game that I love to play. Need some improvement in matchmaking like opponents level should not be  very high also the continuous attacking that kills too early and opponents do not get any chance to attack counter (not for those who are really very good at this). Overall this is something else in battle royal game. Everyone may love to play this.
5119,couldnt ever get a game against real players. They just auto fill the lobby with bots.
5120,"Very fun, medium difficulty mechanics, annoying people who somehow get big advantages over you in battle because of falling frames or getting stuck in the air or something but otherwise great fun game :D!"
5121,"太好玩了，这才是国产游戏的骄傲

5122,dont buy this games China is china !!a
5123,"Very fun game to play, enjoyable combat, interesting melee mechanics and movement mechanics. The one downside would be the anti-cheat, it barely works, I've been playing this game since 3 weeks after release and have run into blatantly hacking players that use either parry bots or aim bots. However today I was banned just for having a godly game while playing the deathmatch mode and parrying a predictable player 9 times out of 10"

5127,"very very good game ! big fan !

lovep laying on europe servers!! 

GO EUROPE !!!"
5128,annoying
5129,"Overall a really nice battle royale game.

Playerbase is okay so far and far from the toxic levels other BR are suffering from.
Graphics are very good and atmopheric. If this would be a MMO i´d just hang around and enjoy the scenery ;)

No use buying the DLCs so far tho, unless you really want to give the devs another bonus for their work.
I´d rather commend buying some coins ingame so you can unlock the bettlepass (which isn´t even 10€), that´ll give you more than the DLCs and is really worth it!

On top of that, you unlock skins all the time and 90% of them just look awesome. 
Ping from Germany is very decent (~10) and matchmaking takes 1 minute max for me, which is perfectly fine.

Takes a while to adjust to all the weapons and learn hoow to aim with them so you hit the enemies. Once you get that, you´ll be having a blast.

Get it! ;)

Update: Another fais Battle Pass added, including nice skins and the usual rewards for leveling up.
Verdict: Still get it! ^^"
5130,its a good game
5131,good
5132,"Was pretty fun at the start , but you only have trios/solo , dont play the game if u dont have 2 friends to play with since you'll find yourself queuing 24/7 with Chinese/French/Germans who most of the time cant sadly communicate and you find them playing by themselves by picking the assassin class and self invisibility skill and camping until late game doing nothing ... 

oh and forgot to mention its overrun by cheaters :D

a waste of potential :/"
5133,"Really good game. 

NOT good things:

1. Longsword (broken af, with this weapon a noob can become a pro-player if he knows a bit how this weapon works)

2. Blocking: Not only you get blocked and your attack was useless, you even lose your weapon & get stunned meanwhile. The enemy can pick up your weapon while you are stunned, that u cant even fight against him anymore. One block is a free win for the enemy. This has nothing to do anymore with skill. 

Fix these two points and will be a perfect game."
5134,very good game
5135,"If you are from Ukraine, just don't buy this sh*t. The ping is ridiculous, you won't be able to play at all. Bought ultimate version and battlepass, that's about $80. I better spent this money on something more useful. Once more, game is sh*t, connection is sh*t!"
5136,"It was exciting in the beginning and I really wanted to recommend, but in all honesty it just doesn't do it for me. It does do some things that other BRs don't, but i'll preface by saying the only BR I played and enjoyed was H1Z1 and barely. I like the design of the heroes, the payment model and the general aesthetics of the game. The soundtrack is awesome. The combat just reminds me of why I fell out of love with fighting games though. It IS in-depth. It DOES require some commitment and it really does give me that GunZ: The Duel vibe. But i've also stopped looking for a GunZ replacement since GunZ 2 failed. And at the end of the day it just looks and feels ultra jank. Like you're trying to become a jank master.

The combat and balance just does NOT feel good if you are anywhere near casual with your gaming.  Most people say they played against bots for a while before ranking up and fighting real opponents. I had bots for like 2 matches, then took chinese ass whoopings forever after. I think it's because i'm playing ranked, but either way, it's not really a ""fun"" game in bronze. Even in Bloodbath, the toothpick combos and dagger rushes just feel annoying af. I can top 3 often in bloodbath mode, but it still doesn't feel worthwhile for the price point and the microtransactions. I guess that's my main gripe with it is that it doesn't feel worthwhile playing at all. HUGE DISCLAIMER: I don't play trios with friends which I feel might dramatically change the game.

This game does so much different that if it were free to play with MTs, I would DEFINITELY recommend even though I wouldn't play anymore. If it were pay to play with better ""progression"", I would recommend. But right now it just doesn't feel right. I will say after mentioning MTs that it isn't Pay2Win AT ALL from what I see so far. I just feel like it's a niche game and won't really be what most people are looking for. But for the few who love it, they'll probably be a die hard community. So if you really want to try it, join the discord and find a solid group, but if you see videos of the gameplay and feel like the combat doesn't look like your cup of tea you most likely won't enjoy it like me."
5137,a
5138,For those who dont love fps
5139,Awesome game!!
5140,shyt game only
5141,"Very good game. When starting, you can get to know by just playing unranked and spamming left and right click and making it to tops.
It is a very skill based game, but I do recommend it because I also like Dark Souls,
I love the japan with swords apex remix kind of aspect. Keep up the work!"
5142,"Naraka: Bladepoint has the potential to rival popular Battle Royale games at a time where the genre is stale. This game offers a fast-pace and high-skill ceiling game-play. With lots of room to expand, the melee system offers a myriad of weapon choices and combos. However, Naraka: Bladepoint crumbles on the very foundation that every competitive game must need in order to succeed. Many players from NA and EU voiced their concerns for the developers to urgently address VPN issues, improve net-code, and present solutions to balance game-play. Instead, the developers poured resources into an esports scene that is too early to develop. Many problems unaddressed caused a flock of players to abandon the game. Had the developers improve their product, this game would have succeeded.

Pros:

+ If you're a competitive player, this game meets that criteria and even exceeds it
+ Refreshing battle royale game that is centered around melee combat with ranged weapons as secondary
+ Movement system is fluid

Cons:

- Poor net-code and VPN issues made the parrying mechanic obsolete
- Character and weapon balancing issues
- Developers failed to capitalize on a growing player-base in the West causing long queue times and competitive matches filled with AI

Tl;dr

I DO NOT recommend this game because the developers failed to improve their product in a timely manner. Skip this game and save yourself your time and money."
5143,"Can be difficult to understand the type of combat system in this game, but once you get it down.. hella fun"
5144,they either fix the balance of this game or it will be 5% of current playerbase  in  1 month
5145,"the sound of fireworks in the match waiting interface, they are too noisy. And have no way too turn off it, FUCK this sound and the idiot who think about put the FUCKING noisy sound in the match waiting interface but have no any way to turn off it."

5148,good graphic. unique game play
5149,"[h1] Runs very bad on low-end and mid-tier hardware [/h1]

Runs very poorly on my mid range hardware (R5-3500U / GTX1050 / 6GB (8 GB if we consider with allocated memory for integrated GPU), and not to say it finally ran well when I put the game on my SSD (around 30 fps all on low), again a game where you must have an SSD and abundance of RAM memory... (sadly had to refund the game because of this problem)

Otherwise the game is pretty interesting take on BR, mix of melee combat with abilities and heavy focus on competitive play (sadly which some people may like or dislike).

The skins are actually pretty interesting (standard battle pass is actually kinda good) and the character editor is [url=https://imgur.com/a/UmFG117]ACTUALLY VERY GOOD[/url]!!!!

Bought it at full price (19,99€) for the base game, but I'd pay like 9,99€ max without sale, otherwise get this on sale."
5150,"Super nice concept. However, sometimes I have a feeling that the animation is not smooth or quite lag, like when you see your sword go through the enemy and it does no damage at all. The climbing movement is quite stupid sometime, too.
But it's totally worth a try, especially if you like Chinese marital art.

I'm an 8-year Steam user, and now there's a game ban on record, like a shit on my face, I'm kind of angry and sad."
5186,fix the fuccing servers theres no reason in bronze lobbies i should be facing a bunch of fuccing asian motherfuccers who know every combo in the game it makes it not fun and kills your new player base fix it before your game dies ion even under stand how with 180 ping theyre parries are perfect

5188,Very good
5189,ok
5190,I did like this game a lot until the latest update. Literally getting killed with armor on by a single combo at the start of the level... like what did they do to break this? Went from fun to punishing.
5191,"The game is SUPER fun, its exciting and makes you think strategy which I think is always fun in a game. 11/10 would recommend honestly"
5192,"No way...

I don't wanna take long time on this. This is fact. Some players had it also. Nutshell, I got an update. I didn't played game for a week. Today I did restart to my premium antivirus and one of the best in world. What happens? I got Trojan_Gen2 from Narka start.exe . 

For now I need to change my review and I don't recommend installing newest update. 
If not premium antivirus I would be lack of not only private docs. That's why you need to take this seriously, even if that is not looking suspicious at start. 
Maybe this is not bad of developers, maybe it is attack or problem with code. I can't help them and I can't also say I am in playing this game until it will be solved completely. You need to take this seriously and check main source (yes, there will be a problem finding one, because of certain reasons). 

I edited my review from positive to negative on 11 Nov 2021 state. 
I will be stick to discord for info later. Hope you will understand and try to find why people got same problem as me (on my antivirus it shows there's 100-999 of people with same problem from this game).

I've wanted to inform you about this cause it should be helpful and it needs checking code at least, if this is not problem with code you know what it could be. I know antivirus can treat some lines of your code as virus but it ain't just a normal virus. 

Best regards and I wish you good luck."

There is also players from China who use VPNs to play on American servers and you're forced into laggy fights. This game is online only battle royal. That being said, it's very hard to find new players like me to play with. Most of these issues could be solved with a larger American player base."

5224,Game has such a unique flow to it. There are some pros and cons but overall the game plays so well for the style or Battle Royale it is.
5225,"Superb melee combat and gravity-defying movement make this game a clever take on the familiar Battle Royale Genre with a twist being mainly melee focussed in its Combat...
The combo's and pixel perfect movement required can be daunting at start, Naraka: Bladepoint isn't afraid to punish you for not respecting its mountainous skill ceiling, but once you find your footing, putting people to sleep and outplaying them is very satisfying.

--------------------------Pro's------------------------------------------

- Clever take on melee Battle Royale Games, an In depth Combat system with combo's , parrying, etc which flows more like a fighting game than any battle royale.

- Interesting DESIGN for Heroes, the Map, Weapons, Etc

- Loot-and-scoot way of life will be familiar to any BR player

- Very Balanced even in Team-fights with very diverse hero toolkits for a wide variety of viable comps.

- Charging into battle with no plan in mind against players that know what they're doing will almost certainly get you sent back to main menu, Requires a healthy amount of research and skill !!! 

--------------------------Cons------------------------------------------

- Might take to long for your casual gamer (not me ofc ;) ) to learn the intricacies of combo's, charged attacks, Pixel perfect Parrying, Monitoring enemies moves and mastering animation cancels in Strategic Duels to survive...

5234,"Game is great, but considering the fact Matari (playable character) is extremely broken, and has 0 risk abilities compared to the balanced abilities of everyone else, this game deserves this poor rating. 

Matari is essentially why many have moved on, and she ruins the idea of serious competitions."
5235,Game plays smoothly and has in depth combat. Only downside i'd say is you can get wombo'd/one shot with smaller shields
5236,"Combat is smooth skins are dope character customization is nice. when you first start off they put you with hella bots but as your rank goes up they put less. when you first meet real players you realize you're trash at the game but its still fun
"
5237,"Although this game has great things in it, it feels dead while playing against players. I don't know whether I'm just playing with bad players or bots at times. And when I do feel like I've run into a real player, fighting just felt off like we were both trying to do the same move at the same time. I wouldn't say this game is dead since matchmaking solo was pretty fast but I feel like I'm cutting down bots in every game I've played, even in the ranked que."

5243,"Game is fun but game is difficult. If you keep losing after you get to real players, do the tutorial, practice counters in free training, and watch YouTube videos for tips."
5244,"Gave a shot to this game even tho I definitely do not like battle royale genre so here's my thoughts.

Pros:
+ Amazing graphics.
+ Amazing character design.
+ Can climb almost anything and everything.
+ Really high skill cap gameplay.
+ Action combat.
+ Yoto Hime.

Cons:
- Combat sounds are beyond underwhelming.
- Even though it is action combat, I found combat really boring no matter which weapon, I don't feel the impact on hits.
- Huge microtransactions for a buy to play game, this game should've been free to play.

The game overall has good population even with it being p2p game, queues for trios take around 3 minute. I would suggest you buy the game on a very big discount or I can actually expect this game turning f2p after a while.

If the game ever becomes f2p, I'd definitely suggest you give it a shot but otherwise I would not recommend the game."
5245,Have fun with ur homies
5246,Great game but iam suffering from ping issues from Dubai and my internet is fine to be honest.
5247,Bought the game first week and few months later still not made OCE servers yet like they said they would fix.
5248,"Right now this game is in a rough state, movement is untrustworthy where youll get stuck on pebbles or slide down sides of mountains when trying to wall climb, or simply trying to go through a window but wallclimb instead. 
Not only is there a weapon that will kill you in 3 hits (greatsword), but there is a character(Tarka Ji)  who can literally stun you infinitely and kill you no matter what weapon rarity he has(katana) or how much health/armor you have.
I have experienced so many laggy enemies where i focus attack and their extremely delayed parry still gets me before it even shows on my screen.
this game is in a bad state for anyone new or even people trying to return to this game after leaving early on.
I am simply waiting for nerfs and bug fixes and literally people jumping from other servers just to ruin everyones fun.

Edit: they are making the game worse, the dagger updates they have been adding are destroying this game. As with the greatsword they made it with the dagger, it is not a fight. The dagger gets free hits in just because it can dodge any attack and combo with way too much damage. Not only that but they added a souljade making its damage increase dramatically making the weapon able to be used by the worst of players and able to kill the best of players.

Edit: Uninstalled

We could barely kill anyone, not mention it to reach top 5. So what the hell happened? I tell you what is happening. Asian Players getting abusing the lag/high ping, e.g. when you hit them, actually you dont, they much faster due to lag. And the best thing so far the macro and jump/teleport hack. 

If they fixed these thing, i recomend anyone to play this cause it isnt other shooter batlle royal games. More skilled based.

5265,"not for casual gamers - huge skill gap between new players and current players. half the lobbies are bots and the other half, mouth breathing sweaty 1 combo spammers."
5266,"New Female chars, new maps, and great graphics with cool sword fights. I recommend this game."
5267,Amazing!!!
5268,Good Game
5269,A fresh take on the battle royale genre. The combat and movement in this game is so good it would work no matter what gamemode!
5270,i will say the idea for the game is good but the game has way to many problems for me to like it. first off combat can be won bye just spamming like its very easy to just spam and win and once in a while parry so you dont die. second the map is WAYYYY to big for a game based mostly around melee combat do to the sheer size of the map you spend alot of the time doing nothing.also half of the dame lobby will be bots that are fecking brain dead and are boring to fight. so if they fix these issues i think the game will be worth the 20$

5274,"For Honor mixed with a Battle Royale and some Shooter elements. A little unfinished Lag-wise, but otherwise very very fun.
Edit: After Season 2 launched, the game feels even more alive, very much a recommendation for people seeking a competetive challange"
5275,Good and different type of Battle Royale! Lots of fun. Took me some time to get used to some controls but after a few games was feeling really comfortable. Definitely worth the price!
5276,"The most fun br ive ever played with unique fighting playstyle and various combos with different weapons is something that made me fall in love with the game, a lot of people tend to hesitate to learn the game because it seems really hard and it is but when you take some time to learn the basics movements weapons etc... you get to have tons of fun i highly recommend it to ppl that like competitive games and improving, for the casuals it can still be fun in quick matches and bloodbath the game is worth the price no doubt about it."
5277,Unique battle royale
5278,"1)Bot royale
2)too muchchinese
3)stupid and hard gameplay mechanics 
Waste of money and time NOT RECOMMENDED"
5279,"Horrible balance. Everyone uses greatswords you're just oneshot. Too much damage in the game, fights are over in like 5 seconds. The respawn mechanic is insanely bad in trios. Legit 4 teams fighting in one hotspot, and everyone has 2 lives, and respawns instantly and jumps back into the fight. Its a stupid mess."
5280,"despite some lag problems I can highly recommend this game, combat is super fun and highly addictive if you like PvP games, its especially fun with friends. reminds me of Black Desert but without all the grinding, lol. if you don't like battle royale you can just play bloodbath mode (deathmatch), if you like then even better, good for u"
5281,I like the emphasis on melee.

5289,Fantasy PUBG
5290,smooth game. no problem at all
5291,"Highly competitive, BR aspect is not as much as you would think, however I wish solos map was a bit smaller. Overall, fantastic game; monetisation method is eeeehhhh since it is pay to play, but it is cosmetic overall so it doesn't entirely matter, plus the battle pass is very well worth the price. RNG on loot boxes is, well, random. I have had relatively good RNG so far, opening 23 chests and getting 9 epics.
I do recommend this game only to people who can have fun in competitive play as even the low level play is very high with Chinese players on VPNs, so definitely do research on the game and the mechanics if you are interested in the game. It feels like a less arthritis-inducing GUNZ to me.
Do expect this game to become an ESPORT once the devs have interest in investing towards that as the game is most certainly only going to grow.

Also my PING was normal all green low nominal and the game showed so too, 34ms no higher, i could play another online games just fine but this game just wanna be special in my list.

5313,"The teaming in solo queue's is abhorrent. It doesn't ever appear that they get banned either. NA servers is full of players that aren't in the NA region so the rubber-banding happens all the time which affects the nature of this play style where parrying is important in this hack and slash battle royale game.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that because of the high ping players, the parry mechanic is inconsistent; you think you have the parry timing down, but it's never the same. Then you face high ping players that does the exact same timing for parrying and it works. It's ridiculous. At least they're still updating this game though.

EDIT2: I don't know why I still play this game. They do keep constant patches to keep the game fresh, but man does the parry system bother me."

5316,"Beautiful characters, amazing gameplay, best design. This game must be one of the best of 2021! I really love it. Highly recommended for people who love beauty and hard gameplay. 
"
5317,This game is super fun and immersive! Its incredible to me that it doesn't have a bigger player base. I could spend 30 minutes or 3 hours playing this and it would be a blast either way. The combos and ult combinations make for a different fight every time. Very similar to the apex looting system so coming from there the backpack system is very comfy. 9.5/10 would strongly recommend for anyone.
5318,Skill based game
5319,very funny !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5320,booooooring
5321,"Game changer in Battle Royale Genre but months later -> there's less and less people that plays the game and queue could take more than 10 minutes.

I guess this game is dead"
5322,This game absolutely great. This game has very good combat the skins are phenomenal and overall the game play is fun and always exciting. But the optimization on this a game is horrible. The game looks good but not outstanding. This game shouldn't be this demanding. If you have anything below a 1660 super you cant run this game. At least if you wanna enjoy it. A 1660 super you can probably get 50-60 frames on low to mid settings.
5323,"I love this game, I do. It's unique and has some of the most solid feeling combo systems in recent years.

It's just... I honestly can not recommend this game in its current state.

The queue times are absurdly long, mainly caused by the dwindling player base. The population is falling for many reasons, but IMO the most solid reason would have to be the insane skill cap. It doesn't help that players in bronze/silver are matched up with players in gold/platinum simply because there aren't enough players across the entire matchmaking board to fill the slots.

Some of you have probably heard of the ping issues - I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's still an issue, BUT it is not as bad as it was. I come across maybe one a day at this point, and that's playing 3 hours straight. Take that as you will.

All in all, it's a solid game suffering from death by a thousand cuts. Give it a try, but don't hold out hope unless something drastically changes."

5334,"Satisfying swordplay, good graphics and vast customization options. 
My recommendation to new players is to spend some time in practice mode to get used to movement, grappling, parrying, weapon combos, animation cancels. That might save from some frustration when playing actual matches.
I actually haven't even touched Battle Royale mode yet. Deathmatch (Bloodbath) is still fun for me. Once I get a good grasp of game fundamentals, I will be ready to play BR."
5335,good
5336,"Altho the game has potential it's total trash right now. The dev's are completely clueless it seems, because there are poorly designed characters that are in no way balanced aswell as very unbalanced weapons.
around peek hours in europe, the game is prettymuch unplayable because there is no ping cap and the servers get overrun by asian and american players. normally this would not be a issue, however with the way parrying and ""klanking"" works high ping players basically can win every fight without having to utilise any skill whatsoever. if you're looking for a game that is balanced competitive and rewards skill i would not reccomend it, maybe check back in a while (or considering the way that devs go about patching maybe check back in a year or 2)"
5337,Yep. just get good and surely you'd enjoy the game. Stop whining and beat em up~

I cannot fight anyone. I jump into battle, freeze frame, homie dead.
When it works it's fun and rewarding.
Haven't had a match run properly in weeks.
I am uninstalling this game until it is optimized, or a ping restriction is implemented.
Until then its a waste of time

5363,"I can't recommend this game to anyone till they put in place some ping restrictions. Otherwise it is the best BR game I have ever played. If you buy the game rush the tutorials and get a couple matches of bloodbath (free for all deathmatch) and see if you can tolerate losing from opponent ping. That way you can refund within the time frame before you are locked in. I can tolerate it for the most part, but it is terrible to spend 15 to 20 minutes in a match to finally lose because of it. Bloodbath can be even worse if you are facing multiple of them. I hope they solve the issue so it can really be seen as the best BR, because it really is better than all the others."
5364,love the game i wish u guys had it for console
5365,"This is one of those games i really want to like. Both the combat and movement are some of the best I have experienced in games recently. Unfortunately its plagued by foreign players, bad matchmaking, and some over busted game mechanics. I doubt any of the problems will ever be fixed so I recommend you dont waste $20 on the game. Just another cash grab that will not be fixed."
5366,MMMM DAM THAT SHIT GOOD
5367,yea
5368,Good game and mechanics. Clearly a lot of effort has been put in but DEFINITELY NOT worth getting until region locking/ping restrictions have been put in place. Every lobby in NA is more overseas players than NA. Kind of amazing how bad the problem is.

Simply does not worth your money, I'm silver 4 and still encounter BOT when playing, and when I turned off quick match function in trios it matched me solo against team of 2 and 3, it said this game had over 20 K players playing
what the fuck happened?
You either get matched against BOT or face against Chinese fucks who VPN to cross regions, good luck having fun when you're getting pounded by 3 Chinese players back to back
Now that New World is out this game is dead, dropping from 60K players to 20K, listen to my advice and get New World it's an extra $20 but it'll worth your while."

5393,"I hate this game, but there's some satisfaction in defeating other players. Like every other battle royale you'll come across some dude who's mastered this game and you'll just get wooped by him. Other times you'll get stuck trying to run away because the movement can be a bit... sloppy and you'll just end up climbing up walls inside a room instead of jumping out a window or maybe I just suck at this game. IDK! I just hate this game but it's addictive."
5394,"I love the game, but I will not give it thumb until there are chinese in EU servers. 
My teammates are chinese, enemy are chinese, everyone is chinese. I get killed only but chinese
and my teammates are the wannabe chinese pros. they suck, but play here, because they were obviously told that it is easier here or what. i am mad"
5395,"Like other players have experienced, a lot of unexplained game play, which can only be cheating and interference with the game itself, have experienced players not taking damage, unbelievable one hit kills. Hopefully the developers will eventually get a handle on closing these guys down. A lot of outside region tourists connecting to EU servers ruining the game also. The game itself is pretty good, just need to close down the cheats, or people will be driven away."

5414,Fun to play
5415,"I've always been more into RPGs like Persona 5 and Mass Effect or fighting games like Marvel vs Capcom 3 and Street Fighter IV, but Naraka Bladepoint is fun. Combat, mobility, and kills are all satisfying. Whether you're swinging the greatsword for dear life or doing some really good hit-and-run combos with the dagger, earning that kill feels rewarding. The grappling is fun, although getting stuck on a wall or hanging from a ceiling can get annoying and really disrupt the flow. The combat system is simple: horizontal and vertical light attacks, focus attacks, and counters. The complex part is learning combos, knowing when to stop your attacks and cancel with crouch/jump/dodge. 

It's not for everyone. There are ranged weapons, but if you're coming from a FPS thinking that you're going to main the musket and pistol, you're probably going to be disappointed. The matchmaking can be frustrating as well. The longest queue I've ever been in was 15 minutes. It doesn't help that I played poorly and died within the first five minutes of the match. Like any online game, you're going to run into trolls. I've had a few obnoxious teammates who've yelled some anti-Asian remarks, and it doesn't look like there's a way to immediately report a teammate and mute them until after the match. 

The gacha system for cosmetics is rough (and can get pricey). Naturally, you can unlock a lot of stuff at the beginning, but I'm at the point where I mostly get duplicates that automatically get turned into silk. 

I also wish there was more lore. Each character has cultivation missions that unlock a piece of art and some text, but that's it. 

Still. If you want to jump into a game with rewarding combat, I highly recommend.

5425,"Game play is some what fun, but this game has a lot of major issues that prevent it from being playable. 

As a fast action combat oriented game, this game has some seriously shitty net code. If you are against a laggy opponent, they often will be immune to damage or have delayed damage, teleport all around the place, and even drop your frame rates. 

Additionally The game devs and publishing company puts more efforts in creating cosmetic than improving the code. This game's optimisation is horrific, the over playing experience is not good. Would not recommend."

5428,"  1.There is nothing on the market like melee combat Battle Royale with what to compare it so its unique game at the moment and worth for all to get it
  2.Has best of all games character customization plus amazing skin art
  3.High skill cap so you have to learn mechanics and because of that solo ranked games its challenging and not for casual plebs but even they can find fun in trios ranked games 
  4.The game is competitive and very popular in East countries and grooving community around the world already millions players in just 2 months of release, already happened tourneys with decent cash rewards and it has potential in the future to be one of Esport games
  5. Price - 20$  wait, what? just 20$ for it? OK I will take it. (best 20$ I have spend on the game in my life:)"
5429,Nice they fix the lag mostly but now the game is infested with hackers so beware if you buy.
5430,"trash game, too many bug and also cheating problem, at first i though its gonna be a good game but nope. gonna deleted it anyway. wasted of money to buy."
5431,"The game itself is good. If you enjoy battle royale games, but with a fighting mechanic, then this will be your game.

The supporting cast of characters are vibrant, albeit some buffs/nerfs are warranted for a few of them. Overall, once you learn fight mechanics, such as evading, parrying, etc., then the game really shines. 

This is not your typical button masher. Beware the player who is a only button masher.

However that said, the abuse of ping by players is rampant and makes the overall game not enjoyable - this will quickly make the game die on the NA and EU fronts. Likewise the matchmaking system pitting you against players far above your skill needs to be fixed. There are other issues with weapon balancing, and certain tactics with weapons that need inner review. Until at least the ping abuse and matchmaking are fixed, I cannot recommend this game."

5459,I bought this for Yoto Hime's boba
5460,great game once you put sometime into and not no 3hrs but some time enought to learn some things and what else you unlock as you level the game does reward you for leveling bu by making have higer stats do to glyphs and ppl dont really seem to understand that
5461,Pretty nice battle royale with a Sekiro concept.
5462,Good game
5463,"Really fun game that is really easy to get into, yet has a lot of depth to the combat to learn overtime. There is actually a pretty fair balance between the weapons as well, with only one (longsword) standing out as a bit overtuned. Lag can certainly be an issue at times though with Chinese players occupying NA servers, and is currently the largest issue facing the game atm (alot of chinese names are NA players memeing)."
5464,Love it
5465,This game.... You coom. Then boom. Now you and your homies are in a circle jerk with 60 others hitting each other with rocks and sticks. Best game of the century

5471,"Where to start

This game is very fun and indeed very combat based.
It takes a little to get used to everything, but 10 guide video's and 3 twitch streams it gets very fun since you learn all the nooks and crannies of the game.
Yet i found myself getting so annoyed by several things i hindered upon.

First and foremost: WEAPON BALANCING
I really think that the weapons in the game are very very fun and very well animated.
But some weapons just seriously are overtuned.
Greatsword is in both higher tier play and low tier very dominating, greatsword also doesnt abide to all the rules that ALL the other weapons have. The combo's are different, making them hard to parry/dodge.
it also has a thing called rock form or something, which is like passive shield that basically says a big funk you to everything you throw at it and enables your opponent to just initiate attacks.
The range of it is INSANE and lets not forget the fact that in most cases you'll get caught by it even when running/dodging away from it. Also the damage is nuts. You literally get 2shot from greatsword if you have BLUE ARMOR.
Longsword has a ranged ''mastersword-like'' attack that you can spam 24/7 (it is parryable though but its a ranged attack which means you dont disarm your opponent after a succesful parry)
Spear has infinite combo's and once you get into it, no way getting out, only with luck. 
All the ranged weapons are pretty fine, the game tends to not really revolve around them, they seem like secondary weps.
 THEN WE COME TO INFINITE COMBO CHEESING, idk if it is with a specific champ but with spear you can get infinitely get swooped into the air and you cant get out. This i see VERY often.

Next problem: Servers
CHINESE PEOPLE PLAYING ON EU SERVERS 
I really really really dislike this. 
For some reason, whenever a player lags, the one that lags has a HUGE advantage over the opponent that isn't lagging.
Lets say you're fighting someone whos lagging pretty hard. Your attacks wont be initiated because his body keeps glitching and surfing in directions. Yet the chinese wong chu tong tong or whatever, his hits will all be hit on you. 
Making the game purely: unplayable. 

Also the tutorial only teaches u about  basic movement lmao, like jumping sliding and parrying
yet in the game, whenever youre in a combo, YOU CAN NOT PARRY. only if you do some very uncomfortable, immersion breaking wooba dooba with control/jump which cancels your strike and you can then parry while jumping/crouching (imagine if this shit wouldve been something in mortal kombat or something)

The game is not worth the money. You get the game and if you want ANY content at all, you'll need to buy the 10$ battlepass which gives u some goodies.
The game is also coming to mobile which idk how i feel about.

Also if you dont have this on an SSD you'll be having a processor melting like Anakin screaming ''I HATE YOU'' to Obi-wan. 

For now i really think this game should be free. The devs are very active, but they dont seem active on changing the game, but bringing this unfinished game to mobile which makes me sad."
5472,yis
5473,There are to many EU players running around at 400 ping in ranked getting 30 kills per match. It makes the game not enjoyable to play at all  and its in normal and ranked matches
5474,"Combat is very easy to get into, but so hard to master. A lot of weapons have counters but you won't realise how to deal with them first hand. A lot of combo's and tech chases which make the gameplay very fluid"
5475,like
5476,"very fun to play recommended for people who are bad at shooting like me cause this game is focus on close combat battle, mechanic is not that hard to used just gotta get used to it and practice some combo

PS: Yoto Hime is tight <3"
5477,"The game as many nice features, great gameplay,cool art. So, why the bad review ? 
Every game you face ping abuser from other regions. 
The game is made to respond by accomodating to player who are lagging and not the ones that have a good ping. Every machanics the game offer are made useless because of this. Ping abuser get through your parry, you can't hit them most of the time because their position on your screen is not where they are either.
It Ruins the games totaly.
I'll change the review  if the dev make change on that but the game as it is now is just frustrating"
5478,amazing battle royal with an incredible design
5479,"Heed my warning, if your goal is to take this game seriously, in its current state lots of work needs to be done. The meta is atrocious, the queues are horrible, the skill gap between players is quite large, and with ping bring a decision maker for the combat system; the increasing population of ""laggy"" players that make up NA/EU/OCE population ruin the quality of the game. If you are looking for a pickup-and-play br to play to climb to the top, steer far away from naraka as this is not the title for you. 

**even in trios, dog game...."
5480,This game makes me feel like a god of war. If you have watched kings avatar this game represent that alot. Its a awesome battlefield. Give it a Try!!
5481,good game
5482,"If you're more of a casual player this game is great, but if you'd like to play this seriously then the flaws start to show very quickly. EU/NA servers are flooded with smurfs and ping abusers from other regions, matchmaking will put you with top 30 players when you're still in bronze and the combat is extremely ping reliant which leads to extremely weird and unfair feeling fights.
There's definitely a lot you can do to work around those problems but they shouldn't be a thing in the first place. Luckily the developers claim they're close to fixing this issues but until then beware if you plan to play this game seriously."
5483,very good
5484,good game !
5485,"Very Good Game. better than one would assume, combat is excellent."
5486,Really good competitive game!
5487,"I love it.  Even if my record is trash.  Even if the Longsword gets on my freaking nerves every single day.  Even if I may never be Solar (maybe I will lol), even if I parry a blue focus and SOMEHOW it doesn't go through....  I still play it everyday and wish to get better at it like a real gamer would do.  p.s. pls idk nerf Longsword or uh... do something about Tarka infinite combo maybe?  idk still I do love the game"

5493,Best game ever
5494,"While I like this game and it has so much potential, it is absolutely a kill joy and turn off when you run into hackers, especially in rank. You want a fair match, climb to the top of the world and see who has the most skills? Naw son it don't matter when you are facing people who use insta charge attacks, aimbots, wall hacks, unlimited item use and rare item generator. If you're expecting to climb through the ranks, its hard to do with hackers. You want casual pvp fights? It won't happen either cuz they cheat even in quick match modes. Bloodbath?? forget about it bro. 

I cannot recommend this game to other players who actually enjoy pvp match for a contest of real skills. Until they fix the cheating issues and overseas people using vpn service to play on NA servers to gain an upper hand over NA players, it is an absolute shame and a disservice to recommend this game to anyone else."
5495,"hard to learn but worth it, really fun with unique gameplay and mechanics. I am not a fan of battle royale and only play a few games on games from this genre but on Naraka I find myself playing the whole afternoon. great game!"
5496,"Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Putting aside the fact that they charge upfront for the game and they exploit free to play mechanics around every turn.. I'll say that the combat is amazing and it's probably the best feeling battle royal I've played. Which is meaningless when the game is literally flooded with cheaters and high ping players from the other side of the world who might as well be cheating. The devs don't really seem to care either, they're focused on ""malicious teaming"" in the wake of actual cheating. God forbid they put a high ping lock on their servers, that'd just be super racist.

P.S. I don't want comments on because I absolutely dread seeing that copypasta ""we're sorry"" comment that they keep dumping into negative reviews. How about you address the issues instead of prowling the negative reviews about the cheating."
5497,aaaaaaaaaa
5498,"Literally, really enjoyable.  Had a blast the first 3 hours i played! More to come!"
5499,"You are gonna get dunked on by some chinese dude every other match, but its still fun."

5501,"not for me

5502,Ninjas in pajamas
5503,"Pretty fun game for a BR. I'm usually the type of player that's not really into BR games, but this game was captivating for me. However there's a few cons after playing daily since release.

 I honestly think this should be free to play if they are using a battlepass system & terrible lootbox rng %. However it is purely just cosmetics & it won't affect your gameplay (it still sucks though). If you don't have a battlepass, you can really only get immortal chest through the shop paying through an ingame currency called tae though you can only buy up to 4 per week. Tae is relatively easy to come by, but buying 4 chest can get really expensive since everytime you buy a chest, the price increases until weekly reset. Chest also come by completing cultivation and every 5 levels. With how bad the %'s are, you're most likely going to end up with a lot of duplicates.

There's also a lot of overseas players playing on almost every server other than their own servers which in an online fighting game typeish game like this where ping plays a major factor, its frustrating to play against. 

This game only been out for over a month and even though their monetization is booty, overall the game has been a blast playing. The dev team is looking into the overseas players at least so I believe they will address it sometime soon. If you can look over these hurdles, I believe the game is worth a shot to try out."
5504,(y)
5505,awesome game. difficult and it should be difficult. takes time to learn but after 10 to 20 hours you start to learn more. The game is not for people who gear up easily. but you have little time. and do not give up so it is addictive fun 11/10

5532,rly cool combat system kinda like for honor and titain fall combined. Fast paced battle royal but it takes some time to get good in the higher ranks. Skins are also sick. Would definitely recommend.
5533,"this game is fun actually however, its flooded with hackers recently. out of 20 games there is roughly 6 games with hackers...
therefore i would not recommend this game to my friends."
5534,So great ~~!
5535,Helped me get rid of my League of Legends addiction. Now I'm addicted to Naraka.
5536,"I really like playing this game, it's a lot of fun when it works as it should, but it has several problems, and i really hope they fix most of them.
This time i'm going to talk about the bad things of this game, because most of you already know the good things, and the good things are great, so i hope to be useful and just inform you a little bit more about the game with the following points:

Tons of players abusing of their lag:
-There's a lot of players who have advantage over you only because of their high ping, (Most of them are Chinese players playing in NA or EU servers, they use a VPN in order to simulate being from The Americas or Europe in order to play in these servers. and it's pretty unfair, because they have so much lag that you can't do counter attacks against them, or sometimes they just don't take any damage when you do a charged attack to them, and there's a lot of these players in every match, so this ruins completely the game experience (The combat), if they fix this issue then i would recommend this game, because this is the major problem here.

-The Optimization is pretty bad, although if you have an RTX Card is not as bad, because you can use DLSS and have better performance, but most of us don't have those cards, and even less in this global shortage times. 
Urgently the developers should at least implement AMD FSR Technology for this game, and release an update completely focused on the optimization because the FPS drops problems, and the high ram usage problems are pretty bad.

The monetization system is excessive, they used a mobile free-to-play game monetization system here.
There's Cosmetics/Skins for everything, There's a lot of Outfits, Hook Skins, Accesories, Backgrounds for your character at the loading screens, emotes, gestures, skins bundles, also loot boxes, battle pass and even more. The game screen is full of notifications constantly and all of these things are typical of mobile F2P games, and that's pretty bad because this is not a free game and it seems that they focus more on all of those things instead of fixing the bad performance of the game or many other issues. 

-The legendary or extreme skins bundles ( just an outfit plus a weapon skin) are more expensive than the game itself and that's ridiculous.

-You can't directly buy the amount of gold necessary to buy the Battlepass, you always going to need to buy more gold in order to get it.

- The Upgraded version of the Battlepass is ridiculously expensive, it cost 4360 gold bars, a price close to twice the amount of the game price, and even if you bought it at the discount price of 3000 bars (23.15$) that was still more expensive than the game itself. And the only plus you receive from this upgrade is that you unlock 30 BP levels instantly, so is not worth it at all, but the normal BattlePass (11,10$) is well worth it at the beginning of the seasons.

-Even if you complete the BattlePass you don't receive enough gold bars to buy the next one, they still ask you to buy the minimum amount of gold bars in order to complete the required amount of money that you need to buy the new BattlePass, and that's pretty disappointing and insulting."
5537,bbest battle royal yet
5538,gud
5539,"Within 20 matches, the game’s concept is quickly grasped and all its flaws begin to show. Its flashy, clunky, and discourages range combat.

If you are seeking for a game to replace HOOD: outlaws and legends, this game will SLIGHTLY satisfy that itch, but will more likely deliver a salty and sour aftertaste.

Naraka’s Combat:

The combat in Naraka visually looks complex but its all just flashy animation. Its combat is simplified down to 3 aspects. Basic attacks, uninterruptible, specific counter for the uninterruptible attack.

The dogma dumbs down to this:
uninterruptible > basic > counter > uninterruptible. 

Pros (combat):
1. Heroes have no influence on weapons.
2. Heroes have unique abilities
3. Heroes are not locked to weapons
4. Weapons are the fighting style.
5. Stamina based dodging
6. Wall run, tree climbing, wall climb, ledge hanging bush hiding, tree hiding
7. Grapple hook for even greater traversal
8. Grapple hook players!
9. Air combos!
10. Counter disarms enemy!! (They drop the weapon)

Neutral (combat):
1. Uninterruptible attacks always knock down enemies
2. Grapple hooking players stuns them
3. Mimic opponent’s attack type to clash weapons.

Cons (combat)

1. Females have the best ultimates
2. No blocking !?!?!!!!?!
3. Hard to get off the ground after knockdown
4. No way to counter repeatable knockdowns when knocked down
5. Headshots do not instant kill, headshot multiplier
6. Stamina pool equates to 2 dodges
7. Cannot counter / escape air combo juggle.
8. Cannot break out of grapple stun
9. Performing Uninterruptible can be canceled (Feint)
10. Projectile based uninterruptible cannot be countered
11. Dodge required to start sprint!!!!!

WTF (highlights)
1. No blocking
2. Dodge to start sprinting
3. Cannot break out of juggle
4. Hard to get off the ground after knockdown.
5. Stamina pool = 2 dodges.


In my opinion the cons of the combat design outweigh the pros as there are ZERO ways to break out of knockdown and stun spam. The ability to cancel or “feint”(For Honor reference) an uninterruptible attack makes countering OBSOLETE in the majority of cases.  The combat experience is reduced down to whoever gets in the grapple hook first.

The counter does disarm the knockdown spammer, but the feint counters the counter. 

In short, naraka has all the elements to make a great fighting game, but the poor and lazy decisions to critically design a balance of sustain and exploit is absent.  Naraka is an exploit cluster fest that rewards those who can do it faster. 

Hood: outlaw and legend is superior to this.

Actual value: $5.00 USD or free to play

######Update

I cannot recommend this game because the cons can be frustrating and annoying at times. I will admit, I have dealt the cons to people in order to win, and the game falls hard to this concept. Although id still play this game to figure out more techniques to overcome such stupid strategy, buy this game at your own risk.

#### Update #2

Loot in the Battle Royal Map is not at all Random. If you memorize a gold drop location, get to it ASAP.
Another stupid design. Aside from this, its quick fun.

##### update 3

The suspicion of cheaters has been growing on my mind. With certain players running with incredible speed, taking less damage, and charging their attacks in less than half the normal time, my brain’s cheat radar is going off.

I did some digging in the forums and someone posted a video of  streamer who is cheating. See mark 21 min and 30 seconds, 30m and 20s of video link. He can even see all loot and chest locations.  https://youtu.be/-VZGHeCCWgs

#### update 4 -- Fake Positive Reviews
The game is rated Very Positive because the reviews that are 2 words to a short sentence are from accounts that own 1 to 10 games. Although they are actual purchases, its a business strategy to keep the overall rating of their product positive.

### Update 5 -- Reputation Deduction when crashing out of game
get enough of these an you are banned for 72 hours.

### Update 6 -- Never lose with  GreatSword and Katana
- So i was always took 3rd place in bloodbath using every other weapon except GreatSword and Katana.  Having noticed every ""Great"" Player at the top with a GreatSword or Katana, I have decided to see whats the big deal.  Well.... 8 wins in a row as 1st place with a GreatSword and Katana is saying a lot about these Stupid ZZZZzzzzz weapons."

In the first few games you will get some good kills or even win the game, but the more hours you accumulate the harder it gets because you will be up against those who know how to play and you will need to step up your game.

Challenging. Sometimes easy,balance and difficult matches. My opinion playing in Ranked (solo/trio) is most balanced. Since opponents seems similar skill level. Voice chat/communication chat/emotion stickers unique part of the game! Moving in the game is fun, like a ninja. Jumping/flying fluently cross the map with Grappling Hooks. 

Lots of variety melee and ranger weapons. You can spam in the game a lot vs bot. But not against real players. The game force you to learn weapon mechanics ( blocks,dodge,evades). Rewarding.

[b]Chill[/b] There is also chill mode like  you can go into Bloodbath and die as many times you want. ""Test your skills"", do some Quest for rewards, get some kills. 

[b] Graphics [/b] 10/10 Beautiful  characters. Fun character editing.  Lots of small details to add. Lots of nice outfit skins. :D

[b] Rewards [/b] Lots of rewards!

Addicting!

FIN -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[b] Pelattavuus [/b]
Haastava. Joskus helppo, tasapainoinen ja vaikea ottelu. Mielestäni pelaaminen Rankedissa (soolo/trio) on tasapainoisin. Koska vastustajat vaikuttavat samalta taitotasolta. Ääni chatti, chat ja emoji tarrat söpö osa peliä! Pelissä liikkuminen on hauskaa niin kuin ninja. Voi vaan ""liidellä"" sujuvasti kartan yli Grappling Hookin avulla.

Paljon erilaisia lähitaistelu- ja ranger -aseita. Voit spämmätä nappuloita pelissä paljon AI Bootteja vastaan. Mutta ei oikeita pelaajia vastaan. Peli pakottaa sinut oppimaan asemekaniikan (blokkaamista, väistämistä ). Palkitsevaa!

[b] Chill [/b] 
On myös chill -tila, jossa voit mennä Bloodbathiin ja kuolla niin monta kertaa kuin haluat. ""Testaa taitosi"", suorita joitakin Quest -palkintoja ja hanki tappoja.

5608,this game is super fun. the fighting mechanics are fluid and feel good. its overall a really rad game wish more people played
5609,very nice
5610,"This game is harder than a lot of games that have came out in recent years. So if you are not prepared to learn about characters, weapons, cancels, matchups, the attack and defense system, movement, while still being able to critique yourself and not let yourself succumb to just saying this game is bad because of your own mistakes and incompetence, then do not buy this game. But if you are somebody that's willing to learn and put in the time and work then you'll feel the joy on your first combo, first cancel parry, first bow headshot, and many more very rewarding and satisfying experiences. This is the best game I've played this year and has made me look at myself as a gamer and better my own gameplay with quick thinking and decision making"

5620,trash
5621,This game is trash. Cheaters everywhere. No region lock so people from Asia can play on NA servers with stupid high ping and are impossible to kill. I played all the betas. This game could have been good but the devs do not care.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!
5622,"Awesome Game!

 -Thrilling fast paced combat and movement systems 
 -Beautiful art work and characters
 - High skill cap
 - Variety of Weapons and Warrior/Abilities
 - Refreshing and Novel new take on the BR Genre - Totally unique
 -- The Variety of Character/Abilities/Weapons and High Skill Cap means this Game already has an abyssal 
     depth, with plenty of potential to add more. 

I'm puzzled though by the many negative reviews I've seen here. Most negative reviews admit the game is very well thought out and kick-ass, but complain that they would like to see a region lock and a ping limit placed on lobbies, as high-ping is basically an exploit being used by eastern players to dominate NA servers.

I'm South African, and as there are no regional servers here, I play on EU servers with at best around 190 ping. If there is a way to use this to my advantage, please can someone explain it to me? It has been extremely challenging trying to compete with the higher ping, and since I've hit Bronze II lobbies it's been almost impossible to win any 1 v 1's unless I time everything perfectly.

With my high ping I experience the following:
 - Unable to land standard parry. The way I have been able to land a parry is by perfectly timing a jump or 
    crouch parry, or by faking a focus attack and switching to crouch parry. Even if I time this perfectly, it is 
    unreliable at best, and attacks penetrate straight through my parry's.

-  Focus attack doesn't reliably block standard attacks, many light attacks penetrate my focus attack as if it 
    doesn't exist.

- 200 ms delay in such fast combat means I have to anticipate the opponent perfectly to land my combos  
   
- I grapple away thinking I've survived only to find I've been struck and actually died.

- I combo toward an opponent only to find he's moved and is now behind me

- Ranged combat is almost impossible as at a distance as you cant accurately time or lead the shot.


In spite of these challenges I have managed to progress and enjoy the game, and in light of my experience I don't understand how NA players are saying high-ping is being exploited to dominate their servers? Please explain it to me so I can have a better experience ;)

I would therefore not like it at all if the devs created a region lock or ping lock as I would not be able to play from South Africa, and this is what the devs mean when they say creating a region lock would cause them to lose players. 

Please can the dev's look into having regional servers in South Africa. There is a large gaming community and Naraka would be popular. Many other big name titles, if not most, have servers in South Africa. This would greatly improve the gaming experience obviously, You could try contacting Gamesoft to arrange them hosting servers.

Naraka is a solid Thumbs up from me.."
5623,"Before I say anything else let me warn you about the Cash shop.

Do NOT invest any money into loot-crates, the chances of getting duplicate items are extremely high and you will most likely NOT get the desired item.


Other than that, the game is pretty good, the combat is fun and engaging and you have a very high skill ceiling, I hope the predatory loot-system will be made a bit more player friendly at some point since the game is already buy 2 play anyways.

5628,"This game is actually a lot of fun, but im very sad about it.
Well at first u need some learning curve to get good on this game, but after you get in it, its really fun to play.
Combat mechanics fall apart completely when playing against players that connect to servers overseas to avoid playing in their own region ( yes mostly chinese people ). The connection issues is my worst experience because it makes the game stutter and in a few cases unplayable. If the devs do not fix the chinese invasion and the connection problems the game will die sooner or later.... to my sadness

+ The company marketing strategy is the most aggressive i've ever seen in my gaming career, they try to get you addicted and spend as much money as possible on the game, without you even noticing it :( but i wont spend haha"
5629,"sb game, even dogs dont play"

5635,put English language in CN servers pleasessssssssss
5636,i like
5637,"Will you have fun for awhile? Sure. Because they implement bot players specifically to get you over the 2 hour mark so you cannot refund the game. By the time you hit that mark, you'll most likely be playing in late Bronze early Silver ranks in which the game is plague by unbalanced weapons, no region locks so specifically oversea players on other servers will be able to parry well after they should be able to, and a general unhealthy amount of skills in the game. 

I don't recommend the game until they implement a region block, a ping limiter and plenty of balancing. I'd wager that a ping limit/region block will actually solve a lot of the issues with the melee combat 

Oh and it's an aggressively monetized game on top of a buy to play model. Usually nothing wrong with that. Gotta make your money somehow after the initial hype dies down. 
Till you realise they'll only give you one of the special event exclusive loot box to earn and you'll have to buy the rest, in which in order to get a guranted epic pity drop is 100 of the loot boxes, totalling to about £300 

The only saving grace is the production quality of the actual game. Art work, design of the skins, the map are really well done for a BR game. It's also a unique Melee BR so there's that. 

Review can change if the Devs implement needed changes"
5638,just buy it
5639,Get these chinese scum off the NA servers.

5643,"(first review i think) As a person that has under 24 hours on this game, I can say this is honestly one of the only games where I feel like I stand a chance Battle Royale wise. The game is really hard to get to but when you get all of your tactics down, the game can be enjoyable. I recommend you to practice in your spare time and watch guides, but overall this game is fun and challenging."
5644,cool combat system very satisfying overall. Do not get down on urslef learning the combat system takes time and its something I am still learning
5645,Good game I really enjoy it

5654,
5655,This game is shit for a paid game its clunky and just a mess. Theirs no soul to it I feel like I'm playing a Sekiro mobile. If it was free it would be okay but even so its not worth any money in the state its currently in.

5658,for controller players maybe be able to add an extra feature for us to move the cursor faster while looting
5659,"Very nice game, good to see it is being developed."
5660,nice game
5661,Could be the best battle royale out there but I feel like being able to use the same character in trios can be a bit overpowered.

I don't think I'd call the game bad but it has a lot of mechanics that need to be worked out."
5677,"Looking for an EZ game? This ain't for you. Skill Gap is high. If u take your time to learn it, you will be able to survive... if u want a game that i a walk in the park... turn back now. With this said.. this IS THE BEST battle royale in the fighting genre right now. Superb FUN!"

btw Samurai Fortnite"
5680,so fun
5681,"it was fun but it were sucks. Yes, the concept were playable but there're just too much stuff need to learn again, only those hardcore were able to handle it, I can only casual play instead of taking this game seriously, the characters can be take down too easily or too much need to counter if you're solo 3 alone, for those new who just joined this game I hope the dev will open newbie server(by play time) instead of getting smash hard from different level experience players.
Yes, you see the trailer looks so flashy and amazing, but when you play it, it's just expectation for visual commercial."
5682,"very very solid BR with unique combat, needs some time and effort to master, has a lot of hidden tech which reminds me a lot of actual fighting games. overall 8/10 would be a lot more fun if i had friends sadge"
5683,"Combat good but battle royal format sucks. Best part of the game is custom lobby 1v1s, and I would like to either see the devs expand more on 1v1s or maybe introduce a team vs team arena mode."
5684,very gud
5685,"This game offers a huge variety of weapons, playable characters and cosmetics. You get a bunch of cosmetics and ingame currency for free from the battlepass (which you don't have to buy in order to receive items).
There's daily login bonuses and quests to complete which you get rewards for. 
I'm a huge fan of the melee weapons and the individual abilities every character brings. (They all have a skill and an ultimate)
[b]Very fun game, YET I was nearly unable to play this game when I installed it on my HDD. I experienced very bad lags and it took forever to load in after the round had started. This game HAS to be installed on a SSD in order to run smoothly![/b]

EDIT: If other servers were region locked I'd enjoy this game a lot more. Each round I literally get destroyed by players from other continents who have been grinding since the release of this game. SIGH"
5686,yoyoyo
5687,"This game is extremely fun with friends, especially in trios. however, the price tag along with it is not worth imo. best to grab only the base version of the game unless you are into skins. in game treasure chests are a ripoff for a paid game, best to grab the battlepass for the best value for skins and other in game goodies.

There is also endless character facial customization if you like turning your characters into shrek, night elves and maybe even goku. One can easily spend hours in character customization before even starting the game.

The game has almost an infinite skill ceiling and your worst enemies aren't your first few bot matches. You will be matched with players much stronger than you once u make it past bot matches and most likely you will keep dying. However, much of this game is learning through deaths and understanding the base mechanics of the game. Trios is way more lenient in terms of mechanical skills as compared to solos and its overall more fun for me."
5688,"fun somtime but feel weird gameplay such hitbox, animation etc"
5689,vv good but am noob
5690,permainan bagus
5691,"Skill-full game, needs more maps and characters."
5692,"Edit 2: I've returned well after the new champions have been introduced, and the new weapon, nunchucks, arrived to the game, and while some improvements have been made (the game now has a bot mode that contributes to your rep, something that I imagine will help users that get low rep and can't play Herald's Trial and Quick Match), not that much has changed. The reputation system is something that I find not only annoying, but also pretty scummy for a BR that has a $30 dollar entry price. The monetization is a bit more intrusive, which as well is detriment for the same reason that the reputation system is a freaking bad idea.

High ping players and region locking has been mentioned a few times here and there on the Dev logs, but no implementation or a solution seems to be on the devs priorities, and you will find the same ammount of cheaters the longer you keep playing ranked matches (and to the nay-sayers of this detail, read my initial review or educate yourself and search for any Naraka ""plugin"" as the asian players know the you-know-what-i-mean type of, lets call it ""tool assistance"", I swear the asian market for this type of thing can rival those used on games like CS, Fortnite and  GTAV). All these things are some of the details why the game does not have a presence on Twitch, and why there will never be a well entablished and proper esports scene as the devs intend to, which, with the state in which the game still is, should not be a priority untill most of the problems are solved.

Plus, after returning and playing the game 10 more hours, a personal nitpick I have is that, there is little variety for a game focused on melee combat besides that of the skills used by each hero. Sure, its a BR title and it would be hella difficult to balance it if every character had a bit of variety on animations, hit boxes and whatnot, but if you're the type of player that looks to learn different playstyles, You won't find it here. So I still cannot recommend this, use those $30 bucks on a better game.

Edit 1: changed typos and should mention that, within the latest update, the devs have added a reputation system that affects you when you leave a game, even within the prep time. If this reputation gets lower than 7500 and 6000 points, you'll be banned from playing Herald's Trial and Quick Match respectively. Practically you won't be able to play most of the game modes. What a way to kill your game, mofos. Just to point out, I've regularly have seen a concurrent playerbase of over 100k players, close to 150k, but now the numbers are standing just over 33k, so yeah, 24 Entertaiment and Netease, enjoy your future dead game if you keep doing nonsense like this.

And to anyone else, better find something else to play and don't buy this, and if you have already bought the game, let the devs know your concern and place a negative here, because if you don't let them know this is such a bad change, you've wasted your money like this dum dum here.

Will continue to add more as the insanity grows, we'll see how bad this ends later on.

-----

Naraka: Bladepoint is a game that has great potential, that unfortunately will meet its end if the glaring problems that many other users have already pointed out are not fixed by the company.

And my view was changed because I kept practicing right after the 20ish  hour mark, a moment in which I though will be abandoning the game, but by sheer stuborness I begun to learn more about the game mechanics, and discovered things like traverse tricks, combo interruption, combo transition, etc. The game is really fun when you learn more and more about the way these mechanics work, becasue many players might think that, since its a Battle Royale it should work like any other game in the genre, or that if you have Fighting Game knowledge, you'll automatically do fine, which is not the case.

I used to be completely destroyed because I though this way, but after learning the mechanics and the potential that this game has, I'm having more fun with it.

But even with all that I really cannot recommend the game, since it has an overwhelming problem with high ping players and cheaters, and if you are on of those in denial that the game does not have any cheaters, let's remember that any type of game that has had any competitive element has suffered from cheater, heck, even Fall Guys had this problem, so with that I rest my case.

Plus the game has other problems, like no camera speed optimization, and the camera itself becomes frustrating in many places on all the maps.

I'll still be playing this game because I'm a stubborn bast', but if you don't want to suffer and be frustrated, avoid this game like the plague. Anyways, if these problems are not solved sooner or later, I can see the game dying soon enough. Even gacha games have better customer service experiences, which is a detail that should be very telling of the state in which this game is, and the grim future that it has if something is not done soon enough."

5729,fun to play
5730,"From infinite combos to devs ignoring the playerbase, this game has everything. Unfortunately it's generally bad.
The game could be great, the combat is fun at first, the characters are cool, you get to customize them with the system going as far as having sliders! sadly that's about where the pros stop. There are always one or two way overpowered weapons in the game that allow you to get infinite combo'd so you can't even fight back. The characters abilities are generally all some form of cc. There's also one character, Matari, who makes up like 80% of the matches since she can just teleport out of a fight and go invisible if she's losing which is wildly annoying. The worst part is the cash shop. It's a loot box system but there's two different loot boxes(at the time of this event at least), then there's the stuff you can buy for gold (in game currency) that you can't get from boxes, then there's stuff you can buy with tae (another currency), then there's the spectral silk store (another currency)... see what I'm getting at here? That's all cosmetic though so you don't necessarily need it.

The devs don't seem to listen to the playerbase either. NA has been asking for balanced heroes and a ping lock since release(other regions who have had the game much longer are playing in NA servers and ruining the experience) and the devs latest Q&A has two statements. One about combating racism, and the other about becoming a streaming partner. 

The game was a breath of fresh air in the BR genre but the devs lack of action and greedy transactions ruined it for me.
On the bright side, it'll probably go f2p in a few months(quickplay matchmaking takes about ten minutes during peak hours for me, ranked even longer) so just wait till then to get it."
5731,"hi
"
5732,"pretty fun so far.
controls are easy, but you would need to learn some combos and tricks to not be too frustrated, by countless defeats and deaths)
not so absolutely maddening as For Honor, but definitely has similarities 
all in all easy to start but hard to master, it would eat a decent chunk of your time, or you will drop it, one or the other
buy on your own discretion

EDIT: [strike] there also would be times (quite often honestly), when you wont be able to get your ass kicked, because of severe ping, disconnections etc. [/strike]  it was more or less fixed."
5733,"I have always played FPS/Sims. I only got this because i saw it on Steam front page as a new BR so I tried it w/ really low expectations to how well I'd be w/ the mechanics. Its intuitive, fun, compounds on itself, and is very rewarding. When i hop into into other games after playing this I'm wishing i could move my character the same way. Movement tricks are very satisfying.

If you like games that require fast mechanics and outthinking people quickly, defintiely try this.

5734,"If you are from Central or South America dont buy it! the lag ruins the game mechanics/gameplay

5743,"Naraka is honestly a breath of fresh air in the field of Battle Royale games. While most BRs are focused on ranged combat, Naraka puts heavy emphasis on melee; and it feels good. The combat system is very similar to traditional fighting games- combos, counters, dodging, etc and its honestly the most fun I've had in a battle royale in a long time. Of course, the combat isn't the only selling point. The movement system is extremely satisfying and fun to use; anything that you want to do, you can do. Climb up walls, stealthily balance on a chain, hide in a tree, hang from the edge of a roof, dive through a window, the list goes on. You also have the option to use a grappling hook, which when used properly can make you feel like Batman zipping from building to building. Visually, the game is beautiful. There's a lot of detail on things that you wouldn't normally spend very long looking at, and of course all of the main elements are amazing as well. Combat visuals are easy to see and interpret, but not so much that they clutter the screen. 

The characters are all unique with their own playstyles, and it all seems decently balanced so you won't have to worry about picking the ""wrong"" hero. Its the perfect game to play casually or competitively, and I highly recommend trying it.

That being said, it does have some issues. If you don't have an SSD, you should definitely get one before downloading Naraka. Running it from an HDD causes stuttering and lag spikes. Its not enough to make the game unplayable, but it is very frustrating and menus can take a very long time to load- sometimes long enough that you don't get to pick your spawn point before the match starts. Other than this though, the game is very polished and clean and if you have no hardware conflicts, then you shouldn't run into any issues.

I have never had a problem with any game functionality-wise or connection-wise... this game is horrible on both fronts. Therefore I would recommend holding off on this game until it is fully optimised and has stable consistent servers. Albeit the game-play is amazing and the combat is really fun. Definitely give this game a shot, just hold off for a little and let them fix their minor mistakes and balance some of the broken systems in the game currently."
5760,"NGL this game is super fun hence the hours clocked in, but with more hackers on the loose and chinese players dominating most regions with their lag and sometimes skill gap, its gonna be sooner or later this game will die a natural death outside CN servers.

-Wide variety of melee and ranged weapons to make the gameplay less mundane.
-Basic lootboxes given for free through grind or purchaseable by non real life money.
-Battle pass definitely worth for the rewards you get.
-Bloodbath can be 12mins of fun or sweat that leaves u constantly re-spawning.

What i dislike:
-Skill ceiling far into the void, so huge skill mismatch for regular good players vs new/returning players.
-Ranked ladders seems screwed up atm where a silver player could possibly be in a game with plat/solars for solos. Definitely unfair in terms of skill match up and not fun to keep the grind going.
-Tarka's infinite combo is apparently allowed by the devs = 100-0 with no counter play in solos. (fk this champ and all who main him REEEEEEEE)
-Players exploiting hacks/lags to gain edge over others.
-Combat glyphs(Energy &/or rage) are basically a must have, leaving little to no use for other glyphs like Corrupted zone dmg reduction, coins/s , shop discount etc.


Current feels of the game as of review: Naraka is fun with loads of action packed gameplay, but also not a place for casuals nor beginner friendly since there is literally no skill ceiling in sight. For trios if you don't have a solid team, be prepared to have players that hot drop into 20/20 position before reporting you for not aping in with them"
5761,"its so sexy game for battleoroyal
"
5762,"its a fun game, but i am getting disconnected every single round. sadly for me the game is not optimized for me, and i love getting grappled by 3 guys spamming left click and i love the SBMM of this game as well. Keep it up, cos the more disconnection i get every round of games, the more i feel like uninstallling this PAID game."
5763,nice
5764,"Don't buy. They don't care oversea market at all, especially OCE server. Bad connections, so many hackers, bad optimizations (5800X + 3070 with lowest graph settings, 70% resolution can roughly run this game). Low ping and high FPS players can easily win the fights. If you report a hacker in OCE server, it will never be processed as there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE STAFF. What a joke."
5765,10/10 verry good
5766,"This game has a really cool theme and the combat system is fun and exciting but it can be really unfair most of the time because of the constant cc (crowd control) and the ability to do nothing about it aswell as all the match making system and how it doesn't even region lock players so 9/10 matches you will be going against people from the Asia server if you play in the NA server like myself and the reason that is a bad thing is because they lag all over the place and even though you clearly hit them and use your abilities on them it just doesn't hit them or it goes right through them even though you see it hit them, Now I'm not one to say it much but this game has a REALLY BIG problem with hackers and cheaters, me and my friends have run into them a lot during our matches and it seems like they always have the chinese characters as names and its getting really annoying how 45/60 players in the lobby are from a different server and the game feels one sided, One of my friends was banned for cheating even though they did not use any third party software or any cheat engine and the game itself has its own cheat protection so does this mean that the cheat protection does nothing at all (yes its completely useless) the Devs themselves are also useless and they don't even have a person working there that can help you also the ingame support and service email for the developers, both will ONLY respond with copy-pasted (probably autonomous) responses. Their copy-paste email response they've used a few times has absolutely broken English that's hard to read. If you have any real issues you will NOT get any help from the devs."
5767,"This game is really fun. I love the characters and the art style, and the combat system is very engaging. My main issue with this game is the monetization system which is very predatory and feels unrewarding most of the time."
5768,it's a very nice looking game and I love the play style
5769,its a good fun game cobat is nice and the looting its good but there are some weapons that u just spam thats bs and the ping is that bad its hard to even play sdome times not worth £17 if thay fixed the ping it would be worth it but cuss the ping is so bad i would not even bother playing it but if it gets fixed i will do a 2nd review for it but i never seen a ping so bad u think outriders and cyber punk was bad this tops it buy farrrrrrrrrrrrrr sort the ping out so meny ppl will be happy
5770,"Was fun, but now it is simply irritating.  There needs to be a region lock.  Kanji and Euro Trash players need to stay in their own servers."
5771,"Gierka spoko, ale twórcy mogliby zatrzymać Chinoli w ich własnym rejonie. Przyjdzie taki na EU i później ma nabitych 15-20 fragów na koniec gry, a o Bloodbathie nawet nie wspominam, bo tam 30+ to standard dla gościa z chińskimi znaczkami w nicku. Niech sobie skośnooki żółtek w otoczeniu figurek swoich waifu gra ze swoimi.

The game is fun, but developers should keep the Asians on their own server. They come to the EU and have around 20 kills in every match. I don't even mention The Bloodbath. Let the Asian man play against people from his continent surrounded by his waifu figurines."
5772,"they buff stuff that is already strong and it has literally come down to longsowrd meta who can use the charged LMB or RMB first and stun lock the other
otherwise theres quite alot of cheaters already and also ping abusers since you can get a second or 2 immunity

needs a duo mode for those who play with only 1 other friend and dont wanna put up with a random
it would be a fun game if they fixed alot of the ping abuse stuff and along with that the weapon balancing too since thats kinda lopsided"
5773,I lose connection to server almost every game.
5774,"its dank
"
5775,"Well control , nice and clear!"
5776,It's just apex...wtf
5777,It was fun the first 2-3 hours but then slowly you realise this type of game isn't meant to be played in a battle royale genre. Should've been a single player rpg that fleshes out more of the combat and parkour with ability trees and more.
5778,very fun game
5779,"loving the game, can't recommend to anyone who takes ranked seriously however. the netcode is so poor when youre against Koreans or anyone not from your region, you could have a stellar game and die to someone you never even saw.

the game its self is great, and ill continue to play it, but for how sweaty they made this game the netcode issues alone make it pointless to play competitively."
5780,"First, this game should go free to play as it is very much a free to play game. I would like to see a system with matchmaking based off of seasonal pass purchases. Like a premium play queue to reduce cheaters. 

The new map is not fun. I have never played a BR game where the map literally works against you with annoying traps and areas blocked off from weather.

My biggest complaint is they did something to the countering mechanic at some point. This mechanic is used to prevent people from spamming attacks yet 9 times out of 10, because of the net code, the focus (blue) strike will hit you where as the counter will just not register.

Originally I had a positive review because the game itself COULD be fun. I think it is funny because EVERY negative comment about this game has been the amount of VPN users absolutely destroying people. They are not destroying the lobbies because they are good but simply because you cannot hit them due to the way the game works with lag. This has been an issue for a LONG time since the game first released.

Do not buy this game unless you play during the day.

Also, the Greatsword, Longsword and Katana have been massively overused for at least a year now due to their ease of use. If you mess up one thing against both of these weapons they will kill you much faster than other weapons. The Dagger and Nun-chucks are just rage inducing stunlocks now, the dagger used to at least have some unique attributes now meh. And the Ultimates just do not belong in this game, the abilities yes, but the Ultimates are get out of jail free cards and that is pretty much it across the board.

Kill stealing. In Ranked your RP is greatly rewarded when getting kills and the game has no recognition of doing 99% of the damage and someone else hitting them with a ranged weapon. They get the full reward and you are left low HP and need to repair.

Cheating. The amount of times I spectate and see people locked to targets is insane.

There are multiple character and weapons that allow combos that are inescapable unless you have an ability that lets you get out of it. Weapons are supposed to clash on same type of hits yet with the laggy fights between WIFI consoles and VPNs this never happens and whoever spams light hits and cancels will just kill you with no counter play."
5781,"Update: Still contains a bunch of predatory monetisation. Unacceptable in a game with this sort of price tag

Really love the game, think it should be free. It contains all the F2P hallmarks already, but I'm sure they'll find a way to squeeze a bit extra out of everyone if they do actually make any changes."
5782,"This game is freaking awesome !!! So many mechanics and weapons.

Though I'm a solo player, so I would need people to play with me. If you plan to buy the game, add me and use my code : ch784eecne !!!"
5783,"Fresh take on Battle Royale Scene, highly recommend trying the game. if you do decide to purchase the game use my code: chydywqycc before you create a username for additional rewards!"

[b]Anticheat:[/b] NeacProtect

Before anyone asks why these are listed, with the rise of cheaters in this game, it's to give a fair warning on this game.

Naraka Bladepoint is a unique take on a Battle-Royal type game. 
Take your fighter, get some weapons and fight with martial arts and multiple abilities.

Pros:
- Unique
- Customization of characters
- Good cosmetics
- Decent servers

Cons: 
- The anti cheat is a joke, read up on NeacProtect and how easy it is to bypass
- Reports don't do anything
- CN players on NA servers (Now this wouldn't be a problem if it was 2 of them, but up to 40 a game...)
- Bots, lots of bots.
- Cheaters are rampant and unpunished

Naraka at its core is fun, the gameplay is unique, I hate BR games but love Naraka, but with the rampant cheating.
The massive amount of foreign players near your own location, the abysmal MMR system. I can't recommend this at all.
I wish all these issues would be fixed as it is a great BR and fun to play. But in this current state, stay away. 
If it becomes free to play, then sure try it. For now, save your money for a sale, since they have a battlepass. 

Here are examples of what you will face in Naraka.

5797,"[h1]tl;dr[/h1]
Ranked matchmaking is broken, as a low/mid ladder player you are being matched with top players, not being able to climb or learn. Also the game contains a couple of broken combos (infinite damage and stun). If you want to play ranked matches, wait for a matchmaking fix, it's unplayable now.

[h1]Review[/h1]
Overall the game is my top 10 games ever. The combat mechanisms are well done, the graphics is pretty nice, the idea for the game is interesting, the heroes and their abilities are, with some exceptions, balanced and fun to play.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]
The problem is with the matchmaking - I have around 2600 skill points in trios, so my rank is Plat IV, but I already played with the top EU players. One game I even played with a trio which consisted of top1, top2 and top4 players, each having +4000 skill points (see the problem?). Usually I get a top100 player in every 2 games I play - I even learned their names and skins already.

Once you reach a certain rank, which is around Plat, you will struggle a lot in games, because you are going from games with mediocre players and a lot of bots to games filled with top players. If you'd play with players from your rank, you could learn, you could have fun, you could have fair fights. But the reality looks different.

People that say ""you have to play with better players to learn"" are partially correct. But in this case ""better"" should mean a bit better, not top1 player that rolls you with their bare fists. 

[b]Broken combos[/b]
There are a couple of different combos in the game that once started cannot be interrupted or are extremely hard to do so. One of which is a katana combo with the ""fire guy"" or dagger juggling. If a way better player is doing that to you, you are most likely dead, without a way to cancel/parry/interrupt the combo. The combo is infinite, so the player could just juggle you for eternity, and you wouldn't be able to move.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
I recommend this game with all my heart BUT if you want to play ranked matches, wait for a matchmaking fix, it's unplayable now."

5801,"Always been curious on how game developers might implement the concept of Hack & Slash into Battle Royale, this game actually delivers. 
Downside is that when you are queuing solo, mostly zero communication and most likely all of you go on your own way then got left clicked by bunch of parties. 
In terms of learning curve, this game might take awhile, especially parrying and the combo of some specific weapons. 
Got money ? Got friends ? Like Hack n Slash ? Into BR ?

5806,Good game
5807,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5808,game itself is wonderful and hard too there are some issues with movement but nothing that bad. the worst thing about this game is the vpn abusers the game need region lock and ping lock fighting against enemies with absurdly high ping gives them a huge advantage in this sort of game but still ill give it a thumbs up.
5809,good soup
5810,i think the only thing that the game needs is more people playing it
5811,very good i love it
5812,Game seems to give advantages to players with high ping. every time you get into a fight wit someone you get massive lag spikes or frame drops. This game is all about timing and timing is impossible against high ping players. i wouldn't buy until the implement some sort of ping lock.
5813,gud
5814,Server lag
5815,Goodgame
5816,"It's a fun game and had potential, but great sword and Spear is very overpowered. One of the heros is very over powered and without being able to actively block, you can parry (Only focus atks), Who ever gets 1st hit usually wins. There's a level of chaos that's  frustrating.
Edit: NERF GREATSWORD OMG Don't buy this game, you will hate your life."

5819,"-23rd Evening

I've been attempting to talk to both the ingame support and service email for the developers, both will ONLY respond with copy-pasted (probably autonomous) responses. Their copy-paste email response they've used a few times has absolutely broken English that's hard to read. If you have any real issues you will NOT get any help from the devs.

While I was asleep on the 22nd of September I received a (false) game ban from the developers which'll ruin the reputation of my steam account permanently aslong as it's in effect. I'm absolutely confident I've never used a 3rd party software, exploit, or service to gain a advantage in this game and the devs won't even give a human response to try and show what I could've done(there's nothing and they either know that or have their entire anti-cheat and support on full automation). 

The only programs I've used in the last few months besides games themselves are Armoury Chest (built into ASUS motherboards), Discord, Steam(yes this client you're viewing this on), Opera & Opera GX (web browsers), Chrome Browser, Porofessor & Blitz: League of Legends statistic assistants which are the same as sites like op.gg and metasrc (all of which are completely allowed by LoLs ToS), RimPy (rimworld mod load manager), Vortex (mod manager being used for multiplayer 7 Days 2 Die).

If you wana see that I've never been banned in any other competitive or mmo game I've played that's popular and reputable, go ahead and check or contact me on them.

-Cs:go, FFXIV, Smite, Paladins, DOTA2, Rocket League, 
Warframe, DbD, RS Siege, For Honor: All this steam account
-LoL NA: Kagarin Izuriha
-WoT NA: Kuroneko_38T
-Mcc Reach & 3: Smug Kitty8995(I think, haven't opened it in awhile)

===================================================================
-22nd Evening (original before they gave 6 automated email responses)

64 Hours, cosmetics bought and interacting with community and streamers just to be false banned. Leaving a scar on my pristine profile that I've kept clean for 13 years. Now because of a faulty system or a mass report I can't be trusted.

I don't have or own a single cheat software and i've put hundreds if not thousands of hours into games with way more notable anti-cheat than Naraka, take a look at my games on steam, let alone off steam games like League of Legends (and other riot games), World of Tanks, and several other mmo's.

Unless they fix this issue i won't be changing this review, and i'll actively discourage purchases of this game. I'll do a proper review of the gameplay itself when I'm able to play to 100 hours."

5858,"Updated, just don't buy this game and be careful with the products of the same team.

The feedback below was never considered, the feedback of other people were never considered. 

You won't have a good time in this game. It was mostly the people abusing high ping back then but hell let loose in this game. You won't find a healthy amount of people playing from Eu because they have quit. The development team did not care about the fact that the game was unplayable for it's flaws. They didn't solve the ping abusing, they didn't solve the third party cheating, nothing. 

Even they are to solve these issues at this point, it's too late, that was enough of a proof for us the community to understand how irresponsible this company was, aside from most people have left the game to it's abandonment, and I suggest you to stay away from anything that might come from this very company. Unless, it's a freeware, but even then I would have my concerns.


(Below is the review of 22 of the September)

(You're probably looking for this, if it's your intend to browse the suggestions before attempting to purchase)

The review is to be changed depending on how the team 24 Entertainment approaches with their game;

The game itself is hands down a good take on battle royales, personally it's the only battle royale I enjoy. While I'm against it being this expensive for what it is, it would still be a worth purchase nevertheless. It's a hybrid between a melee and ranged style and eyecandy aspect of it also very charming. Also they have such a sweet support team that reply to your tickets in seconds of not minutes. But none of those hinders the flaw(s) of the game unfortunately. I will straight up recommending to NOT buy it for the reasons that are objectively bad, you could find out how severe those issues are just by looking up to discussions or browsing them on youtube.

1) The Vpn deal. The game limits on which servers you can play in normally, so you don't get to play in some server in which you would have 250 or more ping, due to the game's odd networking, the higher the ping the more advantage a player gets to, they basically become a teleporting machines that cannot be parried (a crucial mechanic to survive in the game). Normally you can't have this unless you are intentionally increasing your own ping or if you are someone using a Vpn to access to a server in which you would have a massive ping. The game allows this. And you get to match with people who are basically ""almost"" invincible. The tough situation is that the more day passes, the more you get to see such people in your games. (Nowadays it's mostly chinese players doing this, it was 1 to 6 people in each game usually when I started although now I get to see %30~60 of them being presented in the games in europe server)
Community tries to reach out to the developers to have it fixed but for a such trending and expensive game, they still shown no response to this day even thought the flaw makes the game somewhat ""unplayable.""

2) The cheaters / hackers. As sad as it sounds, it exists. And what's even worse is that it can be found and acquired easily, and every day the amount of them increasing in numbers rises. They get to have stuff such like infinite dodge moves, auto parrying and alike. There is still nothing being done about them besides report function.

3) Monetization. While it's only cosmetics, it's still awful way of approaching to an already expensive game for what is it. Any single acceptable ""good looking"" outfit will be more expensive than the game itself. There are loot boxes, at starters the game hands you them for free for doing achievements but they too will come to an end eventually. In game currency can get you some loot boxes although it's limited for some small amount of them that you can buy. There also is a premium type of loot box variant, which is only paid to buy. There is also a season pass deal going on but you probably know what it is. In short; the game already is expensive for what type of game it is while also having a grand in-game market that they can sell you good cosmetics.

But overall, if they would handle the 1st and 2nd issues, the game would be such a good ride that I would recommend to many."
5859,"great game highly recommend
"
5860,"I suggest that you don't purchase the game and here is why. 

1. Movement - Movement feels clunky. The game relies on a system where your character snaps onto what you are climbing, but sometimes you get snapped to the wrong object and sometimes it's difficult to snap to an object (such as jumping off of a tree and then trying to double jump to get back onto the same tree). Sometimes you unintentionally snap to parts of rooms while just jumping through them. 

Moreover, the game heavily uses a grappling hook to pull you toward surfaces and enemies. I found that the grappling hooks crosshairs to be unreliable and hit the wrong object somewhat regularly. The crosshairs can be aimed at a surface or player, but objects in front of the desired object end up getting in the way even though it wasn't visually obvious that they would get in your way. Again, this happens during combat and is unacceptable in my opinion. 

2. Combo play - The system of attack followups lends itself too easily to there being situations of players being able to combo attacks together for large amounts of damage and there isn't sufficient counter play to that system. This also happens from the perspective of team fights. In other battle royals, a 2-on-1 situation doesn't have to be the end of the world. Because of knockdowns and the counter-attack system being clunky, a 2-on-1 situation in Naraka feels incredibly one-sided and unfun.

This effect is also largely felt in popular areas and respawn zones. You are encouraged to spawn in certain areas for better loot and will need to do this when you get team-mates who insist on doing so even though there is plenty of map. It's very easy to get ganged up on in popular areas and with little recourse. The game puts respawn points in these popular areas, and you are encouraged to respawn as to continue to be able to help any teammates or kill the close enemies, but it is possible to get camped by the multiple players that also may choose to hang out around the respawn node. 

3. The game will suck you in just long enough to make it non-refundable. This is done by having you play against mostly bots for several games. Once those games are over, you get to see just how cheesy a close-range battler can be. Predatory tactic hiding as something player friendly?

Overall, I only think that this game will appeal to you if you actively play fighter games. Haven't played fighter games in a while? Save your money. Want a battle royal that doesn't feel bad mechanically? Play one of the previously existing ones. Want good ping? Don't play this game."
5861,"All you fight against is bots. Won every game. Literally like at the end of the match the bot was just running into the wall.

REFUNDED!!!!!!!!!!111!!!111!!!!1"
5862,"-5 Out of 10, theres a ton of top chinese server players that VPN over to NA and are top leaders boards while teaming in game. Plethora of evidence, videos exc but a total of 4 people have been banned. Also Ping abusers from other servers. My sunken cost forces me to play atleast to finish current event but after that I am probably finished. I cant even get friends to play with me that already own it."
5863,if you like free running games and action arena fighters just do it. its soooo goood
5864,"This is the most fun game I have played in my 7 years of gaming. Highly suggest trying this game out, well worth the money."
5865,BEST GAME
5866,"good game but no OCE server so you just get ping diffed by all the SEA players, gun weapons are clunky and have a little ""freeze"" after you shoot that stops you from doing anything.

Badly optimised and has buffering issues when entering the game, stops buffering once you actually get in game.

Spear weapon is busted and has very little counterplay.

The crowd control from abilities such as Tianhai's ultimate, Viper Ning's ultimate, Valda Cui's ultimate are way too oppressive, with Viper Ning's ultimate having a 5 second stun, and Tianhai's ultimate grabs ""Struggle"" key press taking too long, you'd be dead by the time the CC is over.

A lot to be worked on but overall great game since it's new.
"
5867,"very good game, but need to skill up"
5868,"fun game great to play  with friends, not beginner friendly though fair warning"
5869,<3
5870,Great game and the skill gap is not to big!
5871,"Great and really fun game with excellent combat system, Maybe one of the best battle royale game I've ever played beside Apex Legends !"
5872,"Started the game
lost to massive bazoinkas
went to toilet
lost again
10/10
"
5873,is good ya!
5874,"its a pretty decent game, different from other battle royale games ive played before, they should definetily bring a duos mode and maybe something else to offer, maybe a bigger map, like expanding the map to make it big enough where players feel they can come back and earn good rewards for playing it, dont get me wrong there are many rewards that make the game interesting but I feel the battle pass is too expensive, besides having to pay for a game that would be free elsewhere, thats why a lot of games in this genre got pretty big, just things to take into consideration..."
5875,"takes time to get good but is so satisfying when you get better. i think the controls feel a bit clunky but once you get the hang of it and learning the different weapons, it gets better. i love how the gameplay forces you to be aggressive instead of people camping and picking you off in fps games."
5876,"fun game
"
5877,Fun melee combat and fluid movement. The game is only held back by limited game modes and the occasional laggy player. Low point of entry that has a nice gradual learning curve and a high skill ceiling. If you are a fan of combos in action or fighting games then I can imagine you would really enjoy this game. Also everything you buy in game is purely for cosmetic purposes. You can absolutely pay the money to play and never spend another dime on the game. I would recommend getting the game ASAP as many are still learning and the servers are very populated as it stands.
5878,Yoto hime booba
5879,"Love this game so much. Hope it continues to grow. <3
I am eager to see where development leads this beauty.
"
5880,Yes
5881,"ty 4 the game, awesome"
5882,"Biggest issue in short: 
Due lack of region lock/ping lock, or vpn usage by people, there are high ping players which ruin the game, because you just can't hit them...."
5883,"Addicting, already good and can only get better. Hope they'll work on the counter/parry mechanic to make smoother though... But mostly I love it!"
5884,Terrible game. Everyone just spams the longsword charge attack which already does the most damage of any weapon in the game. It has a range longer than any ranged weapon. Takes no skill at all. they need to nerf the longsword or remove it completely. Not playing this game again till they fix it
5885,very nice
5886,very fun
5887,fun
5888,Ngl this game made me save up for a better pc
5889,Youtou Hime - best waifu
5890,Great
5891,"This game got that many positive reviews? Unbelieveable, this game is OK but no one talking about the BOT count? How basically every single lobby has a +50% AI count? Even throughout the higher ranks? PvE rather than PvP."
5892,Fun and addictive. Though has a high skill curve.
5893,"Probably the most fun Battle Royale game on the market.
Too mad its ruined by the entirety of mainland china VPNing to the NA servers making it a 50/50 chance of fighting against lag so bad they might as well be hacking.
This game will go the way of PUBG if region locking or ping restrictions aren't added, which is a shame."
5894,"Games developers basically just laugh off the ping issues within the player base. Joined their discord and asked why servers weren't region locked and they said it would be silly because they'd ""lose Players"" which doesn't even make sense. I then continued on with the statement of saying that made no sense and they replied with SEA players want to play with NA people so it would ruin the fundamentals of the game... WHAT?!?! So I guess letting SEA players into NA server where the ping is such a huge difference where when you go to hit or grapple them it doesnt even register and you get stun locked because somehow they ended up behind you in a rather of mere seconds. You can even see that the servers get ping related issues due to these players joining..."
5895,"Even though the monetization is tough, the game still is full of really fun fast pace melee combat. Its something they can keep improving on, and if they keep the community strong and pushing out content regularly then I think even with the hefty micro transactions its worth it. If you get the game just realize that micro transactions are something your signing up for since it is a game based in the asian market. However, despite that, there is still alot here."
5896,this is hot and very good!
5897,"amazingly difficult
"
5898,Its a solid game. honestly have nothing really bad to say about it other than I am kinda bad.
5899,yes
5900,Fun combat
5901,Good game.
5902,"Pros:
One of the most tactical battle royales out there
Customization
Battle mechanics
Cons:
Servers are veryyyyy bad sometimes we need more over the world, EU,ASIA,UK,USA, i think they have those listings, but u need to be close to the real in game servers to get good connection, so work on that.
Frame drops/Optimazation, now this is a very huge part of the game for me, i would right now have a lottttt more hours, but sometimes the frame drops/ lags are so bad i cant even play it, whats worse sometime the frame drops are gone for 1 day then the next day they come back.
Conclusion:
The game has it's core structure figured out, it is a innovating type of battle royale in some aspects, like a previous battle royale that came out a few years ago, so with that ground layed out, they just need to fix some pot holes on it and the game should be one of the best games on steam :)"
5903,good
5904,"nice melee fights, but small community"

5909,Best BR game ever
5910,so cool !
5911,GG
5912,"I don't play a ton of Battle Royales. I played PUBG before release for about 87 hrs and I've played a few dozen hours of Apex between the EGS and Steam. I like fighters and Sekiro. Naraka: Bloodpoint Combines all three of Battle Royales, fighting games, and Sekiro into one. The result is an extremely fun and unique take on the (stale) BR genre. It's very fast-paced and has a steep learning curve. I've played 18 hours as of writing and I've just started to feel truly comfortable with the movement. It takes a lot of getting used to. I HIGHLY recommend checking out guides on how to optimize movement and general weapon/loot/strategy guides as well if you want to succeed. 

You'll go in blind, like me, and you'll win your first match, like me. As games go on more and more bots will be replaced by much more difficult human players. They will kick your butt, and a lot of people, I'd imagine, get discouraged from getting stomped when this happens. Once you get the hang of it, though, the plays you can make grappling from enemy to enemy as you finish them off after a melee involving 5+ people will make it all worthwhile. Highly recommend."
5913,"Ping lock China players. Vpn Laggers faze through attacks for a while in rank and its annoying but normal name people combat is pretty good and fun.
Game is pretty good though."
5914,Gave me some fun. It will be more fun if ever I persuaded my friends to play this game with me. haha
5915,"The game is almost like pubg, fortnite and league of legends mixed. Love the arts."
5916,Balance!
5917,the ping is fucking trash
5918,best battle royal
5919,It's fun with extreme fun system combat!
5920,mmm... booba...
5921,"this game sucks, playability actually is interesting but it keeps crashing. I have a 1080gti and i can believe it takes a lot to load even with low graphics. I actually thought that after a few updates it will get better but it actually got worse. I got frustrated that on every team fight everything is lagged"
5922,"One of the most fun arena games I've ever played. There's a fun little rock-paper-scissors mechanic to the melee interactions, and there's also lots of little things you can add to your hero that can give you different strategies. Ranged is ok, it does chip damage. You can absolutely get kills with ranged but if you stand there trying to chip someone down you're going to get grappled then juggled by an enemy. It makes the game super exciting! Plus the grappling hooks let you fly around like Spiderman! One of the only games that has filled that old Tribes 2 niche in my gaming heart for movement."
5923,It is fun and requires alot of skill and the visuals are amazing
5924,"Very fun. If i had 1 suggestion it would be to add more content and game modes, maybe a capture the flag or 1v1 arena or 12v12 capture the zone and hold. if not this will get boring like fortnite, royal, after royal, after royal.....after......royal."
5925,Need OCE server
5926,this game is chinese based they opened up servers in eu na sea these servers are infested with chinese vpn abusers and the devs for the game do nothing to fix the issues but would rather focus on buffs/nerf and cosmetics in the first 3 weeks of the game.the game has so many bugs and typos from bad translation its pathetic really i would never recomend this game to anyone! THIS GAME IS DESTINED TO FAIL.!
5927,very fun
5928,"LETSS GO 
"
5929,Amazing game. must buy for dark souls pvp fans!!
5930,it is good
5931,Fun game. Cool combat. It has great potential. No server limitation is really bad. Constantly having asian IP players in NA is horrible. their high ping makes it that they will always win. DO not buy until it's fixed.
5932,good game
5933,Sh1t game if you wan't to buy the game just to play against china players using vpn to play in na server and ping abuse be my guess. Half your attacks will not register and you wont be able to counter because latency is a big issue in this game. I will have 50 ms and still lose to someone playing from china using vpn with 300+ ping and still lose and why? All because my hit will not register because in my screen they're right in front of me but due to them using vpn and playing from china with 300+ ping they're able to hit and counter all my hits while i can't do anything. Game peaked 100k players on launch day and with in 3 week they lost 75% player base due to this latency problem and due to china player invading na server ruining a good experience for na players. Until they ping lock or solve this issue i don't advise anyone to buy this game.
5934,"Game is hard, but greatly satisfying when you put the time in. Combat is super dynamic, some noregs here and there and players abusing high ping. Overall really good game."
5935,LIKE IT
5936,"Great game, high skill cap."
5937,"Love it. So many playstyles, character customizations and weapons to choose from, depending what you like the best. I hope more of my friends purchase this so we could learn it together. ^^"
5938,Super love the graphics and gameplay
5939,"So you want to play this game? heh, don't even bother, you're gonna get so mad after a couple of hours.

Let me tell you why.

Autoaim on hooks, so you will be constantly hooked onto. especially in trios, you're alone against 2 or 3? you're dead in 4seconds, constantly stun locked. Dodge doesnt work, and parry works sometimes but still trash (can only use it when they charge an attack). So if there is 2 on you and you can't escape, just end game and join que again.

Autoaim on some weapons, you dont even have to be good at the game, just spam combos, or greater yet, get a great sword, jump and slam your sword on your opponent, you can continue this combo untill they are dead, and you will nearly allways autoaim onto them. 

There are spells and powers unique to the characters, there are some thats just pointless to play in Solo and is trash to play in trios. So if you find a character you like, you might have choosen the wrong character for the meta.

All in all, i enjoyed the game when it first came out, but now that everyone is doing the meta by abusing game mechanics (slide jump to be faster or charge attack followed by dodge to get further, stunlocking with broken weapons with traits) I've felt that this game is not enjoyable anymore. So if you like this kind of annoyance, go ahead."
5940,"This game is the best battle royale out there, hands down."
5941,"The Game play is pretty good, the only down side is the item ui when pickup"
5942,"Very mixed feelings.
Love the game but the parry system barely works and favours high ping players.
Game is full of asian players which have had the asian version of the game for a while now so every match is full of high ping, high performance players which wreck everything.
Top of every ranking is held by these asian players, including regional rankings, which sucks.
You can literally choose any region\city to use as your region, which results in even the most remote cities having these asian players as top 3.

Would highly recommend the game, once they implement ping\region lock."
5943,"Good game 
"
5944,worth it game is amazing and needs more exposure to break ground more. its that good compared to others in its shadow
5945,"Pretty good game. At first there were a bunch of bots but I think thats because I was in the early noob ranks. Now that I'm in silver I feel like everyone I run into is a actual alive person. Regardless though I still triumph, my 25% solo win rate is a testament to that."

Still if you want to play this game just try stick with only solo or duo if you don't have a full squad just so that you don't want to quit because of the ""way to smart team of ning, valda, tianhai format""."

Lame pun aside the game is great! combat feels great, grappling hook around feels awesome, and on SEA server everything works fine. No lag or queue issues, usually match found within 30ish sec waiting time (the longest queue time i had was 2 minute-ish). 

overall a 10/10 game, greatly recommended !"

5977,ดีมากครับ โมเดลลามกดี
5978,Very nice Battle Royal Game.
5979,Nobody is going to see this comment so i will say i like men.
5980,This game really does take mad skills to win. At first I thought man people are just going to w key and smash their mouse clicks but I was wrong. The skill gap between players that just play and smash their mouse clicks and players that actually practice is crazy. The people that complain about how hard the game is just don't really put in the work to practice and get their ass beat to get better. To get good at a game you need to take L's. Shit till this day after practicing for hours in bloodbath I still get my ass beat but that's the thing that makes it fun. The game is a real challenge and really requires your time so you can advance as a player. I really recommend those who like a challenge and ain't no bitch to play this game.
5981,"I normally don't play Battle Royals.. as I suck at first person/third person shooter games. But this is an exception.. My first impressinon was horrible though due to my PC having only 8 gb of ram. I had to upgrade to play this.. and Man this is a fun Wuxia-theme game . 
8.5/10 truely recommend for those who just want to have some wuxia fun."

5987,yes
5988,"I was actually super excited for this game and was encouraged by the character customization. However the parkour is nothing like advertised and the gameplay is awful when it works. The fight animations were overlayed and looked horrible. It also ran like garbage, I have an RTX 3090 and I couldnt get more than 40fps. Not to mention if you didnt go through the graphics settings the game auto optimizes and its the worst. The only reason the game is getting good reviews is because the female characters have jiggle physics. If you arent a horndog dont get this game."

6000,the server is shit

6002,love this game bruh
6003,"The game is a fast paced BR with fighting game mechanics, the characters and different weapons offer variety and overall high skill ceiling. While the core idea is very fun, the garbage netcode and dishonest developers completely ruined my experience.

[b]The netcode is garbage.[/b]

Half of the time the parry mechanic (which is extremely important) won't work for you and you will die even when you guessed correctly, your hits won't register, people you can't even see will stunlock you to death, etc. These situations are way too common and impossible to ignore.

People with extremely high ping get benefited from it and of course the Chinese have been taking advantage of this. These nerds plague every server and are unstoppable.

[b]Hackers left and right. [/b]

Macros, auto parry, teleport, lag switch, you name it. It is way too common to encounter some scumbag that will obliterate your ass without any chance of fighting back.

[b]The devs are dishonest [/b]

They promised a south american server which they removed on launch without any warning succesfully scamming the entire region. They offered a ""node"" meaning if there are enough players queued on SA we will play in Brasil, but a month later after release it is literally impossible to play on this ""node"" (I wouldn't be surprised if these people totally removed this without telling the community) and you are forced to play on the NA server.


I love the game but considering the things I mentioned I highly recommend you to turn around and walk away."

6012,good
6013,So i don't really ever write a review because i feel like it would be lost in the mix of review. However with this game if i can at least get one person to play this then i've done my job.I truly think that fortnite and apex was made so the idea of a sword/gun Battle royal came to mind.Never got into fortnite didn't really get it.Even thou all the hype behind it was real and apex i played a little longer still didn't keep me playing longer then level nine. This game i play all the time and its extremely fun plenty of unlocks and every game feels different. I am never bored playing it. So please support this game for the life span of the game its needs to keep going.Thank you
6014,"I usually don't enjoy battle arena games much because most of them are really the same, but with this game I did not feel that. I enjoyed the way the fighting is in the game and I actually got captivated enough to play more. Yes I only played for 3 hours but that was in one go, I am looking forward for future updates to see what will happen with the game."
6015,Game isn't bad at all but characters are unbalanced. The fact that you meet on Europe servers so many Chinese players with high ping that are jumping from place to place is awful. And it makes it sometimes unplayable..Don't get me wrong the game is fun especially with friends but it needs a lot of polishing to be actually good. But if you are looking for a different BR game then it's surely worth a try :)
6016,I like the competitive nature of the game's melee fighting and the open world fighting battle royale. Seems pretty balanced for how new the game is. You fight mostly bots in the beginning and as you rank up higher you start fighting more and more other players who are way more skilled.

However, major warning on the BS locked Scandal.
I went to China and during my trip I bought this game alone with the in game currency.

Now that I am back in Canada, when I login  I just noticed all my progression and my in game currency are locked and I have no access to my currency and contents anymore. The game simply prohibit your access to Chinese servers and it didn't even bother to transfer your data, just reset your own game to zero.

THIS IS FRAUD. There is no warning on the steam page about this.

The Customer service is also a joke. ""We understand your feeling but there is nothing we can do"" is all they are saying.

So, would you buy a game that steals your money and then locked your content? 

What a BS customer experience."
6031,hopefully itll go free to play soon so more people play and comes out on ps5 and is a big hit. matchmaking is terrible with long queue times and youre put up against top teir players after your first few games. also take away server options. 50% of the time im killed by somenameicantread(AS).

6033,nice

6039,"Game was alright, the ping was super bad, you're always against teamming, and a lot of asia players that use lag to their advantage. I played the game normally and got banned for using MSI afterburner and Core temps. Those who are unfamiliar with the apps; they are used to display your temperature on your CPU and GPU. Due to these two applications you will get BANNED because their ""anti-cheat"" software recognize it as a third party program to get an advantage over other players.. Sadly thats just how it is. Reaching out to the dev team doesn't matter, you will always get an automated message and if you are banned thats it. There are still plenty of players who still team in solos and many still are using hacks to reset their attack, and still not banned. Oh wells, overall, game is okay, pvp is cool and unique but unless they get a new dev team actually going to do their job on cracking down actual cheats happening, the game is not worth playing."
6040,"Great visuals, smooth combat mechanics, perfect training for killing Titans, especially when you see that monk goes berserk."
6041,"NARAKA SimpPoint

CONS:
1.Pay 2 Win as Fxxk.
2.Gready as Fxxk developer.
3.A Chinese developer discriminate against Chinese and Asian...?! It must just being in 2021.

PRO:
1.SIMP's heaven and I'm such a wreched SIMP. So I'm happy.
2.All hail YoutouHime."
6042,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Good luck to you if you reach Gold tho..."
6043,The game has done nothing to improve the game and wrongfully will ban you if you run any programs while the game is running
6044,NICE MOUNTAIN VIEW
6045,Really sorry that I've got this game.
6046,"10/10 Would recommend, low key find playing by myself boring in games like these but because there is a solo mode I have put in many more hours :D"
6047,"The developers of this game promised so much and have delivered less than nothing but things to throw more money at. If you weren't already racist against the Chinese, this will certainly further tarnish their reputation in your mind (or lack-thereof). I used to be really in to this community, until it became abundantly clear that they only care about players from China, if that. Fuck this developer, and fuck this game."
6048,"Badass!
"
6049,"Soooooo good, high skill gap. Not for noobs only buy if you want to actually put effort in and grind. Has everything. Ranked, Customs, customisation, battlepass, updates the lot."
6050,"This game is decent and the visual is pretty. It has fun combat mechanisms, anime big badonkers, somewhat unique art style (at least for me), and cool cosmetics. Not that bad but not that great either, just in between."
6051,Fun game
6052,This game is a blast!
6053,GOOD
6054,"Gameplay is fun, having played the beta's for this game and sinking 200+ hours into the final release....

BUT FIX THE PING ISSUE AND CHINESE PLAYERS ON OTHER SERVERS.
It ruins the entire game experience. after playing all the Beta's of this game had really high expectations and I'm feeling let down each day I play this game.
Your attacks will not hit high ping Chinese players/players who swap servers to play on yours because they'll have an advantage. If this is not fixed then the game will die.
The future is not bright for this game as all the negative reviews are about PING/server swap players.
REGION LOCK the game or ping lock. 
It appears the developers don't care about the game and will only care about taking your money.
There is some need for reworking certain weapons/heroes too, but I think this isn't the highest priority as fixing the high ping issues and terrible decision to not region lock the servers. there's even comments on cheating players or players using autoparry giving even more advantage.

TLDR; 
Region lock is a must, and developers don't care about fixing issues this early into release, then I can't recommend this game."

6056,Pretty good game.
6057,Good game bruh!
6058,ok
6059,"Challenging but fun Melee Battle Royale. Definitely needs some practice to be proficient, but worth the investment,

Update: This game has a really solid core, but until they do a weapons and ultimates Balance pass I'm probably going to have to put this down. Tian's Monster form is overpowered, and is a huge crutch for bad plays, especially combined with his ultimate, and when you have 3 of them on the enemy team it is just stupidly oppressive. Not to mention the greatsword needs a nerf.

DEVS: PLEASE DEAR GOD BALANCE THIS GAME. You have a great concept but you really need the combat to feel fair

2nd Update: This game is just as unbalanced as ever, dont waste your time or money. Play BloodHunt instead if you want an actually good third person BR that is Free to play rather than play $20 (or any dollars) on this mess."
6060,"Hybrid Battle Royal with melee and range. 
Swinging around like spiderman. 
Decent combat system. 
Fast paced. 
Great artwork. 
Fun to play with friends and solo."

6062,yes
6063,开宝箱机制真的sb，网易吃香太难看了。给个差评。 希望网易不要以手游的开箱机制来设计端游
6064,better than other BR games
6065,"Need to fix matchmaking so you don't get people from fucking halfway across the world in your 3's teams
Need to fix the grapple stun lock spam shit
Need to fix Greatswords and Spears, they're absolutely broken
Need to rebalance the heros, some of em are just not optimal to play with
as it is right now, its not worth the 20 dollars, youll find yourself dying to stuff out of your control more often than not
However, after some more playing, I can say it is less frustrating playing in solo queues, or if you're just playing quick match (non-ranked)

Edit; Eh, its alright, still kinda a clusterfuck unless you have a lot of time to learn the mechs, but more fun now after a few quality of life patches and updates"
6066,"The melee combat system is spot on. I wish for the DEVS to fully do something about the security of the game against those who try to Hack/Cheat.

6085,fun
6086,"When the game came out I did not want to listen to all the negative reviews but still held off buying the game to see how it would evolve.
The reviews got better and I decided to buy the cheapest edition just to try it out.
The developers said bot matches where intended because they wanted people to learn the game before hopping into a pool of real players.

Which from that stand point is understandable and actually quiet a smart mechanic.
But now here it comes, later on in game you start to realize that the game is so badly optimized that when you do finally start to encounter other people, half your counters get ignored and half your attacks just miss, even when you lock into the target and are close.

So instead of playing a high skill game which I was hoping for with tactical dashing,sliding,blocking and melee attacking.
It sadly becomes a game where its sometimes easier to spam attacks and blocks because with luck you might actually hit and block, then to actually plan them but because the latency and the bad optimization half of your attacks miss.

Bots don't have a latency, so earlier in the game you don't realize this because you are fighting against bots.
By the time you are not the refund policy ended because of play time and you are stuck with a game with pretty much one of the worst hit registration I have ever encountered.

On a different note, if the game did not have those hit registration issues, it is actually a quiet enjoyable game and a big welcome for the battle royal genre"
6087,The combat is really fun. Kind of fighting game esque but not as hard as most 2d fighters making the barrier for entry a lot lower. A little bit of practice in the training area goes a long way in this game. I'm having a lot  of fun with it and planning on dropping a lot more hours.

1. Ranked mode, players rank 2500-2800 matching with player rank 3500 - 4100 - How can they win? very absurd because of the rating mode.
2. The player exits the match before the last 5 seconds, still unharmed? And the result, the remaining 2 players have to survive while all other teams are 3 people, the top 5 results still deduct 5 points? - Trash game.
3. After the update, some cases can't see teammates' names, how can you fight when you can't see the other 2 teammates?
4. Bad UI/UX, even hard to use. What is the number 3 key for? Why not 12 (Weapon) 34 (Heal, Amor) ? What is number 3 ?
5. Please delete my account and give me my Steam refund back, I feel this game is really bad, lots of Bugs and we don't see the publisher fix it, bad and very bad."

6116,I'd refund this game if I could... once you get out of the shitter ELO and start to see how broken somethings are its becomes a shit show.
6117,REALLY good battle royale style game. I absolutely love the melee aspect of it too. Would recommend this game to any person that loves online fighting games.
6118,This game could have been great. They have some key fixes they need to address before I attempt to play this again. mainly the VPN invaders and Personally I did not feel a gradual skill increase. it goes from 0 to 100.
6119,This game was really good but now Chinese japanese players comes to Eu servers and this game makes not more fun !
6120,"Pay for game, still have to pay for cosmetics. Anyone who say you can play the game without cosmetics, screw you.

6134,very hard game but fun :D
6135,bets game out rn
6136,"Before i even start the review i need to emphasise how big of a problem Chinese ping abusing is on the NA server and how i cannot recommend this game until the server issue is fixed. play a bloodbath game? you're the only one from NA in the match. the rest are all 500+ ping people from china you cant hit that just abuse the system for free wins, it is incredibly frustrating and i wish the devs would do something about it. please region lock servers!!!!! the game is incredibly fun to play when you're against people on an even playing field and i really do have high hopes for this game. it has amazing potential, but that being said. If you're looking for a unique battle royale experience with a high skill ceiling than this is the game for you. the combat is very fluid and allows for some pretty creative combos via animation cancelling. While it does take more than a few matches to begin understanding the combat. it's very fun and entertaining whether alone or with friends. if they region lock servers than its 10/10 worth the $30 price tag"
6137,"Go Big Sword! Damage, Damage, Damage, and has less chance to miss due to high ping enemies...

PROS:

 -Good Graphics
 -Action Combat
 -Need to be good at timing attacks/parry/dodge/counter/etc...
 -Swift movement/good mobility
 -Can play with 3 friends in the same party
 -Have roles: DPS, Healer/Supp, CC heroes, and etc...

CONS:

 -Sometimes if attacks lands but somehow the system dont recognizes the damage/hit (im with 29ms ping)
 -Placed with random trash teammates (recommend to find friends and play as a team or just go SOLO)
 -Need to place people within the same ranks during rank matches(how come im silver with bronzes as teammates against others who are platinum or higher)
 
OVERALL:
 -Need good PC
 -Make a team, if people sucks, GO SOLO!
 -GET GOOD
 -Go into training room and practice combos/parry/etc...
 -HAVE GOOD PING (60ms below) please..."
6138,"Yeah lets add more heroes and ignore the fact that there's no region lock making the game unplayable, every lobby is Chinese servers these devs are fucking retarded"
6139,"To preface: I am not that big of a fan of Battle Royales, however this game has changed that for me, at least in the form of this Melee style BR.

If you are fan of Fighting Games I believe you will enjoy this game. It has Modes that aren't focused on the BR, rather a big ol free-for-all that will satisfy people who don't always want to be in a drawn out experience. 

Gameplay: Quite complex, like any fighting game would be. If you have put in some time with such titles as For Honor, then this game will have that familiar feel. Yes you can just spam Left Mouse Button and get some combos in, but the real combos come from cancels, uppercuts and grapples tools, etc.

You may need to do some training to get it down but, to me, it's not too intensive comparatively.

The game isn't easy but for me it is addictive and satisfying. 

Characters/Champions: They are all quite fun, some are more upfront with their apparent value while others may be more of a niche. Either way I think folks will find their class and hero. 

Another awesome thing that I haven't seen in any other BR/hero focused games is that you can customize the features of pretty much any character in the same sense of a MMO. You will be able to make Heroes your own even if you don't buy any skins. You can make Shrek if you wanted! 

Shop: The prices could be a little much for a game that you have to pay to play, in my opinion. However, you can skip this totally and not feel too bad from it, that is unless you are obsessed with skins of all sorts and emotes. 

Developers: They are quite responsive with balance and listening to the community for the most part. Not perfect but by all means very good when juxtaposed with other devs today. 

All-in-all: Fun, populated, addicting and challenging. Made a believer out of someone who doesn't like BRs."
6140,This is the best battle royal game so far. Buy it have fun!
6141,"Badly needs a Ping cap or a net code that AGGRESSIVELY supports the players playing in their region.
END THE ZERG.    

Its a good game with a ton of learning/skill but it all the goes out the window when there is 300 ping goobers running around.

[played a few more days gonna uninstall until we get some kind of help with all the pingers.]"
6142,nice game
6143,GOOD GAME
6144,it good
6145,Worth every penny :D
6146,Assassin's Creed and For Honor had a social call with a Chinese grappling hook. 8/10
6147,"Naraka is a fresh take on the BR genre with interesting mechanics, smooth gameplay and diverse styles of play.

Pro's:
- Combo-orientated combat rewards you for learning
- Combat feels fast and fun, even when you don't know how to combo
- Grapple hook is fun as hell!
- lots of different weapons and characters opening up diverse team comps and fights
- Kills feel very, VERY good.
- Incredibly rewarding to learn a combo
- Cool cosmetics
- Waifu's-a-plenty


Cons:
- Lots of variety is nice, but there are balance issues making it so you only tend to see 1-2 different weapons in each fight, the main example being the long sword.
- Particularly in 3's, Grapple hook spam means 0 counterplay death
- Getting 2v1'ed/3v1'ed usually ends in you dying without touching the floor
- Long sword hold attacks have enormous hitbox's and countering them doesn't take their weapon away
- players joining from other servers will often hit you without being near you
- in need of some sort of rage/combo break mechanic to get you out of Xv1 unmovable, unbreakable combos
- ranged weapons feel underwhelming in damage considering they are hard to hit with and can be blocked on accident.
- Grapple autolock needs to be removed from the game before its a healthy mechanic
- Very very high skill ceiling makes it hard for new players to compete at all


All in all, i definitely recommend playing Naraka. I've enjoyed every minute playing, but there are definitely issues that need to be solved before it becomes amazing. Let's hope they keep our input in mind while making balance changes!"
6148,Its a good game but the access from Chinese players and hacking protection needs to be fixed.
6149,pog
6150,will recommend once asians are kept from na/eu
6151,Yotohime cute.
6152,pp
6153,"If you like Asian MMO-style heroes, extensive character customization, action combat, melee weapons and extreme mobility, you will love this one. Despite the system requirements, the game is quite forgiving and well optimized, just make sure to choose the appropriate server to play on, for optimal ping.
I'm not hyped for battle royal type games, but I have made an exception for this. I was instantly hooked(pun intended) the moment I entered this game world. It's one of those easy to learn, hard to master experiences.
Understand sword play, learn to use focus and time your counter, and you will be golden. The price is also quite good, it's some of the best 20 Euros I ever spent on a game. I play it every day, even if only 2 matches, that's how much I like it."
6154,"Skill based combat, Parries, dodges, combos, out plays, and no one-shots!"
6155,"After playing around 95 hours , i have decided to uninstall the game.

* I have a good internet connection and play the game on RTX 2060 *

Don't get me wrong..this game is fun and challenging.

But once i crossed my level above 45 and tidal(seasonal) level above 60, I started to notice even though the server selection in login screen shows my optimum region's ping level in 40s, While playing the game, ping level will be indeed in 40s, That is till you start fighting with an enemy or vice versa , Ping raises to 150s and i start having micro stutters during the fight. It completely ruins the gaming experience. i have tweaked my settings to low configuration, But no use.

if they can eliminate/reduce these ping issues and implement some kind of ping cap system in future patches, then i am willing to reinstall it again."
6156,I LOVE IT!

fun but shit in too many areas for a positive review!

EDIT: after 300 in game hours more i can say its even worse than before stay away from this chinese scam game. The only game i've seen this badly optimized and with this many latency issues. Typical asian incompetent devs. Random fps drops making it impossible to play and downright stupid with too many issues to list fuck this game and the devs"

Every single mechanic in the game (season passes,lootboxes, cosmetics, new characters) is handled like in free games like League - you spend. The upfront price gets you nothing (the first new character is pay to unlock, no free currency worth the purchase price either). The balance is shit and the servers aren't any good either. Don't get me started on the cosmetic rates and prices.
This game will be F2P soon for sure, the price right now is just a cashgrab. Just wait if you want to try it out.
Can't recommend spending on this."

6178,"Really fun BR, it has a great twist with abilities and the weaponry used in combat.
Love the break from just guns br, even though it has its 1 to 3 types of gun.
Really wish they had a South African/African server because there's one con of the game being high latency , blocking the attack or dodging it, you struggle to break away from the attacks"
6179,Is the game fun? YES! Are there problems? YES! Are the devs working on the problems? I HAVE NO IDEA! Devs don't really seem to listen to the MAJORITY of the community and seems to only really listen to data from their China based players and the Chinese community. The 2 patches we've had have not fixed major issues (Like how OP LS is from launch and how parry is inconsistent.... and forget about demanding ping lock cause they won't). But aside from the short comings from the dev team... it's a fun game and I am sure it'll get better over time. 7/10
6180,"good concept, good gameplay, but need further development, i.e. when cleared the game as the winner, its lack of some reward, need more upgrade there"

6185,"I've got 70 hours into this game at the time of writing this. While this games combat is extremely rewarding at times, I don't see this game surviving in the west without some sort or region/ping locking. In a fighting game combat comes down to frames and this is ruined when you allow players from the other-side of the world to play on servers they shouldn't be playing on.

Other than that, the hero's all have unique gameplay styles and abilities which makes learning them a blast. The weapon combos are badass and the movement in this game, while sometimes wonky, is pretty damn cool.

 I would recommend this game as long as people understand that there is no region lock and you're most likely going to be missing counters due to the other players ridiculous ping. However, until they fix that I can't give this a thumbs up."
6186,One of the best battle royale game ever created... highly recommended to play with friends! Gameplay may be a little bit complex but it is very fun to play...

6194,"The game is fun don't get me wrong. I enjoy the play style and how the game works, but when the NA servers are overrun by Chinese and the occasional cheater its hard to want to keep playing. with a game so based on timing counters and dodges to try and survive and turn a fight around its pretty damn hard against people with 200+ ping. Sure the game will show you that someone is lagging by a red signal near them but then proceeds to do absolutely nothing about it. The game seriously needs to be region locked or at least ping locked to prevent this kind of crap."
6195,good game
6196,"Very cool concept, combat makes you feel like a anime character and movement is solid. HIGH SKILL CEILING, and you will need to play a lot to compete with other players."
6197,"As much as I want to enjoy this game, the imbalance of it all, the high ping abusing players, the sometimes great, sometimes bad performance really just detracts from it all. I tried playing ranked since I read a lot that it's better than quick play, but I'm still running into players WAY above my skill level that just perma juggle me like no one's business. (I don't mean spammers, I mean players who clearly know how to perfectly delay attacks, do dodge cancels to perfection and constantly are grappling onto me). 

Unless you REALLY love this style game and don't mind going against poorly matched lobbies, I sadly cannot recommend it in its current state."

6199,"Having fun with it so far. It's my first battle royale game, and to be honest I kind of prefer the death match mode, but there's a lot of customization and potential for more content in the future."
6200,"*EDIT*

Decided to add more to this since i have more hours.

Pros:
-Combat
-Characters
-Character customization
-Weapons in game thus far all are really fun to use aside from new on release weapons being a bit unbalanced at first but generally gets hot fixed pretty quick
-Frequent balance patches
-Dragon used as a sort of red-zone/airstrike is visually pretty cool and unique
-Solos, Duos, Trios Que so you don't have to be stuck with randoms if you don't want that
-Movement ""for the most part"" this one is more of a pro con as if feels go to move but can feel awful to climb and scale rush at times when you're in combat, sometimes the parkour decides to flat out not work and you can get stuck on terrain.

Cons:
-Optimization for hard drives is abysmal you NEED an SSD to play this game, i personally have no issues since i have one but friends who have attempted to play this on hard drivers have constant stutters and frame drops
-The game is not region locked and Chinese players abuse high ping to their advantage being almost untouchable a lot of the time due to latency. If you're a casual player you won't have this issue in normal matches but if you want to dip your toes into ranked especially at plat plus it is a lot of high ping abusers.


Overall opinion:

For $20 i feel like you get a lot of value out of this but also would probably benefit more in NA if it went free to play, i personally enjoy the combat twist on this and the movement of it as i am personally over battle royals but this game is a fresh twist on it and feels more like an arena fighter than anything else to me just on a giant map. Also this game is definitely an easy to pick up difficult to master type of game, there are really good newbie guides on YouTube that id recommend for you to watch if you plan on getting into ranked. Overtime you will eventually be matched with better players so if you're stubborn and refuse to learn the mechanics of the game it will become very frustrating to play"
6201,"Exciting and artistic battle royale game. The combat is a mix of ranged and melee, with a focus on melee combat. Between the different weapon combos, ranged aiming, movement techniques, and parrying, this game has a high skill cap. 

There are a few different game modes with more coming. You can currently play survival mode (ranked and unranked) with the option of playing solo or on a team of three, and you can play a bloodbath mode, which is basically a timed free for all in a more confined space.

Not only are the graphics beautiful, you can also customize most of the heroes quite generously. Each hero has a skill and an ultimate unique to them that adds another element to the combat system. The game comes with the same kind of battlepass and in game store that're often seen with similar games, though I find that the game is quite generous in some cosmetics without additional payment.

Overall, just a great game that takes a somewhat unique approach to the battle royale genre"
6202,"very interesting game

6207,"5/10.

1) I hate battle royale games. With a passion. All of them. Never played them, never wanted to play them.
2) In the last few years I could not find any game that could keep me occupied for more than a few hours or days

This game, that I never heard of and heard no hype about whatsoever, this is my personal favourite. My GOTY. I cannot even describe how fun it is and even though I pre-ordered New World as well, I have a feeling I will be stuck with Naraka for a really long time.

Why is it 5/10?
1) Chinese players. Everywhere. Literally everywhere. People with high ping, people from the US, people from everywhere apart from EU. If there are dedicated servers I would expect them to be region locked as well as taking care of people with similar ping should play together. I am far from racist, but we all know that Asian people are a whole new level when it comes to gaming. You hardly have a chance against them.

First kill: Chinese person.
Unstoppable: Chinese person.
3867 kill streak: Chinese person.

This is 9 out of 10 times. It gets really annoying sometimes. The other thing is I do not understand why people cannot use their own region where they have their own dedicated ones. Sigh.

2) If you want to play this game properly, SSD is a must have. Even with an SSD I have issues with loading times and loading textures, I cannot imagine what it would be like on an HDD.

3) The player feedback is completely ignored. The game is heading to a devastated stage. Hackers are not dealt with, some weapons are so OP that you have no chance against. People were begging for a dagger nerf because its combo is way too ridiculous and what the dev team did? Boost it even further. Same with some of the characters. Everything has a VERY poor balance.

This was the only game I wanted to compete in, but I stopped playing completely instead. Not going back until all the ridiculous problems are fixed. Such a shame tho as this game has a special place in my heart and feels really bad to see it being so neglected."
6208,Any other early access game I've played had far better optimization than this... Huh? What do you mean this is not early access!?
6209,"I havent had so much fun playing a game by myself in a long time, especially a battle royal.  Using all the swords and combos makes you feel like such a bad-a. If you don't have an ssd, then dont buy this game. This game was the final factor that pushed me into finally getting an ssd. Its soooo worth it."
6210,"VERY good gameplay wish there were duos tho :/
"
6211,"The game feels pretty fun, but it's almost 2022, and when a game doesn't allow you to rebind certain keys, that's a big thumbs down.

If things get changed, and I can actually play using the controls that I want, then this is likely a thumbs up.

"
6212,"A nice fresh take on a Battle royal , melee is so much more satisfying !"
6213,ping lock the game
6214,The only (so far) Chinese-made games that is cherished by the entire world!!!!!
6215,"best game

6216,"10000 hours loading the terrain with 1080 TI 12 GB at the same time after the game finally ""load"" i'm already dead. This game is not optimized at all.

6219,"super, see you in the arena"
6220,"if u love clunky movement and unbalanced champions and weapons, this game is for u"
6221,Fun if u have good connection and are willing to learn the game mechanics. Quite a steep learning curve.
6222,"Eğlenceli ve zevkli. Grafik olarak istenileni karşılıyor ve ""sanırım"" düşük sistemlerde de destekleyeceğini düşünüyorum. Karakter hareketleri olsun, dövüş mekanikleri olsun süper olmasada bir adım altında istenileni veriyor. Oldukça savaşın dönmesinden dolayı, ""oha lan son adammış bunlar"" dedirtiyor insana. Biz üç arkadaş olarak oynadık şu an yeni aldım ve 4 saat oynadım aralıksız o yüzden fiyatına göre oldukça tatlı bir oyun denemenizi tavsiye ederim.

It's fun and enjoyable. Graphically it meets the demands and ""I think"" it will support low systems as well. Whether it's character movements or fighting mechanics, even if it's not super, it gives what you want in one step. Because of the constant battle and constant fighting you don't realize when the game ends. At the end you end up saying ""oh they were the last team/player"" .We played as three friends, now I just bought it and I played it for 4 hours nonstop, so I recommend you to try a very sweet game for its price."
6223,"great
"
6224,fun and challenging
6225,nice game
6226,its a 30 dollar free to play game. i enjoy the game mechanics and the match making has improved greatly. unfortunately i can not recommend this game the base price for what you pay to what you get in the return is not worth the money.
6227,nice game
6228,"Not pay to win game , Takes skills and moves to kill and win games , this game is DOPE !"
6229,"I really want to love this game, but the performance is pathetic... so much stutter and lag at 1440p I just can't find a sweet point to play at. Also you're at a complete disadvantage to any high ping players and there's a lot of them..."
6230,optimization

what do u mean?

"
6246,bezt game eva !!!
6247,This game is very solid and is a unique take on the battle royale genre. The fighter aspects tied in with the survival-of-the-fittest theme a BR brings makes this game rather interesting. Steep learning curve for new players but very rewarding.
6248,Amazing combat. Very well made game
6249,khá là hay
6250,"Any one buying this in Australia or New Zealand forget this title, here is why - plain and simple its just not a fair shake of the sauce bottle, Asian servers Asian players bot riddled games heavy down payments for cosmetics very slow progression on the seasonal pass which unless you can bunker down in grandmas basement on centre link you will get NO where without coughing up a weekly paycheck to get through it. its not all bad though the graphics are nice!"
6251,good
6252,"Game is trash,to much asian abusers"
6253,"its simple. battle royale but the twist is what the game differs other br games. i will not go in the details, just check it out! :)"

6255,good game
6256,good
6257,"how come asia so laggy while sea not? i meant, sea is just south east asia"
6258,"A unique battle royale that takes the tried and true formula, and adds depth and counterplay to one on one combat. At least that's what I hear, I mostly run around stabbing people until someone better than me stabs me to death. But it's fun!"
6259,Fresh new take on Battle Royale. This game have good unpredictability and the skill ceiling is high enough. Melee and Ranged combat are great and delivers good gameplay variety.
6260,"great game, fluid gameplay also love the mechanic and lot of free stuff in the game. I just hoping that we could change gender not just faces but overall is awesome"
6261,Alhamdulillah
6262,"PAY TO PLAY AND PAY TO WIN.

On top of that its not like other battle royals it doesn't focus only on guns, in fact it capitalizes on the fantasy aspect of it in almost the best way possible. The only downside i have with it is how bad it lags makes me think my connection is worst than what it actually is."
6286,Love the game and concept
6287,Its a hard game but if you learn the mechanics it is really fun.

6295,The game is fun and competitive. although there are some issues with server there are times that is it laggy specially when the game is about to start or clashing with more than 6 players.
6296,hayyy
6297,Amazing balance!!!!
6298,"I don't usually enjoy Battle royales very much at all, and I hate fortnite with a passion. This game, while being a BR, does not feel like one very much at all. The combat is very unique with a high skill ceiling. There is a extremely satisfying freedom of movement that I have not seen since the game Gunz. If you are competitive minded, this is a great game. Stay away if you get frustrated easily and don't have a learning mindset."
6299,"Easy to play, hard to master.

6304,"Great Combat, lots of potential and fun to play with friends and decent enough solo. Keep in mind this game is pretty heavy on Competitive Gameplay, so unless that's your thing. I'd wait for a sale maybe? 

Few tweaks here and there, like any other game. Main issue is Ping, so make sure you got a great connection or you will rage from being unable to make split-second decisions/counters."

6309,addictive and u really need real skill in this game hahaha so hard
6310,"Very fun game with different and new mechanics from any other BR. However, I would classify this as a fighting game more than a classic 3rd person shooter.

Your first games are going to be against bots, when you then pass the refundable play time you'll start getting crushed whether you're in normal/casual or ranked. It's a hard game don't expect to get good by only playing 4-5 h. 

Still hyped tho, graphics are hot. Please keep this game alive <3

(nerf spear, thx)"
6311,ill be #1 soon also implement gamepad please smoothly
6312,awesome battle royale
6313,"The combat in this game is fun and real technical but,there is alot of micro-transactions in the game, enough to where the game should have been free. I dont want to feel like a <free to play player> in a game i paid to get into."
6314,ngl one of the most fun games ive played. its hard and i like the combos and movement. only thing i don't like is the tech tree thing kinda like dead by daylight. i dont like it cause im not smart and its confusing. but for real you should buy it.

6321,10/10 game.
6322,"Naraka Bladepoint is loads of fun from the very start. It's like Mortal Kombat, Zelda, and Fortnite had a baby and you get Narake Bladepoint. Fast paced, melee and multi projectile weapons, and loads of fun movement, this game is ready to be enjoyed from day 1.

Have fun!"
6323,"So I wont pretend this game is perfect. The monetization isnt what I would like, and the online play isnt as consistent as I would like. However, despite both of those I keep coming back to this game. 

The raw gameplay is addictive, more so than any other BR I've played, and kills feel so satisfying to rack up, same with the movement. $20 is definitely more than most other battle royales, but the experience as well as the fact that(as of writing this), all the heroes are unlocked just means you only pay for cosmetics. Unlocking new abilities for each hero can only be done through gameplay. 

I understand not wanting to pay the entry fee, but if you have an extra 20 bucks laying around, there's far worse purchases."
6324,"Quick to learn, so much better than your average royale, fast paced and just a bunch of fun. Once you get the hang of it, it feels like you're invincible"
6325,"cool game tbh, love the ""its fun doe"" combos"

6339,Great game so far.
6340,Fun time with friends with hands.
6341,"This game looks really nice, but for me the problem is the map is either too big, or there are too few players. Meeting an enemy is few and far between, the combat is pretty boring and mostly consists of mashing left click faster than the enemy can. I expected a lot more from it"
6342,Hmm
6343,"Doesnt feel like a br, fun game play, lots of mechanics and technical movement to always have room for growth :)
"
6344,"handful matches but seems very solid to me, a fresh take on BR and very polished. abolutely exceeded my expectations. combat is smooth  and movement feels good.

it all boils down to how they want to handle fluff gear, if they greed it or actually lets you get chests through gameplay.

and unless they want it to die they need to limit the latency, servers are full of chinese players exploiting the high latency. hitreg goes bonkers when you meet these players. cant hit or block.

that and a bit overpriced shop for a game that wasnt completely free imo.

5/10 needs latency/region lock or completely reworked hitreg/netcode behaviour because of the swarm of chinese players using a vpn to connect."
6345,"Great game
"
6346,big booba sword ladies
6347,"Game play and combat are ""solid""
Graphic and textures are ""great""
Character design and skills are somewhat awesome

But but but but
This game is like a early access beta game. There is no optimization for various types of PC and various type of connection strength. You need a mega high end PC in order to perform well and at least 20 to 50 pings to have a smooth game play. (I have tried with every possible connection methods, VPN, mobile network, private wifi, public wifi and I have tried to play this game in internet cafe, also with my own PC and my working laptop)

Overall, this game is great for people who are going to play from NASA or Space X with highest technology."
6348,A very fun and immersive game. A great option if you want to get away from other games you normally play often.
6349,"game so good but pls check hack , hack every where"
6350,good game
6351,Combat is great but needs work to be more fluid. Would reccomend to friends. I gifted a copy to one of my friends just to have someone to play with. I think it's fun but it's hard to find a third even in the naraka discord.
6352,"good game, has a nice combat and characters customization is really nice designed !"
6353,good gameplay
6354,"[strike] I really, really want to recommend this game, but I just can't. Not right now. Not with all this game breaking stutters, long frame drops and high ping [/strike]. The fun gameplay and combat mechanics is severely overshadowed by other issues. I already lost count on how many fights were turned against me when the game randomly decides to freeze my game only to come back when I'm already dead. This frustrates me a lot since I really want to enjoy the game, but it seems like the game itself is not letting me do that. Even the open beta ran better than the current build.


Update: It's been a while now since I've last played this game. I came back to after seeing some major updates and I have to say, the fps drops happen way less now. It's still there, but it's got to the point where the game is playable now."
6355,Would recommend
6356,Every fight is a mosh pit of random button presses.

6370,"Naraka is growing on me as potentially having the best BR experience. 
Melee combat and weaponry is diverse, love the movement.

The game just needs region lock implemented, and it will have all my praise."
6371,".
"
6372,"This game is really fun and has a high skill gap. The character customization is a great addition. But the death of this game is it's servers. The game is clearly telling me I'm in a ""NA server"" but that's clearly not the case. Every player I see while in a game either has a [EU] tag or their name is in Chinese. This tells me I'm NOT being queued with people of similar connection and results in lagging and having a poor connection symbol floating above my character at all times or every other player has the symbol and is lagging around me. This is not a connection issue on my end, I have fiber optics internet and have ZERO connection issues with any other game on steam, epic games launcher or battle net, this mean the issue is their servers. Maybe they're are doing this because they don't have enough players and need to pull from other servers, but it's killing their game. In a game this high skilled where milliseconds, precise movement and animation canceling are everything, the quality of the servers mean everything. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone until they fix the server issues, it's a good game, but the connection just becomes a complete disappointment."
6373,"Do you like melee fighting games? Do you like BRs? Then this is a game you should try. 

Overall: The game is very punishing to new players. The graphics are passable for a BR, but the music quality is lacking balance from game start. If you are willing to push through grindy progression and clunky movement, this game will offer you a lot of pride and sense of accomplishment when you are dunking on noobs before they can even realize you attacked. Naraka: Bladepoint might be for some people, but it's not for me.

Gameplay wise, Naraka: Bladepoint has a steep, STEEP learning curve, similar to other fighting based games. If you are good, you're a god. If you aren't, you'll feel like trash. There is no in between. Movement is okayish, but you need to learn it, otherwise it can feel very clunky. You'll get stuck in random places like trying to climb through a window and instead jumping to the rafters for two minutes until you realize that crouching is the only way to drop off a grabbed ledge. The game also combines BR with RPG mechanics where you can choose modified abilities and ultimates as well as augments for your character that can be leveled up to help with loot quality, recovery, and movement abilities in game. This means the more you play, the better your character will be at the game.

Graphics: I'm running the game on Ultra with a 3080 ti, and i can hold a about 100 to 120 fps. The scenery isn't crisp, however, and it kinda reminds me of something I'd see in a new generation WoW map.

Volume: Remember to turn down your volume because this game is LOUD. What? Did you say something? I can't hear you over the ringing in my ears. Seriously though, I had to turn volume down to less than 30% for it to sound normal. Don't start the game with headphones on.

Price: For a game that is as heavily monetized as this is, I'm surprised it's not F2P. A $20 price-tag was shocking when the loot crates only give one item, and they have a season system that costs just over the $10 premium currency amount so that you need to make two premium currency purchases to get the pass. The game offers a good amount of loot crates, at least early on. They are tied to character story progression as well as weapon leveling.

Customization: I do enjoy the depth of customization for each character. You have the ability to modify the characteristics of your character's faces to make some amazingly hilarious designs. I wish they would add the ability to change the color of facial hair too.

6374,Good game just needs more modes for when the main battle mode gets stale. Like a team bloodbath mode /give better rewards for playing regular bloodbath. Other than cultivation quests & weapon leveling there’s no reason to play bloodbath imo .

6376,A very well created game!! KUDOS to the creator!

6383,Awful game that tricks people into waiting until they cant get a refund to get items from the deluxe edition. fuck this trash game
6384,"ADDICTIVE AND FUN!

I highly recommend this game to play with your friends!"
6385,Chinese cheaters and latency abusers are allowed to roam free and destroy this game for everyone and every server.  I believe the developers are probably racists..  The rules seem to only apply to the new players from other regions.  There is almost no way to enjoy the game due to the crazy influx of latency abusers and hackers from AS...  Most new players have been run off and the racists who make and support the game.. they just seem to LOVE their fellow-trash.  Gross.
6386,"This game has so much potential! I never liked the battle royale format in games, but with this game's super deep movement and combat, you have so many options to approach each situation. 

Each weapon type takes time to learn and has it's own combos/play-style (which I love), and the movement feels like a mix of Sekiro and Assassin's Creed with a bit of Breath of the Wild. The movement feels really fluid, and the amount of options are crazy! The characters are also each unique enough to play and feel different as well as offer distinct advantages in fights. On top of that, the character creation options are off the charts, and are comparable to Code Vein, in my eyes.

There is definitely a steep learning curve, but once you get the movement and combat down, this game feels amazing!"

6388,"repetitive, full of tryhards."

6391,"[h1] 8/10 [/h1]

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a really interesting battle royale game. Instead of the current gunfight battle royale, they try to make a game that is mainly based on melee cold weapons(most of the ranged weapons in this game are inferior to the melee weapon) combat to make this game different. The system of this game is very attractive. The graph is not bad, the optimization of the game is fairly plausible. The music on the main menu and the music cut in during the battle are very good, too.

However, we can not ignore the shortcomings of this game. For now, there is only one map in this game, not good for keeping the enthusiasm of the players. For the first 20 or 30 hours, you may find this game is really interesting, however, after you know how this game work, you will find that each round of this game sometime is a little similar. However, I think the developer still could fix it, and I just hope that NetEase would not screw it up.

This game is impressive, but for now maybe still needs to be polished. Unless you want to try this game now, maybe waiting for the patch is a good choice. Which edition of this game you should purchase is also an important thing for you to consider, as many people reflect that the DLC of this game sometimes does not work even if you purchase them."

6393,best game ever.
6394,Really good game for me
6395,"I'm ashamed of not playing this game sooner.

The ajinomoto of battle royales. 10/10 A+++ Supreme.

Even with a kinda small western community, there is enough people to keep playing and devs are adding more and more. If they can make the lock-region thing, it would be fantastic."
6396,honestly super unique
6397,good.
6398,sick game
6399,"So this game can be very fun. The fights are frantic and fast paced and to really play well requires hours of practice and development of your skills with the controls. The problem is that the game allows you to region hop. This means that players from any region can join a server in any region. This results in them having high ping which means that hits will not register and they will teleport around you during a fight. The game currently has an issue with players using high ping to their advantage. 

Go into this game knowing that the higher ones ping the harder they will be to land a hit on during the frantic, fast paced combat. Till they do something to address this I'd stay away if you are looking for competitive PvP. If you don't mind and are just looking for something casual then this should be plenty of fun."

6414,game is great. better then Shadow Arena by far. must fix the match making on trios. solos are great. a must have for a different kind of battle royale gameplay. UPDATE: as of 5-21-22 I had to wait 10 plus minutes to find a match. also for months now every time I play this game I always having drop fps and stuttering at the beginning of gameplay and takes 1 minute to adjust to the map to see the buildings and trees and hopefully don't die and wont make me pick a location and a character on time. fix that problem asap
6415,"Very, very good.  No nonsense."
6416,"EDIT: Having to change this review to negative from positive after many hours of playing.

It's clear the devs aren't interested in making this game better and the player numbers are showing. 

ON TOP of this , the game has the WORST lootbox system in a game, as in mega greedy.
They recently released a new lootbox, requiring you to spend 240+ USD for a CHANCE (since it's only a 0.6% chance) at getting a legendary skin. If you want more than one then there is a chance you can get DUPLICATE legendaries too.

This is worse than any f2p scheme, stay away.

Add in no ping lock and it's not ever going to be a viable competitive game."
6417,This game is great and is underrated.
6418,BING CHILLING !
6419,slice and dice royale with grappling hooks. great fluid movement. combat is sweaty af. Needs a duo mode and a 1v1 arena.
6420,"This game will fuck you if you get caught lacking. At the same time, it is not impossible to kill someone more geared than you. If you can chain good enough and keep them on the backfoot you can take out a dude with legendary gear. Super tense combat. I'm still pretty new and learning to counter most things, greatsword seems to be my bain right now but there are mechanics in place that make it possible for you to turn the tide of any battle."
6421,CUm
6422,"games trash, counters barley work people abuse ping . They let certain heros get guaranteed escapes and combos while not giving other ones any. Games all about what to abuse not about skill and you should never fight just rat if u ever care about rank."
6423,The character customization is better than any game I have played. Beautiful graphics even on the lowest settings and the movement feels great!
6424,"The level of customization and the depth of the fighting mechanics is brilliant in this game. It's the first melee battle royal ever made and with souls Sekiro-like combat. Well polished and looks like it will get updates with more game modes and content as time passes. And it's super cheap at only $20. Has a steep learning curve  (which I like) but enough weapons, characters, and ability diversity to support any play style. The only thing I did not like is that it has little to no controller support. Pretty much unplayable with the controller right now."
6425,A unique Battle Royale game with an extremely high skill ceiling.
6426,It takes a little while to get the controls down but once you do beating people never gets old.
6427,"You will be facing bots before level 5 and I totally understand why.
This game is hardcore. There's so many movement mechanics and combat mechanics that you will need to learn for your very survival.

I'm only in Bronze I and the players there are already quite good being able to parry and dodge around quickly."

6452,A whole new wind to the Battle royale genre. If you want to take on a whole new style of challenge. This is the place you should spend your time on.
6453,"I would recommend this game to all of my friends. However, this game is only fun until your whole squad gets wiped by 巨大的公鸡."
6454,"very impressive
"
6455,"Overall, I think this is the best battle royal game I have ever played.

Pros:
- Amazing Combat system and balance between melee and ranged weapons.
- Good variety of characters with different abilities.
- Engaging and punishing ranked system provides a good challenge and a hook.

Cons:
- Ping makes a difference in parrying and other things. You will have the best experience if you live in an Area where there is a designated server. Stable connection is highly recommended before thinking of buying the game.
- Grappling spools stagger a bit too much and needs to be tuned especially in Trio.
- Paid battle pass for a paid game (However I still think its worth it because if you buy it once you can buy the next one for $1 if you save your gold).

Would I recommend the game?
If your pc can run it and you have a stable connection then YES because this game is really something else.

6463,fun game
6464,so freakin fun but as frustrating as any battle royal game
6465,"One of the few battle royale games that I like, that avoids most of the pitfalls of others in the genre.  The matches are quicker, more involved, more active than similar games like fortnite and PUBG.  The martial focus helps prevent the typical sniper death from someone camping in a good spot like in other games, and also disincentivizes playing like that, as it is unlikely (and mid-late game certainly impossible) to get a purely ranged surprise kill.  Of course, surprise attacks are a powerful tactic, but really only if at close enough range to engage in close combat.  

There is a decent variety of heroes, with more on the way, and more modes coming too.  The content that is in the game is worthwhile and fun.  My only suggestion to those that are interested in starting for the first time, is to either install the game on an SSD, and if you can't (like me), play some free training or a deathmatch game (bloodbath) before playing the ranked modes.  The game has issues loading assets the first time off of a harddrive.  This will help at least some of the early headaches.  Also, the menu music is quite a bit louder than the rest of the game."

6480,"[h1]Barely playable, but not because it's poor quality...[/h1]

What It Is:
A battle royale focused around melee combat rather than guns. This is actually a lot more entertaining than you would think, with movement being a big part of the gameplay.

Gameplay:
A very combo heavy, methodical combat which requires you to be on your toes constantly, especially when fighting multiple enemies at once. Movement skills are a must, quick inputs and good timing are necessary. It's to the walls at all times.

Controls:
Mouse and keyboard recommended.

Difficulty:
Skill ceiling is not visible.

Graphics:
Pretty good, they aren't the best or groundbreaking but you won't be disappointed by them by any means. Personally I like my frames so I run them low.

Audio:
Fantastic 360 degree immersive sound.

Replay Value:
Depends how far your patience goes. This game is a true test of it.

What I Like:
The combat is unique, the gameplay is fast paced, the animations are smooth. Everything is here for this game to be really nice and unique and fun to play.

What I Don't:
Nerfed a large portion of the games movement via scale rush, and haven't address any of the realistic balance problems the game has. 

I don't even have fun anymore, every single match in Gold V to Gold I and back down again is just a bunch of SEA sweatlards and it's ruining the NA gameplay, not to mention local leaderboards are broken because of CN players using VPNs (RIP to being #1 in my state since randomly one day an Asian player was at the top :shrug:)

Leaderboards are infested with boosters using new accounts/friends to drop ELO and farm.

Improper teaming within Asian teams is common at higher ranks (they like killing NAs).

Hitboxes are buggy (both because of latency/netcode and because they aren't very accurate).

Parry has reached a state of full uselessness.

There is NO proper ranked system for matches. You'll be matched with Silvers in Plat, and Plats in Bronze. It literally is just a clusterfrick at this point. As of this review I am Gold IV and have been Plat once, and in that time I have seen more Plats as a Gold IV than I ever did as a plat. It's goofy as hell.

Judgement:
I wouldn't buy this game to be honest. The devs show no interest in fixing common and REAL player complaints, instead erring on the side of using surveys which are vastly weighted in favor of the CN player answers (most of whom all main the broken characters/weps so they never receive the nerfs they need.)

Honestly man, after 240+ hours  (80+ IN GAME, ~500 matches) and being WR on one of the characters (former Temulch #50) I can honestly say I hate the state of this game. Devs have released a new character which is busted and basically replaces an existing one with better skills. They don't seem to actually care about anything other than shelling out 20 dollar skins for weps and characters at lightning paces.

If you're an American with a social life or a family or full time job you will never achieve SEA levels of sweatiness, leaving every game to become dodge the guy with the asiatic name until final circle and then get smacked because their parry worked facing 180 degrees away from you."

VIDEO CLIP: https://clips.twitch.tv/ShakingWonderfulKiwiPeoplesChamp-dGHQ6Ynj3bZenRS5

[NOTE] I've seen the recommendations to install this game on an SSD and I'm not sure how much of this clip was an actual issue of it being installed on my HDD. I've also seen people bring up the fact that this game isn't region locked and that its causing Ping Disasters (which is what I'm assuming this was) im not really tech savvy so I couldn't tell ya for certain. Watch the clip, this was an issue in almost ever single game i played."
6485,"All the Asian players with 900 ping playing in the western servers are probably looking for immigration sponsors to come to the west, i wish i can refund but i pre ordered months back, should of known by the name it was going to be a shit show."
6486,"Amazing mechanics, great visuals, incredible balance. The great problem, which if not solved will ruin this game, like it did to PUBG is the zerg of chinese people, who have 300 or more ping, parry your attacks seconds later, and sometimes even use cheats (although I only got 2 or 3 cheaters in general, they were the 3 chinese)
"
6487,"This game is in a very bad state right now. It has massive ping abuse, half of the weapons are never used because people just want to spear spin spam and longsword spam, and the devs dont seem to care about the NA player base. You let other countries ruin the fun and then you give them the new characters first so that they can learn it just to abuse the system even more."
6488,"dope

6489,"Very clunky and buggy. As well as Bot lobbys, which I hate in any multiplayer game."

6491,Sweaty game for those who enjoy a good PVP
6492,"A game made by china clearly favors china players. Players with 500 ping are allowed to play on NA servers and be nearly un-hittable and clearly game breaking. This game is a lot of fun, Like a fighting game BR that would take a long time to balance, but fun.  I think ultimate's make the game less fun  but that's personal opinion

Cant down vote this enough currently. theres almost no skill involved in most fights. no counter play available with the latency difference. the Timing window for Parry is tight, like it should be, but you must ""get lucky"" and parry a Chinese players charged attack because what they are doing on your screen is different than what they are doing on their screen, mix that into ROLLBACK net code and the game severely breaks.

Devs do not seem adamant about fixing this"

6505,Very fast paced combat with great graphs
6506,over competitive and ridiculous fight mechanics. the only sense of satisfaction you get is killing off bots and other newbie players. once you reach a certain level there wont be anymore bots to kill but only high ranking players who either knows how to abuse the fight mechanics or maybe hacking. you will also realize that these players are always lucky to get loot items that are at least a grade or two higher than what you have if not more. All in all this is a stupid game. But hey its just my opinion!
6507,Apex Legends with a Dynasty Warriors-esque aesthetic. Super fun game. Has it's ups and downs but mostly pretty awesome!
6508,Unplayable rounds because of high ping players abusing other servers because they can get unrealistic parry windows. No duo mode available either. Ultimate balancing is also something that should be fixed. Besides that great game but needs a lot of fixing. Will change to positive review once the high ping players are removed from other servers at least.

I never knew this game until I got a txt message from steam about buying Naraka Bladepoints and the game currency. 
I soon found out that an anonymous hacker from China broke into my account to buy some game money. Of course I asked for refund about the game itself in Steam. Since this hacker guy played for only like 6 mins, I got refunded. But the money spent in buying game currency? This fking Netease company wouldn't refund me by only saying ""About your request, we are sorry to tell you that once the transaction is done successfully, it cannot be reversed. This is same for all our players to ensure a fair game play environment. Thank you for your kind understanding."" This is just insane because I've never, ever, bought anything related to game. I've tried sending the company evidence of hacking, and only reply I get is that same line over and over again. Before playing this game whatsoever, one must realize that this company has noooooooooo attitude in solving customer problems.

6528,"Not recommended. While the art and gameplay is fabulous the state of the NA region is awful. Your 60 man lobbys will consist of 60 percent Chinese players with extremely high ping, which for some reason Netease has made high ping an advantage. I've never had a game where high ping was an advantage except for this one. There is a video of someone with high lag being hit 20 times (no exaggeration) and not being inflicted any damage. This is the state of the game. The devs have said they are working on region block but IMO they will not do it because of lack of western player population. I am currently Silver 1, which is in the top 5 percent of my region. I am playing against the top 50 ranks every game and also I see the same people every game basically. Except of course the Chinese that run rampant in our region. 

One of the biggest problems of the game is parry which is one of the rock paper scissors, arguably the most important aspect of the game. The frames on which it is active is very odd. It's dependent on each weapon and what weapon you are fighting against. Since parrying is a mechanic that you have to predict and not react with ... trying to do it against players with high ping is impossible. Even for me, where I have a 6 ms internet speed test (I live in West coast, Usa) I have about 90-100 ms in game. 

Currently 1 character, Matari, is in 80% of games since she is very evasive and can turn invisible. Character imbalance runs rampant, as well, as weapons. If you have been watching any of their tournaments (which have been God awful by the way - their social media and discord management is the worst I have ever seen - will talk about this later) you will notice that 90% of the ""pros"" will be using longsword since you are able to do two attacks with a 0.5 second stun. This is called toothpicking which combined with the standard uppercut combo can take out full yellow and purple armor. There is no counterplay. 

So, their social media engagement has been the worst I've ever seen for a modern game company. Their twitch streams of the tournaments have been disasters. Their first tournament about an hour in during the match they raided (switched the stream) to an individual streamer. Today (Sept 11) they weren't able to operate their twitch account to host their $10k tournament.... Their discord team have been very rude to people. Search on reddit for many personal accounts of how bad it is in that discord. They also have been banning people for little reasons. Something that also bothered me about their tournaments is the fact that they have over 6 lobbys of games going on at the same time but only showcase one of the lobbys. So that means we cannot see the 5 other lobbys of 60 people each fighting. So they have been stacking ""lobby A"" with all of the top players making it very unfair. This and the rest of their twitter engagement (they have shared videos of people using exploits in game and afterwards deleting it after being called out for it) has made me feel like they are being run very unprofessionally. In todays world where games seem to rely on twitch popularity and esport capability I see very little future for naraka. 

This combined with the everyday experience of running into high ping Chinese players using VPNs to play in NA region has left a sour taste in my mouth. I haven't even begin to talk about the exploitative cash shop they have. The skins for characters are incredibly expensive. This is the only game I've ever seen that had a box cost + a paid for battlepass. The skins, while beautiful, are extremely expensive for what they are. Their ""loot boxes"" seem horrible because of the limited amount of skins they currently have. So if you buy 10 of these treasure chests on average you will get 6 or 7 items that you owned and will be recycled. 

The game has been out for much longer in China. They have had no communication in months about the ping or region lock (since region lock does nothing because of how popular VPNs are in China) I cannot in good consciounsce recommend this game. Once you are about 50-100 hours into the game you will face players that are extremely better than you because of player popularton in NA or you will be fighting Chinese players that constantly jump around the screen that you cannot damage. 

For a game that relies on precise timing the server and ping are impossible to play around. Please 24 Entertainment, Netease, fix your game. Stop focusing on the money from skins and new characters. Care for America and the rest of the Western audience. This will be one of the many Eastern great games that fail to support the Western audience. This game has incredible potential. Please work on it and be open communication with your player base. Thank you."
6529,Refunded the game simply because it's impossible to play with hordes of Chinese players on EU servers abusing their high ping.
6530,"You will die, you will get better, and you will die again to people that got better. 
Basically Dark Souls Battle Royale."
6531,Very Fun
6532,The action combat system as well as the fresh feel of a Battle Royale this game brings is truly unique. Big fan of this game and I hate Battle Royale games typically. The drop system is quick and easy. Only downsides are the load times if you don't have it on an SSD or dedicated drive. People also complain about the smurfs and ping issues but I haven't experienced it as much. Highly recommend if you enjoy action melee based combat.
6533,yoto can hit through wall nice game
6534,"Ping Abusers & VPN players from NA & China will make this game impossible to play at a high level.

6535,"Make no mistake--this is a very difficult game. Like fighting games, there are various combos you can employ and there ARE true combos. You will die. A lot.

That said, it is the most fun I've ever had in a battle royale game. The art style and combat are definitely my jam, and I enjoy most of the characters currently available."
6536,"It's a fun battle royale for people who don't like First Person Shooters, very decent rock-paper-scissors-like melee system. I recommend this game for people who don't like FPS battle royale but like games like Chivalry or Mordhau. Just be aware that there are loot boxes in this game."

6559,"Could be a great game in its uncontested genre right now. But not region locking this game with a netcode that provides advantage for high latency connections ruins this for me. Up to 80% of a EU lobby are asian people. Very often you see a ""bad connection"" symbol above people's head. You get hit by moves you didn't even see and you cannot block a lot of the attacks because you don't see what's actually happening."

6577,I currently love this game. the movement is great and the combat is very satisfying. I'm currently playing on controller so I couldn't tell you about how the usual controls work but I love the controller controls. There are multiple different heroes and weapons so I'm sure you can find something that matches your style of play. The game is still in it's infancy so they do still have a few small knacks to work out but I love the game as it is right now and am very excited to see how it evolves in the future

6593,"the game itself is fine, but the lootbox on top of a paid game always feels a bit wrong. and ofc, they rigged the system.  not only you can get multiple time the same loot, but when you get a high value loot you have a very high chance of earning a previously earned one. since there is no transparency whatsoever of how this loot system work they can do whatever they want. they don't care of local regulation, being netease and located in china they don't give a shit about anything really, so it doesn't matter your country banned lootbox, and frankly, since it s abused in such manner, should be banned everywhere. so if you are someone who has a tendency to gamble it is HIGHLY not recommended you ever install this game."
6594,Nice one
6595,Don't buy this game if you want your attacks to land and parries to work. Also enjoy being put up against 3 stacked teams queueing solo.
6596,Very good game
6597,666
6598,"Update: Since a recent update the game it requiring me to turn off memory integration. Don't see why they would want you to do that but its suspicious. Its a base windows security option that creates a virtual server to scan code for malicious bits, before allowing it to access windows. Its a great security option that stops low level drivers from allowing the code to access your kernal. Its actually ridiculous they want you to turn it off and it a questionable change to their security requirements. Essentially this makes the game unplayable unless I want to open my computer up to malicious code. Worth mentioning that starting the game anyway has a chance of locking that feature on your computer. The game literally will stop you from turning it back on. Can't be more disappointed.


Starting with the bad. 

This game has some of the worst monetization I've ever seen in a game. The battle passes are long and grindy and the skins are expensive. 

Hacking is a noticable problem, even with their overly intrusive anti-cheat. People will often chain combos faster then they should be able to, infinite juggle, perform unrealistic animation cancel, and preform multiple animations at once such as countering and using a skill(which you cant normally do). 

There's also a huge problem with foreign players taking advantage of switching servers. There are a lot of chinese players in particular on NA servers, who are either hacking or taking advantage of the ping differences to avoid damage, as there hit box wont usually be where their model is. The devs cleary don't care about this, I havent seen any mention of addressing or fixing it. They just want to make absurd amounts of money on their skins. I wouldn't spend a penny on the game outside of buying it. Not only do they not deserve the extra income, but you will get plenty of free stuff and save your self on over paying for pixels. 

Fortunately for them, the gameplay is quite good and they have a fair amount of free cosmetics for people who play during their frequent short term events. The game boasts one of the most fluid movement systems in the industry and a fun skill focused combat system with lots of flexability in playstyle based on your weapon and character of choice. If you can look passed these things and aren't planning on taking the game competitively then you will enjoy it. If you are very competitive then you might want to skip it, as there will definitely be situations where you will be questioning the validity of a fight. Whether it be infinite juggles, impossible animation cancels, the enemy not taking any damage at all, or them countering every strike you make. Either nullifying the strikes damage or disarming you in the process."
6599,"like
"
6600,"Really great and fun game, but does contain skills."
6601,Runs like absolute shit.
6602,"Do you like being staggered to death by 3 people simultaneously while your teammates run 200 meters in the opposite direction to hit a bell?

Do you like staggering a person to death while their teammates run 200 meters in the opposite direction to hit a bell?

Do you like getting 3rd partied (and still winning) just for both teams to respawn 30 meters away and come back to beat you into the ground while you're recovering/looting?

This game does have the same BS that other BR games have. These things DO happen. That being said, the game is still very enjoyable and has a deep combat system that's easy to pick up, and rewarding to master. It's one of those games that you will be able to feel yourself improving at as you play.

It's worth the $20 (although I think F2P would be fine for this game given the cosmetic MTX/Gacha system). The visuals are pretty good as well. I can see myself playing this game consistently. I recommend this game because I think it's fun, and I would like to see the population go up in order to solve the moderate population issues the game currently has."
6603,Want to feel like a samurai or ninja? Naraka is for you!
6604,"You should get this game, even if there are chinese vpn abusers taking advantage of the system at the moment... theyre defeatbale lol trust me xD people who give up easily after losing should avoid this game."
6605,"If you play NA just avoid, Lag advantage is a big thing. I run into more Chinese people than English. Combat is clunky and snore if you play anything more than butten mashers. Climbing mechanics are like clunky, barely functional AC mechanics."
6606,best br
6607,"The servers are not stable. Game barely loads through even on low setting. I have to wait 10-30 seconds just to pick up the loot in front of me. Rendering buildings at the beginning of the game is like waiting for Santa to come and gift me presents. The gameplay is actually really good, like the idea of the hole Chinese themed battle royal, but I feel like I payed 20 dollars for a Beta version."
6608,nice
6609,"basically mobile game, requires some degree of skill, also almost unplayable on controller"
6610,The game was the best game i've played but now they buffed the dagger and most people use it now since you could drain your enemy's energy and it has high damage if you get certain perks or whatever they are called or you can just do your blue attacks and combo your enemy 90 times with the same combo over and over and since its the fastest weapon in the game you can't escape. And it makes the game more fun when everyone uses it.
6611,Nice Game
6612,Super fun !
6613,GOOD
6614,Good

6617,THE MUSIC AND CHARACTER PERFECTLY GUIDE ME INTO THE GAME.
6618,"great game but i can't in good faith recommend this game right now, they seriously need to fix ping issues with people playing on different servers. there are a lot of Chinese players flooding EU/NA servers with VPN's and generally completely dominating due to the game favouring the person with the higher ping, it's no fun having a full combo completely ignored just to get deleted by a greatsword, very frustrating when you lose rank and it's literally not your fault at all.

i seriously want to love this game and with a few improvements it could be some real competition as it fulfils a niche no other game currently provides."
6619,Too many cheater hacker  DEV do some thing!!
6620,good game
6621,"Great game, I can speak chinese now"
6622,"Hello Troublemakers Kamne here. Buckle up and let`s dive in.

Naraka: Bladepoint is a 60-player action battle royale game with a variety of melee, ranged weapons, abilities, and unique movement options. There's a lot to unpack, but here's a quick look at Naraka: Bladepoint before you jump into the fray. 

Game world of Naraka is really Beautifully designed. Game is really carry that eastern style. Optimisation is okay, you can get desent amount of FPS in the game with Mid or Lower tier graphic cards without a problem. Customizations are detailed. Player can select 7 Heroes/Classes and those classes have no balance between them but that is also the point because every class has different role. such as do you plan to make your self a tank or do you aim to be a best healer, player can adjust his/her style. There is a system similar to runes you can buy on empty slots and upgrade it for your style of play. Game have microtransactions and loot box system, although most are cosmetic focused only not looking harmful at the moment. You can create rooms for custom matches so you can enjoy playing only with your friends.

Servers are still need adjusting. Players expect some latency in the game. Melee Combat is good and fun to play. You need to adjust your timing for evade and when to attack or when to block. It`s kind a remind me Gunz Online. Walking on walls using blades such a nostalgia for me. However range combat became a challange for me due to Latency issue it is really difficult to hit an enemy player also hitboxes can feel janky. Choice of weapons are ok. I expect new characters and new weapons will be added in time.Other than battle royal mode there is also a death match mode I recommend start from that mode so you can adjust to combat quickly. Musics are fun to listen and voice over quality is good. You can select 3 different voiceover language at the moment. 


Game Music :  7.7 / 10
Art Design : 7.9 / 10
Combat System : 8.2 / 10
Overall Gameplay : 8 / 10

You should put this game in your radar and give it a chance."
6623,1
6624,Awesome game..should be best game 2021
6625,game is great but being able to grapple people ruins the game!
6626,best br to date not made for little kiddies who love second place trophies
6627,"Gameplay-wise - not bad, imagine Blade & Soul but with simplified combat and as a battle royale.

Sadly the game suffers from huge framerate issues and if you compare it to other graphically-intensive titles, there is really no reason to dip below 30fps in combat on a 1060 & i7 @MINIMUM settings.

It's lacking a lot of polish in certain areas, but the biggest issue for me is the framerate. Also the grab spam is annoying af at times, ngl.

Would recommend if they got rid of fps issues and polished it a bit."
6628,"This game is fun af with the right characters. People won't be able to truly enjoy the experience until the developers optimize their game for each region. They keep avoiding the topic of Ping abuse. Hopefully another developer picks up on this concept and can release a game without glaring issues their player base is stuck to deal with.

All-in-all, if you don't mind lazy networking, it's fun game. Maybe once they release it for the PS5 it will be better optimized, who knows!

I have hopes for 24 Entertainment."
6629,A lot of fun
6630,"So, the game is good: complex high combat strategy fast pasted..The problem is with the PING durring FIGHTS...tones of people who gave negative reviews are uppset about the ping issues. For me, to loose only because of PING issues its frustrating. I like the game, when i dont have a ping durring FIGHTS, and thats rare, i win most of the time. I already have arround 40=50 games. So, yes buy it, i belive they will fix the ping issues. This is one of the best BR game out there...Do try it."
6631,"Beautiful graphics and exciting combat. A fresh take on the BR genre but it also includes free for all deathmatch mode called Bloodbath that is equally fun. The grappling hook adds such a fun dynamic to the mix, takes me back to my old Quake DM days with the grapple mod.

The occasional laggy VPN player can ruin the experience, but that has been improving with region locks and what I suspect are latency limitations for servers.

P.S. Don't button mash or you're gonna have a bad time."
6632,Beautiful animation! It's super fun! Very Parkourr and A BATTLE ROYALE WITHOUT SNIPERS. UGH SNIPER. I HATE SNIPER.
6633,liads mom is hot and this game is even hotter :)
6634,"quite hard but realy fun, this game is unique"
6635,"I first reviewed this game after around 15 hours of gameplay. I'm now updating my review with close to 50 hours. After playing enough to develop my skills in this game and making it into top 15% of the world my fundamental view of this game hasn't changed at all. The idea of this game is great but the developers do not care about their NA region at all. NA is literally overrun with EU and AS players with 200+ ping. The developers have had AMPLE time to apply a ping lock to the game to save whats left of their actual NA players and they haven't. The developers also tend to completely ignore some blatantly unbalanced and OP weapons/characters in the game. For example, ""Toothpicking"" has been an OP tactic with longswords since release and the developers have yet to nerf it. The game recieves an average of one patch per month and a half which also means if something is broken, you're going to be dealing with it for a long ass time. That is if they deal with it at all which doesn't seem to be the case for many things. I've reached the point where this is where I'm uninstalling the game. No more making excuses for this shitty developer that maybe its just me and maybe I need to work on my own skill some more. I will return IF the DEVS ever actually show one tiny little strand of care and at least implement a ping lock to keep these laggy VPN abusers off our fucking servers. This game will follow in PUBG's footsteps and let their server be completely ruined by chinese. Just watch."
6636,"good game
"
6637,"Combat is fun and each fight feels different. Worth the buy at 20 bucks. no p2w either so thats a big plus.

6664,gudgame :D
6665,Not big on battle royales but the combat is fun and deep
6666,"Amazing game! Just like every other game u ll improve if you are willing to put your time into it.  
Highly Recommended ! 
(This is from someone who enjoys FPS Games like Valorant and BRs like Apex )"
6667,"After several hours of playing, you will notice that you will always be playing on the same field as the players of significant difference in levels and skills. you will have no chance of surviving.

FIX THE MATCHMAKING PLEASE!

AS FOR NOW, NOT RECOMMENDED."
6668,Love this game
6669,"Personally really enjoying this game. I find myself liking niche Battle Royales when I do wind up liking them, and this is no different.  The battle system reminds me of fighting games in that its a rock paper scissors system of three posibilities. Even without the battle pass there is a lot of ""quests"" and the like to earn cosmetics and various currencies.   The heros are interesting and the customization options are unrivaled.  There is a high skill ceiling which i personally enjoy because i love learning tech and nuance of heroes and gameplay to outwit opponents.   The game does a pretty good job of teaching you about the various tech but watching pro streams always helps.  Hoping the game continues to grow."
6670,Actually pretty fun battle royal
6671,"247 hours upon writing this review.

first off i love this game and the fighting style
the skills is beautiful and also the character customisation
the map is also very well thought out.

but one thing i hate is the amount of cheaters in the game
like jesus christ the game has been out almost a month and theres hackers
everywhere with teleports, auto parry insta cast on skills unli dodge insta combo
and guess what? most of these hackers are bloody chinese, 
there has to be something can be done with all these hackers and i know its a chinese game but damn
everyone in the rank and hall of fame is flooded with chinese players, and dont get me started on ranking system
its bloody ridiculous that you have to be top tier player to basically move up the ranks (cheaters paradise) because even if u win the round with one kill it  will give you maybe +11 in platinum/solar then lose the next game at rank 15 with 5 kills u still get minus points like wtf the whole rank mode is broken in terms of points. 
its like theres no reward for being the winner at all but only the kills. 

should i recommend the game? yes if your not competitive but if you are dont bother. or just play bloodbath mode
im still gonna play this game cos i love it but i just dont reccomend it at this stage."
6672,"The best Assassin, ninja, swordplay battle royal ever!!"
6673,1
6674,This game is literal trash. The most inconsistent combat system in almost any game I have ever played. I gave it a fair shot and played for over 50 hours. Stay away!
6675,"Dobre bo ciasne, ciasne bo dobre."
6676,Fun game. Duos please.
6677,if region lock will be introduced i will give 10/10! Chinese highping players all over the place
6678,"goddamn chinese ping abusers, unplayable after you reach a somewhat higher rank"
6679,"since i bought it i have been telling people to get it, underselling the issues as minor but in this review i wont do that. The game is good its super fun and a good concept. The combo system is easy and its super sick to get a counter, The free running aspect of the game is awesome and makes you feel like a ninja at times, its nice to be able to grapple hook onto anything around you and instantly fly there. The fact that you can filter parties with mics is nice but often times useless as they dont use them. 

The only issue i have with this game is the amount of lagg you get nearly every game, sometimes minor but other times it comes in the worst possible moments, in my case it seems to be caused by players from the other side of the world. when i say lagg i mean running into a tree, rubberbanding back into the darkness and getting a connecting overlay that disables any control of your character that then, kicks you from the game. In a trio you can rejoin with your setup but in a solo you pretty much never played that match. All in all id give this game a 4/10 the connection issues just make it nearly unplayable but that wont stop me from trying just yet."
6680,good game
6681,"Good game, looked hard via videos on YT and twitch but its actually super fun and I have really enjoyed it thus far! Only down side is that there is a HUGE skill gap between players. Your either going to destroy everyone or get destroyed by 1 team. Still would recommend and still super fun!"
6682,"Its really good but you need a good pc 
"
6683,"Really fun, when you actually get good and understand the game more its even better, can't wait to see what they do to this game in the future, it has amazing potential!"
6684,LOVE IT
6685,"One of the unique BR games I've played, hard yet so satisfying when you get the hang of the combat.
Don't know why, but it reminds me a little of the old good days of GunZ.

However, there is a multiple microtransactions systems for a paid game which is a bummer, but it's only cosmetics.

Long story short:
+ The Combat
+ Challenging yet rewarding
+ Fair play
+ Looks pretty & Runs pretty smooth
+ Active devs and community

- Chinese players on EU servers
- Multiple currency system within a PAID game

Definitely recommend!! 9/10"
6686,"This game is fire. Have binged in this game for so long. Drop the guns my guys, time for blades and swords!"
6687,good game but fix the goddamn frame rate. i'm using core i9 and rtx 2060 and 16 ram..
6688,"A really interesting take on traditional battle royals. Definitely suggest it if you aren't fond of FPS battle royals.
10/10"
6689,u want a good melee/gun royal this the one ong
6690,"Really fun game!

You'll see complaints about things like ""balance of the fighting system"", ""ping diff"", etc. 
These haven't really affected me. Every fight I've lost felt like a fair loss for being outplayed or me simply me being worse than the opponent.

But this is my experience and yours may be different. 
However, if you're on the fence about this game, just buy it and give it a try for around 2 hours. If it clicks and it feels like something you enjoy, keep playing, if not, refund it. 

I recommend this for all games you feel on the fence about, you really don't know until you've experienced it yourself. If you're interested in it, there has to be a reason, so experience it yourself and see if that gut instinct that piqued your interest is true."
6691,"Wounderfull game, definitiv recomending.  Do you love Pubg or games as pubg.  this one is what you need.   The diffrent is the Pubg is more tactic and you have guns.   Most time fight in thsi game is sword fight  face to face.    the game itself is like Pubg where is in world things you can buy or a battel pass.   You have diffrent character with diffrent powers they can do. and you can level them up  to become stronger and get diffrent type off powers. 

You can also face make the character after you own face.  

To describe this game , it is a Fortnite Action game with game style from Pubg.  
So you love fortnite or Pubg . this will be one of you favourit game."
6692,tell me why ?
6693,"I gave this game a try, but it's just too hard. As a person who plays games to relax, I don't want to be on peak concentration every second, but if you don't do it here you're gonna die all the time and have no fun at all.
Also, the devs didn't have time to stabilize fps, but implemented bouncing boobs and butts for female characters. Guys I'm not twelve"
6694,"It's fun when it's not lagging. Which is about 90% of the time. The game is so poorly optimized I loose brain cells. Everything on low settings (RTX 2060, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 16 GB 3200mHz RAM). 

It tells me I'm in NA servers with 45 PING yet I get placed in Asian servers. I can't even fight because as soon as one person shows up my frames go to 30, im skipping, they're skipping, then the rest show up and I die. Every new POI takes two minutes to load and drops me between 1 and 20 FPS. 

I do truly enjoy it when it's running smooth. I see the potential. But $20 for this mess? Yikes."
6695,Graphics and Game play are both AWESOME!!!
6696,Needs a Ping kick 100000% or the game will die.
6697,Dis joint guud *fire emoji*
6698,"The game is pretty fun as it is, with elements of Sekiro and Apex Legends, though as much as I am enjoying the game, I would recommend getting the game when its on discount.

It has a very fluid combat mechanic, that will need some time to get used to, which they do give you the chance to learn as you play by matching you with bots for your first few matches. So by the time you start getting matched with players, you would already know the general gist of the game and begin experiencing the actual game, in a fun and likely not so fun way at the same time.

No bugs encountered so far, game runs pretty well with really good graphics.
As any other game, adjustments / nerfs would probably be needed for certain aspects cause of the weapons capabilities, but its not so bad to the point of ruining your Naraka experience."
6699,Beautifull battleroyale
6700,"Dont wait for sale, buy it now"
6701,"Good game, fun to play with friends. The game's attack mode is so detailed, not only left and right click.
A lot of works to learn, worth to buy"
6702,Its ok.
6703,"A game with much potential. Fun gameplay, nice graphics, several fun gamemodes and tons of cosmetics"
6704,Graphic DX 12 PLZ
6705,"Good game, good mechanics. Give this game a try for sure!

Things i like to see changed:
- Tarka Ji infinite combo nerfed, if you get it hit.. you're ded.
- Grapples should have cooldown to prevent spamming, very annoying in 3v3.
- Ballista nerf, 2 shots to kill someone is way too strong.
- Enviroment objects, less stun & less damage."
6706,"Great game, all though the spear is way to OP. So, use spear if u wanna dominate, lol. They gotta fix it."
6707,"Yeah, I dig it."
6708,"Im not a fan of battle royal games, but this game is way more def to me, didnt like pubg or apex or other battle royal but this is one and the only battle royal i loved it.
Highly recommended."
6709,"Game is cool and fun, but poorly executed. It revolves around a high skill rock-paper-scissors system between light attacks, heavy attacks, and a parry. Unfortunately, parry becomes less consistent as you fight against better enemies; In the end, its all about dealing light and heavy attacks and dodging or tanking enemy hits; which isnt the core premise of the game. A better execution of combat mechanics is on For Honor, which luckily for Naraka, doesnt plan on bringing a F2P BR format anytime soon. Because it would, in my honest opinion, be a better game.

All in all, for a format of a TPP Melee combat BR game, its in its own league just like PUBG was back in the day. Buy now while its still hot with many players. Once it dies down, you'll be in botfest land, as with any typical Chinese game"
6710,its okay.
6711,.
6712,Fun!
6713,"Another new look of BR game,I didn't take Naraka: Bladepoint seriously at first, and it didn't give me many reasons to. In its tutorial, the melee-focused battle royale game teaches you to combo by clicking repeatedly—no problem, I love clicking—and then introduces its weird countering system without really explaining it.

You start learning that your parry has a Sekiro-like margin of success, and even that's predicated on a poorly-explained color system that tells you if your character has the ability to parry a specific attack altogether. Dodges are effective, but can be easily adjusted for by a smart, forward-thinking player.

Therefore, This game not really popular on Malaysia but it is popular on China,"
6714,wery good game!
6715,boob physics
6716,chinese game for chinese players don't recommend for NA
6717,"This is a well-created battle royal game. Unlike most battle royale, the game is created with characters mostly playing with close-range weapons and skills. However, 16gb ram is highly recommended for playing the game, otherwise you will lag hardly like me."
6718, cool game
6719,"I regret spending any form of money towards this game - NA playerbase will die soon enough here. I encounter lag and game freezes every time I play against these VPN-ing outer country players who had months more experience than I - and I don't see the ping cap being a priority for the devs to fix anytime soon. Lovely graphics and gameplay but not when playing against players who I can do little to nothing about. - If only I could refund what I spent, cus there's no way in hell I'll spend again."
6720,i like this game beacus i can with my friends :D
6721,"Well, lets get the positives first. This game has great visuals, my favorite character customization among all of the battle royal games ive played, and playing earns you small rewards that motivate you to continue playing. everything else is either standard, or below standard (for reasons ill explain in a minute) compared to other games in its genre. 

Now for the downsides.
First of all, the game is VERY poorly optimized. you are told in-game, that you should run this on your SSD as your hard drive will struggle to keep up as this is an extremely taxing game on your hardware. Unless you wanna start crowding your OS Drive, this is already a big red flag. once you do drop the extra 60-100$ on another one, you can still expect a very choppy experience even if your hardware exceeds system recommendations.
Continuing off the poor optimization, the netcode is the next thing that gives this game a hard time being playable. even with connection speeds of over 100mbps. The most common problem amongst friends and I being that attacks and parries come through on your screen, but dont come through in game; making critical moments seem more like a coin toss between an intended read, or a frustrating way to die.

Second of all, the combat plays like an MMORPG that decided to hop on the battle royal trend, and did a mediocre job fleshing it all out. its a basic hero hack and slash system with little room for complexity. Ive enjoyed much better swordplay from other non PvP centered games like Dark Souls. and while im not a fan, even For Honor delivers a MUCH more complex and engaging combat system that keeps you focused on reading your opponents moves and planning out varied attacks with hopes to penetrate your enemies defence.
Naraka does offer a skill ceiling in what ill call ""combo potential"" as it is by no means a fleshed out system, but feels more like an unintended linking between attacks, similar to the discovery of combos in Street Fighter II.
Ultimately this all makes for combat that feels like a hapless, laggy, choppy, hack and slash PvP with the potential of overpowered ""combos"" that will rob you of your life once someone manages to pull one off randomly in game.

Speaking of ""overpowered"", this brings me to my last point.   The Balance

The Monk and Yoto Hime are by far the best characters in the game at the moment. The monk is the ultimate F**k you character. his regular ability makes it so he enters a faultless defence stance for a second that he can use at any time that completely negates everything coming his way while giving him minor buffs. this includes attacks, charged attacks, other abilities, and even Ultimates with status effects. his ultimate also does the same thing, while turning him into an ultimate monster that you are forced to run away from as fighting him in that state, is not an option unless you cower away and shoot from a far distance and hope not to get grabbed and instant killed from any distance by said grab.
Yoto Hime is just the Best DPS with ultimate and abilities hands down. little to be said here.
other characters abilities are all counterable and have their downsides, but these two definitely stand out among the rest.
Also, this game is not balanced nearly enough for Trios Gameplay. the mess that is the combat system gets amplified to a thousand when playing in a party. Have fun amlessly slashing and throwing out abilities in hopes of just hitting something; or getting slashed, ability spammed, and grapple hooked spammed by multiple people at once, with the name of the game being to get an opponent in an infinite stunlock from so many people hitting you at once with endless spamming. Truly riveting gameplay.

weapons are another story, while im not certain about all of their ultimate potentials due to the combo ""system"" being as it is, it is clear that the balance team has some work to do in this department as well. ill let you read other reviews here as they have more to say than i do. while im not certain on its overall ""tier"" the Greatsword is EXTREMELY inconsistent. having the only unique charged attack pattern, it makes for an absolute mess to use, and to get hit by. Remember what I said about the combat feeling like a coin toss? well take that and add a D20 roll to it on top of that. neither me, nor my opponent knows what the hell will happen when i swing this thing and vice versa. either way chances are that its gonna hurt, which leads me to picking this thing up just to stand a chance at the chaos that is this combat system. it is a messed up mix of rewarding and frustrating gameplay when using, or getting hit by it.

well to conclude, this game has potential, but god damn does it suck right now. 
it still feels early access and honestly should be free to play as i regret every cent i spent on this game, and accessories just to try and run it efficiently. 3.5/10"
6722,"good game, combat, cosmetic, etc. so recommended to buy"
6723,GOOD
6724,Looking forward to what the future holds.
6725, very good
6726,Really Fun and love the fast paced combat and characters. Would recommend. 9/10
6727,"Fun game, worth the basic purchase price. Though 20$ is a fair price to pay for the game, I think it would do the game more good by making it free to play so that the playerbase can grow even more. 

Many people are complaining about the game's business model with skins, loot boxes and battlepass but keep in mind that all of the purchasable contents are cosmetic only and does nothing to give the players an advantage. You are given the ability to customize your character's appearance to make yourself look unique enough without spending a single cent on the game. From handsome Squidward to Thanos and Ultraman, you can either import these characters created by the community or create your own skin and share it with others. For the players that truly desire the skins and do not wish to spend on the game, the game still do offer free cosmetics and loot boxes from time to time. Though it might not be enough you are still given the option to purchase more loot boxes each week using the in-game currency you earn from playing the game.

Naraka is a difficult game, while the basic controls are easy to grasp, the gameplay mechanics go way deeper than just the basic movements. The core gameplay is just like any other Battle Royale where you pick a spawn point and begin looking as the playfield closes up until one man or one team remains. The combat system is similar to rock-paper-scissors (normal < focused < counter < normal). While you might be spamming the attack buttons at first, once you reach a higher level of gameplay, the combat becomes all about mind games and risk management. In a way, Naraka is very reminiscent of Gunz: The Duel where you have players creating moves which utilizes the game mechanics in order to bring out the full potential and efficiency of every weapon, movement and skills that are available to the player. The average gamer would not be a fan of this as it requires practice, experimentation and learning from others in order to achieve that high level of play.

Unfortunately, some people here have had bad experience with players with high ping. I am currently playing in SEA server and I haven't got my game ruined by high ping players yet. (Perhaps its not so bad for SEA players?)  I feel for the players who feel cheated by the bot matches, but for those that have not purchased the game yet, you can expect the same level of difficulty as playing online in a fighting game."
6728,"nice game
"
6729,Meilleur jeu du moment je l ai decouvert grace a gotaga j ai que 7h de jeu et je surkiff
6730,"There must be something wrong with their Hacking/cheating prevention. I got my account banned for no reason and the the client service is terrible. They kept telling me that I was using illegal tools which seriously influenced the gaming experience for other players. However, I've never installed or used any kinda of those tools on my PC. Besides when I got my account banned, I was in the free practice field practicing, this is totally unacceptable. Please unblock my account otherwise I'd take further moves, maybe a refund."
6731,Good Game
6732,Solid combat and customization. Definitely worth a shot.
6733,"In team kurami is fking stupid broken bs that heals multiple times a fight then you got tianhi the annoying running ass monk. Which makes it worse is the servers are merged some games i have 116 ping for no reason fighting eu. inputs dont work sometimes which is very frustrating. the spear you have a dumb skill which  you can't stop, that takes half your hp it super easy to use no penalties. otherwise its fun"
6734,"great game, fun game play but very challenging with pvp"
6735,GREAT GAME
6736,Good game
6737,No cheaters for now with stable connection
6738,"another exciting ways, to get killed every game."
6739,pretty fun. needs some quality of life updates. others than that its enjoyable.
6740,avoid the chinese vpns
6741,"Nice game, it's very exciting."
6742,Made in China always good
6743,spears
6744,"Game started off with bots only which was too easy, once i started facing real players the skill level shot up drastically. First few hours of game play i didnt think i liked the game all that much due to me dying over and over every fight. I started to learn the mechanics by sticking with it and now i can hold up in most fights. of course there will always be people much better than i am, but the game has turned out to be extremely enjoyable, even if i get smoked by some guy who is better. it is a game you can see yourself getting better at the more you play. Overall very enjoyable, and very difficult."
6745,Not fun to play against people from other countries who don't take damage because of their ping
6746,first fun br
6747,help I've cut off connections from everyone else and I'm stuck playing this game friends and family are worried 11/10 would recommend
6748,It was a blast but servers are trash. China overtaken the game at this point making NA players lag. 24 needs to fix this ASAP until then I'm out!!!
6749,$30 for a game where all the cosmetics are locked behind battle passes and pay walls? Game is fun bu this just stupid.
6750,great gameplay
6751,They need region lock. 4-5 games you get killed by some Chinese guy. The fight feels like hot dogshit each time this happens. Pretty disappointing. Other than that its a great game
6752,"fun
"
6753,SO POG VERY POG ON GOD MORE LIKE ON GO MODE YOU KNOW I GETTHAT SHIT FOR THE PROMO FUCKIN AND ABUSIN THE WOMEN LIKE IM ANDREW CUOMO! ESKETIT!
6754,"Leaving a bad review for now, until i see something fixed about playing on na server with china only players. and ping advantage. i would hate it so im keeping my hours at 90min for now. and refund if nothing is done soon XD don't get this game. thank god i didn't pass 2hour mark"
6755,"Feels like a modern Smash Brothers to me. I haven't felt like that about a battle royal game in decades!
"
6756,"very nice, add pve or coop boss and add more peeps in a team cause I have more than 3 friends to play with!"
6757,The game is super fun and i hope it goes far in play wise!! it has a few flaws but i believe it will be fixed in dew time! there a few things that needs to be fix and reworked like tianhai being overpowered for his ultimate because his grab can reach stupidly far and i don't believe it should go as far as it does since its the only one that has that much range. kurumi can be much more better as a healer if a few things where changed to help her support her team and to be able to defend herself better in combat while supporting teammates! Also ik many have said this alot and it WILL be nice to see region locked so na can play with na players only eu with eu etc etc...bc of bad ms people from other foreign country using it to being a unfair playing field. Because of there bad ms on a server there not supposed to be on and it also effects how atks and counters  don't  hit/connecting majority of the time. You guys need to listen to community a bit more on this hole server invasion and lock na with na only etc etc because game might not last very long for how its looking and i hope you guys will find a way to fix that issue and this also effect in game communication because u dont know what is being said or how to replay bc of ur native language. the hole new Reputation Score about your reputation will take a hit if you leave a game before you are not COMPLETELY dead and your teammates are not all dead either. if u guys mean staying in a game when your fully dead and u got 2 teammates still up and leaving u ganna get effected with losing points might be a bad thing to have bc there no way someone ganna stay to watch 2 people of there team or 1 person run around to finnish the round it will be a big waste of time that no one has time to waste irl. the biggest issues is far the most important ARE CHINESE PLAYERS/JAPANESE PLAYERS COMING AND INVADING THE NA SERVER WITH BAD PIN/MS AND CAN'T HIT ATK?COUNTER THEM BC OF IT!!! WHY HAVE U GUY NOT WORK ON THAT??
6758,Cool game play and super fun and easy to learn. Highly recommend.
6759,Love this game
6760,"This game's a shameless cashgrab battle royale with every garbage monetization model possible AND it's b2p. Battlepass, loot boxes, cash-only skins, $20 buy in, 3 different DLC tiers. I wanted to get that part out of the way before I got into why I actually can't stand this game: every match has bots in it, and I'm not talking about the first 4 or 5 games they make you play with nothing but bots that literally run in place (which is absolutely insane to me, this teaches you nothing about the game), but even in ranked matches it seems like about half the lobby is filled with bots. I know this because I've sat and watched one of them repeatedly climb up a pole over and over again when I'm right under it in a bronze 3 ranked match.

After looking it up, I guess you eventually get to the point where they stop flooding your matches with bots once you climb to a high enough rank, but I'm not looking to play a BR filled with bots, if that's what I was looking for I'd play warzone. The actual gameplay is pretty fun, I like the melee-focused BR approach and is something that's sorely lacking in the genre right now, especially after The Culling hurt itself in confusion years ago and eventually got shut down. There's a lot of technique that goes into fights when you start getting into the nitty gritty of it with animation cancelling, counters, weapon frames, really deep stuff like that, but unfortunately nothing in the game bothers to go that far into combat. The most you'll get is ""press LMB to attack, press RMB for charge attack, press both at the same time to counter a charge attack"", just the basics.

I want to like this game and I've been begrudgingly trying to climb ranks to eventually get to the fun part, but I just can't bring myself to trudge through another 20 games filled with bots to get to the real people. Oh, and when you do eventually get to play against real people, there's a non-zero chance they're going to be lagging all over the place and hits won't register. No region lock makes this game a real mixed bag when it comes to quality of fights when you're up against people across the world with 200+ ping.

TL;DR: Good idea, bad execution. Garbage business model, one of the only BRs I can think of that makes you pay to get in just to pay every other step of the way. No region lock, so expect to play against high-ping players that might have an advantage over you in combat. You've gotta put at LEAST 2 hours into the game before you start seeing real players, and even then you're still gonna have lobbies filled with bots presumably until you get out of bronze. There are too many prominent games in the genre to accept a standard this low, unless you're like me and are really just attracted to the melee aspect of it."
6761,"This is the best fast paced hack and slash PVP Bloodbath (Deathmatch) and Battle Royale samurai type game I always wanted to see... Sadly there are a lot of cheaters like in PUBG who uses stuff like Auto Parry, No Stun and ESP/Aimbot making it impossible for you to win in higher ranks but at the times you don't meet them it can be godly satisfying!"
6762,"Definitely not fun for me if it was an MMO i wouldn't refund and play it at least 100 hours. It has the potential of being a good game. Character design, map design and all is good but sorry i just can't feel like this game has a future as a battle royale"
6763,NEXT TIME FIX THE SEA SERVER... ULTRA LAG IS REAL.. FKING GAME
6764,"You'll play at first against bot (~10 games and more) so you can get a feel of this game , this is the worst mechanic there is imo 

The weapon and character have some major difference in term of power. Go watch some videos before buying

I have nothing against bot , but bot with a shit AI I cannot let that pass 
The bot just run in walls start to heal mid-combat while fleing 

This is a no no game for me"
6765,"[strike]naraka my beloved[/strike]

wtf am i doing"
6766,"SUPER FUN!

but only for a while. This game is awesome, the gameplay, graphics, and combat are all amazing. Even the menus are awesome, which is so rare for Battle Royale games. However, the game loses its luster after only a few hours, and this is due to the lack of gameplay loop. Gear isn't important when there isn't something in the gameplay driving me to win. Why should I win? No really? I win almost every match I play, and the game just isn't that hard. I think that's because there's a lot of bots in the games because not many players stick with it because of the lack of motivation.

Please Naraka devs, find a more interesting gameplay loop. I want to love everything about this game!"
6767,"Naraka: Bladepoint..  supposed to be a fun game.  24 Entertainment has allowed an influx of Chinese cheaters to abuse this game to the point of no-return.  A simple research on Google will show endless videos of how these over-seas cheaters have destroyed the game.  This is my 2nd account... as one of the hackers interested in this game, hacked into my Steam and defrauded my Naraka account.  To this.. they offer no support.  Seems like they only want over-seas cheaters to play this game and either for reasons of race or nationality.. offer no support to the NA customers who are new and being exploited by poor development and game-management."
6768,~~
6769,that is good game with many features

6771,A battle royale without the worst part of battle royales: snipers. Really fun Melee mechanics. I'm good at this one because I'm rewarded for unga bunga. Cowardice is not the optimal way to play in this battle royale and it is so refreshing. Get in there and fuck people up with cool swords.

6775,"srsly most shitty unplayable game i have ever played, u can just spam the same attack without even being able to get up..... so if u get down u are fucked, there is nothing to be done after than, u are getting more fucked that a hooker in a whorehouse. should be a free game for the shitty gameplay. first hit wins...... and ofc the people that made the game i have no way of writing to them fix this shit. so many things is needed to be fixed. they need to fix this like they fix a dog, cut of the balls of the shitty people that made the game.

and this is the nice way i talk about this game."

Less emphasis on FPS aiming and more on your combo game and tech. Primarily a fighting game. Reminds me of GunZ. 

If you're in Msia, the ping is great. Smooth fighting experience so far.

6781,"Very Fun Game, if you are into Devil may cry or hack and slash this is right up you alley, I play a lot of tekken and fighting games on the PlayStation so the parrying system is very familiar, however if you don't have these background there is a learning curve you gonna have to get through. Balancing issues are quickly address so the devs are listening to the community so that's a good sign. Recently they added a Sydney node so I'm getting a constant 30 ping, thank god because with games like these ping and input lag plays a huge role in whether you win or die. There aren't too many modes at the moment but I'm sure that will change in the future, an arena base  1v1 in a team consisting of 3 would be awesome and make the game complete for me. Overall I'm in love with this game and hope it keeps doing well a solid 8/10"

Solos is very enjoyable because it feels like there are way more viable play styles when you are being comboed by 3 people at once but I always feel driven away from playing it because you are missing out from a lot of things like some challenges become impossible and I don't think that you can fight moonbane. That being said though the combat feels really nice when you aren't being gangbanged by a 3 stack of Yoto Himes."

6810,"Naraka is not just another battle royale, as its graphics and characters are of a more realistic design.

The character's customization level is very high, you can change practically all the head's physiognomy, almost to the level of a mmorpg. Each character has their skills and skins.

In terms of weapons we have many different types of weapons, melee weapons and ranged weapons. The visuals of the weapons are also very well done.

Perhaps the only problem I found so far with the game is that it is recommended to be installed on the ssd."

6825,"[OPTIMIZATION ISSUE]
You guys have done a great work to make this game. However the game's optimization is not well optimized. Fps could be dropped a lots when fighting or being in some situations even I had mid-range system requirement as well as set all setting as lowest. Please make an update and fix this issue. Thanks you and your team :steamthumbsup:"
6826,"Pros:
Fun combat with a deep mastery curve.
Several unique weapons and fighting styles.
Refreshes the Battleroyale formula due to melee combat. It just plays a lot different.
Couple of content/balance patches already with fairly communicative developers

Cons:
Paid game w/ Loot Boxes + Paid cosmetics puts it in the realm of Overwatch. Except this game is wayyyy less generous with cosmetics than Overwatch.
NA servers are filled with Chinese VPN players who lag and don't communicate
Several characters just have frustrating abilities to deal with.

Things I'd love to see in the future:
Team Deathmatch or 1v1 mode
Character ability reworks

[b]Naraka: Bladepoint is a fast-paced, action-packed battle royale fighting game.  It combines smooth fighting mechanics, versatile parkour, and different play-style options to make a pretty astounding experience. [/b]

Whether you're playing Solos or Trios facing against the calamitous shadow and the 50 and counting foes, this game promises an amazing experience. 

The combat is intricate enough to have a steep learning curve to where once a player learns your style, it could be game over.  If you're button mashing, you're screwed. This game rewards attention to detail, and the methodical experience of practicing the art of fighting others amidst total chaos.

The game offers a balance of melee and ranged weapons with boosts to accompany most weapons as well as basic traits that the user has. 
The varying abilities of characters offers so many different play-styles that you can keep your foes guessing, especially when you change up the meta in trios with different hero combinations.

[h2]Enough Chatter, [b] BRIEF HERO BREAK DOWN, PRO/CON LIST, GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO [/b] [/h2]
(I will not be listing all characters abilities and descriptions of them. Please get the game and play it if you are that curious, lol)

[list]
[*]Viper Ning- Excellent all-around hero. F-skill is fantastic, and fast. Ultimate ability makes for game-changing battles whether that is solo or trio. Solo sustainability is most certainly S-tier.
[*]Kurumi- The healer. Cute and kawaii and totally useful. Useful even in solos.  Has a teleport ability and a self heal for sustainability across game modes. One of the most balanced options to take care of you, and others.
[*]Matari- The elusive goddess. Odds are you're playing against probably 30 Mataris per lobby, just saying. She has teleports, and goes invisible like a slithery little snake. Good luck facing against her.
[*]Tarka Ji- This drunken Chad is a ball of fire, literally. He goes zoom zoom real quick for is ultimate ability and launches fireballs and other theatrical stuff. His ultimate still has an infinite combo which is at least super hard to pull off, but still needs taken out of the game (lol). Lots of fun to play, useful in solo and trios. 
[*]Temulch- I have not played much of Temulch but his abilities are most certainly useful. He is excellent in late game situations in solos due to the zoning of his ultimate ability making it very hard for players to effectively do anything.
[*]Tianhi (Monk)- The calm monk, until he isn't and becomes a gaint 25 foot four armed goliath. Good F skill and obviously his ultimate, lots of fun (unless the monk is on the other team). Quite sustainable but lacks get away like many other non-teleporters do. If someone presses V, RUN.
[*]Yoto Hime- This is my main. While I am branching out and using almost everyone, she has been my go to from the start. She's a lot of fun, and has the ability to be super aggro.  Deals high damage with her ultimate ability (even after nerf) and her F can be useful in a lot of different ways. All in all a good hero but lacks in sustainability and survivability. 
[/list]

[h2] PRO/CON LIST [/h2]

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Excellent combat system
[*]Though parkour system has it's issues, it is in the end very enjoyable
[*]Grappling system S-tier
[*]Choice of characters makes the game very hard to feel dull
[*]Deathmatch mode provides good practice
[*]Custom games provide good practice if you have people willing to practice with you and get good (look up fight clubs)
[*]Game is fairly well balanced, and is closely observed and updated
[*] No Pay-to-play implementations (yet)
[*] Character Glyphs offer good customization and can really vary with different playstyles
[*] The hero skins are for the most part pretty sick looking. Weapon skins are pretty awesome as well.
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Parkour system can be a little clunky at times, but often there is a workaround that you just haven't learned yet
[*]If the lobbying system ever matches you up with ""quite challenging"" lobbies it can be well... Quite Challening. But not in a good way.  I was getting quite challenging lobbies pretty early on in my solo queues which in my humble opinion shouldn't happen with such a wide fanbase.  When trying to learn the game it's a bit tilting to get infinite combo'd by someone at silver 5, lol. 
[*]Parrying- I'm quite skeptical on the parrying frames. It could very well be due to my lack of knowledge thus far, but the frames for weapons seems to differ pretty drastically at times for when a parry registers and when it doesn't.  It is often quite hard to learn such mechanics in fights so that is when fight clubs are even more useful.
[*]While I think the balance is pretty dang good for a game that just came out not even a month ago, I think there are heros that could use some changes, not nerfs. I think Matari is completely overused and for good reason. I think she has way too much escape and sustain. Kurumi can be completely busted playing in solos as long as you don't get third party'd by someone not minding their own business, lol. Meanwhile champions like Temulch fall off due to the other options being so much easier to use and maintain and a lot less SITUATIONAL
[*]I still can't decide whether I like the implementation of bots or not, TBD
[*]The pistol sucks. Take it out or change the mechanics, because W.O.W.
[/list]

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
All in all, this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a very long time.  The intricacy and in-depth detail of the combat system as well as the fighting mechanics make it a game I WANT to learn.  If I lose, I keep playing because I WANT to improve, I don't quit because I am tilted. I always take something from the loss and learn from it, or try my best to. There's room in this game for everyone, so hop on in. Just watch out for the shadow (unless you have Tu' Na).

The Mayor"
6836,very good
6837,"This game is very fast paced, difficult and mainly for the melee combat lovers. A lot of replayability is there , skins are awesome , need to buff/nerf some characters.


Need customisability and more skins for Yoto Hime.

Most skins of the male characters are really boring :D.


Counter block system is kinda good but i think it can be improved."
6838,Fun to play. Even more fun to master.
6839,"Fun game, Assassins Creed meets Soul Caliber in a Battle Royale"
6840,"good game, tons of fun, but server match up really sucks, and could run better but im on US servers but it puts me in another server and i get tons of lag issues and spikes, fix this problem and you have yourself a long standing contender"
6841,Zhen dao is all you need
6842,"Here are my takes from the game (Posted 08/09/2021)

Pros
+Unique
+very fun
+high skill cap
+Really nice looking skins (not for everyone but genuinely some look very good)
+melee combat is exciting
+feels rewarding to get a win
+great movement
+no fall damage
+great solos or with friends
+the weapons feel great to use

Cons
- ranged weapons aren't great(except 1-2)
- very difficult when getting to higher ranks
- after some playtime harder to play casually as combat is intense (can only play casually if you don't mind getting killed often)
- Players joining your server from other countries have lag which is very hard to play against and has caused me multiple times to lose when against the last person due to not being able to parry attacks (and yes they were timed right the attack went straight through this isn't a salty point just was due to lag) or their character teleporting due to lag.
- apparently new characters being released will cost the free currency/premium currency which for a paid for game should never be the case and i can see many of the community leaving the game especially if it feels pay to win.


As i said i love this game, I really hope it succeeds, the benefits of this game are great and it's so fun and feels so good to play however there are quite a few issue the game needs to sort if this game can become as amazing as it should be. If the game doesn't fix the issues and does make a bunch of characters behind a pay wall, especially if they are too strong then unfortunately i don't think the game will survive but i really do hope that wont be the case as it's so refreshing from other BR games."

6845,fire as FUCK
6846,"game is ok , but need fix some bugs with walls, and re-make the dagger again i was try to main dagger and they nerfeed and changes the skill to...
And i like deathmach so much but they are no reward and nothing so lost of time.
anyway its a good game for kill your time."
6847,Servers are whack
6848,VERY NOICE
6849,"Lots of fun for the first 2weeks, now the invasino of chinese players gets more and more obvious.

I managed to hit plat 3 in trios, took a week break and came back to EU servers being crampped with only chinese names, and more than half of them having bad ping (not assuming, the hud shows when they have bad connection) 

the NA and EU community will slowly die (like it does right now) untill they fix the chinese invasion, pubg never did it and look how unplayable and dead it is, just because they refused to do anything about the chinese invasion.

The skill difference is already huge because they got their hands on the game way sooner, but the fact they have such a crazy ping advantage too is beyond me, Devs promised to deal with it soon, and said they would talk in the news in their discord on the 08.09, but they didnt even mentioned it! 

Do not buy this game, its simply not worth the money untill they keep their promise and deal with high ping abusers who VPN onto other servers.

this is probably the most fun BR i've played, and quickly became my least enjoyable one at the same time."
6850,it good fun time good time
6851,holy shit these animations
6852,best battle royal ive played
6853,"Naraka is a wildly unstable game; It freezes like nothing you've ever played - sometimes for up to around 8 seconds at a time. I've gotten multiple random disconnects when my internet connection to everything else on my PC was perfectly fine. Sometimes the game doesn't ever unfreeze and just crashes instead. Sometimes my internet browser will crash while playing Naraka and is unfixable to the point where I have to restart the entire machine. At least one of these problems is basically guaranteed if you alt tab for even a second during any loading screen. I can say with the upmost confidence that these issues have lost me at least 30 rounds, enough to make me lose count. Sometimes everything runs smoothly, but then you run into an opponent dealing with one of the aforementioned issues which ruins the experience anyways by either giving you an unsatisfying free kill, or by dying to a Chinese player on a VPN who is teleporting around the battlefield cause they have 500 ping.

These issues are frustrating for sure, but it's amplified tenfold because past all of these constant technical issues is a wildly fun and refreshing Battle Royale game.

When Naraka works, its one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences I've had in a long time. The melee combat is a much more engaging and exciting take on the BR formula than any other game in the genre I've seen. The rock-paper-scissors formula of basic attacking, focus attacking, or parrying is simple enough to understand and get the hang of while more advanced mechanics baked in like jump/crouch/dash canceling, weapon and character specific combos, and souljades that change the properties of your weapon's attacks give the battle system some much appreciated depth that keeps you playing more rounds and striving to become a better player. 

Gameplay is enhanced with 7 different characters each with unique, customizable abilities who are all unlocked for free at the beginning of the game - along with new characters confirmed by the devs to be released later for in-game currency. (Yoto Hime is only free for a limited time I think, so might not be free when you read this) With 5 different melee weapons each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, there's a lot of mechanics to learn and utilize. Of course there are still a multitude of different ranged weapons to wield, each also with their own different properties, but you wont be winning any full on fights with just these ranged options. This is because of how fast and fluid the movement in the game is. With grapple hooks and fast vertical movement a la Assassin's Creed (and actually less frustrating than AC), there are plenty of ways to reposition and maneuver around a fight and find different angles of attack.

The game is surprisingly entirely skill based, with the only aspect not being totally level at first is the glyph system - which is reminiscent of old League runes. Unlike old League runes however, it's extremely easy it is to completely max out your glyphs in Naraka with currency earned from playing the game. 

When you want a break from the BR mode, want to practice new combos and tech, or just want to de-tilt from the constant connection issues that got you killed very first 3 ranked games in a row, you can't do much better than the Bloodbath mode. This deathmatch style game mode is more fast paced and low stakes than the classic BR modes; with 10 minutes to score as many points as possible by killing as many other players as you can with the entire game's arsenal available from the start. It's an enjoyable change of pace and I hope to see more unique game modes released in the future.

When it works, Naraka is one of the most enjoyable Battle Royale experiences you can get. It's up to the devs at this point to keep me playing for a lot longer by ironing out connection and stability issues, because if left unattended for long enough it could change the recommendation of this review."
6854,"After only 2hours i can tell its a classic netease game the concept is good but this game has no future. Games with Netease relation wont get fixed. I see already alot of bugs, clunky gameplay and alot of skins. If the game doesnt get into the hands of another company it will be milked to death with no fix on gameplay but skin releases every 2 weeks. I dont recommend buying it except u looking for a game u play with your friends for a few days have a bit fun and let it sit untouched for the rest of its time.

6868,"DO NOT buy this game.

I have made two posts of the discussion of this game.

The first one, related to staff abuse on discord, the lack of addressing the issues of Chinese players playing on NA to abuse ping to get an advantage over NA players, and the Staff team making fun of users who complained:

https://steamcommunity.com/app/1203220/discussions/0/3044984779779821154/


https://i.gyazo.com/da07a30de87d291d3d60cc252985a400.png


The SECOND post is about how we was PROMISED that 9/6/2021, Archer, the developer of the game, would give us an EXACT ETA of when the ping lock issues would be added to the game, that never happened. We was ignored.


https://steamcommunity.com/app/1203220/discussions/0/3044985340421792511/




The development team DOES NOT CARE about you, or anyone. They have things overpriced in the game, where you need to spend $10.00 on steam, to get a $5.00 item. They are focusing on PS5 releases over fixing the game. There is INCREDIBLY imbalancing, and now the CN ping issue. On top of that, the Chinese players are not only abusing ping ,but ARE ALSO hacking in the game with speed hacks. I even have a recording of that too:

https://clips.twitch.tv/HonestEnchantingHerbsDuDudu-Ka4GpcncCnHUPnPG


This game is going to die. The Discord mod team is abusive, and think it's funny to make fun of you, or anyone else who complains. The support team don't care about what happenes in discord, or anything else with their robot responses, and the dev team doesn't care that people are abusing their game as long as money keeps getting dropped on them.


MY FAIR WARNING TO ALL OF YOU. DO NOT BUY NARAKA: BLADEPOINT!










***EDIT***

You may notice some of my links don't work in this review.

That's because THE STAFF TEAM DELETED IT TO HIDE THE ISSUES.


I made a video about it instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pYJ3YH-Fyw


There has been more abuse since then.


UPDATE 9/18/2021

Chinese ping abusers are NOT only abusing ping to win, but are now speed hacking, AS WELL as teaming in solo matches to fix games.

6870,"The game is fun and all good but at this moment it has many problems.
- 70% of my opponents are Chinese players with long swords with legendary gear after 5 minutes of game or bots
- Every competitive player plays Monk or Ratari because they have ""save your life"" skills.
- Weapons. First it was dagger. Now its long sword. Its worse than dagger. You cant even properly parry it ...

Overall a nice game, hoping they fix it.
"
6871,good
6872,"Cool concept. 
But really poor optimization and awful sever ping sometimes."
6873,game not fun
6874,"Theoretically Naraka is a good Battle royal idea, with high end melee skill ceiling. But in fact, when you look closer to the gameplay, you will feel like a 2 year old boy trying is best to beat the hell out of your dad playing Streetfighter. Clearly the ""high end melee skill"" is a double edged sword. Where, Yes, this game as a potential, but you will need to put 10000 hours to feel like you actually understand what you are doing.

""Great, you can parry, dash, cancel."" but until you play with top player this won't serve you as no one knows what is he doing. Spamming, charging, dashing everywhere.
But it's a BR so you will receive enough dopamine to continue playing until you break your keyboard."
6875,"Terrible matchmaking. 

In ranked matchmaking, I am getting matched with streamers and chinese players who are 2 - 3 tier ranks above mine. These streamers already have many hours invested in the game, from playing the alpha, beta and chinese test server. 

Chinese players with VPNs are smurfing in other servers, their low ping causes them to lag and teleport. Countering these players becomes inconsistent and their characters teleport behind or suddenly out of your field of view. This is frustrating to play against."
6876,Give SA Servers Please!
6877,"very nice game to play with friend !! <3 
recommended to buy this game WOHO
#JERUNGMERAHNIBOSH"
6878,awesome game
6879,"This game is so refreshing.
First things first i wish they hadn't put ranked in on launch...but it is what it is.

This game is awesome tbh, finally a BR with actual melee combat and combos that take time to learn and perfect, this is one of the first if not the only game as a BR that i've put considerable time into actually practicing and trying to get better at. 

Seeing someone beat me doesn't make me flame like i used to, i simply note what they did and go into custom to work on a way to counter the combo or the way they played to better myself. This is one of those games where you'll get out of it what you put into it, and the learning curve is pretty steep which may bar the entry of noobies a tad but it is what it is.

The way that cosmetics is handled IS through loot boxes but honestly they give you so many in the battle pass, and if you grind enough you'll be able to buy out the entire ""Spectral silk"" store through the battlepass alone. I dont quite remember what the BP price was but i think it was like $20? And 20 bucks for 80 days worth of grinding is pretty awesome if you ask me. 

There of course are downsides to any game and this ones aren't exactly major but they're really annoying. 
First off, in trios being m1 spammed to death is a thing due to melee attacks applying an x second stun after landing and not becoming ""Stun immune"" can cause you to just get mowed down if your teammates ditch you or vice versa.

Currently I've noticed my counters NOT countering even though im full red when the blue attack comes and that's reeeaaalllyyyy frustrating. But aside from these two things the game is everything i could've asked for.

TL;DR 
Pros: Great Gameplay, Solid monetization, Decent community, SOLID Dev/Pub team.
Cons: (Potentially con) Learning curve, Minor gameplay annoyances."
6880,"A REAL DEAL CHINESE KUNGFU BATTLE ROYALE GAME!

Graphic is GORGEOUS! 
Gameplay is MARVELOUS!
Customisation is ENORMOUS!
Lootboxes are GROUNDBREAKING!
Getting Kills are MAGNIFICENTLY FUN!
Getting Killed are ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS!

10/10 - REAL DEAL and worth every penny you've spent (exd. - Loot box treasure hunting)
"
6881,Memang terboek kasi try bah haiya
6882,"Duo queue is here, decent and fun game"
6883,Fun game with good mechanics.
6884,great game
6885,"I like it so far

Edit: I don't like it anymore."
6886,"PROS
- Unique. No other game does multiplayer melee battle royale in this fashion. 
- Combat. Obviously. Very high level of skill expression available. If you're a fast learner, you will dominate.
- Graphics. Nice art direction and map design as well. Details everywhere.
- Customization. Face, hair, clothes, accessories, emotes, you name it this game has it.

CONS
- Optimization. Devs, you need to do DX12 support ASAP. The frame drops during big teamfights are horrendous. Maybe do different Level Of Detail for the enemy player models too.
- Monetization. It's almost abusive. Paid game with battle pass, loot boxes and DLC? Yeah."
6887,"Very fun game for skilled people.
But if you`re a scrub you`ll get toxic really fast..."
6888,"Graphics are pretty bad and the game run considerably bad for how low definition the game really is. Otherwise, there's nothing new or fun about this battle royale at all other than being a 90% parkour game so the only hype behind it are all the PUBG nerds that are just bored and over PUBG. Huge pass on this game that will die out soon."
6889,"This game is really wasting money due to graphing assist that make u can't 1v3 or escape the fight. Moreover, weapon is not balance at all like greatsword is too OP"
6890,"Beautiful characters design, good game play, but this game has an awful server and suck terrible optimization."
6891,the right idea but still a long way to go
6892,much fun
6893,Like
6894,"I still stand by what I said before minus Spear doing too much damage - That was addressed.

It's a generic BR setup (you get into a lobby, choose location, get teleported to your chosen location after a minute)
However what separates this from the rest is the Fighting Game-esque melee combat. On surface level it's easy to get a hang of, parry this, focus that and do damage however you can.

But as you play more and go higher the game turns into quite an advanced chase for eachothers health - The player emergent-behaviour is what drives the competitive aspect. Lots of animation cancels, tricks, frame advantages (forced stagger... which isn't cool) and to top it all off, perfectly timed parries to turn the tides of fights.

This game closely scratches the itch that GunZ created. It gets overwhelmingly mechanical. And this has just happened this past month so its future growth is looking to be exponential as there are norms forming - like focus canceling for movement, uppercut setups for aerial damage etc.

One of the coolest (and dumbest) things is ""infinite"" combo by Tarka Ji, which resembles Cloud from Final Fantasy VII doing an Omnislash. The setup is that they use their ultimate, knock the target up and keep them there for... 30 slices as they repeatedly circle them with uppercuts. This is enabled due to the ultimate ""unleashing"" the mechanics of the game by removing restrictions like not allowing to animation cancel ALL moves, while managing energy to create a near-infinite cycle.

BUT...


It's $20. It's a BR by design. It has downsides. I think even with that I've had my fun with it so far.

The current problematic aspect is that there's a difference between practicing (labbing) your combos and then playing it out on... not the best connected player. With equal ping it's a very responsive game... With not so equal ping it feels like some battles were cheated out because the game didn't read your ""hit"" as a ""connect"" on their game. This becomes an immense advantage as battles can easily be drawn out to knife's edge if you factor abilities of the characters into it.

There are some weapons that feel more overpowering than others, like Greatsword which is sort of the turtle... and dragon at the same time. It was meant to be a ""counter"" weapon but it's also the hardest hitting weapon without countering and when it counters it forces the enemy to do a knowledge check which entails guessing the attack and then timing the parry accordingly... Or dodging away pre-emptively.

...and Longsword which is the hot topic right now after Dagger was tuned down a little. Mainly for creating stagger chains that feel unrewarding to parry or generally go against. So instead of a dance with the enemy it becomes one guy showing his moves on the dance floor as you kind of wait him to get it over with.

That being said there are region or ping locks on the way, likely some balancing issues already being addressed, but not shipped.

As a new player you're put against bots for first few ranks, to not throw you into the pit immediately... But as you adapt it allows you to meet some of the players mentioned above more frequently. There should be multiple streamers/youtubers to help you get accustomed.

This is mostly SOLOS perspective, Trios is just pure chaotic ability mayhem and most of what I said doesn't apply to this mode. But briefly, Trios is the mode you go to have fun with if you can't be bothered with the competitive nature of solos."
6895, Breath of fresh air in the BR landscape
6896,ngl kinda gaming
6897,"NIce game, I never leave a review except this game
Don't just go and buy, runnnnnnnn for it"
6898,"Smurf every where, so hard to play :("
6899,very spammy game not fun should be free
6900,Sekiro rides a Crouching Tiger to meet PUBG *****
6901,"This game is fun for a battle royale, I would rate it 7/10. However, the game can runs poorly on HDD unless you transfer the files to SSD which sucks and the combat should be more refined. Being combo’d without being able to parry or dodge can be annoying."
6902,nice
6903,Good game. It reminds to Rakion- 1 of my favorite PK Game in the past
6904,Great!
6905,A game i never knew i wanted to play
6906,"nice break from modern day fighting, cant wait to see updates in the future"
6907,"As it is I would not recommend. Game has huge balance issues that makes the game super stale and doesn't allow for you to try other builds. Devs don't really care even though at pro play, it's just everyone using the same characters with the same weapons doing the same tactics."
6908,Very very fun
6909,"this game is very good, this is really the game i was looking for hahaha i am a fan of battle royale games but after i saw naraka wow i feel this is the game i am looking for different from other battle royale concepts this is like traditional battle royale hahaha i really like it, unique game"
6910,prett good but ive spent 75% of the time in character customis=z';dation they are so hot
6911,Good
6912,yes
6913,"it's definetly worth the price, easy to learn. but hard to master. if you're a casual type player. just go play trios. because Solo is absolutely sweaty game 99% of the time starting from silver. while you can still enjoy chill game even when you're plat on trios.

the combat feel a little bit clunky when you just learn the game. but once you understand the mechanic of the game, it actually feels really smooth. definetly one of the most unique BR game out there"
6914,great game
6915,Very good Game. i like playing it.
6916,"look......just dont do it. 
I know it seems fun at first but you'll regret it, trust me.
Or do what you want idc. It's your life.
I'm just some guy on the internet trying to save you from the agonizing realization that you've wasted hours of your life trying to learn the mechanics of an un-optimized garbage fire of a game that devolves into "" whoever has the most movement consumables wins""
Not JUST that mind you. There's also the whole rock paper scissors combat mechanic that leaves you feeling like none of your 3 work the same as your opponents. Their rock hits harder, scissors cut deeper, paper has essay that you cant read etc.
Or maybe.......its JUST me.......
Maybe you are the chosen 1 with divine abilities to beat all the odds. The 1 man army that can defeat any foe regardless of how atrocious their PING is.
Time will tell i guess."
6917,"I like the game, but I cannot recommend it without a ping filter. The NA servers are over run with people from 150ms to 300+ms, making the experience less than optimal."
6918,great
6919,"If you were considering trying it, you definitely should."
6920,Good game if you don't run into Chinese vpn users that are flying everywhere
6921,"The game was working fine the first few days. Now it keeps crashing every 2-3 minutes. I literally cant play anymore. I tried everything to fix. It is poorly optimized after researching online that many people are having the same issues. Sucks because I really enjoyed the game before it started crashing all the time

works now"
6922,"+ really fun combat compared to other battle royales.
+ feels more balanced and skill based play, because it's mostly melee combat with combos.
+ really cool japanese aesthetic and graphics.
+ already seems quite popular and can get twitch prime gaming loot for it."
6923,swag
6924,The servers at the bodega on the corner are better than this game
6925,"Pros:
- limitless climbing, wallrunning, movement mechanics
- combat is superb
- no building

Cons:
- monetization is off for a $20 game, but no different than PUBG i guess"
6926,i love it
6927,The game is great but it's over run by lag/ping abusing players from certain regions in the world. I would recommend it if you don't want to take it at all seriously or you want to just duel 1v1 but i can't recommend it as a BR.
6928,honkers bounce when changing outfit.. why no work on guy dinky too?
6929,"a friend recommended me this game because i enjoy playing samurai warriors, dynasty warriors, and the like. i'm not a fan of battle royales or shooters, so i was hesitant to purchase. but i couldn't be more surprised by how fun the game is. the customization is great, environments are beautiful, and physics feel snappy and responsive. if you're on the fence: do it"
6930,this is new for me i just ply fps and i was tired but this one bring something new for me
6931,longsword go brrrrrr
6932,"The Gameplay mechanics are neat, Waifu customization is top notch.
Monetization method is questionable, you have to buy the game and then also there's a loot box system AND battle pass system. Fun game for sure, however with your first few games being against bots its a real slog to get started.
I'd like to come back maybe in a year or so and see if these are addressed because the potential is there for this game."
6933,"If you into attack on titan, you gonna love this :D"
6934,"Fun game, Assassins Creed meets Soul Caliber in a Battle Royale."
6935,nerf the bloodripper please or else
6936,jiggle physics.
6937,nice
6938,Good
6939,"Every game is a mix of bots and west Taiwanese (China)... unplayable mess, I don't recommend that game until they fix it with a ping lock... Which might not even happen...

After an additional 52 hours let's ADD the scamming system that are the lootboxes, the unbalanced heroes and weapons, the lack of communication by the devs... only good thing is the chinese getting banned then crying and insulting everyone in the discussion to get banned there as well..

Otherwise it would be a great game BUUUUUT then again the devs don't give a flying F about you, they just want your money and fake the reviews to get a positive note and sell more"
6940,Very good game
6941,"amazing game
"
6942,"The melee combat weapon combo is incredibly fun, diverse and difficult,  making this fighting game + BR hybrid really refreshing. Has been a while since last time I'm this addicted to a game and want to get better. It is a good feeling. 

另外这也是我见过对“武侠”概念还原度最高的PVP游戏。非常有那种武林高手飞檐走壁见招拆招的感觉..不知不觉就中二了起来OwO"
6943,By far my favorite br
6944,"Changing my review. cheaters everywhere, anticheat is a joke. No region lock, so NA servers are flooded with Chinese cheaters."
6945,"It's a high paced rock paper scissors battle royale with combos and creative movement. It is hard to learn at first, but what fighting game isn't hard to learn at first? Once you get past that wall the game becomes really fun. The skillcap is extremely high and every character feels unique. If you have trouble learning while you play you could always go into training mode or do custom games and fight other players that way instead of loading into Bloodbath or the BR."
6946,"Nothing to say anymore, the game is really good."
6947,Fun to play and unique in its own way
6948,"On EU-realms in gold and higher ranked lobbies 60-80% of the lobby will be chinese names with high-ping. Those players are almost impossible to counter/disarm since their animations are already completely on their side with high ping, when the counterable/disarmable animation shows on your end its already too late."
6949,good game needs to fix the lag
6950,fun to fly
6951,kayanya belum ada cheat nih game.. sementara ini masih mantab.
6952,"Your first handful of games will be against bots to ease you in, but once you come up against other players you will get your ass handed to you. If you like a challenge, enjoy learning mechanics, and want something to play a bit different than just another fps game, then this is for you."
6953,Booba
6954,very cool game i love it
6955,Fun game but gotta be ruined by hackers and lag issues! Hoping for improvements before the game is dead.
6956,"WIll take some times to get used to the controls, after you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun. But do not recommend you to do Trio without full party (rando sux). With a bit of RNG, you can dominate the game. Good luck playing!"
6957,Mantap
6958,i like this game but my pc cant play 80fps :((
6959,es fun
6960,lag
6961,Good game. The game play is almost the same with Shadow Arena but with more game modes.
6962,"Game feels very blah atm way to many bots in lobbies should be more actual players.

refunded"
6963,hard game but worth it once you practise
6964,Fun and stuff until you hear the deflect sound
6965,"+ Fun combat
+ Great animated shorts
+ Character depth
+ Scenery is awesome

However....

- The game is extremely difficult. 4 weeks in and I'm still getting absolutely battered (silver 1 atm, EU).
- To add to that, too many Chinese players on EU playing with high ping / smurfing (their rank doesn't get carried over from their server). I can't learn or at least have fun against them.
- Game needs polishing. Although the combat is fun, things just need balancing. For eg, fighting against a greatsword is high risk low reward. Or players spamming spear and you just can't get away.
- Parry system needs tweaking. Am I too late or too early, ping plays an affect to this
- Can't mute team-mates. Instead you need to turn voice chat off completely.
- Why isn't the location on the hall of fame have a search button or at least alphabetically arranged?

All in all, good game. Expect to be whacked constantly, I do think a region lock would help that. I also don't understand why they're charging for the game though, when there's a battlepass you're likely to buy already. 

So for the reasons above, I wouldn't recommend buying the game until the region lock is implemented and rankings balanced."

6970,Some footsteps are not accurate. I am running to grass but the sound is on water
6971,"sooo goood, 得想个办法振他一下
"
6972,"Honestly, the only BR that I have found enjoyable. Melee combat makes this super fun, has some combos but isn't like a fighting game with 700 of them to memorize. 

Very enjoyable especially with a couple of buddies for the trios. Hope to see this game do well and not die off because this has filled a void in the BR department I didn't know I was missing out on."
6973,"DELETE LONGSWORD. This wepon super trash. All Noobs in EU servers use this shut.
SWORD CAN'T SHOOT - THIS NOT A GUN!
This game so bad  - zero balance with skill and wepon.
After this game start free like apex legends or dota - you can play.
Now i no reccomended this game to buy."
6974,good game shit bussin bussin no cap
6975,This game is everything I hoped it would be and more. Very fun and addicting.
6976,noice
6977,"addicted to this game is not good, you will spend ur whole time sitting and playing it!!"
6978,"Very hard game so you need to learn it. Tough learning curve, but this game is definitely one of the best BR out right now"
6979,chinese fornite
6980,very goood
6981,"Good yes!
POOPSHIT !"
6982,BR done right.
6983,"too many lagging EU/ASIA player playing NA server and almost 1 month in they are still yet to fix this critical issues, its not a hard fix or find a temp solution...."
6984,Good game
6985,"Very fun BR with a good deal of unique ends to it. The combat is fun and challenging and wins are extremely rewarding.

The main reason I can't recommend this right now is the absolute INSANE amount of Chinese Smurf VPN players sitting on NA servers just abusing the poor bloodied anuses of us ACTUAL NA players. Not to mention, the shit ping works in their favor for counters and hit detection. Region lock players to the server with their highest ping and you won't hear any more complaints from most people."
6986,Good!
6987,My Friend buy it for me and after a few weeks I buy him the upgraded battlepass as a thanks you since we both liked it a LOT and played it till late when we have free time (usually once a week) If you like battle royals and RPG games than this game is perfect for you!
6988,nice
6989,"this is a nice game, i Chanh it 3000 =))"
6990,haha fork knife but guns bad and pick axe rule i hate my self
6991,"Thumbs down. enjoy playing ""Quite Challenging"" games every time vs chinese smurfs and get your asshole reamed"
6992,"Super fun game, and a lot of bang for your buck."
6993,10 minute queues for OCE with no actual OCE servers anyway so get put in SEA. 10 minutes for a SEA game is too much for me.
6994,I very cool and I play NARAKA. If you want to be cool then you should also play NARAKA. Thank you for read this very epic.
6995,"Its a mix of battle royale and free for all multiplayer match-up, samurai version. really recommended to all players that love the intense fighting and all out action. If you think your tilted kinda player then you might wanna think twice of buying this game. but overall I love how this game came out and looking forward for the future updates."

6998,Very good game with nice Chinese art styles and buildings. I also got the battle pass and enjoy the game so much. My KD is still low but I can feel I am improving.
6999,this is a refreshing take on battle royale!  the combat is fluid and has flavors of for honor.  grab some friends and jump in!
7000,"very challenging game, never make me bored"
7001,"Wait for the game to go F2P or on sale. It acts exactly like a F2P BR game and all the microtransactions that come along with it. That being said the combat is fun, although it does need some more balance passes."
7002,"Excellent combat, good climbing. Too much monitarization for a B2P title."
7003,love it
7004,has fun gameplay and it looks pretty nice
7005,awesome game visually and mechanically so far but the death of this game will be the lack of region lock
7006,Maybe add some skins for Viper Ning that wears sandals and add customisation for nails.
7007,"Yes, just yes, play the game :D"
7008,"this game is a fucking joke. you are matched with laggy people using VPN from other regions and 6 out of 10 times parry doesnt register, and when it does you have a 50% chance to have it ghosted and doing nothing. Ingame delay shows up as 40-50, and its 80-150 in task manager"
7009,"For free stuff use this invitation code:
chqfapc677"
7010," the control options are limited , I couldn't enjoy the game"
7011,Definitely a game with huge potential for sweaty yet enjoyable gameplay. May need some fine tuning here and there but the devs seem to be actively working on that
7012,Chinese fantasy put together right on point.
7013,"spam mouse 1 and you win
"
7014,"If you can put in the time to learn its mechanics, the game is fun and plays like a fighting game with fast paced, fluid movement. 
However, it's not worth playing or buying until a ping restriction is implemented on servers. Combat mechanics fall apart completely when playing against players that connect to servers overseas to avoid playing in their own region. On the NA server, lobbies frequently have more of these overseas players than actual NA region players, and this problem is exacerbated depending on the time of day you play."
7015,kosom l lag
7016,yes
7017,play it. its dope.

7019,"This game is sooo fun ive only sunk in 70+ hours as of this posting and the skill ceiling is so high in this game it wants you to learn about it which i love learning and invest more time into it, i recommend it to ppl who like or are trying to get into the genre and its very unique because of the melee combat and the movement, only thing is if the game had region lock to balance the games more and also optimize it for it to be better. 8/10"
7020,"After 160+hours(210+hrs including beta), ranked 140-150 solos NA. I've officially uninstalled. The game is extremely frustrating playing against players from other regions taking advantage of the high ping (specifically Chinese players) . Having High speed internet for once puts me at a disadvantage in a video game.. (wow that's ridiculous) 850mbps Upload and 250mbps download.  

I'm fine with loosing to high tier one players, because I can fully admit that they 1) either outplayed me or 2) were just better than me, but to loose to a Chinese player who just won out of luck because my focus attacks did not register is extremely frustrating. Even worse is when one of these players taking advantage of high pings end up surviving because my hits did not register and runs away, comes back to follow me and wait till I win another fight only to jump in and third party me while I'm healing."
7021,"In fights, ping spikes and you can't block or dodge enemy attacks at the right time.
Microlags are also included."
7022,Game is great but the chinese people in the game are not region locked so lag does hurt but the biggest issue is they team meaning if your paying 3's there are at least a few chinese groups together so they are running 9 or 12 strong which makes it very very hard to win and hurts your rank

7032,"After several hours of gameplay I finally decided to provide my own review of Naraka.
[h1]Please don't get disheartened by me not recommending it, but instead read carefully all the pros and cons I list and weigh yourself if you think this game could be worth playing.[/h1]
My final assessment depends mostly on the price tag for product provided, compared to what other Battle Royales offer, plus the general gist of what interested me in the game the most. (fight mechanics)

[b]Pros:[/b]

[olist]
  [*] The game is incredibly fluid and fast-paced. More so than any other Battle Royale I enjoyed.
  [*] The artstyle is gorgeous and unique among what most other games offer.
  [*] Most of fight mechanics are, in fact, well adjusted. Many players complain about them, not being able to adapt and find out how to counter each specific move. A few hours spent in Free for All brawl and 1v1 duels do wonders and enable users focused on perceiving how others play to adjust their playstyle and improve, extending their chances of finally doing something worthy and fun in the game.
  [*] The game placed its strategic Battle Royale gameplay well, Teams of three can set up goals based on where rare loot occurs more frequently, go for stashes that occasionally spawn after 1st phase of circle diminishing, try to chase team opening a vault and so on. Quest mechanic works well, and unlike some commenters claim, the team defending against a Bounty quest actually can see if the team hunting them closes in, can set up an ambush. Ambush gameplay in itself is brilliant and offers much in terms of enjoyment.
  [*] That the game pairs newcomers with bots actually is a welcome mechanic that allows them to train enough to be able to fight actual players.
  [*] Both the rune and skill alternatives for heroes systems appear to be fun addition.
  [*] The game offers really nice variety of weapons and heroes to choose from. For a melee Battle Royale current amount of playstyles and weapons to choose from seems satisfying.

[/olist]

[b] Cons [/b]

[olist]

  [*] First often mentioned issue is lagging players. It's unfortunate they are to be paired within other servers.
My view is that this could be easily handled with special servers dedicated to Asian players playing with VPN.
Harmonising their interests with players from other servers shouldn't be an issue given possiblity of using VPNs from other, low-ping countries for a given server data center location.
  [*] The dash mechanic. It can, at moments, be wonderously viable, but, very often, without locking onto another player with tilde key [noparse][`][/noparse] it fails it's intended purpose of dodging horizontal attacks. Most of the players don't get accustomed to it precisely because the game does not stress enough locking on mechanic, instead favouring aim help mechanics. (attack and grapple aim help)
  [*] The game has big price tag for a product with additional microtransactions that are the only viable way to unlock some of the cosmetics. My calculations find out that, roughly, players are expected to grind about 100 play hours before opening enough chests for just one special cosmetic to unlock. This is comparable to many Free to Play alternative titles, with additional quirk that they actually allow players to influence what consmetics they would want instead of it being random. (for example, by controlling this with in-game currency that's not shared with other systems, such as rune system in Naraka)
  [*] Finally, the most unwelcome drawback of Naraka as of early builds, is that the game is [b]severly unbalanced[/b] in terms of both weapons and heroes available.

[list]

  [*] [b]Longsword charged slashes[/b] offer insane range and speed of execution compared to how other weapons behave using their mechanics. The range of charged slash offers highly annoying defense against counter combo, should a defending player manage to parry such an attack.
Moreover, the hitbox or travel speed of slash wave is so incredible that often it becomes an achievement in itself to counter it in timely manner. Compare katana's charged instanteous attack, whose both range and execution predictability seem to feel far more well-adjusted.

  [*] [b]Yoto Hime[/b], in general. Her skillset offers not only vast offensive power, but it also gives her overpowered survivability. Regular skill, F rotating blade (Spirit Slash) can disrupt players before they even attack, allowing her to jump-attack them afterwards. or escape them. The regular variant of the skill allows to refresh this on each kill, which, I understand, is not getting a player knocked and timeout / spawn as a ghost, but in fact[b]any[/b] kill. This is incredibly punishing in long teamfights. Compare about any primary skill of any other hero, most considerably, Temulch's F (Zephyr Wind) which simply disrupts an opponent for [b]up to[/b] 3 seconds.
Then, her ultimate. Not only it can be executed fast, killing an epic-armor wearing player in just two shots (sic!) out of three available, not only it renders her immune to disruptions during the execution, glowing yellow - it also makes her jump up like Temulch's F, making her much harder to deal with, and allows to move around, using considerable range of the blade to out-range everyone. I've already had my fair deal of Yotos overwhelming entire teams of players with this ultimate to assess she's overly broken hero. The ability to see enemies' health to assess where they are and whom to focus is just a cherry on the top of this unbalanced skill.

Does it help her ultimate is effectively a skillshot? Not by fair margin, as it's execution is easy enough after mastering.

Compare Tarka Ji's variant of ultimate (Blackout) enabling to throw multiple fireballs. It's vastly less reliable in terms of his own survivability while executing, while retaining most over characteristics, including raw firepower.

  [*] Last but not least, the [b]broken Tianhai[/b].

While his regular F ability, Divine Bell, seems to offer balanced enough utility (with the exception of disarmament for unsuspecting players, whose weapon(s) he may immediately pick up with enough weapon slots saved for this purpose) his ultimate, Titan's Call, is the single most broken thing in Naraka. I won't stress this enough - this ability isn't about him being able to turn the tables, returning to full health or even about the damage he deals - it's simply about his utility of grabbing up to two players of the opposing team, completelly shutting them down while the third one is ganked. It's not nerfed in any considerable length by disallowing its use indoors, since most of the gameplay under current map encourages fight in open spaces, usually making last circles exclusively open space fights.

Above OP heroes can be countered to a degree, with some hero skills, but still don't feel quite balanced.

  [*] The last minor inconvenience is how grapple has this tiny stun effect. I would completely remove it, given how grapple attacks can only be effectively countered with charged attacks, which is quite hard given player has to charge the attack before being grappled to be effective, and grapples cannot be easily expected beforehand.

For some of the fight mechanics of this game I cannot stress enough how I adore them.
For instance, how greatsword charged vertical kind of ""blocks"" incoming light attacks, how dagger combos favour in-air combat and offer great utility (light attack-dash-horizontal attack jump, for instance, or vertical attack downdive utility), how the game rewards spear handling players for placing a well-timed charged attack.

I also have some qualms over ranged combat. Some ranged weapons offer incredible utility retaining their damage (bows - high range, cannons - splash effect) compared to pistol / revolver (low range, worse charged damage than bow, requires charging to be effective without gems)
However, ranged combat can easily be countered."
7033,"Interesting spin on Br genre, challenging and rewarding."

7036,Super fun til you get lag stabbed by a Chinese player teleporting around from lag.
7037,"Very solid game and refreshing take on BR games. If you want a break from FPS BR and want to enjoy competitive fighting game type melee combat with hella options I recommend this game. It looks nice and sounds nice(Having a customization feature for the character you play as is pretty cool. You get to see some silly creations as well as some badass ones.).  There is a decent progression system as far as unique character skills,as well as upgrades(with in game currency), which adds further customization for each hero So you can find and create a play style that suits you. The Battle pass and micro-transaction system is eh... but at least its purely cosmetic and Ill leave it at that.There are a few bugs with the parkour but even that is very fun and I love the grappling hook. I cant wait to see what they add in and change in the future, keep in mind this is a new game and they are going to be adding more heroes into the mix."
7038,This game is actually a lot of fun
7039,
7040,good game but probably gonna turn free to play in a year fk u WY
7041,best battle royal game
7042,"Buy to play? a bad Joke who should not be supported. Just greedy Gold digging.

You start playing, think your good until you realize at the match are 90% bots you are over two hours and cant refund it.

If you got an enemie, whos not a bot, he can dash attack you so hard you dont have any chance with the wrong melee weapon to counter"
7043,Yep it's pretty good.
7044,"TLDR
Yes play this game (2 hours is plenty of time to know if it's for you)
Invite Code : chaaf43p8k

CONS

-$15.00 for SSJ hair :(

I would highly recommend watching this game before you buy it as it is very different from a lot of BRs and you should get an idea for the combat to decide if it looks interesting

If you found this review helpful and plan on buying the game please use my invite code when prompted to after first loading into the game, chaaf43p8k this helps me at no cost to you whatsoever. If you have a friend who has this game already, ask them for their invite code instead. It is under ""Torchbearer"" on the menu screen in-game 

I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes skill based melee combat, PvP in any capacity, or BRs in general"
7045,"Some fps drops and optmization seems not really good, but the game is fun and worth 20 bucks"
7046,Absolute blast even if you're bad
7047,"High Skill Ceiling, you will die a lot after your first game. Combat has Light, Focus, & Parry which play rock, paper scissors with each other. Its like a Mix of For Honor & Sekiro. Additional advanced movements which can be learned on youtube. It's clear some people dont like how hard the game is but its worth it once you get the hang of combat. Be careful in Trios, 1v2 & 1v3 is overwhelming.

6.5/10 - Too much stun lock"

7071,"Region lock the fucking servers and the game will be absolutely fine. I've been playing fighting/reaction-based games since I stopped pissing my pants (probably like at least a few months now) and this game is fuckin horse shit, purely because of the players whose names are either Chinese or contain [AS]. Bit of a weird coincidence. Can't say I've died unfairly even once to a player whose name I could read."

7075,this game is chinese based they opened up servers in eu na sea these servers are infested with chinese vpn abusers and the devs for the game do nothing to fix the issues but would rather focus on buffs/nerf and cosmetics in the first 3 weeks of the game.the game has so many bugs and typos from bad translation its pathetic really i would never recomend this game to anyone! THIS GAME IS DESTINED TO FAIL.!
7076,good shit.
7077,Such a beautiful and fun game!! Fighting style is great as well!
7078,"If you wanna be trashed by asian players that lag more than granma's old Modem this is the game for you.

7098,My very first game that i willing to watch you tube and learn how to be good at this game.. is hard to play but i see that’s a challenge for me. Really love this game! If you like a challenge and battle royale you should try this game
7099,good mak mak mak
7100,"I would add positive but they dont have duos so me and a friend are forced to play with people who steal loot, and then solo charge trios and alt f4 as soon as they get quarter health left. Seriously fun if you have a third though. But if not its just a spear gank fest

Edit: Ever since i left this review for some reason performance has dropped hard. But it's ONLY when other players get within a certain distance of me and my team. Pro: we know when people are coming. Con: I have red connection bars the entire fight and like 5 FPS for some reason"
7101,"Although i'm stuttering, awesome game though!"
7102,Nice game
7103,"Game is amazing overall, the main issue right now are the chinese players with high ping. It's impossible to hit them as they keep lagging. The worse side is they are flocking everywhere. I would highly recommend this game, however if you're playing competitively I would not pay for this until the main issue is fixed as dealing with those high ping players is a hell of a nightmare."
7104,"If you have an hdd instead of an ssd I wouldn't bother buying. There is sometimes extreme input lag to the point where the game is nearly unplayable.

Too many Chinese cheaters...

Edit: With the recent season they seem to have downgraded the North American servers...

Edit 2: With the most recent update(2/24/22) the game randomly crashes during fights."
7105,Fun and competitive
7106,unique battle royal!
7107,"The game is full of people abusing high ping and hacks, one game after another there are more chinese players in EU servers then there are other players. Game is good, but they need to fix this ASAP. Not worth buying before this happens!!!"
7108,Alright so I love this game and it was fun until I realized the first few matches are just bots... Gave me a false sense of my abilities in this game. I am absolutely 100% dogshit and the first few matches made me feel like a god. I spent 20 bucks on this game I wish there was a way for me to actually practice after the initial bot matches. It's like it goes from swimming in 2 ft water to being thrown out of a submarine in a trench 8 miles underwater with no oxygen tank and a scuba mask from the dollar store. 🤦🏽‍♂️
7109,"Fun game if you like a more up close combat experience, and not just an other shooter br."
7110,"Awesome game to jump into, with friends or alone. 

The combat is crazy 
The environment is stunning 
Challenging enough to learn characters and skills
Character progression has a good pace

7113,its a fun game.........go play it.....now
7114,HORRIBLE A LOT of exploiting
7115,all off it
7116,Really good br game but Commies from china are ruining the game.
7117,666
7118,Finally a different br game. Only issue I'd say is region lock is needed. Takes time to learn which makes in way more fun once you start to get the mechanics down

game play is fun and satisfying"
7123,"It's a rough game to learn but once you do the combat is exciting and in deph, i'd recommend you to try it but also be patient and understand you will die ALOT. For sure one of the most unique BR's."

Overall 9/10 . Takes skill and hit reg is not bad.
"
7126,"This game has all the makings of a well oiled machine in the idea of a classic battle royale, but seems to suffer from the problem of playerbase resulting in high queue times especially at higher ranks.

Aside from this creeping issue it seems, the game is join to play if you are the type to enjoy the action mmo type games but would rather just jump into pvp right away."
7127,Most fun battle royale I've ever played all time
7128,funnnnnnn
7129,"This game is super fun to play, the combat is really good. The game is a bit hard to learnt he mechanics and combos but when you do know you can have some good fights.

The only thing I dislike about the game is it's not region locked. If Naraka could fix that and add a duos queue then it would make the game so much better. It has huge potential but there's still a lot of things that need to be adjusted to make it better."
7130,Super fun fast paced high skill ceiling br. Needs some work with region vpns and desync issues but still worth the 20 bucks.
7131,"If you like Fighting games or BRs and want to mix it up from just guns whilst feeling like you're straight out of Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Forbidden Kingdom then this is the game for you ! High learning curve but once you ""git gud"" its a blast! 10/10"
7132,"This game is great!!. If you are thinking to buy this game, DO IT. I hate br games, but this brings something unique to the table"
7133,"region lock pls ty

will change if it comes"
7134,this is very good game
7135,"Spamming harpoon to stun a champion is very bad idea especially 3 players in same team, they should do something about this . For me is annoying 1v1 pvp is ok because you don't get spammed by 3 players with harpoon. So at this point as a pvp team game in my opinion is bad."
7136,"It baits and hooks you into itself making you think your good by matching you with bots til about level 6.

After that it dumps you into real matches making you face off against the chinese on american servers! with their desync and cant even get a hit in due to your timing being off.

As of now due to the game depopulating you will only face off against chinese and bots ...you will know your going up against a bot cause they will run into walls or be trapped in buildings...then while your fighting they turn their back to you and try to heal. and you will know your going up against a chinese cause you will get rekt and seeing their chinese character name after you die.


Game is dying in population if you are gunna buy, jump in now cause it is only going to go down from here every second after I post this review. The gameplay is fun....but chinese and bots ruin it

"
7137,"Good game, decent skill cap. Hard to tell if people have cheats or are just rockstar players.  Just an honest thought, although I'm not high skill cap."
7138,"iz gud, very gud game"
7139,"Its good but not quite great.. yet at least. you see someone with a better character skin then you, you know you're about to get rolled. and been able to not do anything against getting grappled sucks big time. but all in all it is and can be pretty fun"
7140,"Real Talk 

This game is great for a battle royal game easily worth the 20 dollars if you are on the fence grab it. It plays similar to Apex Legends but with more focus on melee. and unique abilities to literally parkour over anything and grapple on to anything even players.

Pro: Great game overall, graphics, game play, Parkour, weapons, abilities, items, fighting styles, solo mode, team mode and a lot more. Overall pretty fun to play with a group of friends. If you are planning on going just solo be ready to get killed until you get good. Very Easy to play but hard to master with many options which keep the game and replay value alive. Is it a game you can easily play 100 hours in? Yes but continuous 100 hours? Probably not more like several hours a day than take a break kinda game. But it is still very entertaining and almost every game is different I cannot wait to see what they add in the future and I will keep coming back.

Cons: Yes there are bots in the game but there are also people as well. Sometimes the bots can be very annoying especially when it feels like they are on your team and do not listen. However the bots still do a pretty decent job when fighting as it appears the difficulty goes up the closer to end game you get. 

Also they do have micro-transactions but these are pretty much just cosmetic only so anyone complaining that this ruins the game is wrong. You can literally get any item in the game by playing for free. It will take you some time sure but think of it like Genshin Impact where it takes time to get gear, items etc. They also have a battle pass system that you can purchase to get more items etc faster if you want to. All the cosmetics you do buy are actually kind of nice and can be seen clearly in the game from weapon skins to how your character looks. Overall  one of the better games in terms of buying content etc it is actually worth it.

Overall this game is pretty fun and for 20 bucks honestly is a good deal. They have lots of players playing right now and as you rank up you will start fighting people who are really really good! So great game with friends and solo if that is your jam. Hope this helps with anyone on the fence. I would also just buy it and in the first two hours you don't like it than just return it overall its a win win for everyone."
7141,"I like everything the game has to offer. It'd be great if they added more skins or community requested skins. Other than the amazing skins the game has to offer, the price is what holds it down. If the prices went down a bit, I would've spent more money on this game."
7142,
7143,Fun game to play
7144,"Cool game, kinda clunky sometimes though.
Needs a bit more loot variety, but overall very fun."
7145,"Perma stun mechanic, full of bots, unresponsive keys dues to poor animations timings.
The game UI and menu are flawless but it should not have been a battle royal game.
I would recommend to wait 2 months for it to be f2p, they cruelly lack players.
Can't recommend the game for $20 at this time.
I won't play anymore anyway, so whatever amount, if fun is not there."

I like the melee and the concept, i just wish that the ping system was abit better and the UI wasn't so ridged looking and had alittle flow. all this said i would recommend this game to my own friends and you should too!!! its really fun and a blast to squad up with your friends or foes!!"
7149,"this game is difficult but definitely worth a try cause you can tell they they put in a lot of work and want to make it last. the customization's to this games characters are really in depth, its really fun to customize. overall i recommend trying this game if your skeptical about buying it"

7151,awesome game!
7152,"So much fun, so many fights, I like it!"
7153,I studied the blade
7154,95% of players are Chinese vpn abusers destroying every ranked game. x) If you report them you will get banned for racism :DDD
7155,재미잇다요
7156,"This game refreshes the BG genre very well! Great combat mechanics, visually pretty & doesn't have building in it... big thumbs up!"
7157,"Regionlock the Chinese players. In this game frame-perfect actions are crucial. You destroy the whole system by letting 300 ping players join. 
And the reason why all the Chinese players are on EU is because it actually gives you an advantage in parrying etc.
Until regionlock gets implemented I have to give a thumbs down. A BIG thumbs down."
7158,"Saw this game on steam banner on release but didn’t really look into it, thinking it was an MMO, then I saw Nick and Soda play it on stream and turns out it’s actually a battle royal. With busty anime girls, swords and grappling hooks! Sooo yea I wanted in. It’s pay up front which kinda sucks but might help with cheaters though. There are A LOT of cosmetic items/battle passes/dailies/weeklies/seasonal etc. on top of it, so the 20 euros upfront is weird. The menu and UI can also be a bit ugly and just a bit off. It really feels not made by western devs in that sense lol. It’s a Chinese game so makes sense. The gameplay is amazing though. It really comes down to tits out Sekiro battle royal. Right now I’m at Silver 2 and almost Silver 1. And only lately I feel the game is starting to get a bit harder as people are starting to know what they are doing. It’s so nice to stand in an open field with no cover and not get sniped in the head and waste half an hour of looting. There are ranged weapons but they don’t really instakill, plus you can just grapple or double jump or sprint or slide away! It’s a cool take on BR’s and the boobs are a nice bonus!"
7159,"I wasn't interested in many royal battles, but there is something special about Naraka that makes me interested. I hope there will be more customization options and characters."
7160,"It's actually fun.

A lot of the elements actually remind me of Apex. So if you ever played that game before, you'll learn Naraka's mechanics easily. Powder = battery cell, Red berries = health. White < Blue < Purple < Gold rarity code means the exact same. 

The combat is incredibly fun and complex. Parry counters Focused Attack which counters Normal Attack which counters Parry, and it works in a lot of interesting ways.

Just give it a try. It's seriously fun."
7161,NICE.
7162,"It's Amazing if you like playing games like SEKIRO, DARKSOUL or BLOODBORNE mechanics, But it's just BR which new and exciting to play because of the tactics, combos and parry's. It just depends on how you play and I highly recommend playing it you friends because this game is also need of teamwork for the different types of skills every character have."
7163,"Real poor balance right now.

The spear can do a golden attack without counter which there is no defense against.

One character can get 4600 HP and restore his hp mid fight.  Not to mention its super powerful in teams as he CCs you while you get shot down."
7164,"The first game I've played that actually feels worth the money I've spent to get it tbh. Amazing graphics, and there's a LOT of thought put into game"
7165,ok
7166,best game everrrrrrrrrrrr !
7167,good gamedd
7168,"I really love this game and the idea on it! For me is well made and beautiful!! 
BUTPLEASE 24 Entertainment PLEAAAAAASE JUST FIX THE EU SERVERS! I WANT TO PLAY SMOTHLY THE GAME!!!

But overall i really love the game. Well done!"
7169,"the game is 1 of a kind but the mechanics sucks, it's pure RNG. The fact that you can't cancel animation makes it in this game you have to predict everyone's moves and that's ofc impossible, cause everyone's different. If you react you lose.
Pure trash mechanics"
7170,"This game can be played for around 10 hours for fun, for this i have no doubt.
But if you want to play this game seriously, this is not the game for you.
Problems:
1. Long queue time if you are in top 10% player, and you are not playing on Asian Server
2. Bugs are part of your gaming experience, like you should not take dmg but you take dmg, or the parray should work but not working, these Bugs WILL make you lose the game.
3. Balance, weapons and characters are not balanced, there is one character can kill any health with the combo needs only ONE hit to start. As the ult of most characters are being used, can simply reverse the situation of the fight, like pressing ONE button, and he/she becomes ONE PUNCH MAN. Got hit by the ult ONE time, you are dead duck.
4. Devs are not trying to fix the Bugs and Glitches mentioned above.
5. Optimization is terrible on this game, if you don't have top tier M.2 SSD, or you don't have GPU from NV. Mine 6900XT + 4.5Ghz 3900x + 4000 mhz RAM + SN550 ssd, playing on 2K res, not even highest setting, constantly having only 60-80 FPS
Good part about this game:
 1. The graphic in this game is decent.
 2. Devs are trying to fix this balancing problem.
 3. Movements in this game feels nature and incredible.
 4. Character customization is great.
 5. Skins looks good to me. But skins with Top 2 Tier rarity, if you want to make sure 100% get it, expecting something from 5k ~ 20k USD.

If you turn out liking this game, you might facing the issue of staying in queue for more than 10 minutes waiting for a game.
As for my experience of this game, based on hourly, I have seen bugs & glitches that causing my death at least 10 + times, sometimes 30 or even more. But this is not only happening to me, it is also happening to other play I was fighting too, sometimes I kill them not because I'm better at this game, but bugs. R.I.P

7177,"lots of potential, but i decided to refund it when i realized the mechanics feel incredibly janky after about 4 hours of play. Even computer players teleport around when I have 30 ping. The amount of times youll ever pull off a cool combo like in the trailers is almost zero, since teaming up and stun locking people is in fact, the best way to win. Not saying that in a salty way, thats just how BRs go. I wanted this game to be fun but it just feels like a janky cash grab, and the combat is overall a disappointment."
7178,good game - good content - me and my friends got happy time with this game

7189,its fun
7190,This game makes battle royale fun.
7191,"Naraka has a bit of a learning curve - button mashing will only get you so far.  That said, it's worth the effort.  Winning a dual by the skin of your teeth is very satisfying.  The game is beautiful and full of nice visual touches like the grass and bushes being knocked down by the force wave created by your weapon.  It's a nice touch and really makes it feel like a fantastical kung fu movie."
7192,sweet game must play
7193,"At first I was sceptical, the visuals looked a bit confusing and hard to follow in review videos. However, the player looked like they were genuinely having fun, and the grapple looked interesting, First play through, and I am not a big fan of Battle Royale games, I feel this has something very good to offer. Its in the primitive stages, so theres only 7 characters, but the game is so approachable and has a high skill cap. This is also a great time to get this game as the meta has not been developed yet."
7194,good game
7195,"The movement in this game is god awful , most times you'll be fighting or trying to escape and your character starts grabbing walls randomly or not doing what you're trying to do. I mean simple things like jumping through a window or climbing something , feels alot like assassins creed but ten times shittier.

It gets alot worse when you're fighting indoors , you might aswell ALT + F4.

I've also encountered some sort of bug it seems with the parrying , where I'll press the button to do it and the game doesnt register it. Some characters are straight up useless , and others have godlike ults.

Game only has 1 or 2 maps."

7200,"It's a good game, but I'm bad as fk."
7201,"This game is actually a lot of fun. 

I personally think it should be F2p though. It's set up with a battle pass/Micro transaction shop so spending 20 bucks THEN buying cash shop stuff isn't usually the way people like to get in to these games. I think it will really limit the amount of players who decide to try it out as well.

Combat easy to get in to with a typical combo system however the with the use of action canceling and parrying it elevates it to a pretty high level. Unlike other Battle Royale's you have time to get in to the game and experiment without the fear of getting 1 shot by a sniper from 1000 meters away. It throws you into a bunch of bot games in the beginning to make you feel like you are doing a good job. Only to get into a real game then get your ass kicked by some rando who knows how to fight unarmed really well when you have a blue tier weapon -.- There is also a deathmatch mode (Bloodbath) which is a really good way to get a feel for the game try out new weapons and not feel bad about dying.

The movement can seem clunky and buggy but at first, but watching good players it tends to look pretty fluid and complex so I'm sure there is just a skill cap there. Go watch a Youtube vid about it, it will pay off.

It's got the jiggle physics

This game has potenial for 20 bucks I'll probably play for a weekend or 2 and get my moneys worth.

7202,"This game is completely broken. 

Ranking System
Every single game Ive played in solos after gold 3 I lose 15-20~ points if I die early. I get roughly 28-35 by winning a game with 6-10~ kills.

Combat 
Its completely broken. Parrying in this game works 50%~ of the time, the other 50% it just goes through your parry. Its like playing rock paper scissors except rock beats both scissor and paper.

The mechanics, and movement are one of the two most critical things I liked in this game. I waited a month for the full release. I started playing it, yet I wasn’t having the same experience, it felt bland, the content that was pushed out compared to the beta is a disappointment. Then on top of the content the in game rewards for users who preordered the game was taken away. During the beta those who pre ordered more than the base game were reward with 50k gold, and on official release we were only rewarded with 10 crates that had randomized loot inside. 
This is my honest explanation of the reason why I don’t play the game anymore."

7218,"This game is really fun to play casually or hardcore. If you just want to drop in and run and slash some people up with your weapon of choice, you can do that with decent amounts of efficiency at low elos, but the combat system also has a lot of depth and variety that makes higher elo battles really exciting and fun as well. This is a game with a lot of nuance and a high skill cap that isn't necessary visible at first glance. Haven't played anything since I bought this."

7262,"Great take on the battle royale genre and one of the funnest games I've played so far this year. The game focuses more around melee combat, but there are ranged weapons such as bows and muskets. The weapon balance is surprisingly decent and skill with your character and combos will win you more fights than the actual weapons themselves. The movement in this game is well done and the grapples allow you to zip around or reach high places/enemies quickly.

Is it perfect? Of course not and there's a pretty noticeable leap in the skill floor from where you start to once you've gotten a few games under your belt and it can be frustrating at times, but I'd say it's still one of the best $20 dollar bills I've spent in a while."

7279,Bery good nays
7280,EXCELLENT!
7281,"Update: Nope... F this game.

The biggest issue is the insistence of your character to get stuck on stuff and fighting in areas where the floor is uneven. Miniscule elevation differences create massive misses which get you killed.

Basically, they've designed levels to be very pretty at the cost of decent movement and positioning. More often than not I am consistently missing hits, getting smacked around and dying because the guy I was fighting stepped back at no fault of his own and it put him below me slightly due to the ground.

F it. This is terrible. It has a brilliant combat system ruined by really, really crappy level design, positioning and sticky movement. I went from loving it to hating it over the course of time because it's just frustrating to die to crap. Good fights that are on even footing (literally, even footing) become rarer and rarer. It's just annoying stuff that kills you most of the time.

Avoid. Amateur game dev.

----------------------------

Really like it, but also infuriating sometimes. Mainly in precision for me.

Combat is good, nice and fun, fluid, engaging. Some weapons are incredibly annoying to play against like the greatsword, but once you get how the weapons work you can counter. It's a pretty tight skill ceiling on that stuff. Lot of room for growth and learning to pace yourself.

Movement is a lot of fun too. When it works properly.

Visually gorgeous with good sound.

Lots of players in Asia, which is good.

Biggest issues:
-Some whack as hell balance here and there. Ultimates are basically get out of jail cards for some chars, esp. Yoto Hime and Tarka. Counterable but annoying. Greatsword is a nightmare to fight. I don't think it's broken, but it has very little room for mistakes. I think long term play fixes it, but for newbies it is a pain fighting against greatsword hordes all the time. Incredibly easy to use, too.

-The movement and grapple can be jank as all hell and it's the most annoying thing in this game so far. Grapple will sometimes hook you into weird places and your character turns into a complete potato. Feels like cancels and clicks are sometimes off or significantly delayed too. Positioning of attack is also really janky here and there, especially when trying to use the spears attacks. Getting stunlocked, then rolling, then not moving for...some reason is annoying. It has a lot of control problems. Drives me nuts when I grapple onto things that I'm not wanting to grapple. Oh yeah, terrain and climbing; jesus christ why does the character want to latch onto everything like he's a god damned glue stick? Stop it, go UP, not wall run against a rock. Drives me nuts with how sticky the characters are. Elevated fighting is also horrendous.

-Laggy players. Holy cow there are a lot of glitchy players. Clearly hitting a dude and he just quantum walks through it with a dagger to your face like nothing ever happened. Greatsword wielder throwing a slash at you which doesn't even connect to your characters model, but you get KO'd. Grappling someone and the grapple deciding to grapple onto the wall behind them because they momentarily phased out of existence and back. Needs to be some kind of rule there where 100+ ping gets booted, or consistent ping spiking gets booted. No, I don't care if they're paying customers - if they can pay for a game, they can pay for some decent internet not running on a hamster wheel and string. That and region locking, important.

Overall it's great, but the negatives are a big deal and ought to be addressed by the developers. It's the best BR around in my opinion, I like its style and combat. Yes I get frustrated and mad, but it's because I want to get better and play more. Competitive.

Recommended but with some caution of above points."
7282,autolock needs to be fixed cause that ruins the skill gap. hate how ez game is with auto lock and exploits. sprint and dodge need separate key binds. also needs way less stuns
7283,There were some balance concerns at launch but I think the devs have handled them well.  This game is pretty challenging but also a lot of fun and very rewarding to master.  One of the best melee systems in any game.
7284,"the game keep dropping FPS and disconnect even my internet is normal. Because everything is on server so i need to wait for game loading the map download, and everytime i get to new location i need to wait for the map loading. in combat it just keep dropping FPS or reconnect and after combat end everything normal again like... the game not want i combat to other player. Especially when i combat to other Chinese players"

7301,Anime For Honor Pubg is actually very entertaining and fun. The combat is engaging and the game is extremely easy to pick up and get swept into it with a group of friends. At the highest level (which I am far from but know leaderboard players) has a high skill ceiling and advanced movement/Combat mechanics. Try your best not to instantly buy all the cool looking things in the store and MAKE SURE you do the advanced tutorial before you reque because it teaches you a lot but is not mandatory like the starting tutorial.

No, it's not just me, I have videos showing that parry times don't work depending on who you play against. https://streamable.com/9dhxtg - https://streamable.com/xas64f - https://streamable.com/5af8uz

This game needs to be region locked, and it needs to favor players with lower ping. Otherwise the game is luck based at best, and disadvantageous at worst."
7321,"I was sceptical at first. Then I just gave it a try and I am addicted now. Realizing its not simple button mashing. It is like outplaying your opponents in many different ways. Being an elegant dancer with the long sword or a monstrous aoe mashine with your great sword, saving your team mates while wiping out the enemy lines. Different abilities to unlock and a glyph system which let you grow strength gives you the feeling to progress. LVL 42 around is the cap for ""getting stronger"" but the skill cap vary heavily. Prepare to train and get good or die after a while getting countered and outplayed. If you are the player to compete in battle royale improving yourself or hackn slay in the deathmatch mode then gor for this game, 20 bucks is fair. It also has boob physics enhanced lvl and a korea game character editor for the first 6 chars and cool skins.

7323,pretty interesting style of battle royale game.
7324,"This game is perfectly for those who like fighting games like For Honor and Soul Calibur. The game is hard asf. But you'll learn from your own mistakes. The game is also so fun to play that once when you go in for the first game, you will cannot stop playing. In the game there are 2 types of weapon: Melee and Ranged. So you have more options depending on your own playstyle but this game is more focused on the close fights. There are Normal attacks, Focused attacks and Golden Focus. You need to perfectly-time a counter with LMB+RMB pressed at the same time when someone launch a Focused attack to you in order to hit them back like a truck and to disarm them and in that moment you can take their weapon so the enemy can't pick it up when they recover from the knockback. Every kill in this game is so damn satisfying. I will happily recommend this one to anyone. Even if they don't like BR games. I tried a few too but didn't liked them. Now, this game made me play it almost nonstop. It's so much fun. And the mechanics and potential of the fights are insane. You can do anything you wish. There are many combos you can do with any weapon. If you're asking yourself if it will pay off that 20$ price, let me assure you it will. There are cosmetics but you will get many boxes from missions to get cosmetics and emotes. So there's no need to pay money for them. 
If you buy the game and find me there, just spam the sh*t out of them normal attacks cause I'm weak asf. xD 80 hours of playing and still I have so much to learn. This is my review. I hope you have a nice day! ^^

7334,Easily one of the best games Ive ever played. Only issue is the amount of players who come from different servers playing on NA servers.
7335,"Refreshing addition to the Battle Royale genre of gaming. Its fast paced melee combat will leave you begging for more fights once you've mastered some of the mechanics and it doesn't feel as though you're getting cheated when losing but more outplayed. There are some kinks to iron out on behalf of the company such as weapon balancing, character additions, and more game modes but it's just starting out and will have more modes, more patches for balancing, and more additions to the game in the forseeable future. I highly recommend this if you're familiar with fighting style games, dark souls mechanics, and battle royales."

7346,Not a fan of them throwing you in your first match against all bots. It builds a false sense of confidence and doesn't properly relay how the gameplay will be since the bots are just bad. It also eats into your 2 hour time for a refund. It's almost like they pit you against bots your first few matches so you will win all while that timer will expire and you can no longer refund the game.

7348,"It is hard to press No or Yes when it comes to the question of ""do you recommend this game"".

It is a very interesting game, with pretty cool mechanics, but as every game these days there are flaws too. You have to decide yourself if you get annoyed by it or not.

I had alot of fun in the game, reached top300 in the rankings, and tried to learn as much as I can. I am still going to not recommend the game.

I have 18ms, my connection to the server is super good apparently but I still run into situations where on my screen an attack gets parried, but it is not happening on the server. I watch people with 120ms on Twitch and literally see them hitting things they shouldn't be able to hit. Why is that?

If I have less ms than someone else, I should be more in sync with the server, doesn't that make sense? In Naraka it is not like that. Asian players are literally teleporting around, or behave like ghosts where they don't get hit. People like to compare this game to fighting games.. having any issues like this would be the death of any fighting game. Imagine punching the hitbox of your opponent and just missing even though you shouldn't have missed.

I'm fully aware this isn't just like flipping a switch and everything is fine. But they have to fix this asap, not in months.

Some personal things I dislike about the game, same shit as in Overwatch:
Ultimates in the game are so powerful they literally get a losing team back into a fight without an effort. If you got so far behind because the enemy team is outplaying you, you should plain simply lose because you deserve it.

Don't get me wrong, I like strong ultimates, but even then, they should still require the player to do something with it. Kurumi literally presses 1 button, and heals her entire team for a massive amount. There is no skill required besides putting your finger on the button and pressing it down, no mechanics needed. Tianhai presses his ultimate and heals himself to full from 1% hp. If he manages to grab you, his entire team shots you down.

I want to emphasize this: We grabbed a guy with full HP and full LEGENDARY armor. While Tianhai is holding him in his hands, we are quite literally blasting him with ranged weapons in 1-2 seconds and he is dead. 

I dislike, or lets be real, plain hate abilities which are designed to make up for bad plays. If you messed up, you should pay for it, and the payment shouldn't be an abilitiy to get a 2nd chance. In a competitive game, there shouldn't be 2nd chances mid fight. If you get outplayed, you deserve to lose.

I like that you can get a 2nd chance if you die, you can revive yourself. But having 2nd chances in the middle of a battle is absolute garbage. If you die, your teammate has to invest time to get you back up. If you take damage, you have to invest time to heal it back up. Not press a fking button and heal it all up in a split second like nothing happened.

It's easy, if you as a player made a good move to get ahead, it shouldn't be taken away from you without the enemy team being required to make a good move in return. Sorry, pressing a button and reverting every bad play you got punished for is by itself a ""no do not recommend"".

I also don't get the reviews where people say the game is fluid. The game is super clunky when it comes to movement, like there is no denying that. Compare it to a Devil May Cry, and you will straight up see what fluid melee combat actually looks like.


The review is negative, but the game is actually decent and has a lot of potential. Like many games, I'm pretty confident they won't, or will be too late to take advantage of it. I'm still playing it, because I enjoy the game, but the frustration gets bigger every day where I know I won't put up with it forever."
7349,"Game Design & Mechanics: 8/10 (Some weapons aren't balanced equally in their types)

Servers: 2/10

Net code: 0/10

The game is flooded with Chinese players in Internet Cafe's all over NA/EU servers. The game has serious design flaws in it's netcode and input reading from server packets. It's like PUBG in 2016 but 10x worst.

7374,"Referral Code: chedhqydnm

Going to be honest, didn't think I would like it at first glance.. but once I got into playing it, found a character and a weapon I like, the game is pretty fun.

Only major dislike, some of the weapon staggers seem a little OP, you can get stun-locked and not able to even queue up a parry or dodge... you're kind-of just, dead with no play around.

Update: Low - Mid Elo very fun, super addictive game... Unfortunately once you reach a ""higher"" elo, and learn the combos, the amount of stagger and bounce you can do, the fights come down to whoever lands the first hit, once a combo goes off you're pretty much done for, there isn't really any way to escape and I can bounce and juggle or just stagger someone from purple armor to no health. So, either you get bounced and juggled, or you're doing the bouncing, and either you have purple armor and die, or if you're lucky to find gold, you get out with a sliver of HP vs someone full HP."

And the rest: But it's also hard. Like Dark Souls, it's not for everyone. If anything, I'm a little bummed that more people don't play this gem. BRs need solid population numbers to thrive. Right now it feels like Naraka doesn't really have that in NA. Long queues for high ranked players, huge ELO spread in matches, and the lingering sense that another game with huge potential may be missing the special sauce to succeed outside of its native China."

Then you look up and [strike]see[/strike] the skill ceiling.

The community is very helpful and positive. Even my negative experiences have been overall better than most communities.

The game has some ping issues that hopefully are sorted out soon, but I find it easily ignoreable after playing Smash Ultimate for years.

This game has potential to become something big, but we'll see. I give the game a good 4/5."

7397,"A fresh extension of the Battle Royale format into melee fantasy-ninja combo style combat. Prepare yourself for an investment in learning the combat system, as it takes a while to get decent, and a long long time to master. I consider this a big positive of the game, as it provides more room for skill to trump cheats and loot luck.  

Another really positive element of this is that aimbot cheats will not ruin it like they do in virtually every gun-centric game (though other cheats might). There are ranged weapons, they are just not dominant, and everyone gets a very strong grapple aim-assist. 

If there is a negative to the game, I'd say it's the new-character glyph-leveling system, where new players are forced to play at a disadvantage until they ""earn"" the fully glyph set. New players are already bad at the game. Why do they need to be made worse through inferior glyphs?!? The game should be *fair* for all players entering a match. Period. That said, this is a short-term issue, as every dedicated player will earn all their glyphs and eventually be on a level playing field."
7398,I like the direction the game is taking. Maybe nerf some of the abilities and supers a little. Otherwise its pretty balanced.

7410,"This game is fantastic. Beautiful, with a deep combat system that is akin to a fighting game. The map is large and traversal is amazing across the map. Has the feeling ""easy to learn, difficult to master""

It needs 60 people to play however, and there aren't a lot of players until you get to a much higher ELO, and when this happens you're way out of water. The issues with American servers (which aren't separated regionally, so even with great internet if you're in Alaska like me, there are ping issues) are numerous. There are Chinese players (who are also suffering from one region fits all) that are coming over to the American servers and playing with ridiculous ping that makes every encounter sporadic and up to chance.

The game is highly monetized with micro transactions and with a 20 dollar price point it seems just like price gouging.

I will change this review the moment these things are fixed and probably re-buy it at that point, but until then I've returned it."

7419,"What they fail to specify in minimum requirements is simply defined as ""Broadband internet connection."" I'm going to tell you right now that if you have between 1-4 mbps download speed, and you only download around 300~ kb/s or less, you will not be able to play the game. Upon anyone using any ranged weapon, expect your ping to go from 100 ms to 10,000 ms. You will simply not have enough download speed to keep up with everyone's inputs. Really sad for those of us who still have internet speeds from the 1990s. I have reached the pinnacle of gaming with 28,736 ping. I can't even use ranged weapons in training mode. IN TRAINING MODE. Apparently training mode is still connected to a server, and when I use the repeater or the flamethrower, I can get my ping to about 1,200. That's just with one player using one ranged weapon.


Aside from the internet connectivity issues, yeah. The game is phenomenal. Play your first two matches and move on because after that you're going to start getting crushed. :) I'd say if you can't download stuff at at least 1mb/s, don't buy; or be prepared to face unjustifiable pings."

7440,"so NARAKA : Bladepoint huh? ive really no ideas with the name. ive been playing this game 35 hrs on record(on this time) and yet still on learning on those combos in this battle royale melee concept gameplay. i bet those who already here are still learning too. dont afraid on combat with the others coz you will be given another life soul if you die. try to mastering your techniques and combos in bloodbath first and yet battle royale will be ready for you. 

cons:
so for me, this game still need an improvement with the servers and lagging issues. im using mid to high end pc right now with stable fast connection at my place but still need to counter the lagging issues in every first time i start the game. and im still dont understand why on the first installation of this game, SSD is preferred as file game installation. anyone can explain this? does it relate with the lagging issues coz i really dont have any problems so far playing most graphically demanding pc games this several years like cyberpunk, Forza 4, etc.

7443,"This game is one of the best games I've ever played. 10/10

As a player, I was pleased with this combat system. The landscape in the game is well done, and new updates and adjustments are still coming into play.

It can also be seen that the developers really care about the players, and a survey of your opinion pops up here and there, which is then subsequently reviewed, and according to the calculations, they decide on the balance of the game.

For example, when the game came out, the dagger was a little stronger than other weapons. Players chose that the dagger was unbalanced and a few days after completing the survey, the game was balanced and dagger is now as strong as all other weapons.

I'm looking forward to the future of the game and how the game will develop.

I also made an amateur video about the game as I improved over time from 0 hours to the current 100+ and I intend to continue. :) [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy6V04hYMbI&list=PL3ICXfPS76DWQ5KFU5Vd34rHqfXcs98Gk&index=1&t=512s] [/url]

Thank you 24 Entertainment!"
7444,Samurai X Simulator! :D
7445,Its kinda hard to play but that what makes it fun. I am so inlove with this game.
7446,"This game is honestly incredible, the first few games DOES HAVE bots. You need to know that, but they eventually get left out of games, with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 in a match full of 60 players. Super unique take on battle royale, if you love samurai fighting action games with awesome, fast paced combat, you NEED to try this game. The combat at first appears simple, but the skill ceiling is incredibly high. If you can't handle getting your butt kicked, this isn't the game for you.

With that being said, the game is just plain FUN and if you give it a little time to learn the more in depth aspect of the combat, and you won't touch another BR for a very long time. 

Sick of the generic first person shooter battle royales? You need to hop on this game ASAP. The game has different characters all with different abilities, but they are all samurai/ninja themed. The map takes place in old China, the perfect setting for epic sword fights. There's a ton of different weapons to choose from. From spears to katanas to greatswords, you name it. The graphics and environment on high settings is gorgeous. 

You'll be running through the cherry blossom trees one minute, to a vast desert landscape, to forests, to swamps. Next thing you know, a opponent will arrive to challenge you in an epic, Chinese samurai movie fashion. Jumping from tree to tree, relying on timing and parries to beat your adversary. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

Hopefully they polish some more characters and abilities but so far i am enjoying it.

7466,"I have played all the big Battle Royal games from H1Z1, PUBG, Fortnite, APEX, Realm Royal, and various other ones and none of them ever appealed to me. I don't know if its because we have Ninja's, wall running with tree climbing and grappling hooks. But I love the up close battle with all the parries, and dodging. I love that just like in most fighting games Button mashers only really annoy new players.

I enjoy the game more so than any other Battle Royal Game todate. Can't wait to see what they add in the future."
7467,"Still don't have OCE servers but I still get 60-80 ping on AS servers, just make sure you don't let the timer go past 7:00 or more otherwise it will widen the ping to 100+ etc. Dark Souls and Bloodborne had horrendous P2P servers and people are still ok with those games but not Naraka? Give it a serious go and see how it all feels, I noticed the first match once you start it up will always load the map for the first time, meaning every match after your first will load up faster. (Couldn't hurt to load up training first)

Combat is very easy to learn but difficult to master which has a rock paper scissors attack types just like your standard fighting games, the game teaches you everything you need to know and experience will sharpen how you deal with situations. (Communication being a very pivotal point to all of them) People say the movement is clunky but have never truly mastered the focus running mechanic which helps getting away from tight situations and helps to zip around quickly and loot. (Keep in mind I only play on controller)

I can see why people are switched off when they get their real taste of combat but it comes with the whole point of battle royal, sometimes you're ganking and sometimes you get ganked, simple. The real problem is the Chinese people who have the best ping using a VPN because reasons... and also the devs know about this problem. 

The dev team are cool and down to earth, I have reported cheaters a few times and have had feedback on it, they reward you with reporting cheaters and even giving some ideas on the game. The community is a bit average because at the end of the day it's a fighting game community and everyone knows how toxic that community can be. (Watch Crowbcat videos on it) Quitters, AFK and toxic people can now be penalised to the point where they can't even get a match going. If you need teammates I suggest you use the in game system to add people and form friendships, there are even people in custom matches waiting to teach you how to be good. (Also they have a discord)

The characters are all unique with their own abilities, although everyone seems to main either Matari or Tianhai because you will survive more chance encounters. You can even recreate each character if you want and how ever you want no matter how crazy the look, you will spend most of the time just unlocking abilities and skins which gives it a reason to keep grinding.

If you want a fresh experience out of the battle royal formula or maybe you're a die hard fighting game fan, then I suggest you at least try it out.
"
7468,fps drops alot
7469,"Extremely fun and addicting game, I am not a fan of Battle royals but I enjoy this game a lot.
Like I stated before I am not a fan of battle Royals but I am a fan of fighter games. The game could be extremely hard at times and it has a lot of learning involved to keep You playing for hours,nothing better than out playing another human that makes you feel better about your self and skills.
How ever as you have probably read the ping issues are very frustrating and tend to get on my nerves, at first it was not that bad and I did not have a problem with it,but recently as I have tried to take the game more seriously I am finding this to be difficult due to the fact that I could get a ping spike out of the blue and have my game freeze then die without being able to do anything about it. As for the time being the game is undoubtably fun and I do enjoy playing it,But I would not recommend it for the hard core players out there due to the fact that the game is very intense and high stakes but the ping just kills the mood,its really sad too because for the most part like I've stated it is very fun but as it stands I would not recommend you buy it in its current state. If you do not care about the ping issue then go for it but for the most part it will get to you eventually. Do not get me wrong I love this game but cant in good faith recommend it to a new player till the issues gets fixed. 
There is good news however, the devs are currently working on more stable severs and ping fixes so hopefully it does get better in the because I would hate to see such a good game concept die.

Came back after some time to see if the game got any better and i am pleased to say  the game is still absolute garbage and has only gotten worse. 
Go outside and touch some grass. You will thank me."
7470,Not worth playing in its current state.
7471,good
7472,"UPDATED REVIEW AS OF 3/23/22

Naraka has added NEW FEATURES that is EXTREMELY FRIENDLY to new players and seasoned players which is the new PVE mode or BOT mode. I believe that has solved the skill gap in the game so new players can become more comfortable with the combat styles and use it as kind like a training grounds or for seasoned players to hone their skills in combat it offers two levels of difficulty Casual and Hard so it has something for everyone. As well as new PVP game modes that keep you on your feet to always stay sharp.

Naraka is not the type of game where you get good and thats it, you have to always be hungry and stay motivated to be better, there is always room for improvement. 

As far as cosmetics go I definitely give it a 10/10 keep in mind it is not cheap I think if it was lowered to about 10-15$ it would be well worth it. 

THERE IS NO PAY TO WIN SYSTEM.  in the game, weapons cosmetics are strictly that.

As far as hackers go in pvp yes occasionally you will come across them do not let that push  you away from the game. Hopefully there will be a better system in place top solve this issue but for now try your hardest and fight like hell

Team work makes the dream work keep that in mind.

The Battle pass system may seem intimidating with how many levels there are and the challenges you must complete to obtain them. But you can complete them in the PVE mode so now you wont have to grind hours on end in pvp to level up giving you more focus when it counts in the battle field. 

All in all the game is extremely well rounded and polished. It is definitely worth getting and investing your time into. It has great combat styles as well as beautiful scenery to fight it out in. It would be super cool to get new maps but the game is still a true beauty 

Stay hungry, stay humble and work hard."
7473,Nice game.
7474,FIGHT
7475,"The first 3 hours I have played the game, so far it was fun. But finding good gear before you get killed is definitely a struggle for a noob like me."
7476,it good
7477,"Naraka is a great fast-paced Battle Royal, which provides a fresh take on the genre and the high-skill ceiling of a fighting game. 
PROS:
☑Melee combat feels fantastic! There is so much potential with dash cancels, fakes, parries, and a lot more tech. (If you are willing to learn and invest time into it)
☑Movement is so much fun. You can grapple around like spiderman, slide around, or just run. 
☑Character choice. The game has many characters (and more in the future!) for different playstyles. Each character gets a single-core ability and an ultimate. However, with each ability/ultimate you get three choices that can drastically change how it works. (for more customization c:) 
☑Character customization. You have so many options to customize your character. It's too much power. (From cosmetics, appearance, ""glyphs""= rune system like league, and skills.)
☑You can play solo or with friends. (Up to a party of 3) (there is also rank play) [There is also more game modes coming in the future]

CONS:
☒The game is sometimes very clunky. For example, it can be hard to jump out of a window and instead get stuck climbing a wall when in a building. 
☒The game is not entirely balanced; some characters feel a lot stronger than others. 
☒The high-skill ceiling. (It can be very daunting for noob players like me and off-putting for others, but improvement comes with time.) 
☒I would recommend having an SSD; otherwise, it's unplayable. 

Overall, I'm enjoying the game and would recommend you give it a try! I truly believe this game has potential."
7478,"I can only speak from the OCE side of things - but I have yet to encounter any issues with ping; hackers and/or anything to do with players from China. There seems to be complaints on the Parry system as well, to which, I've not had any issues with either- once you have the timing down (which definitely took awhile to feel).

Would highly suggest to play the game yourself to find out whether it's your taste rather than read most of these what I find ridiculous (and for some, just blatantly racist) reviews for a game that has potential to keep moving forward.



"
7479,"This game has many MANY flaws. I wanted to like it so bad but it is honestly awful in its current state.

1) If someone hits you just once then you are trapped in their combo with literally no way to get out until it finishes. You are forced to just watch as you get juggled.
2)The parry system is extremely punishing, if you get parried you get knocked down AND forced to drop your weapon. 
3)The weapons themselves are extremely unbalanced.
4) The climbing mechanic needs A LOT of work. I can not count how many times my character latches onto the side of a wall and WILL NOT jump off no matter how much I press my space bar . If you are trying to climb onto a narrow ledge they will constantly over jump the ledge and jump off if you are hanging from the ledge on the other side.
5) If someone uses a grapple hook on you you can not stop them from performing their aerial attack. A parry does not even stop it, it goes right through it. Just hope that you are lucky enough to dash out of the way if they grapple from too far.
6) There is no reliable way to disengage. Just pray the other person has less grapples than you and doesn't grapple onto you mid air, because for some reason that knocks you prone. 
7) If you do get knocked prone you do not have I-frames and if timed right the attacker can just charge an attack and dash into you and knock you prone again because, and i cannot stress this enough, THERE IS NO WAY OTHER THAN 1 CHARACTERS SPECIAL ABILITY to get out of a comb.

Do not reccomend"
7480,"First off, I do not appreciate the ""bot"" initiation. The devs basically have you play bots for your first 2 hours to make sure that you can't get a steam refund if you aren't sure or don't like the game. I unfortunately fell for this trap.

I don't like that you have so little character customization. It's very limited, which was very disappointing to me. Unlocking skins and outfits is difficult and takes a massive amount of time. Very low drop rates on rare vanity items, much like gatcha games.

The gameplay is somewhat fun, and for a battle royale game it felt a bit different and unique. But after about 4, maybe 5 hours of play it gets redundant and boring. All the players running around basically look the same, and there are some gamebreaking mechanics like grappling hook stun. In group fights, you can very easily be double teamed, or even triple teamed, and insta KO'd.

Idea: I'd like to see stealth kills. If you sneak up on someone you should get a large stun, or a highly damaging opening attack.

I can't give a recommendation on this one yet; it seems a bit clunky and unrefined at the moment. It should be F2P IMO."
7481,It's a good game. It is super hard and really unforgiving for new players. Expect to get your ass beat for awhile. The first couple games will be against bots so it will seem like you are super good. Once you start fighting actual people though it becomes much hard. It is very easy to get stun locked in this game as there is no block and or juggle prevention. I have gotten juggled for my entire health bar many times in this game.
7482,g
7483,"Bought this game and the game play is fantastic. However, if you are recommending someone to play the game and they miss the box on account creation to use a friends torchbearer code they can no longer say that you referred them. This is annoying and although I have had two people install the game I will not be able to get the associated items.

Additionally the way you unlock battle pass exp is insane. You use rare tokens to get quests and they are completely removed from your inventory if you fail the quest in that round instead of letting you finish the purchased quest in a later game. Also, battle pass progress is way to slow.

Not to mention the issue of foreign players joining in on the servers far away from their country to take advantage of the lag. When this happens they will not take damage when being hit, counters won't appear on screen when they are performed and you will randomly be disarmed, even during light attacks (which you cannot be disarmed during) and your health will be depleted more than single hits should damage you do to the server not properly registering hits during combat. Connection based match making would make a huge difference in this."
7484,"Hi, I play the game alot, and ive played alot of rank.
             I am currently plat1(top1%)
 I just want to debunk one topic that i've seen  a couple times. 
          YOU CANNOT CLIMB RANKED BY SIMPLY HIDING
As you climb higher on the ranked ladder You will not gain ranked points unless you perform well. 
                        -The majority of the people i play with at plat1  only get into the top5 of their matches 30% of the time. 
                        -The game does not distribute ranked points simply by  being one of the last survivors. This is false 
                          information.
                        -Ive had matches where ive been in the top 3 and ive either gained zero ranked points or lost ranked points 
                            because i did not perform well.
                        -Ive had matches where ive been in the top three with 10k damage( Slightly below average damage. if you 
                          average around 20k damage you are in a pretty good spot.) and low kills and lost ranked points
                       -Ive had matches where ive been in the top 3 with 2-4 kills, low damage, and lost ranked points
                       -The game takes  multiple variables into account  when  distributing ranked points. I don't know all of the
                        variables, but I do know that if i perform well, i gain ranked points, If i don't perform well then i lose ranked 
                         points. If i perform average or below average, i either gain very little ranked points,  dont gain  any ranked 
                         points, or i lose ranked points depending on the strength of my opponents.
                       -As your ranked increases, more frequently you will be in matches where the rival strength of your opponent 
                        is easy. Meaning, it gets more difficult to climb  because there is hiogher risk and lower reward for winnign a 
                        match, and you have to do alot of damage and get alot of kills or else you will be punished.

7489,"Great game. But chinese players ruining the game, just like PUBG. please fix ASAP."
7490,"So was mostly enjoying myself. Until I also started experiencing the downfalls of non region locked. You'll sit there, comboing someone when they suddenly just freeze in place. Lag maybe? For sure but not why you think. You get killed seconds later by that same china name because they have a ping of 2-300+. Do not buy this game until region lock is a thing.

EDIT:  Really DO NOT BUY THIS. Region lock is NEEDED. These chinese folks are re fucking diculous. I can't wait for red dawn when we can wipe them out."
7491,
7492,"the game looks amazing ... but feels clunky-ish. You can kinda stun lock a player by timing your melee hits and feels hopeless being on the receiving end, haha.
i give it like a 7/10. ill still play it here and there tho."

7501,"Don't waste your money , developer is not care about players and what they say
Back in season 2 , company still not care about peoples experience ,  chines still cheating and abusing , any change , who care what players say and want
Finally after 2 season uninstall the game , developers resist against peoples , they don't do anything about chines in EU and Na , as i can see in posts and comments in steam game is dead in EU 
i can only say great job to this Irresponsible developers team

i ask around and check players in game , game is dead in EU and NA 
this is what these developers deserved when they don't listen to their community

i'm happy to see bad developers are getting less players"
7502,"I don't usually enjoy Battle Royales, but there's something different about this game. It's sweaty, it's hard, but getting better feels so good you won't want to stop.

It plays more like a fighting game than a third person shooter or something. It's almost most like Monster Hunter World, Sekiro, and Super Smash Melee had a baby and it's a perfect wonderful baby. 

The fear is that most people will sleep on this game as all Battle Royale games have been free lately, but $20 is more than a fair price for this game. It's optimized beautifully, the art direction is great, the gameplay is fast and fluid and incredibly addicting. The player base is growing everyday and I sure hope that continues!

If I sold you, use my referral code after the tutorial when you go to name yourself. You'll get a couple nice freebies as you rank up. chje7rxyxt"

7508,fun!
7509,:;)
7510,"Server: Want to parry?Dodge?Attack?Grapple? Well i guess .-.  NOPE!!

Imagine playing Sekiro but with insane inputlag. this game depends too much on the split second u hit the keys so if u ever press 0,00002 seconds later you will get fked by the most basic attacks. it doesn't matter how good your reflex are and how cold blooded u can be in dire situation, it's just luck. If your input at exact right time which is almost impossible to do because it's online and u can even get matched with people with over 200 ping. and let's not talk about cheaters who can land 100% of shots and auto counter every single attack or who  go solo ranked with few buddys so end game it's 1 vs 3 which is really lame and to this day i don't know a single person who got banned even temporally for teaming up.
The game is not P2W but damn customization of character physique it's on point 10/10. but weapons and dresses are to buy with $$$ and not even cheap and battle pass and loot chests are trash.

Don't get me wrong. the idea of the game it's great, but unless you play with a ""team"" or u have 3 ping at most i strongly suggest you to go watch some anime like HxH or Konosuba.

I will keep an  eye on the game and try to get a better internet connection until then i'll keep watering the grass."

7524,"Extremely fun and satisfying to play, however there are some frustrations such as small movement glitches (sliding off a cliff or getting stuck in a post, etc.) and desync players. Matchmaking is not based by ping or region. It's just throws you with whatever. 

Nevertheless, in time this game will be really worth spending money for.

________________________

Small update.
I cannot play Naraka anymore on a daily basis. The frustrations just became too apparent and it is not fun anymore to play. I keep dying to things like desync and buggy movement. Then there are some other exploits high rank players are already using to play the game incredibly broken.
Game is still good, but it needs to be known how dumb it is to play the game in the current state."

7529,"Even on a high end pc, this game is extremely stuttery and will absolutely crash. It is in worse condition than the beta. 

Once thats fixed, i will change to a positive review. Its still a blast to play, but the optimization must be first priority for these devs. Please fix.

UPDATE NOV 14 2021

Unplayable. Menu and in game graphics dont load properly, severe lag when attempting to load. Steam wont give me a refund although my hours are mostly trying to play the game. I may have only played 2 hours in total. What a fucking embarrasment. Stay far far far away."
7530,Awesome.

7532,Good but high ping
7533,"If anyone is still wondering if this game is worth it, it is! 
Very interesting and fun mechanics to learn, highly mechanically demanded and lots of mind games. 
So far no lag for SEA server, wouldn't say perfect but it is pretty optimized for FPS (set everything lowest), but the graphic is still stunning even at lowest graphic setting. 
Just get it already!"
7534,the best battle royal gamei have ever played
7535,Amazing game love everything about it maybe be there is a few things they can look at like the kill count can be present all the time instead of only when you open the map and some things like moving equipment from your inventory will not trigger if your engaged with healing it should be able to interrupt it. and some minor details but overall amazing game love it I was waiting for it and it has me hooked hehe
7536,it's really fun it's a bit laggy but so far the best game ive played
7537,ADDICTING + FUN
7538,very good

7542,Great game!
7543,"Good BR game where is steel arms your main weapons and firearms are auxiliary. But menu of a game is awful. It's like a mobile game menu: there is a lot of windows with diferent rewords, missions, statistics etc. Excuse me, yet I wanna play, but not to waste my time closing every annoying window before and after battle.
"
7544,To many bots and chinese people on EU server.
7545,"Another hype game but this game lives up to its name
pros-
1.fresh mechanics with balance gameplay(my opinion)
2.the world is really fun and a lot of stuffs to interact 
3.the looting mechanics is similar to PUBG , which is probably the best option
4.this game tooks every good aspect from every popular battleroyale game which in my opanion is really cool aand fun
cons-
1.It is not from a tripleA developer so there is no meaning of charging this much but i guess they need to maintain the servers 
2.Severs sucks unless u live in US , latence is playable 
3.the game still needs to get more optimized the anti aliasing is not the best ,there are edges images are not that clear , i prefer  MSAA but that option is not available yet 
4.the game looks good but the render distance is not clear its foggy

overall great game i can not explain every little details in this game u have to play the game for that , so is it worth the money ,yes it is fresh gameplay with different word totally worth every penny but i guess we have to wait few month for the servers to get more optimized"
7546,"Good Graphic, Good Gameplay

and the best thing about this game is the server, you can play this game from 25ms up to 1200ms and average 200-300ms it's very good. you have the best server of all the games on steam


High end Game - Potato Server, the developer has a very good combination

please spend our money again to release a new costume or maybe DLC, you don't have to care about your server."
7547,"Crouching tiger hidden battle royale

The only time you'll be good at this game is during your first two matches against bots"
7548,fun fights
7549,"EDIT: This is after the update which came... well sometimes now. The game runs well now, the new character, Valda Cui is an interesting addition, but needs a bit of a balancing. About balancing, it still need a bit more polishing, but slowly getting there. It's really enjoyable now.

Naraka: Bladepoint is an online battle royale game, where warriors around the world go to Morus Isle to fight for the Mask of Immortality for their own goal.

I waited a bit to write this review to experience more from the game, I also got experience from the beta, so this review will (hopefully!) be a complete overview about this game.

It's hard for me to choose, what I like most in this game, but probably my favorite is the sound design. The game has epic and traditional sounding like soundtrack, but what takes the cake, is the sound effects in general, because you can determine it easily where the sound coming from, even if someone shooting from behind of a building or someone running on the roof above you, you will definitely notice it, most online games lack of this quality sound design. The character's voice are pretty good too, my personal favorite the authentic Chinese dub.

About the controls, it seems a bit confusing at first, however you can get into it quickly. The combat system also simple, you can do horizontal and vertical strikes with the left / right click, you can charge these attack types and also, you can do a counter if you press both attack types at the same type. Movement is similar to other games, but the game also indicates the usable buttons on the screen.

Surprisingly, the game got really good graphics. The whole world is vibrating because of the different colors and places, which looks really good. Effects are also nice looking, just like the models too, however because of this awesome graphics, you will need at least a 4GB graphics card, instead of 2GB. Sadly, this is also a problem with the game, because if you lack of proper components to play the game, the game will lag a lot when it's load in the game. Also, it's recommended to put the game on SSD to reduce load time. Believe me, it will be better for you, because sadly if the game not loaded in properly, you won't be able to interact properly in the world.

It's always a nice touch, when the devs making backstories for the life and death game and for the characters too. You can find more lore about the characters, which are interesting and give depth for the game and also, it's pretty surprising to see such thing in a multiplayer only game.

Time to talk about the gameplay. I don't want to write a long describing about what you do in the game, but I try to mention the corner stones of the gameplay. So, there are 60 players on an island, which has varied environment and loots. You can play 7 different characters right now, they got 2 skills per character and every skill has 2 other variants, too. You can find melee and ranged weapons in the game. Every range weapon has it's own mechanic and stats. You can find bows, muskets or even a flamethrower for example. I briefly mentioned the melee combat system, but you can do different attacks in different movement state, and of course you can use different weapons, like longswords, spears or great swords for example and also, these weapons got their own combo system and stats, too. You can find additional items in the world, but also you can collect Coins and buy items from the shops on the island, which will help you throughout your journey. I want to mention the Jades, which can give you passive or even active skills either for weapons or for your character. Moonbane Charms can make danger zones, basically you ask the help of a snake god, which will make the area of your choice to purge. The game also has other dangers or helps in the world, for example you can eat fruits to buff yourself temporarily, or find Dandelions to make your footsteps silenced. The mentioned dangerous are could be fire lamps, which if it falls on you, you will get stunned and you start burning, which takes your HP, but there are wheels in dried up rivers, which if you make move, you can take out players with and a lot other you can find and explore. Need to mention the findable quest scrolls in the game, which if you complete in the game, you earn coins. These all alone makes the gameplay really interesting, but I need to mention the movement in the game, which makes your character go parkour. You can do jumps, flips and combining with the findable and buyable grappling hooks, you can do really fun movements and strategies.  Needless to say, the game has a lot to offer in the matches, however outside of the island, you can experience the detailed character face customization, the tons of skins in the game, leaderboards throughout the game, either you play in Solo or Trio, the custom game option and also the FFA game mode, Bloodbath, but also the unranked BR game mode too, but there is also a talent system in the game, which gives you certain passive buffs for your character in each match. Also, Naraka: Bladepoint not the regular ""long ranged Battle Royale game"", because ranged weapons are not that damage heavy, the game focuses on the melee weapons. You need to go face to face with others and defeat them in there if you want to achieve victory, which is really changing up the usual Battle Royale receipt. Long story short, the game has tons of really good things and usually Battle Royale games are not interesting for me, but Naraka: Bladepoint got me good with it's tons of details... however, things are not that always good.

Probably the ""biggest issue"" with this game, it's skill heavy. There are lot of players who play insanely well in the game in every division, making every match difficult, even Top 5 finishes, too. If you want to play casually, you might have a bad time until you don't learn how to better in the game. The developers tried to make this a bit easier at the beginning, when the player got introduced with bots in regular matches. Lot of people had their hopes up, when they won a match easily, until the next game, where they got destroyed by real players. So, if you are interested in the game, you need to step up in your game, because you might just rage quit from Naraka, because you don't understand why you got stun locked in a fight, why you can't win games. The game's movement also lacking, sometimes not grabbing edges, when it should or at few parts, your character get stuck in places. The game also unoptimized, too. These are basically the biggest issues with the game. Another interesting thing in the game, is that sometimes you end up playing someone else from the other side of the world or even you are not on EU server. The devs say, that they try to minimize the lags in this case, but most of the time, it's really noticeable and unfair.

Before I verdict this review, I want to mention two more things: first the loot boxes and DLCs. I don't understand, why you hate the game which has these stuffs, because if you buy a DLC or loot box, you only get cosmetics. The game is not pay to win, so you can just simply avoid these things. Lot other games do the same, and there is just a few, which let you freely choose between cosmetics for free, so I don't really get what's the matter with it. If you still get annoyed by this, it will be the best for everyone for you to not play this game. The other thing the mentioned bots. You can say it's a marketing step to not let the player let go early from the game, but it's an understandable move in general.

Naraka: Bladepoint is a really detailed and fun battle royale game and also competitive. Lot of people will give up on it, because it's difficult, but I recommend you to check videos about the game and tutorials to learn the game. I can definietly recommend you to play the game, even for the full price, because this is by far my favorite Battle Royale game I have ever played."

7557,nice game
7558,"I honestly don't like the battle royale modes, but the Bloodbath mode is really, really fun. (It's FFA deathmatch basically, with spawning.) and you still get EXP from it, since it doesn't count as a private lobby.

On the topic of private lobby, you can also make your own, up to 16 players, and have your own mini tournament, or arrange 1v1 matches between everyone. 

Overall, I didn't think I would like the game, but it's a pleasant surprise, and I can see myself playing for a long, long time, even if I don't play the BR mode.

At $20, the game is high value, since you can pour so much hours, for a third of the price of a full game. Easy 8.5/10."

7560,"dude, the graphics are just insanely beautiful, and the character designs are so unique in their own rights, everything runs smoothly and i have zero complaints about loading times either. they just need to make their description of the bloodrippers better... very broken english on that one XD but still a fantastic game and all the mechanics on the game work well and smooth."
7561,"the game is good but always lag i dont know why
"
7562,"Pls, optimize your game. I can't play, if I just don't have only ssd. OMG"
7563,good game i ever seen

7565,Good game
7566,"This game really fun, especially it the whole different type of battle royal which mainly about close combating but sadly there no oceania server  and spiking lag so annoying that's why i refunded the game but if they doing like valorant doing which open up local sydney server. Definitely will buy it and trying to master the game."

7577,`
7578,Super
7579,A lot of fun but frustratingly difficult! Don't get me wrong the game has its flaws but it has the makings of a very fun game to play with two of your friends!
7580,"When the game is fun it is really fun! When annoying things happen like fighting another player with lag or getting ganged up on 3 v 1 and your teammates have gone off to Narnia, then it is not so fun. Overall I would say the game is a really good game and just a few balance tweaks it will be a great game. However, I can't let the cosmetic shop slide. One of the most popular characters only has 1 skin. The only other 2 skins available for this character (that are WAY better) can only be purchased in the cash shop for a about 15 US dollars each. This isn't even a free to play game! Getting skin drops is harder and even out right impossible without the cash shop. Honestly I feel this has worst loot drop in a game I can think of in recent memory. And again the game is NOT free! I'm gonna recommend because the game is fun, but the cosmetic shop is bull."
7581,"I have been playing this game since release and have spent much time and money on it, it is a really fun game and has a great combat system which if your good enough allows you to 1v2 and 1v3+. Despite that I cannot recommend this game to others. The main reason is because once you get into the platinum ranks 90% of the people you are playing with and against are overseas, (Mainly China) because of that there is a huge ping difference and in a game like Naraka where timing is key it really messes you up. On top of the ping difference if you play with randoms you will not have a fun time, I like to fight and get better as im fighting but since no one speaks English Plat+ its hard to communicate with your team, and 80% of the time they just care about being top 5 to rank up so they wont assist in fights but just hide in a bush or tree till the last circle... So to summarize, its a great game at start (After the 5 games you play against bots) but later on if you don't have friends that specifically play this or get unlucky and face a 800+ ping player it will not be fun. I will still be playing in hopes they put a ping cap on the server and reward more team play. (This is my own opinion and I understand others might not agree) 

P.S once you get your first 100 crate red Item.. it doesnt reset its 1 and rng the rest... 500 crates later still no red greatsword..  RIP"

7583,;
7584,first game in awhile that i have found challenging. would recommend
7585,TRUST ME DONT USE RANGED
7586,"To be honest the game was fun and feels like dynasty warrior 2.0. However, when you meet an opponent the ping spikes to a level where you cant hit the enemy and becomes unplayable. hopefully they fix this issue."
7587,"Best game I've played in long time, played for 35 hours in 1 week so far."
7588,i main Yoto Hime and very much so hate myself.
7589,"Their was only noticeably bots for my first 2-3 games, now getting a win is a battle.
the game play is fun all around & it feels good to win a fight. especially with friends
but these good thing alone don't make up for the bad.

(CONS)
I do not like how i bought this game for $20 that is seemingly a FREE TO PLAY & probably will be one day.
with many free to play mechanics already in the game, loot boxes, they have a battle pass that you have to buy after already buying the $20 version of the game. The rewards for which are not enough to make me want to give them more money. The free pass doesn't give you good rewards at all. making me feel like the devs/publishers are gonna be extremely greedy in time to come & already are.
The f r e e s k i n s are lacking compared to skins you have to pay GOLD for (bought with real currency)
It also feels like they are or were inches away from making this game a Pay 2 Win in development.
but they are obviously not that dumb. which is why im blown away at how dumb they appear to be.

I mean at least Fortnite was FREE TO PLAY!!!!
-----Countless Battle royals are free to play because they sell Skins and a seasonly Battle Pass-----
This game does that too, but you are gonna have to buy the game as well.
Don't waste money on the battle pass please, they need to see how stupid it is so that they try a little harder next time. They are already trying to milk us, & i do not like being milked, especially by Greedy China Devs. nor should you. hopefully people realize that.


This game is also Very, Very, Very, Un-Balanced 
Just wait till you get killed by a flamethrower to name one thing. I was stun locked for about 5 seconds trying to run, attack, anything, but nothing i could do up until i died.

and I am not even gonna talk about the servers, bad ping, players abusing ping on out of region servers.
i havent noticed it too much, but that's probably why its so hard to win half the time against other players.
getting stun locked a lot might be due to this issue.

If you play this game and your not from asia, join the asia server if you have a VPN."
7590,"This game is an absolute joke.... Literally a bunch of devs in a room throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks... Zero thought was put in to combat in regards to it actually working

update: Game is still trash... literally filled with laggy chinese players"
7591,Fun
7592,do you like to crouch the tiger and hide the dragon? This game is for you.
7593,monkey?
7594,"The game is pretty good,very fun to play,kinda annoying when they spamm mouse 1 button,but ,overall very good
Sugestion : Optimize the power usage and memory usage for the players if u can :3 
But overall totally worth the chackles"
7595,framerate is so bad its unplayable
7596,"The Awesome:
I have tried out a lot of different battle royal games, and this one has to be my favorite by far.  The selling point for me is the melee combat.  It is so fluid and responsive, and requires skill to master.  This game feels like a cross between Black Desert Online and Fortnight.  The graphics, the scenery, the style, and the combat is all reminiscent of BDO (without the pay to win).  The gameplay is a lot like Fortnite, in that you are dropped on a huge map with unique locations and you are tasked with gearing up with whatever is around and outlasting all of the other players.  Their are different ""heroes"" you can choose that have different abilities/specializations.  I love sneaking around in these types of games, and they have a hero in this game that specializes in stealth.  You can level up each hero as well as each weapon.  There's a battle pass, but it and the rest of the cash shop are just cosmetic.

The Bad:
I'm not sure why this game has to be so complicated, but it took me a couple hours to get this one running correctly.  I'm playing on the recommended specs, but the game was still too laggy to play.  So, I realized that I needed to put the game on an ssd to make it work properly (which it recommends at the beginning of the game, but I had ignored this).  So, with the game now on an ssd and plugged into an ethernet cable and playing on the recommended settings... I still have to turn the graphics settings down to be competitive.  Which is a shame, because the game is beautiful.  Hopefully it is optimized in the near future!

tl;dr:
Get this amazing game, make sure to download to ssd, turn the graphics down, and enjoy.  lol"
7597,Nice
7598,"monki only play with fren. no fren, no play"
7599,Thumbs Up
7600,fun
7601,"The game has a very cool idea but it is ruined by the following points:
[list]
    [*]People with a very bad internet connection are impossible to hit. It is really gambling who wins...
    [*]Solo/Trio there are a lot of illegal team formations (from Platinum onwards it only gets less in Trio). Unfortunately reporting doesn't help, because I met the same team in solo three days in a row.
    [*]The worst thing in my opinion: despite the very cool idea to ask the community what should be changed, the balancing system should not be oriented to what the whole community says... There are very strange nerfs and buffs... More precisely I am only talking about current heroes. You should look at the facts! No one wants their main to be nerfed (which is totally understandable). Currently I'm talking about Tianhai Nerf which is just a meme... you could have made his look uglier and had the same effect.
[/list]

The game will be forgotten like Ring of Elysium. :("
7602,"10/10 game with 3/10 servers for small regions like south america
Very active discord and devs are listening, server situation could change"
7603,"The game is so much fun to play, the combat system is a bit hard to learn, but when you (if you) master it then it is all easy. The graphics are a bit weird for me, but in a good way. All in all it is a fun game to play with friends."
7604,"Great Game, really good PVPs."
7605,"Extremely good but challenging game!
The game is extremely fun and skill based. What i love about it is that there is barely any chance for players to win through luck or overpowered weapons/ characters. If you are better you will win almost all the time, depending on the skill gap you can literally kill multiple people hitless. 
Getting into the game can be extremly challenging as there are many ""hidden"" mechanics and knacks you have to know to advance into higher level games. Skills and ultimates feel balanced to me and i dont feel like any character or ability is overly opressive, every single one has its pros and cons.
Besides that, i would like to mention how awesome the developers react to community feedback!
Overall, if you look for an easy Battle royal game where you can win through equipment, or seeing the other Person first (eg Fortnite or PUBG) this is not the game for you. If you are looking for a game with a complex fighting system, various characters and skills though, then i can only recommend this game."
7606,Very nice
7607,"if you dont have a 3rd, this game is a hot steaming pile of shit."
7608,Love it <3
7609,The parkour needs a bit of a fix but overall it's an amazing game to play and it looks amazing as well!
7610,"TL;DR, A Fighting Game like Soul Caliber set within a Battle Royale.

Perfect for: 
- Fans of fighting games and battle royales.
- Try-hards. 

Not for: 
- Very casual or PvE players. 

Like most fighting games, getting good requires studying interactions and combos, and lots of practice. However, putting that idea inside of a BR game allows a lot more emergent gameplay, and escapes the tedious fighting game arena format. Beyond that, the movement within the game, which at first feels clunky and unwieldy, begins to feels very fluid and versatile once you get the hang of it, and ends up shining as one of the game's best qualities. 

All of the characters and weapons are viable, but there are a few balance changes that need to be made. As I write this, the dagger is in a tier of its own, and all of the other weapons are worse but equalish."
7611,"The game graphic so amazing and the movement of the character in the game during the so fluid .

I recommend for anyone seeking to find new kind of the battle royale. 

the combat mechanic of the game is so well designed with parry and each weapon got the individual each combo. 

it worth it to try if you already boring with current state of the battle royale such as FPS battle royale. 

Good game"
7612,"indeed, Naraka is love, Naraka is life!"
7613,very good can be like attack of titian
7614,"One of the best battle royals ever, It's new and refreshing would totally recommend it 100%!!!!!!!!"

You can become Shrek and defend your swamp? checked.

Do I need to give any other reasons to get this game?"

7623,"I like the game... though at the same time Id say there should be more belongingness to the team and companionship... Most of the time you queue and you can get #1 in the whole game without saying a word to your teammate. I try to talk a lot but nobody replies even when its pretty chill and nobodys attacking us. The best part about many battle royale or team games for me are interaction with the teammates and possibly adding them as a friend later on but I havent been able to do the same in this game even once. Any random person can come.. you can team up... and u win. It hurts even more when you die and ur teammate just  runs away instead of reviving you. You really want to have friends that can play this game with you beforehand, which in my case, none of my friends are willing to play a game that costs money in the first place to play. Which I guess is another con of this game, being a paid game is getting more and more unpopular lately and rightfully so. Free to play games like Genshin and Valorant are doing much better nowadays because any casual person can give them a try and possibly become in love with it and even whale in that game. Plus having a game be free just adds so much more audience and people playing your game and sharing it with others, again popularizing the game. 
Also even though this is just a personal opinion but I find it really annoying when me and my team are fighting another team and some other team jumps in and kills our team and at that point skill isnt rly going to get you anywhere lol  youre just dead. 
The counter attack is pretty clanky, Its hard to hit it mid combo and  the best you can do is wait 1 second before being able to do it, for which youll have to really just wait for the enemy to use a heavy move so that you can counterattack. Greatswords are also unnecessarily OP and annoying.  
But you know all this aside I do enjoy the game, plus its got cute waifus and skins. Id recommend it."
7624,.
7625,"Horrible game, i played it so much my girlfriend left me, took the dog and kids with her. Still better than league of legends though.
Mostly because it's a very fun stress-free game that will comfort you with it's relaxing level design and non-tension inducing grappling and dodging mechanics.
10/10 would lie again on a review"
7626,"Its kinda fun, 2d fighting game mechanics in a 3d anime battle royal, the movement is definitely not clean but can give glimpses of promise. Buying anything other than the base game reeks of a scamboozle but you can customize yourself to look like handsome squidward sooooo 5/10"
7627,"its like a japanese battle roayale mixed with super smash bros
"
7628,"honestly i tried and have played quite a few hours, the game has so much potential but as of right now i cannot recommend playing this game until they fix some issues with lagging, and the FLOOD of chinese players who are either hacking or just pro's it ruins all the fun for everyone learning. Also getting spammed by grapple hooks one after another because the pro players carry 40 each i guess... who knows. hopefully soon they start banning all the flood of chinese players that have even taken over the leaderboards."
7629,i rate this gaem at 1 game-breaking patch out of 1.
7630,"If you're looking for a new take on the battle royale genre this is by far one of the best ones to come. Characters are interesting each with their own set of unique skills, which can turn the tides in a clash. Naraka is a skill based game, and battles last quite a while specially with another skilled player/team, however you'll need a lot of luck too if you're fighting multiple attackers. Game is worth the buy for battle royale fans, but for people who hates losing, stay away from this game. You'll die a lot in the early few games, there are a lot of really good players out there :D"
7631,"fun game, different, challenging, lil bit complex but nice...

7637,"If ya like BR games, and love samurai/ninja style games then this is the one for you. One of the best battle royals i have played in a long time. Plus it has grappling hooks for everyone, Who doesnt like grappling hooks? i take back everything i have said lol theres WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY to many NON NA players on the NA server all chinese its ruining the game sadly"
7638,Awsome battle royale game highly recommend
7639,"Starts you against bots for the first x games without telling you, and somehow still has latency issues. That combined with the pervasive mobile game-style monetization and ""daily rewards"" being pushed on the main screen really turned me off. Combat felt unrewarding even when I felt overpowered against the bots, because the skill checks were relatively infrequent."

7661,"The combat is a lot of fun, the movement is good too, just sometimes a little wonky because there are so many spots ur character could hold on to, but its something to get used to."
7662,"A fresh unique battle royale and frail hack and slash game. Love it

-Battle Royal = Not a new concept but with some eastern myth, character that each has unique skill and ability as well as a diverse amount of weapon to choose from katana(my fav) to chinese-jigsaw sausage mixer machine, can also using ranged weapon but try not to rely to it so much or you will always ended up dead. Trust your melle weapon

-Gameplay = Plenty of hero to choose and master from support to big oji san that will pull his enemies and slam them to the ground to a moba character. Each weapon (can be upgraded with jade to improve its ability) has many unique ability and moveset that can be utilized in times of need there's also three notable thing. You dont just hit enemies or do combo to them there's Parry, Charged Attack and basically, Spam
the rules are simple, If you see that the enemies spam you like your brother spamming same moveset over and over(spamming left/right click/normal attack) dont be panic!! Charge your attack and counter attack, what if they spam us with charged attack instead? now this is abit tricky, you will have to Parry and Disarm them, but how? you can click left and right mouse click together and your character will glow red, if charged attack enemies(your enemies will turn blue) hit you when you're on that state then they will be mini stunned, knocked back and have their weapon disarmed!!! Nice right? then what if they spam that instead? What? the parry thing? Just spam them back with flurry of left and right click combined, but note that some weapon after certain move will bound to use charged attack as their finished

-Customization = your character, your choice, you can edit your character make them cooler or prettier or troll them with some lantern head thing or whatever you want, you can do *gacha to get costume, skin and gesture or you can simply get a battlepass and play to claim your stuffs

-Frail character =  this doesnt mean that its bad. This means that in this game you can't be Kratos. You can be super powerfull and cool but sometimes you will just die without even realizing what happen, i play other game that took 30 minutes to hour to kill someone or something while they cant kill me or hurt me. That makes be bored, or playing a dynasty hack and slash(sorry dw fan) that literally send everything flying and kill important character in 10-20 hits. For me that's boring, and Naraka's Fun"

I refunded the game after my first match because of similar concerns, but bought it again a few days later to give it another try as the core mechanics looked interesting. Since then, besides the chinese smurfs, I have only had positive experiences with this game. First and foremost: THE GAMEPLAY LOOP IS FUN! Other than that, daily quests and character progress also feels rewarding & allows one to unlock a fair amount of cosmetics without spending additional money. So far so good."

7694,i like this game
7695,"Its a good game at first, its basically a combo fighter mixed with a battle royale. In the beginning your are set against bots and after some matches it sets you against real players. The skill level of players can be night and day with extremely good players owning your butt and making it basically impossible to play. Cosmetics are alright, some are color variants of the same skin while legendary can be its own thing altogether. Voice acting does not match up with the animations and the voice lines are terrible and too long and annoying to listen to. Balance wise, it is pretty balanced and the only thing holding you back is either RNG or your own skill. Would not recommend due to it putting me against people who have had way more experience than I had."

There isn't much we can do about them, they just had more time to play the game and its predecessor Meteor Blade, It doesn't mean much in the long run just a bit annoying right now with there Ping issues and time to get good at the game. Not a death nail or even much of a big deal in the long run just know you might get flexed on my a name you can't read for a bit. Just flex on them in like a week or two when you get to play a bit more."

Ranged options do exist, from crossbows and slow-firing muskets to environmental hazards that can be triggered by the right slice or shot at the right time. You also have a grappling hook that not only allows you to zip across the map and onto higher ground, but also harpoon and fly at opponents Attack on Titan-style.Aside from the hook, each ranged option exists to merely soften up opponents from a distance as they close in. Getting the big fat kill involves getting up close and personal with something sharp, and here, showdowns with opponents have more in common with Dynasty Warriors and SoulCalibur than Fortnite.

Each weapon has a number of melee combos, fancy uppercuts, charge maneuvers, and parries, which is augmented by power-up shards of jade you can either find or purchase while out in the field. While button-mashing the first enemy you see works when you're starting out (there are currently bots thrown in with actual players to ease you in at first) your first encounter with a player who knows what they're doing will teach you some brutal lessons.

You start learning that your parry has a Sekiro-like margin of success, and even that's predicated on a poorly-explained color system that tells you if your character has the ability to parry a specific attack altogether. Dodges are effective, but can be easily adjusted for by a smart, forward-thinking player. You'll even run into the dreaded mechanic of weapons and armor degradation, which sounds like the dealbreaker on paper. However, repair items are widespread, and the push and pull of every player--regardless of how skilled they are--needing to find respite in order to be successful creates a rather nice tension to every match. You're dealing with all of this while also wondering if the next warrior to finish you off hasn't been waiting in the trees for you the whole time. Everyone is vulnerable here, as long as you catch them at the right moment.

All in all, this is a very competitive and fast pace game. I really enjoyed it alot even tho I am still bad at it."
7721,"A bit difficult to learn, but it gets better once you understand how it works"
7722,aa
7723,"A friend intro me this game, what a pleasant surprise from my fav battle of royal genre. It's not the brainless FPS or TPS like the ones that crowded the market nowadays, but more of action-filled adventure that mimic the traditional chinese wuxia theme. very engaging and strongly recommended!"

7726,This game will make you grind 24/7. Enjoyable grind in leaderboards. Nice game mechanics when it comes to movements/skills/battle.
7727,Great game combat
7728,"This game is the best BR I've ever played, if only there were duos. kinda a bummer that people are using VPN's from other countries to claim top ranks in areas they don't live in, but the idea behind it is really awesome! good job on the dev team for that one, but def bring duos !"

7734,good
7735,This game is extremely fun and has a huge skill ceiling so it takes a lot of time and effort to become good at it. If you want to play this game then you need to learn to lose 90% of the time for months until you get decent and only lose 80% of the time.

7747,"I do not generally like BR type of games but to my surprise, I really enjoy this one! There is some pretty basic mechanics that work and they give it their own twists to make it really fun and challenging. Not the easiest game to get started, it is easy to get overwhelmed, but once you start to understand what's going on it gets easier. Worth the try, it would be a bummer not to at least dip your toe in Morus Island"

7759,"A friend had a gift code for this game and sent it my way, so I got this one for free. 

The gameplay itself is hella entertaining. Think if Sekiro was a battle royal. It clearly has a bit of polish left to go before it's perfect, but I'd say it's worth about $20 as is. 

The only thing keeping me from playing it solo is that it has absolute dogshit server connection at times. This is the only game in my library where my ping rests at 70+ms when I'm typically at 20-30ms in other games (I'm on wifi)."
7760,"Didn't think any future battle royale game would top Warzone, then I got my hands on this. Definitely recommend. Unique and fresh combat system with superb customization that you won't see in 95% of games. Can't go wrong."
7761,"It's alright I guess, overrated as fuck in my opinion."
7762,haha funny game kill people
7763,love it hopefully they get duos and work on the servers its the best br i played .
7764,dammnnnn. this game kinda lit ngl
7765,I have to agree with some of the comments im seeing. about everyone abusing vpn and playing on NA servers ... we cant hit them and they're abusing it for ranked.. all the leaderboards are filled with just them. in the top 10-20. Overall yes this is a very good game.. by far favorite battle royale so far. its a change of pace from what i have been playing and its thoroughly enjoyable. yes cosmetics are expensive... but they ARE OPTIONAL..  u wanna look pretty :) fork up the cash.. u wanna enjoy the game.. XD then enjoy the game :)
7766,poop
7767,so good

7772,very good gameplay i love it so much :3
7773,"Way more fun than i thought it was going to be, so far playing with someone you know is way more enjoyable than playing alone. 

The fights can get intense and the movement can be tricky at times, but when you make it out of a big fight with your boys it's as satisfying as any other BR."
7774,Great Game so far
7775,...
7776,ninja go brrr
7777,"I think these has appealing combat with comprise of outplay mechanics and great art. I would recommend this to anyone looking to play games similar to BDO, Lost Ark and even Apex. If you hate LoI(Losing to Improve)  games I dont you should pruchase it.

A few of the things it suffers from:
- could be it a little smoother in large battles (to be expected)
- cosmetics are well done but a bit pricey

7779,one of the best combat systems out there plus the BR mode which i really like
7780,"I absolutely love everything about this game from the smooth combat to the beautiful scenery! Everything flows very nicely and the pace of the game is very well balanced. Only thing I'm afraid of is the lack of region lock for ping, but I guess we'll tackle that monster when we get there."
7781,this game so cool
7782,SO GOOD
7783,nice
7784,GREAT GAME but definitely requires patience b/c mechanics are very hard to obtain
7785,"The game is great, as an avid dark souls 1 player/PvPer it reminds me of the really indepth combos/mechanics you can take advantage of to display you are a better player and create combos others wouldnt know of. Training pays off. Only thing I can complain about is the game is not region locked. So you will run into the foreign players that are lagging and makes alot of combat decisions and reactions just not really make sense... Besides that the game is amazing."
7786,good game fun 2 play
7787,i love this game! it is really hard but satifiying when you win
7788,It's good. It's fun with friends. Personally Solo's are better for competitive. I think they should take away the auto locking spool. Makes it a little to easy to win fights. But other then that solid game
7789,20$ well spend

7794,"Итак, я наиграл первые 10 часов и наконец то отошёл от ощущения ""А ТАК МОЖНО БЫЛО?"", так что коротко, что это за игра:
Это боевик состоящий из сражений как Mordhau/Dark Souls, но чуть чуть попроще, бегу по стенам и крюкам как в Titanfall, но не укачивает и сбалансировано и комбо атакам как в Mortal Combat, основным режимом которого является баттлрояль, но также есть стандартный набор других минигеймов.
Игра с китайской эстетикой, яркой графикой и приятным муз сопровождением. Они взяли всё лучшее из нескольких десятков проектов: Apex, Overwatch, CS GO, Mordhau, Genshin, Titanfall и даже Dota и завернули это в проект, который сложно чётко определить к какому-то жанру, ибо он является всем понемногу.

Тут понятный UX, где всё объясняется гифками, удобные тренировочные площадки, чтобы отточить навыки, красивые бои, хороший неткод, понятные оружия и способности персонажей и даже есть кастомные сервера для игры с друзьями.

Мне отдельно понравилось, что в этой игре не требуется долго лутать, чтобы начать веселиться, нет лишнего элемента с высадкой с неба, и постоянного лутинга патрон.
Разработчики буквально выкинули всё лишнее, оставили самые лучшие решения и перенесли жанр из только шутера в боевик с возможностью стрелять.

Желаю всем стать Хокагэ, пис!

7809,"If you dont have a SSD dont even bother its awful without one, I got it since it pre ordered since the beta ran fine and it was only recommended but it should be required holy shit. Dayz runs better. Which is saying something. I played the beta and never had a issue prior dont know what happened when they released the full game. Game was really fun when I was trying out the arena mode but can't really say anything else on the main game. Over all If you dont have a SSD this thing runs terribly and you shouldnt even bother. IF you do have one enjoy sweet combat and pray your opponent doesnt have a spear. <3"

7812,good game? nah lol very fun played both betas and out of all of that all i have to say it 8/10 the movement is weird and getting caught on shit is kinda annoying other than that great game very much recomend it seriously
7813,GG
7814,"So this is my very 1st battle Royal . I've never played these type of games before but after playing the beta this game has been growing on me , So I've decided to buy into the base version , I'm glad I have bought it , I'm really enjoying it and the more I play , the more I discover just how involved the stats go for building up your characters . It's got good progression. At the time of writing this I'm now Lv 35 and I've unlocked a few treasure chests and costumes plus some skins for weapons. Beware of  buying GOLD . It's ludicrous expensive. Some costume sets cost 3000 gold that equals around £20 or more for each one . I'm not spending money on cosmetics but I can see how people will become addicted and buy into it so be careful . You could easily spend hundreds of pounds without realising, I don't mind buying a battle pass now and again but that's all, I'm just going to enjoy the grind and have fun unlocking items in game. The map is a really nice place to game in with beautiful locations and the fighting animations are awesome to see. One more thing - The LOOT boxes suck balls. Gambling should not be allowed in games PERIOD.

7820,This is the first battle royal I've played that takes melee combat seriously. Each character and weapon has unique abilities and the game is still surprisingly well balanced.
7821,pretty great  and fun to play but rough on some aspect like the movement and lock-on that need to be reworked.
7822,Great game just dont be a quitter. Try all heroes
7823,Technical and satisfying. Takes time to learn.
7824,"mad fun, can be unforgiving and janky, but fills the gap left by other BRs and has awesome fantasy.

fun progression both learning and unlocking things, deep / complex combat"

7843,"After playing battle royales for 6+ years, I never thought I'd be hooked as strongly as I was when I first started. What makes this game unique when comparing to other BR's is the traditional style of melee combat you get when playing. Aside from the combat, Naraka's most gameplay-defining feature is its fast-paced movement, thanks to its plentiful dashes and grappling hooks. I've always been addicted to FPS's, with there being a few exceptions, namely H1Z1 and Fortnite. I feel as if I'm predisposed to favoring FPSs so I was surprised when I became so addicted to one that wasn't. Highly recommend trying this one out. I'm giving naraka a 8.5/10 due to the mega OP bloodrippers weapon that don't always spawn and the late-late game intensity isn't as high when the circle simply closes. Maybe they can try introducing new concepts into the game such as a moving zone, when it gets to a certain size? One thing I hope to see changed is that this BR is $19.99. I believe they need to hop on the free game with micro transactions wave. CoD, Battlefield, Halo, and more have already done this. If anything, you could purchase it and refund within 2 hours of playtime if you dislike it."

7845,"As with a lot of games like these. You might enjoy it in the beginning. But the more you play the worse it gets. This game is rn at my top 2 worst games I've ever played that could have been decent games but aren't. 

The Battlepass you bay 20 eur for needs you to no life this game in order to get all of the content promised in the battlepass or you could pay extra 100 eur.

The overall mechanics of the game arent explained at all so in order for you to actually be able to play this game and enjoy it requires for you to idk... at this point I dont even know myself how you can compete with most ppl that play this game. I personally looked for about 10 to 20mins for a combat guide... couldnt find one that explained anything. The game seems to be locked behind some obscure mechanics that have to be used 100% of the time or else youre not going to have a chance of winning. If I could refund this game I would. This game deserves around 5 bucks at best and with it being only a fiver.. you should get access to the whole game tbh."
7846,"game, game fun. fun games = enjoyment. play."
7847,ffffff
7848,"""Such a hungry thing the grave is. . .""

As of this review I am the best Temulch player in my state and among the top 500 players in solo play.
(And yes. I know the quote is a Yoto quote. Yes. I am a Yoto enjoyer, too.)

And I cannot recommend this game to anyone but to people with a proper internet connection. The game plays quite well, however there are still incredible needs for re balancing in several areas, including Daggers, Yoto and high ping players for notable ones. However the primary and biggest problem is that if you do not have the best ping available you will not be able to properly parry. This causes HUGE problems as it's part of the very core gameplay in order to disarm or even properly defend yourself. And fighting against people with high ping can be very jarring and random at best as they can appear to teleport around and even undo damage that you had applied to them as the server considers them in a different position compared to where you had been. 

While I personally will continue to play the game after this review, I cannot recommend this game to general users and action enthusiasts. It's a very difficult game to get into, though it has a considerably high skillcap for those whom enjoy that scene to enjoy."

7852,"When my friend invite me to play this game, i was concerns about my pocket money and was expected this game wont bring me play along but just to have fun time with friends, after i bought it i found out this is another battle royale gaming experience and i didnt expected this game can bring me so much of satisfying. However, a very indeed worth game to buy. 

[h1] I RECOMMENDED YOU MUST TRY THIS GAME  [/h1]"
7853,So I spent a majority of my time making my friend's face in the game so I can hangout with them during the lock down.
7854,"The game itself is alright. Swordplay br. Plays kind of weird, and seems heavily unbalanced. You'll hit a good streak of killing dumb AI, then get ambushed by a random player and get two-hit somehow. 

The real selling point is the character customization though. You can make some absolute abominations of humanity."
7855,was okay. i didnt play long mostly like two games after that i request refund.
7856,"fun, unique, battle royal verson of blade and soul, fights is comic intense and high skill"

I highly recommend you tried it out if you have a hand to hand combat dream. You would love it! let's go ! The team play you need to pull off in 3 v 3 ranked, the skill you need to practice in single player mode. You will love this game!"
7872,paying money for this game is just a mistake. 10/10 for worst game of 2021.
7873,lol
7874,"This game's execution on introducing players to BR is fundamentally pretty good. It was a nice spin to add bots into beginner games, to give the players a bit more confidence and to allow them to control the flow of combat to ease the transition into fighting actual players. I enjoyed that. I don't think they intentionally did this to bypass the Steam 2 hour refund policy to lock in profits. That seems like an awful business decision that would hang the entire product on the basis that no one would refund it. They put more work into this and it's clear.

Furthermore, the flow of combat is exceptional. It's very in-depth, however easy enough where a lot of the complexity relies in outplaying opponents. As someone who plays this to rank up, and has the battle pass, along side who has spent roughly $30 in excess on top of the pre-order, I am satisfied with the purchase. I like the ranking system, the constant requests from developers on feedback, and it's clear that they have their hands full. I can say a lot about how much I like the game, however let's talk about some issues:

[b]Grapple Hook Spam:[/b] This has to go. I don't know the solution. Glyphs? CC Immunity? Disable auto target? Not sure. But it has to stop. It's just boring.

[b]High Ping Players:[/b] Yeah, I can see this problem. It's not cool.

[b]Region Lock:[/b] Not sure about this -- but I do see a LOT of Chinese players in my games, and I don't really care except for the fact that I can't communicate with them due to language barriers.

[b]Jump/RMB Spam:[/b] So. Annoying. 

[b]Optimization/FPS Issues:[/b] I think they celebrated this a bit too early. I have a RTX 3070 OC and I can't even touch 200 FPS on my 240Hz display @ 1440P LOWEST settings.

[b]Hacking:[/b] I haven't seen any.

[b]Teaming:[/b] This is starting to bug me. Even in solo's - it feels like I am being targeted by a pack of people. Could be bots, but it's just infuriating.

[b]Tian Hai's Ult:[/b] Nerf the range on that pull, good lord. As a Plat 3 player, I struggle with the counter play outside of hitting weak spots when his team mates are grapple spamming so he can grab you. Cheesy, for sure.

[b]Animation Cancelling For Movement:[/b] My god. What's the point in adding Grapple Hooks into a game to travel across the map if I can just animation cancel into a blue focus into a dash - this means I don't get grappled, I travel at a good speed, and I'm not locked down. 

[b]DUO QUEUES:[/b] Add this ASAP! I think this would be AMAZING!

[b]English Translations:[/b] This is a big problem for me. There are even some weapon descriptions that show coding errors in the description of the weapon, like a color code. The skill descriptions aren't simplified and don't feel as though it clearly represents what the variant of one skill does versus another. It just feels like it's been thrown into google translate.

And lastly:

[h1]NARAKA: BLADEPOINT ROADMAP[/h1]

[i]I can't believe I have to even express this - the importance of a published road map that outlines the vision for the game creates a huge community presence. Sure, feedback is important - but how do I know that I am being heard, as a customer, if the roadmap doesn't reflect my concerns or even shines a small light that an issue is going to be looked at, much less addressed in the near future? Where's the vision? What are you planning to do with this game?  Collaborations? Optimizations? DLC? More characters? New maps? New weather elements? Seasonal events? Server-side upgrades? Adding new items into the game? Enabling DX12? What are you [b]doing?[/b][/i]"

7880,"20$ for 100 hours of fun~. If that's good for you then you should buy this game but if you value your sanity then you should not.

The game is really fun at the beginning but once you get used to the combat, the skills, the map and the movement and once you gain some rating and meet other people who are also used to these things then you realize that the game is completely luck based and requires little to no actual skill and the only way you're going to climb is through patience and macro play rather than killing people which is completely and utterly disappointing. 

It IS a typical battle royale  , gear matters too much and getting gear is luck based. Ganking is even worse than normal BR cus of perma stun/stagger mechanic so you essentially can't move when outnumbered. The damage is stupidly high and you can get 1-2shot with 10min+ queue/wait time for the next game. It's horrible. The final circle is a complete joke. It shrinks to the point of disappearing and on high elo there are 5+ people alive when this happens so you're not even having a ""skill based 1v1"" exchange or anything it's just luck 
.. just like its combat, the combat system is based on light hits, focus attacks and counter hits and each one of these counters another one but the parry system is complete dogshit as it is delayed and ping plays a role on how parry works and you actually have to use it earlier or it won't work but if your enemy decides to cancel his focus attack then he can just hit you with light attacks and you die. It's essentially a ""mind game "" (which is the deceptive way of saying its a 50/50). It's complete luck. If you watch top players duel they are dying the same way as plebs do, the only difference is their movement is more fancy and their fights are faster but in the end its the same ""rock , paper , scissors"" type of gameplay which is not skill based. 
Combine the RNG combat with the RNG gear and the ganking/outnumbering ( which is out of your control and is essentially rng ) and you have yourself the most luck based game i've ever played in my life. You can finish top 5 three games in a row then have three games where you're 60/60 , last place, because you got stunned randomly by terrain before you could even get a weapon because for some reason these devs thought it would be a good idea to put random stun lanters all over the place which trigger whenever they want. Holy shit.

The game actually has desync. If you dodge an arrow but on the enemy's screen he hit you then you'll get hit, which is a fucking joke. I dodged the fucking arrow but since the guy hit me on his screen i die even tho i didn't get hit. 

All in all, the waifus are S tier. The costumes are exceptionally good, the characters look good, the animations are fluid and the game looks pretty but the combat is a joke and the balancing is a joke and the battle royale aspect of it all is a joke. The game is fun and definitely worth the money for some hours of fun and who knows maybe you'll fall in love with it and learn how to deal with its bullshit (you can't, unless you're stubborn or in a mental phase) but other than that its a pile of wasted potential. I mean there's still time, perhaps the devs will wake the fuck up and fix the glaring issues but maybe they'll stay arrogant and not do shit about the dumbass combat. And shit as i write this (between queue for games) i get killed within 15 seconds of game start because i couldn't get a weapon and my enemy wouldn't stop chasing me because he got lucky enough to get a weapon. Fucking joke battle royale concept

i bet the zoomers are gonna love this luck based garbage because it doesn't actually require skill so even garbage can win 

i feel like the devs didn't even test this game outside of 1v1 duels in custom mode which has nothing to do with the real gameplay of this bs 

also i heard they're planning on nerfing melee defense soulgems (its basically random shit you use to upgrade your char in game by picking them up) because they're too strong compared to the rest of the soulgems which will make you even squishier than you are now which is dumb as hell and its clear that they have no clue what they're doing. Maybe they should nerf the inflated damage so that those gems wouldnt be a requirement to play the game how bout that? 


i'm triggered cus the game is good but a few dumb decisions ruined everything. Those type of games are the ones that get people's blood fking boiling, the ones that are just close to being good but some idiot in the development team had the stupid idea to do X or Y and undermine the effort of everyone else in the team 

"
7881,"I cannot recommend the game in its current condition for the following reasons:

1. Region lock, Asian name everywhere in EU,NA Abusing off High pings advantage, Clearly it's the first to work at. Fix Asap.

2. Fix parry, Too unreliable with prediction style. Reaction best imo. 
+ Imagine attack 2 lmb vs greatsword > GS clash > you press parry, but you will not have the time Even if you know he will go blue attack clash instant because of the animation of the parry which comes too late. ( Very Frustrating this is not skilled. ) Fix in 2nd in priorities.

3. Add a potential comeback when 2-3 player focus at the same time so you have a '' potential outplay '', ex : For Honor > Yellow Aura you can't be stunlocked when 2 or more player focus you. (it's a idea) this can be changed, but we need a potential play vs 2-3 player, atm is just stupid you're stunlocked infinitely.

4. Bot in games ? Look at bloodbath max 5 real players the rest is bots. I prefer a queue of 1min with real players than 10-30s with bots and i think many of us think the same. + According to steamcharts the game is in good state in terms of players, WHY PUTTING BOTS ? Terrible idea and players will not be prepared to encounter Real players, Like i prefer waiting 1min queue for all real players than 10-30s For 5 Real players and rest is bots. Need a Real FIX. ( Ranked have bots too high in gold, so not only bloodbath )

5. Too many Hacker and Smurf in game, many of them are foreign players. ( I have nothing against foreign players but it is not fun at all for new players and normal players. )

6. I don't even know why in Naraka you have a Battlepass and money currency, it's a Buy 2 Play game. Battlepass is for Free to play games. Terrible Idea to put this in B2P Games. it's look like dev just want you're money. I Will that some skins can only be bought by real money, Look at Yoto Hime skin for example, can't unlock him in Chest just real money. Atleast put her in chest.  

7. Dash Parry transform into attack.
Bug  : when you do : Dash > parry it's an attack
Lmb > Dash > Parry = Attack too

So it's a bug reliated to dash. Need a fix asap. ( The problem not occurs on Dagger cuz of Gold Dash so no bug on Dagger for the dash parry bug) but occurs on all others weapons.

For the few hours that I have played I have already been able to see that. I also grouped together most of the negative reviews that were `` true '' on the assumption and that I tested myself.
This is not a rage post or anythings, it's clearly what I think the game would be good for and I really think the game has potential. But so far it is not correct for the reasons I cited."
7882,"Edited review:
I played the game again since its free right now and recommended some of my friends to come try. The new update makes the game unoptimized and runs poorly, before I can play at 80ish FPS and now it runs on 25-35 FPS. I do not recommend people buying it, trying the game for free is enough.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:

So far its fun and very addicting, it's not an easy game but once you get the hang of it, it's really fun.

Refreshing BR game with huge learning curve, make sure to learn how the combos work and how to counter them, there's a lot of tutorials for advanced movement, combos, and counters."

7884,"my keyboard broke because of this game, i rate 10/10"
7885,"Итак, я наиграл первые 10 часов и наконец то отошёл от ощущения ""А ТАК МОЖНО БЫЛО?"", так что коротко, что это за игра: 

Это боевик состоящий из сражений как Mordhau/Dark Souls, но чуть чуть попроще, бегу по стенам и крюкам как в Titanfall и комбо атакам как в Mortal Combat и стрельбой. Основным режимом которого является баттлрояль, но также есть стандартный набор других минигеймов.
Игра с китайской эстетикой, яркой графикой и приятным муз сопровождением. Они взяли всё лучшее из нескольких десятков проектов: Apex, Overwatch, CS GO, Mordhau, Genshin, Titanfal, даже Dota и завернули это в проект, который сложно чётко определить к какому-то жанру, ибо он является всем понемногу.

Тут понятный UX, где всё объясняется гифками, удобные тренировочные площадки, чтобы отточить навыки, красивые бои, хороший неткод, понятные оружия и способности персонажей и даже есть кастомные сервера для игры с друзьями.

Мне отдельно понравилось, что в этой игре не требуется долго лутать, чтобы начать веселиться, нет лишнего элемента с высадкой с неба, и постоянного лутинга патрон.
Разработчики буквально выкинули всё лишнее, оставили самые лучшие решения и перенесли жанр из ""только шутера"" в ""боевик с возможностью стрелять"".  

Желаю всем стать Хокагэ, пис!

It does however have a few issues, most notably people circumventing regional locks and thereby playing with high latency.

I guess it's a matter of taste whether you like prediction- or reaction-based gameplay. Both are of course viable as a mechanic, I would just prefer it being the other way around.
It is nevertheless great fun though, especially with friends."

7929,"Naraka is heavily flawed but still fun at its core. The idea of a wuxia battle royale game is a fresh take on the genre and shows a lot of promise. That being said, let's talk about what Naraka does well and what it fails on.

Good:

+Core Combat. The basics of the combat can be drilled down to a very simple combat triangle: normal attacks beat counters, counters beat charged attacks, and charged attacks beat normal attacks. Most players will have no issue grasping this super simple system and learning the timing on each weapon and how to manage your combos well will give experienced players something to keep learning and mastering as they play. This sort of ignores ranged weapons, but they also fulfill a role in allowing you to take up space and clean up kills in a sense. Every weapon feels somewhat impactful, with some (Spear/Dagger) moreso than others (Repeating Crossbow).

+Looting. Naraka simplified looting while also adding additional complexity that means that you can almost always improve or pivot your build after every kill. The core of looting (picking up weapons and cosmetics) is made super simple through the large item bag (and limited item selection) and the extra weapon bag, that allows you to change your weapons at any time. On top of this, the Souljade system functions as an additional ""perk"" system that allows you to customize your bonuses to fit your playstyle. These range from generic bonuses (extra health, reduced melee damage, deal additional damage) to weapon-specific upgrades and sidegrades, as well as some nuts legendary perks like refilling your armor fully when you kill someone or sapping armor on hit. Souljades alone make the endgame more interesting since you are almost always able to find an upgrade or sidegrade that would benefit you.

Bad:

-Servers. Long story short, players are not locked to their own region. High ping is a serious issue, as combat is very much twitch based and requires you to react to enemies instantly. Running into a player who is not from your region is intensely frustrating.

-Solos. The map feels too big for trios (but not necessarily in a bad way), but too small for solos. In most fights, you'll end up in an endless stream of third partying that will generally not be fun to deal with. If you haven't gotten one of the aforementioned armor sapping souljades, you're gonna have an awful time. I highly recommend playing trios if you do get into ranked.

-Balance. The game needs a serious balance pass in the future. Weapons like the Daggers and Spears are incredibly strong and tend to dominate the meta without any real recourse. This can be incredibly frustrating if you aren't comfortable with those weapons, as you'll have a ton of issues countering them in fights. I have no doubt that this will be fixed eventually.

-Cosmetics. This game has typical NetEase-style monetization that you'd see in a free-to-play game inside of a paid game. It's frustrating to deal with the multiple currency types and the strange battle pass system on top of loot boxes to earn new cosmetics.

Overall, however, I think the core of the game is strong enough that you can ignore these faults and just have fun with the game. Servers and balance are a bit of a problem, but you won't always run into them."

7932,nice game
7933,"After 700 hrs into this game i won't recommmend it only because of such a terrible port. My laptop with 16gb ram and ryzen 7 4800h processor starts lagging and overheating because of this game. 

My first ever negative review for any game.

The port is terrible."
7934,"Great game, love the combat!  However, you cannot say Winnie the Pooh because Xi Jinping is easily offended.  Also, played a game where two teams of characters whose skin were all pink, teamed up into a squad to kill all trios.  EZ Chinese players can't support themselves without the Great Emperor King Winnie the Pooh protecting them."

7936,"Setting and Graphics: Beautiful
Sound: georgous orchestral asian inspired ST
Gameplay: in the beginning (against Bots) very easy...later on in the game it becomes harder against other human players, BUT it is always very rewarding and almost never unfair. If you loose it's beacause you didn't pay attention. The Skill-Celieng is very very high in this game.
Progression: there is a steady progression with lots ans lots of cosmetics and minor buffs (glyphs), almost every round rewards you with something
Controls: easy to learn hard to master

Overall I really like this game, it's like a speed bushidoblade warzone :D

7937,Great fighting mechanics. Time to kill is long enough so you don't get killed by a random sniper or camper like the other Battle Royales.

7940,I need to say I love how they make the 12000 Gold + 10 Box top up cost like $92? and with tax $98 where I'm at so I don't have to pay for the tax like other games which make me pay $107 every time. ( Gacha games I top-up over Thousands and I lose at lease $70 on tax per $1000 spent ) BUT NARAKA MAKE YOUR RATES HIGHER MAN AT LEAST 1-2% DROP FOR RED INSTEAD OF 0.3%!!

Netease has said they are working on a solution, but until they fix this GLARING issue, the game is pretty much unplayable with every player you try and fight having 700+ms ping, rendering the quick reaction based combat meaningless. The Devs have said they are going to address this issue and I hope it is soon because this game has a lot of potential."
7958,THIS JOINT IS FIRE
7959,"Fantastic graphics, fast-paced and responsive combat, lots of combos and playstyles. Everything I want in a Battle Royale 👍"
7960,"I've only dabbled a little with Fortnite with a couple friends, and I really did enjoy playing that game - but I had always imagined if it was more something like this game. This has fulfilled my wild imaginations. And despite being a total noob still, with much to learn as far as the combat goes, I'm having a total blast. 
I feel the cosmetic shop isn't terribly over the top or overpriced. I mean for 10 bucks you can buy 3 pretty decent looking outfits if you even want to spend extra cash at all. The system for the cosmetics is almost exactly like Overwatch - almost exactly. But I personally felt Overwatch was much more predatory. Although I'm still new (you gain loot boxes from leveling weapons, heroes, etc.) I've been getting free loot boxes just for playing the game every few matches. Any even despite the loot boxes, there are just as many cosmetics that don't come from a loot box anyways - you'll get it from playing the game/leveling heroes whatever. And the looks you get from playing are just another color scheme of the one someone paid for. Long story short - don't worry about the cosmetic shop. You can still look dope and not spend a penny.
I appreciate the Bloodbath mode where you just go at it against other players, I find it's a great way to practice your combat skills with no drawback - because it will take practice to get good.
The weapons and heroes to choose from are fun and I look forward to seeing what else they may come out with!
"
7961,GOOD GAME
7962,The freedom to climb on anything and parkour around is definitely addicting but the cringe fan service and clunky combat were the biggest turn offs for me.

---

I would recommend this game for people who like PVP, action, battle royale, souls like, slasher games"
7965,"Before i bought naraka i was depressed, lonely, had no friends, and in debt. none of these changed but the games pretty lit ngl"
7966,"Overall the game is a fun-ish and decent BR. But, I have to give this game a thumbs down for the moment, because I believe there are a few things the company needs to change in order for the game to actually exist in the current BR landscape.

High Ping players ruin the fighting. If you are fighting against a player with high ping the whole combat goes out the windows because of its heavy reliance on combos and parries. If you can't predict a combo or a focus attack correctly, you're going to get stomped and its stupid hard to predict said mechanics when the other player is lagging in the fight.

The shop and rewards are an absolute joke. Like, EA/Activision but worse. The makers claim its like Apex Legends but I don't remember Apex being this scummy and greedy to players. Basically you have 2 currencies (gold and spectral silk) and 3 store fronts. You have cosmetics that be can be purchased only with gold, cosmetics that can only be bought with silk, and cosmetics that are locked behind loot boxes with shit drop rates. Like I can't use spectral silk, the currency I get from opening immortal treasures and getting duplicates all the damn time, to buy something directly from the immortal treasure boxes. I can only on items that I really don't want. That's the scummy part in my opinion. They force you into buying more treasures to get those items, and there is not any protection either! At first, after 100 boxes, you can get 1 guarantee red (the highest quality) item....but thats it...you get 1 of those. You can open another 100 and there is no protection. I think like every 10 gives you an epic item but good luck getting those red items that you may want. Greedy company with shitty loot boxes.

There are some weapons that are just stupid and even worse in the hands of players with high ping. Great Swords just power through everything. You can parry...if the timing is correct which relies, once again, on ping. Spear can just trap you and there only a few characters with escapes.  About the only 2 that are ""balance"" are katana and long sword, but even those are a pain if parries don't work. I would say like 1/2 the time my parries are legit off. Fine. I accept I am bad, but other times my parries are on point the game doesn't care and just lets the attack go through.

All in all, this game is fun right now, but I can see it fading away easily into the landscape without some customer focused choices. Start Ping locking people. Match up pings. Someone VPNing in Asia onto NA servers with 200 ping should not be allowed. Second, fix the loot boxes. Better protection from duplicates and allow me to use spectral silk I get from getting duplicates to purchases the items I actually want. I am fine with spending gold directly on cosmetics as well (though that stuff is pricey). And honestly I think I the weapon issues would get better when everyone is in the same ping rang. When the focus attacks happen when they show they are about to happen, parries can counter them. Though spear is still oppressive when using its nezha attack.

Don't go bananas like I did and spend anything beyond the $19 for the game, you will not be rewarded. Will change the review when they change their practices."
7967,"I could recommend the game if there was Regionlock and maxping, but until this wont happen you will get stunlocked and rubberbanded by serverhopping players...

asian players are teaming against almost everyone who isnt asian

SEA and NA player are on EU for pingabuse

asians go to eu to avoid all the hackers and lagswitcher and become what they hated on their own server

you like cosmetics? fck this bullshit 0.3% for the highest rarity you could spend thousands and wont get one of the 4 extremes (within the first 100 lootboxes you are guaranteed 1 extreme cosmetic, which could be not the one youre looking for)


the game itself, is pretty dope, you can pull nice combos and demolish numbskull mouse1 spammers, devs listen to nerf and buff demands
but seriously take too long to lock away lagabusers or server hoppers...im curious what they will do about the shitty lootbox rates
"
7968,Game is beyond clunky and laggy. The game is a cool concept but poorly executed. If they fix the game up in the future then I might try it out again but as of now I'm refunding.

7973,"Fun fighting battle royale, really polished for its type as a lot of thing could go wrong, so far I have enjoyed it and the learning curve gets steeper as you proceed through the ranks, so the game encourages you to focus more on movement and cancelling attacks rather than spamming left/right click. The developers also listen to the community as some issues were addressed in a relatively fast pace in comparison to other developers. Game still staying strong"
7974,"Now, there's few things I'd like to say about the game overall, but I will not.
Freshly released, and there's much to be done to smooth it out.
Spontaneous ping drops are expected, due to MP nature of this..but when this prevents you from playing completely, despite having 17ms link to your region server, then something isn't quite working as it should.

Another ridiculous thing, instead of allowing game to pre-load the map, for easy game start, they just slapped a text ""For optimal experience install game on SSD"", and called it a day.
So in same fashion as an user, I'll say ""How about no?"", and proceed to complain on game being choppy.

Those two massive gripes aside, game is rather fun."
7975,good game
7976,Stun Lock Simulator

7980,really fun game liek apex but different theme
7981,"Edit: Ok, I re-bought the game because what the heck! And I must say, personally I had no issues with ping abusers so far. HOWEVER, the great sword is incredibly OP. You say I am just bad? Well, I just slap enemies as soon as I use the great sword, so that's that. Also, the new hero - Yoto Hime - has disgustingly overpowered special abilities and when combined you stand no fuxxing chance whatsoever. So, yeah... 

As long as you are looking for a balanced, competitive game, this is not it! Not even close!
It is still fun to jump in for some rounds a week. Customization is through the roof, graphics are nice and smooth with good DLSS implementation, the parcour / grappling hook movement is unique and much better than in Assassin's Creed (yes!), the map is very varied and you keep finding new places, especially since there are different types of daytime and weather, and the combat, of course, is very, very unique and believe it or not, it makes BR feel fresh. 

But the poor balancing, my oh my.



Game seems pretty good but I wouldn't really know because within 2 hours I have not once encountered a human player. And yes, yes, I have read the statement. The devs implemented bots to grant new players a smoother entrance into the game. At least that's what they claim. One could ask, of course, how playing against brain dead bots who get stuck in walls constantly will prevent the new player from getting whipped as soon as he is to fight human players. I'd even suggest that training with dumb bots for 2 hours is counter-productive since the new player will acquire a false sense of how combat works. 

I suspect that this is their unique way of binding the players to the game for so long that they cannot refund anymore. Apparently they are thinking that as soon as a game is hard or people lose, they will immediately refund. They don't have a place in their worldview for the myriad of players who are actually intrigued by a hard game. 

But again, I wouldn't know since the game (which is a multiplayer game, mind you!) doesn't allow me to play against human players for the first few hours. What I do know is that the developers obviously think that I am a weak, whiny boy who is in need to get slowly (and very boringly) introduced intto their game. 

What I do not know is: 1. how the servers are working in my region (kinda important for a game from China, innit?) 2. how long the matching time in my region is. 3. How the game actually feels when played against enemies who have a brain. 

This - and not the difficulty of the game - will make me refund."

7983,It's a great game!! Unique BR gameplay because we use swords!! Almost like Monster Hunter but we kill players now not a monster!! Fast paced combat like Sekiro and... That's it!! It's so much worth guys!!
7984,This game is amazing!
7985,its sometimes laggy but overall i love the game
7986,it's hard but still fun

7991,"One of those ""easy to learn, hard to master"" type of games I really like this battle royale. Naraka has a very anime feel to the combat especially at higher levels and is very reminiscent of musou games like dynasty warriors. Finally a competitive game that us Musou gamers can finally flex on. The only problem I have with the gameplay is it does seem to have lag issues when all 60 players are alive luckily it smoothes out around 45 people left. Each character is powerful in their own way and instead of feeling like everyone was made weaker to deal with each other for balance it is more of a make every character super powerful for balance which I love. Monetization is something I do find issue with as it is not a free to play game yet there are 3 currencies, a battlepass, and lootboxes making it clear this game is not a passion project in any form and is a cynical cash grab looking to corner the anime end of battle royale. All together in my opinion a fantastic game with a great initial price and tons of room for competitive play to develop into something of an art form. We can only hope this developer is able to suck enough cash out of whales so us sensible gamers can get some good updates at a good pace."
7992,"Most infuriating unbalanced piece of  s*** ever created. Just play Spear for 100 to 0 stagger or Great sword right click auto parry auto counter auto kill everything and EASILY win everything. And thats not the only unbalanced things you can simply play YOTO HIME the last characters added (big pink sword) which will 3 / 4 shot anyone and its auto aim like THIS WHOLE GAME made for consoles. AUTO AIM in supposedly competitive game.

Don't waste your money or more importantly your time."

8000,"This game is truly a masterpiece. I love how calculated the combat feels, although it definitely is quite difficult to get a feel for.

The best part of this game is that everything is simple apart from the combat, the heals are simple the shields are simple, repairing weapons, etc. however the combat has a very intricate feel with precise timing and cool ass combos.

If you keep playing and learning from combat mistakes, you can really master this game in such a badass way. I love this game so much and would recommend!!"
8001,"Terrible. The connection issues make the game entirely unplayable. Almost immediate molestation of my bandwidth and ping numbers look ridiculous.  Currently, would not recommend."

8009,"The more you play, the more you understand on how unbalance this game is at this stage. Still, this game has some potentials.

So far, the issues are:

1. There is no transparency on the damage dealt by the weapons and its attack speed. Somehow spear is faster than a dagger and dagger dealt more damage than a Greatsword (without souljades advantages of course). Also, Spear counterattack movement is way too unfair as you can't dodge or move when its land you the chain attack.

2.  Repeating Crossbow need to be nerfed. For real, is it repeating crossbow or an arrow machine gun with infinity arrows that do not need to be reloaded???? It is totally unfair, especially if it is yellow quality with volley equipped as the souljades.

2. Hero Yuto Hime's ultimate move and skill are unbalance atm, the spirit slash causes delay on your movement giving a total advantages to her ultimate skill that dealt huge damage especially if it is equipped with  a full atk souljades.

3. A bounty mission is too unfair giving one an advantages by revealing certain player location while there is no counter measure as the bounty target. And it is totally random. It would be better if there is a notification for the target if the assassin is nearby

4. Roller Coaster ping and fps as this game does not applies any region lock yet.

In conclusion, this game is indeed good BUT if you want to try it, perhaps wait for it is on a sale for a fairer price."

8028,"The game's balance is still not good. The greatsword is too strong, and it hard to parry. The ranking system is also suck. Even if you enter top 10 with lots of kills, you still receive about 10-15 points. ANd if you lost early, you lose about 8 points."
8029,Better than FORTNITE
8030,"I sucks at playing fps shooting game since my aim skill is not that good, however I really like games like Apex Legends, PUBG, Counter Strike, Valorant, etc. This game however, offers a unique kind of play style in my opinion, which is a melee-oriented combat style unlike games I mentioned before that offers a shooting-oriented combat style which enables people like me who sucks at playing shooting-oriented games emerge ourselves in a similar games like Apex Legends in a melee-oriented which focuses more on movement, reflex, and timing rather than aiming skills. 

As of writing this comment, the game has only been out for about two weeks, therefore there are still some areas that are quite lacking in this game which I would like to address below :

1) Free training mode needs more improvement such as a hotkey to quickly resurrect the bot rather than having us waiting them to slowly stand up which is quite annoying.

2) This is not a bug or an error however I would suggest to rename ""nearby chat"" and ""party chat"" to ""nearby voice chat"" and ""party voice chat"" as it was kinda confusing for new players *well I was confused at first lol* about where is the push to talk button and it turns out that it was the ""party chat"" for party push-to-talk button and ""nearby chat"" for nearby push-to-talk button.

3) Add some more flexibility in the key binding section such as the ability to switch on or off the scroll wheel button to switch between weapons, or switch off the left mouse button + right mouse button for countering, and so on.

4) I would suggest adding a guild feature which will be kinda cool and makes the game more lively in my opinion.

5) Adding a server chat room would be nice to enable players helping each other out or even making parties to play trios matches.

6) This can be both good for battlepass owners and bad for those that's holding to buy it however I would still suggest adding an exp multiplier for the tidal battlepass exp if you do purchase the battlepass as it is quite hard to level it up in the current system, hence making players hesitant or holding to buy it until they have capped the level for the current season battlepass *this is actually only my opinion if you guys want to generate more cash without breaking the game's balance*.

That's all from me as of writing this comment, and overall the game has been a 7/10 for me. It would be 10/10 if it has better graphics, lower price tag *which makes more people play the game*, and all of the things i've listed above. Thanks for reading this comment."

NOTE: First few hours in game will be bot matches but that is to help you get used to get the game. Game is pretty much like rock paper scissors but it gets complex when you have more playtime as you learn that there is lots of variable to consider that can turn the tides of the battle."

8081,"This game is a ton of fun and reminds me of an old sleeper hit, Iron Phoenix. Especially with the weapon system where your move set and how you play is based on what weapon(s) you use. Learning the weapons and how to fight against them can be daunting with the movement system and the grappling hook but, once you get it down the counter/power hit mind games are chef's kiss!"

8084,"hesitated to buy the game, as it costs 20€...but I watched a lot of videos beforehand. One of the most engaging game I've played since a long time!!! Just bought it today and I just couldnt stop playing & improving. Its a combination of a fighting game (combo, uppercut and so on) and a Battle Royale game. Bloodbath mode is a lot of fun as well. Should have a free Trial in my opinion thats why 9/10!!!"
8085,"a good battle royale game with nice melee combat.
i generally don't play pvp type games, nevertheless this is very fun game for me although hard to win as well. many people in here are quite skilled players about melee fighting. so be prepared to lose a lot of matches if you are not in this kind.

character creator (face only) is quite impressive. however we can't morph body, both manipulation and variation of costumes are very limited.(many of them are recolored version.)"
8086,"It's pretty fun and addictive once you learn the basics of this game, from experience - if you have a gaming laptop I recommend installing this game on a SSD and having decent enough internet so you're not lagging and the game doesn't feel choppy etc. This game requires a lot of practising in my opinion, don't feel bad if you don't do well. The game's chill and the skins are absolutely beautiful too ♥"
8087,"I love the parkour and how aggressive you can be.  Lots of mobility tricks, for example, you can push in front of a player and they don't see you because of camera angle, attack from cover or high ground.  Some heroes recover from getting hit and others have higher mobility to bait out abilities.  Really love how mobility beats tankiness beats cc beats damage beats mobility layers."

I'll tell you this now- if you lag, it doesn't only effect your synchronisation, but your character stutters everywhere, things don't load it, controls (even local like pulling up the settings menu) don't register.  

Its like someone built this game with everything running off the tick event- other game devs or hobbiests will understand that reference.  Avoid this game if you love yourself- nobodies patience is that high."

8095,Didn't like fortnite but I like this lol
8096,Love the game but it needs work still each time i go into combat with another player the game starts to lag or skip in which sometimes if you mean to dodge or counter the game will not read your command and i have great settings picked out for the game and everything is upgraded and ready it's not your pc it's the game it's self no matter what you do you will not be able to completely fix it again great game just needs working in that area.
8097,skill gap is fucking stupid. they fool you with bots for like 5 games. then you just suck because of the skill gap. fuck this fucking game.
8098,i recommend it ! tho it can be bit laggy but its fun and has much potential if you learn the game more and more. i love a game where you can be some type of assasin with fun wall jumping and moving around. too bad you can only play with 3 people in a team tho
8099,"If you like battle royale fighting games, this is most likely one of the best ones.  It's a very hard game and very rewarding once you get better at the game.  There's so much involved though every match is the same, the intensity of challenging others near your level or better than yourself is super rewarding."
8100,Great take on the battle Royal.  Fun combat take some time and play a custom match and learn the timing of counters and what things do there is a lot more nuance to the fighting than spamming. 8/10 some ults need a tiny bit of more balance but all have current counters if u actually take the time to learn to play.
8101,"Game needs region lock, huge amount of Chinese hackers that when not lagging they are using blatant hacks headshotting with ranged weapons from huge distances, locking onto players heads during replays and large amounts of teamers where you'll get 2-3 people in solo queue teaming against you, then you watch as they run off as a group. Until region lock is activated, I can't recommend this game."
8102,Game has bad Ping rate on its servers
8103,"I'm positively surprised by the quality of the game, and I thought BR games were already uninteresting to me. One of the biggest downsides at the moment are the Chinese loosers who have to play through VPN to take advantage of the high ping. However, I recommend it anyway. Game is quite hard (that's good)."

8117,"So this game is a hard decision it for sure has good and bad in it from personal experience and playing the Beta the potential here is HUGE but there are things that gotta be fixed fast if this game is to be left afloat.

Goods - 👍
- The range of weapons and characters is great no weapon and no character feels ""overpowered"" than others the balance is great 
- The map is HUGE and the visual effects on the game are great which always adds a nice spin into this genre 
- surprisingly the traversal movement of hooks works very well the overall movement is smooth I can climb any tree or rock with almost no resistance, some animation issues don't even matter considering how traversing the map is rather fast these things are hard to pay attention to while playing

Bad - 👎
- This game will not last if the servers remain the way they are personally most often I found my self dying to Asian players which puts me off the game as the servers are filled with them and they are mostly amazing players but the skill cap of this game is hard to reach if you aren't used to combo, parry style games which these players are well adjusted to
- The combat mechanic can be rough often you find your self stun locked not able to do anything same as some strategies in the game include ""Bunny hopping"" which just involves you constantly repeating the jump attack stun locking the other player as much as its counterable for new players or players not in the genre its a large instant put off dying to suck a lack of proper sport man ship

I was very excited to play this game once I heard of it the concept is amazing can even see this entering Esports but defo not at the stage this game is at overall I still would recommend it just maybe wait for a sale or something like that unless your well experienced in combo style games 
"
8118,"Good game, good concepts, shitty micro transactions, shitty servers and performance issues but can afford to hold a $10000 championship. Fuck this game till they fix there god damn servers."
8119,Game fuckin' slaps. Deff worth 20$.
8120,".
"
8121,"I never liked Battle Royale games, but this one really struck me as different, so after stalking some Twitch channels for a while, I pulled the trigger and bought it.

And honestly it's good, much better than I first expected. The combat system just works, it's punishing, but simple. It's one of those games that are simple to learn, but a nightmare to master. There's a ton of finesse in every single command and more depth than anyone would expect for what is, on the surface, a fighting game with simple 3-hit combos.

Performance wise I cannot comment, my computer is overkill so it runs amazing (RTX 3080, 3900X, SSD and 32gb 3600 C16) but I must say it takes very little HDD space (WHICH IS A BLESSING in this age of 50gb games for no reason!) and it runs very stable. I've had 2-3 ctd's I couldn't pinpoint, and so did a friend of mine, but they've long stopped, so I have no idea what triggered them.

The chinese aestethic is amazing and refreshing, the customization is really good except for the collab character which cannot be customized.

There doesn't seem to be anything off with the paid content, it's just cosmetics, and there's a lot of them. It's like Overwatch but with more content than just a few skins.

So far I have no real gripes with the game, I think it's an easy buy right now, if you're looking for something different. This is my invite code, for anyone that wants to try: chf7drrkrq"

8146,KEEP CRASHING AT STARTUP SCENE
8147,"Not a bad game overall, I recommend it, but I want to give my honest input on certain things that hopefully will be balanced in the future.

Once you get past the awesome graphics, the idea that this is a melee BR with minor ranged attacks, you can enjoy that at least and the environment is really pretty and cool to be a part of. That being said, the environment is also a severe enemy to running away/ambushing/climbing/moving in general. Take a small example like this: there is a cliff in front of you and you have Grapple Hooks to ascend to the top, so you aim the cursor which locks on at the top of the cliff and, unfortunately, you get stuck halfway up the cliff due to geometry and collision. Second scenario, you don't have any grapples so you need to climb manually, hope you have a little patience because sometimes your character will get stuck, not move, or even when you jump to grab and climb a little more, they fall down, this will ruin you if you need to try and escape to recover. (I know these will be worked on in the future, but just informing you all at this time, geometry is going to ruin you, so try to remember to enjoy the game as best as you can).

Grapple Hooks are a heck of a thing, however, one thing I want to talk about is the collision with enemies. Grapple Hooks cause a minor stun to enemies (if they're in the air, they make them fall) which is great for setting up follow-up attacks...if the path you were going down was correct 9 out of 10 times. Picture someone down a hill, or even up a hill, literally in front of you and unaware of your presence, you use the Grapple to close the gap, but 2 things can happen and they will. 1: you will collide with geometry (even though you somehow managed to hook the enemy) or 2: as you're closing in for the follow up attack, you left click and you fly right by them. Now I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, it never is a perfect science, but trying to connect a cool sneak attack which ends up just whiffing by the enemy is very shattering and lackluster. But, once again, here's to the future and fixing paths and collision.

Certain weapons are currently very broken (surprise, right? Not really). Just be aware as of this review that the following weapons are a real detriment and you're going to have a rough time understanding what to do. 
- A Longsword can charge up and do a mid-range Vertical or Horizontal slash, basically making them a mid-range weapon, my best advice is to stay back when you see them charge up the abilities or jump in the air to avoid, but when they connect they hurt.
- A Spear is possibly the 2nd worst of the weapons at this time in the fact of being very powerful. Charge attacks have great distance so be prepared, but the main thing is the counterattack. Now, quickly, every weapon can use counterattack and do decent damage, however the Spear is ridiculous at this time with a nasty...what...8, 9 hit combo to punish you? It hurts too and you can't block or dodge during it because it's a counter, so get good at counterattacking and keep a Spear handy.
- Now for the big broken boy at this time of the review, the Greatsword (or Father's Cutler, something like that). This bad boy *smacks the hood* can annihilate you in the stupidest manner I've ever seen in a fighting game since Zangief in Street Fighter grinding you sideways into submission. You can use Right-Click to do a down-attack and slam your opponents into the dirt, repeatedly and (for a Greatsword) extremely fast. Picture going one on one with someone who legit baby hops into Right-Click and 5 slams later you're dead with the inability to dodge, block or escape. This right now is the most broken weapon when utilized in this manner, unfortunately when I've been keeping up with people and doing decent damage, they'll bust out the Greatsword and take the easy way out. (Honestly, try it, practice the move, it's strong and ridiculously fast, you'll see).

Every other weapon is kinda...meh, to put it simply, ranged weapons are ok, nothing severe, there's a dagger which is quick but not really worth your time with the other weapons mentioned punishing you sideways. (Dagger isn't that quick either as weird as that might seem). Nothing else really stands out, but I'm sure you'll have fun with it.

Last tidbit before solidifying your purchase, I just want you all to know if you're going to take this game seriously like a normal BR...I hope you're good at mind games and rock-paper-scissors, because this game requires you to be ahead of your opponent in that sense. 
- Normal Attacks can't be Countered (weird right?) so you can Left-Click spank many people who play on the side of Cautious Countering. 
- Charged Attacks are unflinching when used against Normal Attacks. Basically Charge Attacks give you immunity to being knocked unless you collide with another player using a Charge Attack, you WILL take damage, but your Charge Attack will trump Normal Attack damage if they don't dodge it.
- Counterattacks do no damage to Normal Attacks, BUT, are used specifically against Charged Attacks to not only punish the enemy with damage, they force the opponent to drop their current weapon! (My advice, pick up their weapon when they drop it, make them panic before they pick it back up). If you see your enemy changing to a blue color, they're charging, time your Counterattack and hit them where it hurts, just be in your Counter Stance before their attack lands, not like Dark Souls/Sekiro where it needs to be right on the hit, your character needs to be red in their Counter Stance.

Overall, minus the little things, it's fun, I've only played Solo, but they have 3-man teams so I'm sure that can be very hectic and fun. Characters are all strong in their own way, but without going into detail I do feel some of the Abilities are lackluster for certain people. But honestly I think it's a worthy buy. 

Hope you enjoy and if you see me (CoryDWMP), don't kill me too quickly with a Greatsword, thank you <3"

However, after entering the game you will be greet with bunch of bots. You will be on a killing spree, deleting enemy and the AI were just suck at combat. After playing for few rounds, you will notice the enemy starts to behave differently ( That's where players are showing up ), then you realize you suck at the game ( at this point you already passed the 2 hour mark for refund ). After learning the game in the hard way, that's where the game starts to fun.

Sooner or later, you will realize that this game contains of battle pass, loot box. Meanwhile you already spent $19.90 to unlock the game but you are still required to spend money to unlock the cosmetic. Which is TBH, doesn't feel really great."

 Not unexpected considering they never fixed the chinese infestation of European servers, nor added a proper 1v1 mode. [/i]

It's currently filled with warping around 800 ping chiner cheaters. Stay away until they introduce ping-based region lock to keep these animals out.

Also the game's suffering from typical BR problems, first 10% and last 10% are interesting, middle 80% is mind-numbing boredom of running around massive open mostly-empty map and just hoping for something to happen. Would be a far better game if it wasnt trying to be a battle royale."

8176,"This game saved my life.

I am 31.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you..."

8185,There is definitely a steep learning curve in my opinion but if you can push through the losses you will slowly gain skill and start having some real fun with the games unique mechanics. For new people wanting to get better I definitely suggest jumping into bloodbath (FFA Mode) to build up your fighting confidence. YouTube videos have also been extremely helpful since there are some tips out there that the game doesn't directly mention. All in all 100% worth the $20 for something fresh.
8186,"First of all, if after reading my review you decide to buy use my code: [b] ch4qa7nmy4 [/b] and you'll get some extra freebies.

Now onto the review...

Premise, I really suggest to buy this game, its fun, its well made it just needs some polishing here and there.

[h1] The GOOD [/h1]

This game is hands down the best BR I played, its super fast paced, easy to pickup and has a component of dueling that I personally find incredibly addictive and satisfying. The map its mind blowing and very well made and the heroes are very nicely characterized and I believe everyone can find a character that fits its playstyle.

The best thing is that if like me you are no longer in your late 10s or early 20s and you no longer have crazy reflex and years of aim in the back you can still be a pro in this game. The combat, while sometimes a bit chaotic, its way more accessible thanks to the multiple assisted aims implemented letting you focus on doing the right move more then aiming the head of the person like in other games like fortnite. Tactic in this BR is a big thing and stealth is too, lets not forget its a ninja game, and its amazing how once you learn you can engage and disengage a combat like a real shinobi.

Another thing I personally really like is the way in which you unlock skills for you characters, you need to do a set of quest to make your character grow in level, unlock a piece of their background story and their skills, its a nice system that always gives you an excuse to play with a character as you have virtually unlimited things to do. Another very rewarding system is the one of the weapons, simply the more you use a weapon the more the weapon proficiency goes up in level giving you some prizes.

There is a battlepass and there are lootboxes but everything is just 100% looks, you won't gain any kind of bonus or anything from that so if you plan to not spend any more money after the initial buy you are good to go.

Lastly, this is the first BR game where you ll be able to personalize on a maniacal level the face and body features of your characters, you don't like the babe style of your favourite hero? twist her face and make her become an old witch, want your hero to have red flashy skin ? thats easy done, want yo play with a smurf, pimp that blue, its honestly very funny to randomly customize your character even for me that I never customize anything.

[h1] The BAD [/h1]

As many pointed out the biggest problem currently is the ping, I play in SEA but I'm facing lots of Asian (AS) and American (NA) players making my ping explode, expecially at night, to over 100ms making it very frustrating as in this combat system timing in the attacks is everything. Imagine playing Sekiro while lagging... thats the feeling.

Another thing that I'm sure will be added but that now lacks a lot is the vaiety in the modes, I'd love to see a capture the flag or a domination kinda mode, the game has definitely everything for it to be possible and give variety to the solo, trio and deathmatch modes.

Some of the rewards, expecially the common ones are just the basic skin with different colors, to be honest I feel the game would have been better off 5 of the same skin with different colors but... whatever we live in the lootboxes world

8196,"I usually hate playing battle royale games after the first couple of rounds but this is one of the very few exceptions and I'm happy to say this is the best I've played so far with Hunt: Showdown coming in second. Combat is fast and for the most part fluid (sometimes you try to parry and your character attacks instead or the opposite because they're both tied to the same buttons), environments and characters are very pretty graphically (with the added bonus of in-depth character [face] customization akin to games like Black Desert Online), and it just feels fun to play even when you aren't in the middle of combat thanks to the fast and fluid movement and parkour systems. 

The main divisive point of the game, however, is the use of both a premium currency AND a paid battle pass system in what is already a paid game which is inexcusable no matter how fun the game is.

Overall the game is solid so far and runs a lot better for me than the free beta. As previously mentioned, I'm not a fan of these kinds of games, but I just can't stop playing this one. It's very refreshing to have a game in this genre that isn't just another copy+paste shooter with a flashy gimmick attached.

BEFORE YOU PURCHASE: You need to know that for some reason, a lot of people are having stuttering problems on the game when it's not installed on an SSD despite games with similar high-end graphics not having that issue. If you can't install onto an SSD then you're probably going to deal with stuttering when things are loading in or combat effects are happening, making the combat very frustrating. If you don't own an SSD or don't have the extra space on it (about 16 GB or so), you might want to wait before you purchase or make sure you time yourself on the 2-hour refund timer.

EXTRA NOTE FOR NEW PLAYERS: The game uses bots that look like real players in the first several matches you play to ease people into the combat without fighting experienced players. The added side-effect to this is making players feel like they're better at the game than they really are, tricking some people into playing past the refund period before getting frustrated at fighting players MUCH better than the simple bots. Just keep this in mind when you start so you're not basing your purchasing decisions entirely on how you do in the early game and so that you're braced for fighting real players."
8197,"Fantastic, unique battle royale. Phenomenal combat system with a huge amount of depth. Definitely can be frustrating at first, but the game eases you in with bots to show you the ropes. Once you get the hang of it it’s an incredibly fun, tense, and rewarding combat experience. Best of all, this game has a solos mode! 

Much like Apex this game features characters with unique abilities. All the characters feel and play different, and levelling up your account let’s you select passive boosts that further help tailor the game to your play style. If you want to focus on fancy combos and getting your ult as quickly as possible, you can. If you want to have more options to escape tricky situations, you can. Also, the game has an incredibly detailed character creator that lets you customize the appearance of every character in the game (except the one character that is a crossover character from another Netease game). You can make some god awful monstrosities, or some incredibly faithful recreations of characters from other properties. I’ve seen my fair share of Wukongs, Draculas, and even a comic accurate Drax the Destroyer running around. It’s very, very cool. 

The game definitely needs some work; performance and server stability can leave a lot to be desired. Drop the settings a bit (DLSS helps a ton if you have an nvidia card) and expect to lose a few games due to some unfortunate lag. Hopefully this gets ironed out with some patches. 

Highly recommend giving this game a go."

8203,Something needs to be done about teaming. People will group up in a group of 6 and have an unfair advantage. Worst thing is that nothing is being done about it. Some characters also need a nerf.
8204,"Game play is fun, intense and rewarding when you succeed. The problem is the connection of the game. I have above recommend specs and my game takes forever to load into the menu and games are nearly impossible. I go from 31 ping to 900 sometime and it really bums me out! The game itself is amazing but some back end work needs to be done."

8207,it's too late to buy now. Death matches are filled with 3 no-life gamers who play 24/7 and will kill you in 1 combo and the other half of the players are bots.

8209,"Fun game! Definitely a high skill ceiling, but they have a great practice tool, and the solo death-match mode are great for honing your combat skills."
8210,"I originally bought the Deluxe Edition in my opinion do not buy it its not worth the money its better to get the standard copy of the game. Now  the actual game its self is very good but the mechanical aspect of it is very difficult  and diverse i'd recommend doing some train ,death match and 1v1 friends to get the hag of the combat and movement of the game and the for the battle royal part i'd say it's pretty standard rotate to the circle and well i didn't really play much yet but these are my thoughts.

[b]-=+=- DON'T BUY THE DELUXE EDITION -=+=- [/b]

8213,"I love this game. I really do. The combat feels great. Very easy to get into very high skill cap. I can't recommend it until they get the chinese off our servers. Between clear as day cheating and not being able to touch them while visibly seeing your attacks go through them due to high ping on a ping reliant game.... Until they fix it. Avoid. Wonderful game but right now stay far away.

Devs say ""We're working on it, We hear you"" horse shit until anything gets fixed that benefits players before shareholders. Remember that for EVERY game."
8214,this game is crazy
8215,"Good BR with challenging combat, but needs a great number of fixes. 
First of all fix lag spikes. Just no commnents 'bout this.
Second - fix chinese players. Ping is a most important thing at this game and when chinese guys come to play on other servers they just ruin game to everyone. It looks like ""hey, can you predict where am i be at next second?"". Chinese fine and mostly competitive guys, i'm learn some great features from them, but it's really hard to play with. When you try to hit their in-game model - you can't do that, 'coz of ping. Their hitbox ≠ their model. Not always, but mostly.
Third - bots no needed at all, just 'coz they're useless.

8/10 right now, but hope some changes comes soon."
8216,Awesome game; think Crouching Tiger hidden Dragon but with a battle royale theme. Weapon choices are fit for each play style and pacing is adequate. Plenty of match ups and ranking is decently scored. Played beta and couldn't wait for it to launch officially.
8217,"Over 130 hrs and now writing reviews which I dont always do for the many games Im always playing, but this one needs one. Explaining to anyone interested to try this game out for yourself if you think you'd like it..because trust me..YOU WILL! The combat is soo dam fun, and yes, the game has a learning curve, but its very easy to understand with a little effort. There's not a lot of buttons to press its just knowing when to use those buttons. The depth of mechanics is a UPSIDE for myself as there's plenty of cool stuff to constantly be trying out/ creating/ learning, and adds layers to the combat that eliminates the button mashing that most fighting games can be. I haven't found a game this adrenaline packed in awhile and as long as the devs keep on top of it which they have been. Its only going to get better, especially with how polished this game is already on Week 1 considering how detailed the games mechanics are, honestly shocked there is not more bugs, honestly impressive!"

8226,"Game is extremely fun and addicting, however it is very challenging for new players, especially because you have to learn combos for at least 3 of the weapons since you cant guarantee which weapon you will get off the bat. I find myself getting smacked, rage quitting, then wanting to come back as soon as I close the came because of how addicting it is. Take that how you will. Overall, would 100% recommend if you are willing to put in a little time into learning the weapon and game mechanics."
8227,"Gameplay is Great, but Ping literally destroys any and all fun.

Can't count how many times i've been in the final 3, or mid battle in general, only to have ping spike. In a game that relies entirely on split second inputs, this makes it unplayable at very critical times, and with the added feature of displaying your match progression publicly, it only serves to heavily dampen the desire to play.

EDIT:

Devs seem to have attempted to do something about ping, I guess?? 
I couldn't tell and would have no idea that were the case, as the issue continues at a constant rate. 
Running this on an SSD, Ryzen 1700, 1080 TI, with net speeds of 80MB/s DL, 15 MB/s UL, and no other programs running in the background aside from base necessities. 

A lot of people seem to be able to enjoy themselves, but personally I wouldn't spend your money on this until the issue is resolved, as I think I've accrued 40+ losses since my initial posting due to this. 

I've also yet to see any addressing this from the devs. If they would be transparent as to what the issue is, why it's happening, and what they are doing to fix it, I would be more inclined to recommend the game."

8231,"Fun, challenging combat that keeps you thinking. Bots for the first few games are a little misleading as they will  not deviate from the basic combos and are much easier than fighting real players, but once you understand the basics of actual combat it becomes pretty balanced."
8232,"Every match is a thrilling journey.

The setting you play in is rather lovely and feels really alive; the way it sounds and looks.
Seems inspired by ancient China and Japan with a flair of fantasy to it.
Has it's own mythology wired into it.

You can also interact with the environment:
like certain doors ; windows ; crates ; ballista's ; water wheel ; signs ;
rocks ; mountains ; trees ; buildings ; chains ; lanterns etc.

There is quite the variety in weapons ( melee and ranged ) .
A lot of animations for the parkour ; grapple hooking ; light and heavy melee attacks ; parrying ; shooting ;
jumping ; double jumping ; sliding ; slow walking ; crouch / crouch walking etc.

The characters in terms of abilities and customization options are unique and fun.
Cultivation quests make it that you can also unlock stories and incredible artworks of the characters you play.
( while there are also daily quests and weekly and seasonal quests ).

Every character brings something new to the table.
Some are with their abilities/ults more tanky or more dominating; while there is also a healer character and one who can teleport/go invisible to also have opportunity to a sneaky approach.
(every character has one ability and a ult ; there are also 2 other variations for everyone that you can unlock).
They already teased artworks for upcoming characters! HYPE!!!

Can play solo or trio's in herald's trial / ranked or quick match .
There is also blood match a free for all mode.

It is a rather fun game.
Might be heavy on some pc's and needs some balancing here and there still though."
8233,"Ive had the game for 36 hours, played 18 of them, spent a few on sleeping and studying. Pretty good game, to win, just never do blue attacks."
8234,"I was on the fence about this game I am sick of most BR's so I decided to give it a try. I absolutely made the right choice because this game is great. The refreshing mechanics implemented into the game work amazingly well. The only gripe I have is that it can be a bit laggy, but I suspect that will only improve as the game grows and gets better/more servers!"

8240,"if it weren't for all the lag from chinese people playing on VPNs, this game would probably be fun.

but in the current state it is not fun.  any fights you enter are a total crap shoot.  either you get someone from the US and it's a fair fight, or you get some lagger who spams focus attacks knowing damn well that you cannot parry them because of the lag.  Go on, practice parrying in any practice mode, or against a friend.  No problem.  Now go into ranked and try that against, oh, anybody.  Doesn't work.

the first few days were fine, there was a huge spike of american players.  But now there's nothing left but cheaters, people with lag switches, and people from other countries with 400+ms ping.

if you're not willing to sink to the levels of making yourself lag to have an advantage, don't bother playing this until they fix parrying."

8244,"The gameplay is fun, but the lobbies themselves are full of Chinese players who have had a year of experience in the game and who are cheating to get into NA servers for easy wins, as well as bots that the game puts there on purpose.

I am not okay with the mixing of lobbies from different regions, both because of lag, and because Chinese players have vastly more experience with the game. I swear, you see more Chinese players in lobbies now than anybody else, and they aren't even supposed to be there.

Then there's the bots. I am okay with the use of bots to fill lobbies, so long as their inclusion is disclosed and there is the option not to include them in your matchmaking, but for some reason the devs of this game seem to have gone out of their way to obfuscate the fact they include bots. They seem to have made a (very bad) attempt to name their bots in a way that they may appear to be human, rather than indicating that the person you just fought was actually a bot. 

They did not even disclose that bots were used in the game upon release, and instead put you into a series of games with nothing but bots. Then, in their official announcement that yes, they do use bots, they say that these bots are phased out after a few games and you will soon play against nothing but human players. This is either a lie or a mistake. I am dozens of games in, and I still see bots everywhere. These bots are comically easy to defeat, and provide nothing in the way of a challenge. It's to the point where the opportunity to test yourself and learn against other human players is vanishingly small. 

Am I being placed with bots because I'm bad? I legitimately have no idea. My ranking says I'm in the top 20% of players, but I am well aware I am not actually that good, and when I run into another actual player I usually get my ass kicked, so that can't be accurate. Are they including the bots in the player rankings as well? Given how hard they appear to be working to obfuscate the extent to which they include bots, it honestly would not surprise me.

So yeah, the gameplay itself is fun, but the way the matchmaking works is absolutely goddamn abysmal."
8245,"It is good, However, it is not the best. The gameplay, graphics, and concept is amazing; unlike anything i have seen before. That being said, it lacks only one thing, my queen Hinata, if it had Hinata this game is easily a 10/10. Despite this the game is really good and I would give it a Solid 7.5/10"
8246,"Good fun but don't let anyone fool you that this takes skill, just spam melee and hope to win seems to be the option."
8247,good
8248,Nothing lights up my neurons more than parrying.
8249,"Does the ""Battle Royale"" genre right"
8250,"It is not a bad game, however I would not spend the money for access to it, there are several things that need improving and one of them is a hardware requirement.

**DO NOT** buy this game unless you have an SSD to install it on. This is just about paramount, and even the devs have placed a message on initial startup suggesting that the game is installed on an SSD. If not, you will experience frequent load spikes where the game stutters/freezes for a moment while a chunk of an area/game assets are loaded in. In a fast-paced fighting centric game like this, it is a huge oversight on the Devs part to fail to optimize it for non-ssd centric computers.
-The optimization for the game is poorly done as well, and until the devs can better optimize for a wider range of hardware, I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone.

REGION LOCKING: Needs to happen. Too often are players killed by foreign usernames that use lag to their advantage to teleport around the battlefield, avoid your attacks, and somehow annihilate you while you are looking at the top of the building they came from.

F2P: Also needs to happen. The unfortunate death of this game will be the 20 dollar paywall for entry. Fighting type games are too ""difficult"" for the masses to pay 20 dollars for entry, as they have many complex mechanics that must be learned. On top of that, having a cosmetic store and battle pass that also cost a large amount of money with ingame currency loading specifically designed to get you to buy more currency by having inbetween amounts that do not allow you to just get what you want and leave (in the same vein as Riot Games and LoL) is dissuading to spending money on the game. Why pay for entry to a game only to be presented with cosmetics to pay for as well.

Balance: Counterattacks need to be allowed to interrupt basic attack strings. Being locked into an attack for several seconds while your opponent gets a free blue attack off because you decided to swing is silly. Blue attacks are very strong as it is. There is a rock-paper-scissors triangle of attacks, yes, but I shouldn't eat a full combos worth of damage for swinging once. Having my weapon thrown on the ground for being countered is also stupid. I should not lose my already half broken weapon and be set to using fists because of a counter. Keep the weapon on me, but knock me on my ass and open me up to huge damage. This is more understandable.

There is a huge hero disparity as well, as Oto-hime is broken and needs nerfs."

8254,"Nice game, but I think the developer should do something soon with these hackers and internet problems. I love this game, a whole new battle-royale style. I don't want it to die so early.

Update: The game is still good, but the number of hackers is increased, mostly from AS server (i'm currently playing in SEA). The common tool I see is speed and teleport hacking, especially with greatsword. They just focus on 3 stacks then teleport to my place, no chance to dodge it xD"

8261,"Very hard game but just as satisfying! Takes time to learn to be good at. One of those, ""Easy to learn, hard to master""-games.

Pros:
Graphics are crazy good for a BR
Movement is fluid AF
The game is better optimized than my brain
There's solo queue and a ranked mode
Killing is satisfying and it's easy to climb rank, at least early ranks
Beautiful skins that you actually want
Easy UI

Cons:
Too many free-to-play elements, yet it costs (but worth anyway)
Some heroes seem a bit too powerful/weak, but your fighting skill is still the most important thing
There's no duo/squad of 4, only solo or trio
Dagger is a bit OP if you learn the combos
Sometimes I wonder if there are bots after the first game (which is supposed to be vs bots, but only then)"

You will surely love the new style of fighting using swords, spears, greatswords, katana's, and etc. One thing I dislike is the imbalance of characters and weapons. Well it's still new so there's still room for improvement. Overall would recommend try this game! :D"
8272,After 2-3 months of being out they blatantly favor the hackers and players playing on foreign servers to gain a huge advantage and I don't see them doing anything about it. A great variation of battle royale that will die and be dumped in the trash for doing nothing about blatant cheating.

8281,"Naraka is a very fun game indeed. I love this game. Nevertheless, it has some big issues that need to be informed like lag , glitch, unbalanced weapons , unbalanced ults and broken matchmaking. For anyone who wants to enjoy a casual newbie friendly battle royale game, I dont recommend this game to u. Why? because except for the first few matches which are always littered with bots ( consider them as the tutorial matches), every single match that u are about to play (from bronze to silver to gold ), will be filled with lots of platinum/solar level players. in other words, u will never get to top 1 until u have put at least 100 hours into this game. Unlike pubg with 300k players, this game lacks players and players definitely hate playing with bots. In order to solve this issue, they put high level players with low level players into one match. Moreover, many players who have at least 200 matches and reach platinum or solar ranks in trios will start all over again in bronze if they play in solo. In other words, they are legal smurfs. There is little chance u can win against them . Besides, there are also veterant players who have already played and put hundreds of hours into the chinese early access of this game. U will see lots of them in all your upcoming matches. If u are ready to take on all these things and enjoy the game, be my guest. 

The biggest issue here is lag, which has resulted in lots of unecessary losses.  Why do they have to make the game so laggy and inconsistent? Why am i kicked out in the middle of the match because of server issue?  These issues have even been confirmed by netease themselves. If they fix these issues in near future, Ill definitely change my review to positive. For now, it is not recommended."

Don't waste your time in this game. Hackers are everywhere (most of them are Chinese).

☑ Unlimited hit/counter (this is fucking insane)
☑ They can detect wherever you are and can blink/teleport to you.
☑ Instant loot 

Instant quit."
8292,TOO LAGGYYYYYY. CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT. TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO RENDER. BTW MY INTERNET SPEED REACHES 100mbps AND I CANT PLAY PROPERLY IN SEA SERVER. MY PING ALWAYS SPIKE FROM 60 TO 300+. WITH OTHER GAMES I CAN EVEN PLAY IN AUS SERVER AND HAVE 120 PING. FIX THIS AND I WILL SURELY BUY IT AGAIN
8293,"wait until the devs come up with a solution for hackers then buy it, don't buy it now or you will get crushed by hackers"
8294,"While the game is fresh and enjoyable take on BR by approaching using a melee combat system and the graphics and theme are captivating, the devs have suddenly became silent on new developments to EU servers. EU servers are suffering from out of continent players, mostly from China, which I guess are over 80%+ of server population, the devs said they were addressing this issue but a new patch came and they are still silent, only introducing new gacha systems and a new paid hero in a game that already costs 20€ and only had 7 heroes. Unfortunately the netcode of this game is pretty bad and players from China can benefit immensely from playing at higher pings and the EU server is close to dead, it became a asian farmer.  The more this issue takes the worse it will be since the predominant population of EU server  is asian the devs wont want to adress this issue later since they will not want to kill the majority of playerbase. So I can't recomend this game if you want to have a nice experience in EU server anymore, high ping players and weak region lock ruined the game."
8295,"The game has glaring issues with actions. Not registering hits, blocks or mixing up your inputs for some reason. Very high skill difference and a very bad matchmaking system, where you play on EU server and korean/chinese players that have way more time and skill than you are in your game... Great..."

     It's a good and fun game. But it's a pity that this game may not be with us for long. From playing the game for just one day, I found That is, there are still many players who use cheat programs such as flying for long periods of time or even jumping with nothing to cling to or even use a sling, similar to the rogue program found in pubg. I have been killed in a single shot even though A suit of armor is full without seeing the killer. I hope that in the future these things will disappear and was corrected, Another concern is that the server has a lot of ping causing flickering and twitching. From the hearts of people who like this game very much. I carefully sad. Because for a game with a pvp system, a lot of pings or jerks are a disaster. This doesn't include what's mentioned above. See you again when everything is solved. For everyone who didn't get a problem I hope you enjoy the game for a long time."

highly highly highly recommend!"

8311,"Se for brasileiro, não recomendo a compra, o jogo é lotado de bots, após o primeiro up de patente na rankeada (Bronze IV), você começa a cair em partidas contra outros players, porém em servidores americanos (oque deixa o jogo praticamente impossível de se jogar) e ainda com bots, as mecânicas de jogo são legais, mas infelizmente ainda não é um jogo para brasileiros."
8312,good
8313,"Fly around with grappling hooks and turn enemies into salmon maki...

8315,"(Review Subject to Change)

The core game is fun and great to play. Nice mix with melee, ranged combat strategy. Feels well done, the movement is not clunky and the combat for the most part is pretty fluent. The character editor is fun and of-course the cosmetics are nice.  Ive logged many hours in this game and can really see what needs adjustments.

We will start with the extremely high ping players playing in ranked matches. This needs a cap on ping. As I am sure you have read many complaints about the chinese players using VPN and zerging the US servers. Which makes the game vary unpopular. No one wants to try to swing in a melee game at a target you can not actually hit. This makes for a vary big issue in a BR game. This game favors high ping players. Instead of forcing the High Ping player to be locked in place to catch up to the server. They instead just let them run wild and hit at any target they see dealing damage to them even if they are not actually at that current location. If you try to swing at them and hit them, your attacks phase through their body. So as you can see why all the top players are chinese.

Second off, the weapons and heroes need much balancing. As I am sure most people have noticed being grappled hook stun spammed. This could easily be fixed by disabling Auto lock on Melee and Hooks in ranked play. This in turn would make the game more skill based and the engagements more interesting. Instead of being grapple stunned for people to long sword slash spam you. Heroes such as - need some work. His 150m range grab not only needs to be much sorter (Id say about the range of a grapple hook with 50%+ range) and it also needs a cool down (5-8 seconds). You could give him a small AOE ground pound to make up for the CD wait time. Long Sword Slash needs much fine tuning, the Katana stun lock needs some work, the spears whirlwind attack needs some adjusting as well, ect ect...

With the map itself. Its fun, its interesting enough. The issue is with the way the character grabs onto ever little thing and you tend to get stuck on it. Some objects such as small rocks need better clip nodes so the characters and step over them a bit easier instead of just coming to a full stop and then getting stuck.

As far as the way players are playing the game. It is a bit toxic due to the game rewarding those players that hide all game to reach the Top 5 in Trios and 3 in Solos. Instead of just displaying / giving larger amounts of exp for kills and damage dealt. The reward those for hiding and reaching top 5. I can understand hiding in ranked anyways because no one wants to fight high ping chinese players because you can not hit them anyways.

I could easily point out many issues with this game that need to be adjusted for smooth and fun game play but I will sit back and see what the next update has in store. If they get rid of auto locking melee and grapples from ranked (Its ok in QM), lock the ping to keep the ping abusers out (You know who you are) and re-balance some of the heroes/weapons. I would be not only thrilled with this, but would give this a positive review. As I am sure a lot of you would as well."
8316,Fix back my Kurumi and stop taking the hot takes of reddit to heart. Reddit is trash. Other than that the game is the only battle royale I like.
8317,If you played this game because of the Booties then you are in the right place.
8318,Nice
8319,"The only Battle Royale I approve of.

If you've ever played Gunz: The Duel back in the day then you'd enjoy this game. Developers clearly care about the game and want it to be a success long term. Follows the cosmetic only monetization with a battle pass. Could be better, but there are still many awesome skins you can get by earning."
8320,挺好玩
8321,I bought it cause of the Squidward face customization in the trailer.. Also because of Yoto Hime's jiggle physics
8322,If you like pure pvp this is the one
8323,my favorite BG so far besides pubg
8324,"I was sceptical when i bought the game but then couldnt stop playing.. the movement and combat flow is so smooth and addictive..each weapon feels unique and different ..its difficult at the beggining but the game adds ai bots until you rank up...then u up against players with the same rank..after you find out which hero and weapon fits your style what talents to pick etc its so much fun.

 So far i havent got any bugs or crashes or lag problems and i think the game is optimized well no fps drops even when there are tons of effects on screen.... If you thinking about buying the game do it 20€ is a good price... 

P.S. im throwing fireballs on my enemies jumping through the smoke and slicing them up with my katana i mean how cool is that 😁"
8325,Awesome battle royale!
8326,very2 nice game
8327,Not like alot of other BR out there and requires alot of effort to get decent at. Really fun gameplay and easy to get into but hard to get good at.
8328,grol big bobs :)))))))
8329,crashes alot
8330,I recommend this game because in this age of gaming we don't have a lot of option when it comes to fighting games. For 20 dollars I'll buy this any day
8331,it
8332,Love the combat reminds me of a Sekiro like game mix with battle royal mechanics and team tactics. I would recommend to buy it also has a a good reward system.
8333,Good game
8334,"totally unplayable game please avoid, its poorly optimised, players use vpn to go to other server, fighting in lag, frame drops and fighing laggy players is impossible. if you have bad connection you win most of the duels, if you drop in frames you die. its a good game with good concept, sadly its badly made game, making it an overall bad game"
8335,yes
8336,WAIFUS AND KNIFUS...MY FAVORITE HEHE
8337,"Don't buy this game. Save your money and your blood pressure. On the surface it has fun gameplay but the game is filled with high ping Chinese players who will absolutely dumpster you and there's not much you can do about it. Also, the game is flooded with hackers at medium to higher levels of play, and the game is a BUY TO PLAY game with MICROTRANSACTIONS in it."
8338,too good
8339,"Old-fashioned, poetic Chinese style game under battle royale mode, pretty cool and the fighting is exciting."
8340,different style of battle royale
8341,awesome game
8342,"This is another one of those cases where you wish there was a mixed recommendation that you could choose. The game is a lot of fun and there's definitely a high skill ceiling that feels satisfying to strive towards. I want to give this game a thumbs up because it has serious potential but it's weighed down by a ton of bugs and weird mechanics that make it more annoying rather than enjoyable. One of the biggest problems this game faces is the over seas players playing on NA. It's the type of game where you can hit someone and your attacks won't register due to them having poor ping and connection to the servers which creates a very frustrating experience, consider this happens nearly every single match. The devs say that this issue is their top priority so hopefully a fix comes out for that soon. Another gripe I have is the lack of duos. There is a trios mode but it's very clear that the trios was kind of dropped in. By that I mean the mechanics of the game are more so balanced for solos. An example is continuously being hit stunned with little to no time to recover to pull off a counter attack, so when there's three people beating on you it's pretty much a guaranteed loss. There is a parry mechanic but that only works for the ""Blue focus"" attacks and the parry is a little bit finicky anyhow with a lot of players lagging around. Another problem is the grapple hook stun. Now granted I think grappling onto people is a fine mechanic, the only problem is that it has aim assist and stuns you when you're hit by it, so when you're trying to position yourself in a fight and suddenly you have multiple people grappling you, you're stunned for a long duration that allows them to get free hits off of you. I think a nice and simple hot fix solution for that would be to disable aim assist for grappling. In the games current state, I'd say you should get it if you're planning on playing solos. I've found that solos is very much more enjoyable. Though if you're planning to solely play with friends, I'd recommend waiting a little longer for them to iron out the kinks, because the games unique and ripe with potential to be great."
8343,rubber banding on hit simulator
8344,"I never expected a battle royale to be so engaging and fun. I've played my fair share of fortnite, apex, and realm  royale. But none of those really stuck to me.

I got banned on apex due to someone hacking my account

The extreme changes and complicated building mechanics in Fortnite made it hard to get into

Realm Royale fucking sucks.

But this game just has everything. And I love every second of it."

8351,Muito Bom!
8352,"Tons of fun to play.

GOOD:
- Graphics
- DLSS Support
- Combat Triangle (common attacks, focus attacks, counter attacks), makes the game like rock paper scissors.
- Varied heroes
- Varied weapons

The MEH:
- Some ults can feel unfair
- Some weapons can be unfair
- Learning curve. Youtube guides and a bit of free practice makes a big difference

THE BAD:
- VPN Users can ruin matches with their ping - supposedly being looked into by devs
"
8353,"From the beginners perspective, this game feels very balanced. Matches take at most ~20min so playing a few rounds doesn't feel like a major time investment. I've been watching just a ton of YouTube content trying to get a bead on what I should be doing and what I should expect other players to be doing so if that's what you're looking for in a game then I absolutely recommend this."

8363,GG Free
8364,"Amazing game hindered only by terrible decision making that doesn't keep players out of other regions. The NA server is comprised of more Chinese players with 500+ ping than any other region, including other North Americans.This is also a game that is *supposed* to prioritize timing and skill, yet high elo consists of brainless focus attack spam due to Chinese players that don't have to follow the same rules as other players. There seriously needs to be a ping limiter since they all just use a VPN anyway."
8365,"battle royale feels like MMORPG , but overall this game nice"
8366,"For those who is into Wuxia action, this realise that fantasy pretty well. The combat can get some work as some of the mechanics do get glitchy and procs are off here and there. Character wise the roster is quite small but the fact you can customise each character to such depth is amazing. Not much of a competitive person but the way the game is laid out in a way hat even if you do not have good reaction time, you can enjoy it. More than just a hack and slash battleground. Looking forward to more character roster and modes."

8374,"A lil' gem of a game - but in all honesty, casual is the only approach if you don't like playing solo.
Easy to learn, fun to play, a real ***** to master. The art style is amazing. The in-game cosmetics are for sure on the pricy side with RNG microtransanctions, the battlepass compensates that here & there.

Tried it in beta too - very much optimized and servers are stable by comparison.

8376,"best melee battle royale game out there, crouching tiger action a warriors way kind of feel to it anyways the game is awesome . come thru and die by my blade"
8377,"I like this game a lot but this is clearly a netease game, and from what I've seen it seems to be one of the most generous in terms of MTX which is barely saying anything as this is definitely one of the least generous f2p model game I've seen. Wouldn't be a huge issue if the game was actually f2p but since it's a $29.99 entry fee I'm giving it a thumbs down for gross practices"
8378,Also Yes
8379,it's okay
8380,"this game was fantastic but the fps doesnt stable that much things that doesnt need in game just make it less for a better fps and optimize game for low end pc that still can play. My friend love this game so much but hes qiut after 10 hours play :< just because the graphic are not need and the fps keep drop and stuttering. I'm honestly love this game so clearer point pls dev just remove some object or EFFECT less to make the game run smoothly on low end pc 
THANKS FOR THE GAME <3 
FROM VIETNAM WITH LOVE"
8381,"I've never liked Battle Royal games, but this has been a fun and addicting surprise. 
It's a bit overwhelming at the start but I look forward to learning and enjoying with friends! (:"
8382,hit people with sword what's not to like
8383,New Style of  Battle Royal Game
8384,Too try hard with unbalanced heroes & weapons
8385,The new update is not OK. :(
8386,"cool game but I have a problem with power menagment and my pc is restarting every time I try to play it. Never had this in other games, just this one is very demanding on power (in my case I guess)."
8387,yes
8388,Best battle royale to the date
8389,Great combat mechanics. But the parry counter is extremely hard to time. Definitely worth the time and money.
8390,best game ever
8391,awesome game!
8392,maybe someday top rank ?
8393,"Fun and challenging. Appeals to lovers of fighting games and battle royales. I've heard of people having connection issues, but I personally haven't experienced any at all so far. Overall I highly recommend!"
8394,"This game feels like a beta, and the lag is super annoying it gets you killed all the time."
8395,"Nice, finally something different with small amount of skill to learn. :)"
8396,"This game is great! That is all. Don't believe it try it! Seriously, give it a shot! I see you sweating thinking if you should pick the game or lunch tomorrow.... pick the game! Lunch is temporary this game in your library is forever! <3"
8397,"A non memory based reactive dueling game with very little cheese it's an amazing game.

Unfortunately do not buy it until they add a ping lock if you are in US WEST US EAST EUROPE or OCEANIA"

8400,cool
8401,Pretty nice game i like it soo far played it 3m ago when there was beta and from thet time game was pretty simple and i like the way they show sutch a skilled game i hope this game become one of e-sports game
8402,I am looking respectfully...
8403,Trash game waste of money!
8404,"Has great potential to be great, every game for me now is loot up until i run into a chinese player then its over.  If they make American only servers, I could maybe get a KD of 1.  instead of .000001"
8405,"it crashed. Garbage

edit: 
it no longer crash. Fun!"
8406,Amazing game!!!!!
8407,gud gaem bruh
8408,Lobbies are horrible no chance to win against no life players who play 24/7 . You cant progress if you are bronze and you get every game a gold or higher rank player in lobbie.Not even 1 month from release and is full of hackers.Waste of money!
8409,Fun game chill one
8410,One of the most solid games i've played.
8411,"Naraka is a very fun and addictive game. It has many interesting and fun mechanics. Might be challenging at times but definitely had a lot of fun together with my friends. I spent 200+ hours playing within the first two weeks of release. So far the only problem i had with this game is the ledge grab mechanics, it got me stuck sometimes."
8412,"Fix the fucking combat...
Before anyone says ""learn 2 parry noob"", I was spamming the fuck out of the parry when I saw a blue glow. 80% of the time, parry didn't even start. 15% of the time, I parried and they attacked through it anyway. Even when I parried on the white glow, amongst the blue. 5% of the time, it actually worked...

Customer support is non-existent, either. Paid for the Ultimate DLC and despite it saying you get x10 chests, I didn't receive a single one. Customer support never got back to me about it and over a week has passed...
In case no one can be bothered to look at the Steam store page: https://ibb.co/pKXmCfQ

Ample video evidence and some gameplay because why not:

If you can't tell, it's basically a game of who can land the first hit, or who can get out of the way and attack the other person to stun-lock them. In the youtube video right at the end, I did a slow-mo of the parry being bypassed somehow. In one of the first fights without bots, somehow the person who killed me managed to charge up two heavy attacks without releasing the first, which I couldn't parry in time because of the ""hidden"" cooldown.

Movement also sucks ass in this game. The game can't work out what you want to do half the time, and it has not even the slight bit of intelligence. e.g. if you sprint jump in a doorway, game will assume you want to climb the doorframe and you will temporarily get stuck between the wall and whatever the overhang of the roof is called.

Save your money.


* when you are in a bush, it supposedly turns you invisible. However, if you have a bounty on your head, apparently that means jack shit as your bounty hunter gets cybervision and can see your giant, bright, glowing red bounty icon above your head, making hiding completely pointless."

8425,"Bought it today, 2 hours in and I am having a blast. This isn't like any battle royale. The combat, the music, the graphics. I love it. I have yet to play it with friends but I am already really enjoying the game on my own. I'll update this review the more I play."
8426,"very fun game lots of combat and great movement some minor bugs here and there but for a game thats been out 2 week officially an amazing game cant wait to see what the devs add to this game :D

8428,so far so good
8429,"I can't recommend this game, not for the game itself (it has some problems but it's a nice game) but for it's bad customer support.

I was victim of a hardware malfunctioning that caused me a permanent ban, and no one is listening to me, I sent tickets, email and contacted the devs on discord, but they don't care and don't wanna look further in my case and don't even give me an exact explaination of why I was banned, just a generic third party software / exploit.

That's what happened to me:

I have a problem with my PC, every couple months it starts to reboot itself randomly.
When it happens I open the case, clean all the dust and unplug my GPU, clean everything accurately then plug it in again. This usually solves the problem and the PC works fine for a couple months then it starts again.

This time it started rebooting while I was playing Naraka.
It rebooted a couple times and then I decided to open my case and do the usual stuff I do to fix the problem.
When I booted my PC it gave me a CMOS error and the motherboard settings was resetted (I guess I have to change the MOBO battery). I saved the MOBO standard setting and booted my pc.

When my PC started, I opened Naraka again and I started a match. I started noticing the characters in the selection screen moving faster than normal and the audio sounded strange too. when the match started I noticed that my character was walking, running and jumping too fast and my ping was very high. So I understood something was not working as expected and I closed the game.

Then I tried to open YouTube to see if the videos were working fine, and they weren't. they were accelerated and the audio was off sync. Then I googled this problem of games and videos running too fast and found some topics. They told to try and reinstall GPU drivers, so I did it and rebooted my pc.

My PC was working fine again, but when I opened Steam I found a permanent ban on Naraka.

I contacted the customer support through the ingame ticket and I sent them an email to the address Steam indicated me, describing in detail what happened to me that caused that ban. I have been told that I was using third party software / exploit. I tried to send them another ticket and another mail, but I always get the same automated reply. 

I even went to Discord and asked for help. The moderators didn't take me seriously and started make fun on me saying I was I cheater and I was telling lies. I contated through PM all the devs and after 1 day only one of them answered to me telling me that the decision cannot be reversed, without giving me other details or explainations, even though I described them what happened and sent them topics of similiar problems happened to other people.

I asked them to check this case better because I didn't cheat and it's not fair I have to lose the money and get a ban on my Steam profile (10 years old, never had a problem before, I never cheated and never will)
It's so bad to be flagged as a cheater when you did nothing wrong and you were victim of bad luck and a uncommon PC problem.

Steam says they can't do anything on bans from other sellers' games, but I think they should double check those bans or developers can do whatever they want.

Here are some topics with problems similiar to what happened to me:

8455,"Very very good battle royal game! The battles and movements in this game is unlike and other BR out there! 
11/10 would recommend!

EDIT**

Queue times right now are horrendous. They should market the game more, or make it F2P and just give something to those who bought the game."
8456,You should play this game
8457,"I'm going to start with that this is a post uninstall review, I will no longer be playing this game until the main issue which the devs WILL NOT fix is addressed. This issue is mainland china players on non Chinese servers. 

The game was good while it lasted, when you get to higher ranks the entire lobby becomes Chinese names in trios with multiple teams, teaming up each match with the same clan names (max, slay, whatever) all of them teleporting around and hitting you and making you lag while the only issue they face is their hits registering later which doesn't matter because their high ping makes you lag even harder and stand completely still. And if that isn't enough they also team up with each other, every time my team was fighting a team of Chinese names it was a 6v3 minimum and at times 9v3. Multiple times me and my team got to the last circle just to see 3 team just circling each other and hunting for us. 

Solos after getting to top 500 or even top 1% was unbearable with very long queue times and me who is only above average getting matched against the top players despite me not really even being in the same ballpark as them. But at least solos chinese issue was very little so my time in there was more enjoyable. 

The most fun experience was bloodbath since there was little Chinese there and they're mostly terrible at the game when there's not enough of them to team up on you or make you hard lag.

They even nerfed the dagger to the ground which was the only counter to chinese ping abusers since they are unparriable and 99% of them just spam attacks on greatswords so they can ping abuse even harder. If you look at steam charts this game peaks at chinese prime time and na/eu prime time has 10k players at best. So yea

 I wish i could get a refund.

8458,I see Hot Waifu. I buy for Hot Waifu Kurumi
8459,nice
8460,This game great but we need vietnamese language

Netcode, optimization, Match pacing, combats.
I played the closed beta, nothing has been improved. It's even worse in some areas."
8462,great game

8464,"Game is Filled with Bots, played ranked, bots everywhere....in Ranked mode. Something needs to be done about all these bot players in quick match and ranked. You just stomp these bots that are just running in circles or attacking air. Its just not fun. The melee gameplay is neat though

Single Thumbs DOWN

EDIT: REFUNDED"
8465,"this is a fun battle royale games, with many skills and stuffs, with my first 10 hour, i will describe it as simple as possible
+Pros:
- u dont need that kind of insane aimbot shot just to outplayed your opponent
- Easy to learn, hard to Master, at first i just though it was a simple rock-paper-scissor combat type of game, but when your doin it with constant movement, team pick, and mobility, this game really got that learning curve
- HELL YEAH BEWBS PHYSICS, THE GIRLS ARE QT TOO, GIMME MOAR SEXY COSTUME PLS

Cons:
- The server is kinda suck, theres so many stutter here and there with red bar connection notification, but most of the time im playin in 30-50ms ping, im playin on SEA, so i hope they can fix that server problem ASAP
- theres not many mode available, maybe because this is still the early days of developing, the mode that currently available is a survival and bloodbath(some kind of deathmatch), cant wait if they can provide moar game mode
- only one map available so far, so kinda bored seeing one kind of environment over and over again

im waiting for the future update and hoping this game can improve in many aspect, hell its been a long time i enjoy playin games like this :))"
8466,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!
8467,i love it.

Lag favors the person lagging, not the person with the good ping. Quite literally the dumbest Netcode after Battlefield."
8472,thanks for a great game like that
8473,The combat feels flooty and the combat is mostly melee attack auto-aiming. Plus the game put you in bots lobby even in rank. GG
8474,"just try it, it's better than i expected."
8475,"Great Game! there is a sharp learning curve involved and its quite fun! the bots the put into the game are simply to ease you into playing the game so you don't get stomped from the get go! the climbing can be annoying time to time very reminiscent of assassins creed and how annoyed i felt with that game, but its only in certain building models. There are some Meta cheese tactics that you can learn to counter with smart parries or the right character, but overall live able. high rank matches are some fun inner circles and the leader boards are always competitive. if you like cosmetics there are some high end ones in here that look fantastic, but alas i wish there were more for me to throw my wallet at! anyways all in all ADDICTING try it out!"
8476,good
8477,"Pay to Play Battle Royal that does not give u the premium battle pass for free, would have been nice for the first month since we have to pay to play anyways.

With the decently cheap price its quite worth it to buy, while its still fairly new very high playerbase average usually 22k-50k Solos or trios with a competitive gamemode similar to Rainbow Six Siege but with more ranks. Also its only around 12-17 GB and its not hard to run if you turn shadows off very fun experience I give this game a 9.5/10 it is not a 10 because it is new and needs updates and there aren't many locations on the map."
8492,lots of playability but might be hard to master every weapon and role.
8493,"Combat takes a min to get the hang of, some of the movement can be a bit wonky. Getting grappled and stunned while your grappling away is super frustrating. BUT all in all for the price I do believe the game is worth it at its current state."
8494,"Graphics Good, Japanese Voice acting good this game should of been a free to play game with all of the in game purchases love it but it's unplayable with high pinged players and also people who's very experience with the game, Beginners will get toss around like a rag doll not fun at all even for myself as a beginner. What can change this? Crossplay, making it free to play since you have in game purchases and also make it playable for other gaming consoles not only for PC and the PS5. Until then I'm getting a refund will come back to see if that happens in the future."

8500,"I been looking for a game like this for years! I use to play a game called Gunz the Duel back in the day and I love the aspect of swords & guns in a game with the focus being melee! The ranged weapons in this game are useful when used strategically but the main weapons to use are all melee which I find to be really unique in the battle royale game category. 

I plan to play the hell out of this game and hope it doesn't go defunct like Gunz. Hopefully the community doesn't get toxic, so far I've partied up with random people who seem more helpful than toxic. You get a few ragers, but what do can they expect if they don't communicate or ping.

I recommend building your own party (with mics) and finding friends to play with since you'll have a huge advantage in team fights when you coordinate."
8501,i love the graphics and mechanics of the game play its super fun just watched couple videos and got the hang of it still competitive
8502,"THE PVP IS SO BADASS BRO, I recommend 10/10 highskill cap but rewarding feeling nonetheless."

8504,太蠢
8505,best game
8506,"This game would be fun if they fixed the cheese. Currently most players just Right mouse button a longsword or spear. Or the great gameplay of being spam grappled by an entire team being unable to move. To top that off the ranking system is a joke, you spend 30 mins in a tree/bush hiding to gain easy rank or you fight and have fun then drop rank for doing 20k damage but being killed before the top 30. At higher elo's you spend 5-10 minutes matching, get put against the top 10 player team in the game and the game says the match is ''with ease'' so if you die before the first circle you lose almost 3-4 games worth of progress. Last night alone i was against the top player, who is 8 ranks higher then me and it said ''with ease'' and due to that you have to become the cheese to even gain anything. To top that off almost eveyone plays Tiahnai, you beat them in a fight and they just ult near death, get full hp and can wipe out an entire team in the last circle. My friend wiped out the last team solo with him, grab 2, smash and full hp from the damage then get the last guy and keep punching him out the circle. he hid for 15 minutes to do that. 
I like this game, it has some nice mechanics but also has some really broken ones. Most ults can be countered except his, he counters all and if timed right even counters vipers stun, the only way to kill is to hope you can do enough damage before he grabs someone or you run away and hide, but in the last circle you have no where to hide so that strat is worthless at higher levels of play. At it's current state the game is not worth paying for until they balance it out more. And also add a duo que, they have solo and trio but no duo...

Update: Almost a year later and im still being killed by Chinese teleporting players with bad connection who warp backwards. As that just happened for the 2nd time, 2 games in a row, still no region lock that works clearly and im also put against NA players a lot. Not worth buying in to if you plan to play on any kind of competitive level."

8529,"""skill based"" game, yeah no. first to get a sword and spam right click wins.
also asians with 1000+ ping that you phase through when trying to hit every game is a no for me. combat is lame. spam right left click and hope for the best, if you have a sword just spam any move and you lunge auto lock towards them. zzzzzzz next"
8530,fun!!!!!!!
8531,Too many asian superheroes
8532,"Again, just another game that might be fun with matchmaking...
I am either stomping bots, or getting crushed by a pro, that I can't land a single hit on...

Idea is good though, haven't played a Battle Royale in a long time."
8533,no
8534,"A great change from all the generic battle royal where every game is with guns and long distance shootings, but this one is more like hack and slash in your face fighting. Really a new breath of style and mechanics in this genre. I urge every Battle Royal fans  and players to give this game a go.

The tutorials are easy but when you get in the game there is so much things to learn and master. At first it looks like a basic mouse and keyboards button smashing typical game but trust me you are in for one hell of ride/game.  This game is very easy to learn but hard to master as everything is happening in melee weapons and multiple players fighting over one kills is really epic. Although there are crossbow, musket and canons to play with but its enjoyed most with melee weapons. 

Hats of to the developers for actually coming up with the idea and then making the game happen.

As of writing this review there is 7 heroes to choose from with each having unique game play, spells and playing style. The developer has already confirmed that they will add new character/heroes in regular intervals. They are already buffing and nerfing weapons and stuffs from the surveys from the players. But some weapons are being ignored. The great sword is an abomination. Why is this even in the game is a legit question. Please fix this great sword stone from. That is the most broken thing ever man. Mid way throiugh your combo or just random RNG luck counter you to death then kills you to oblivion. PLEASE NERF OR FIX STONE FORM FOR GREAT SWORD.

Overall a very good game to enjoy with mates. 

A solid 9.5/10 from me."
8535,"Man ima keep it a buck im not gonna wait for this game to stop trippin everytime i sign off every single time i try to go to my desktop it crashes my whole computer. Unacceptable. The battle pass should be 10 not damn near 20$ im not paying almost the price of the game for a battle pass why not just follow the format for every other battle royale? i played the betas and it felt better then than now and the combat feels choppy a little dont gop down the road of monetizing everthing first and then focussing on the game itself ill drop this shit so fast 

UPDATE: game is even worse alot of focus again on the shop yet im waiting 5-20minutes for a match. what kinda market are these people goin for? old people? max i should wait 2 minutes not damn near a half hue and heres the kicker THE GAME IS STLL CHOPPY AND BUGGY WHEN U DO GET IN  A MATCH. this is the last time i support a game and fund it to be givin garbage also they shoving so many modes in your face which further makes the que times longer. i dont develope or make games and i know more about player reetention that whoever designed this shit. stop aking for money and lower the que times have 3 permamnet mods with rotating limited time ones to fix the que time and stop selling just under what u charge for skins to entice people to buy a little more. i look and play this game and it just feels like a damn scam. i wish i wouldve gotten a refund to any new players dont buy this fancy garbage unless u got top notch patients and love to hear excuses and have limited time skins shoved in your face more then the actaul game modes that are available"
8536,I've always wanted a game revolving around Asia and battle royale. I'm totally in love with this game and I can't wait for future characters and features :D
8537,"fun game
use my code pls: chdmermj6r
"
8538,it good
8539,i like it
8540,once u play once better mtf
8541,Hard to play but I like it <3
8542,"Very fun and fundamentally broken. I do not recommend you buy this game until they put out a patch that region locks players so they can't play with high ping in servers that are on the other side of the planet.

A combat system based entirely on fast reactions is broken when you allow such a poor decision.

--------- Above was the original negative (mixed) review at 27 hours of play.

At 160 hours now, Naraka is still super fun, especially with friends. Bunch of new content and balance patches were introduced. The devs seem to be doing a good job and the game deserves for you to try it out. The population of the game is also quite healthy almost a year in."
8543,"Most complicated game mechanically, and plus its a Battle Royale. Slack off and u will get a great sword to the face. 10/10.

SEA: Platinum 4"
8544,Starts easy but turns harder with skill based game and is a lot of fun
8545,nicee
8546,Love this game

8548,"One must follow the path!
Pros
- Great Game
- Sweet Gameplay
- Very fun Solo & Group Play
- Waifus?
 
Cons
- a few over powered things
- Just needs a few quick fixes^
- Certain players are very laggy from other regions -_- Making it hard to hit them etc"
8549,I do not recommend this product.
8550,GOOOD
8551,"While there's still a lot to be desired, the game play is entertaining and the heroes are interesting enough to make this worth the $20 for the title."
8552,boobs
8553,Now there's another game where I don't mind getting whacked by the plot.
8554,its aight ig
8555,nice
8556,"Came for the booba, stayed for the gameplay 🤝"
8557,Character customization is prolly the best part of the game…
8558,fresh take on the heavily saturated br scene.
8559,long queue time
8560,"Best game ever. if you don't like BR (Battle Royale) you can play Blood Bath mode which is Deathmatch.

Anyway if you like Wuxia Theme with some cultivator thing, this is the best game for you.
They also include some cursed being such as youkai Yotohime for collaboration maybe more character on Onmyoji?
I Also want to see some monster / boss in the map while doing battle royale such as creature myth like basilisk, demon or anything like eclipse isle (if you kill them you can get some gold equipment or etc like airdrop). hopefully they added this (y) its more fun

Ignore the one saying p2w etc, i mean cosmetic doesn't even give you buff why did u say pay 2 win, it is indeed you have to purchase the game like PUBG, but this is more worth. the one reviewing down is usually they're the one want the game as ""FREE"" since the beta gave you access ""FREE"". also they want the cosmetic ""FREE through game grinding"" i mean most cosmetic costume in game online is always paid which is ridicilous statement to review down just because you have to buy cosmetic but they even gave some good cosmetic that can be bought via Grinding too just maybe its too long.

instead complaining this game is pay 2 play why not just buy the game to support the dev?"
8561,Everything Okay But have a Ping issue and Chinese player be a god in this game bc have a low ping.
8562,good
8563,HIGH QUALITY OF PICTURE
8564,Great game and fun with teammate
8565,"Really fun, unique style of game. Very punishing if you are not adapting to the actual mechanics of the game, you CAN NOT go into this game thinking you're just going to faceroll your keyboard and spam click your mouse and win.

Casual play: 8/10
Competitive Play: 9/10 (could be 10 out of 10 with more hero balancing)
Graphics: 8/10
Mechanics: 7/10 (still getting used to it as a newer player, however there are a lot of mechs in the game right now that come from it being still a new game and developers needing to get out a working product)"
8566,10/10
8567,Buy and Play first then you will stuck with this game
8568,GOOD
8569,"This game is an insane amount of fun.

I'm usually a pretty close minded FPS player but got interested when seeing this game during E3.
Since its 20 Euros I decided to pick it up with a few friends and try it out, haven't been able to stop playing it since. 

Graphics look great (on my PC at least), game flows super well, character / general design is amazing, gameplay feels smooth and is a ton of fun.

This game feels like a breath of fresh air in the over saturated battle royale market.

Only two critique points is the limiting settings the game offers as well as the UI during rounds. Could use some improvement / better concepts to make things easier to find and look better.

PS: Prepare to use some time and watch some videos once you feel like dying to everyone, it takes a bit."
8570,"Top class customizations + Polished game mechanics = FUN GAME Overall!
It's a really great game with a lot of options!"
8571,"very fun game enjoyable time may have broken my chair arm due to it but amazing game 
FIX THE FUCKING SERVERS PLEASE"
8572,"While I do recommend, this game has region lock issues as well as netcode issues. if you don't mind give it a try its super fun!"
8573,Yes
8574,SHING SHING SHING
8575,For the love of god please fix this laggy shit
8576,good game
8577,"Great game with a lot of surprises throughout the course of the game. Initial bots in lower ranks but higher elo will match you off with crazy people. Game concept revolves around around rock paper scissors with certain moves countering others. Other reviews did mention how player base is one-sided being mostly asian players which is not a surprise considering the origin of the game. People said ""asian  players with 500+pings is breaking the game, cant hit them with the high lag"", i haven't had issues landing attacks on high ping enemy players, if your attacks didn't land, more training room for you lol. Game overall feels like street figher + overwatch with battle royale concept, not the best but new blood to steam."
8578,"super fun game, great graphics and smooth gameplay. loving it"
8579,"I really like the game, but the implementation is just insane.
Why is every server a goddamn ping-fest where chinese/asian players are able to use our servers. Try predicting a block with this lag. Also, the game falls apart in the trios: you are guaranteed as a solo to be placed with two prime specimens, who despite their game/top 5 rank being marginally above deceased; think today, this game, is the day they are going to be chow yun fat and kill everyone. 
They will get decimated like chow mein and then run to the nearest soul respawn to feed themselves again. 
You, not being a robot, will creep and avoid people all the way to the final circle to be rewarded with ... losing points in your rank and character, along with twenty minutes of sitting in a bush, hearing an obnoxiously loud heart beat sound. 

It's a fun game, just needs a lot a work."
8580,It's like playing Sekiro BR.
8581,aight
8582,Great game and good experience!!
8583,"<3
"
8584,"Hope you want to spend hours fighting against bots with names and icons designed to obfuscate the fact that they are bots. Presumably as you rank up the bots are removed, but this feature should be opt-in if not opt-out. I didn't buy this game to play against bots, I bought it to play against laggy players across the world bc this game has no region locking in its multiplayer."
8585,"Problem with international servers.
Input lag due to high ping players.
Graphics are smooth, but the ping issues destroy the fun.

Would be a fun game if they fix this.
"
8586,"I will change my review once these major issues get fixed.
Shitty optimization and missing region lock
If you wanna play against Russians and Chinese everyday, that just teleport around then you can play already.
他妈的 你们为什么玩在欧洲的服务器 你妈了个臭B"
8587,"loving the game so far, great combat system, not too advanced to get in to but endless options on what u want to do, would recommend"

8591,"easy to learn, fun game."
8592,"A truly fresh take upon the Battle Royale genre. The melee combat is super awesome, you really have to read the opponents moves in order to win the battle. And the map itself is also really innovative, with destroyable objects and consumable plants for buffs. This makes every match feel unique and fun. I also like that every characters has a different skillset with variations."
8593,it done
8594,"This game is now in Season 3:
Game was super fun! Now its Infested with Lagging and Exploid using People.
Especially Guys with Chinese Names and Extreme Highping. And Having that gives you advantage. 
Its Impossible to play without those guys.
I gave this game a Thumb up (Release) but its still getting worse.
If they fix this and lock those away or Regionlock whatever im 100% sure this will incrase the Playerbase in EU and NA.
BUT NOT LIKE THIS!!!!
Graphics = TOP
Gameplay is not fair if you fight against people with Higher Ping.

Getting in the same lobby with lagging / Exploid using dudes is super annoying.
I Reeeeaaaaalllyyy Love this game but its extremely unbalanced since release. Some Ultimates are way too strong and you cant get out. 
You are in disadventage when your opponents connection to your server (mostly asians and now NA joining EU ) is crappy.
And thats frustrating. 
Please do something! DONT LET STUFF LIKE THIS DESTROY THE GAME!
Cant even play 1 Ranked match without Lagging  People with strange movement or Exploid using dudes with Chinese names. Make something like autokick if your ping is higher than 80 or something. Would be important if you Play Ranked.
Like this its Impossible to play Fair.
Thanks


add:
 if you are opening chests and stuff prepare to get the same stuff 238934 times, even if they are paid chests. Keep your Money if you are sane.

AND GUYS... STAY ON YOUR SERVER.
Thats all."
8595,Its a fun game but to many dam sweaty ass Chinese kids
8596,"BR with melee. feels so good
"
8597,GG
8598,"Balance is non existent, hits go through people sometimes making you die, people team in 3v3 and 1v1.
Some top ranked people are hackers and teamers or people with high ping (devs have no issue with this).
You get placed against people in china and even NA when you play on EU.
Ultimates are free win buttons. There are many easy to abuse, spammable strategies that cannot be countered unless you are an actual god at predicting.
Maybe the game will get better with time, but currently it's not worth the time and money, just to be annoyed by horrible mechanics."
8599,"excellent concept, combat, graphics and gameplay"

Have fun playing the game!"
8622,nice
8623,BEST PUBG UPDATED LOL
8624,"* I rarely play BR's  *
With that being stated, I found myself fully immersed into this game for multiple reasons some of those reasons being due to it unique to other BR's and it's playstyle while managing to keep the BR feel to it. The characters for the most part are nicely designed however a few could benefit from a nerf to make them more balance and less irritating when you go against or get  dumpstered by them. I highly recommend naraka bladepoint for those who are looking for a fun and engaging game to play with friends."
8625,"How the f when im in the middle of the fight, suddenly the game :""there is a corrupted files need to repair"" and then kick me out of the game ? WTF developer ??"
8626,like
8627,good
8628,"While the gameplay is fun, even if a bit unbalanced, my review just aims to what's around the game, considering it's made by a chinese company.

Basically this is a mobile game. Everytime you quit you are requested if you are sure or if you want to continue playing, there is a constant user ID code on screen when you play and, my god, monetization is the worst applied ever. Game is B2P (that will surely kill it in few months becasue BR games NEED high population), has in game shop for cosmetics, battlepass and lootboxes. While there are other games with the same business model, like Apex, this game has the usual HORRIBLE chinese/korean gatcha mentality they are using EVERYWHERE in the east nowdays. Lootboxes have unique items that you cannot get in other ways and while games like Overwatch and Apex gives you the way to directly pay for them, this game doesn't. Like in a gatcha game you have one guaranteed legendary drops (with droprate of 0.3%) every 100 boxes (basically every 200bucks) but it can still be a dupe!, so you can literally spend THOUSANDS of bucks without obtaining that particular item you want.

This behavior must to stop, we went from COMPLETE games in the 90s to games that requires a house rent and these countries are constantly abusing of it. You CANNOT pay so much for a damned skin which requires 2 hours to be made by a single dev, they are not new heroes with unique skills like a real gatcha game, lootboxes CANNOT be that way in this damned game. This fast and cheap money milking MUST TO STOP!"
8629,ghiền
8630,very good - wish i had friends
8631,"Amazing game! Quick tip, if you ever buy this game, download it to your ssd instead of your hdd, when I first played this game I installed it in my hdd and the game was so slow to load the first match that I played I didn't even have the chance to pick my character or where will I spawn but when I download it to my ssd the difference was noticable, it loads faster and more playable than when I download it to my hdd.

This game is simply great, characters with different abilities that suits different play styles, I really like how the game is more on close-combat with a pinch of long-ranged weapons here and there, one of the many things that I like about this game is the grappling that helps you initiate a fight, get out of sticky situations or for just simply mobility when going around places. I really love the game and I hope for its success and more updates to come, the only problem I am experiencing sometimes is my connection is unstable in some games, maybe because I am being matched with people from far places but I hope they can fix this by adding regions to where you will be matched up, none the less great game and still going to play and continue pulling all-nighters playing this game."
8632,"It's a fun idea, but it seems like there are a ton of really dumb bots in each game.  If I play an area game like this, say Warzone...I might get one or two kills, but it's still fun for me.  This game I actually win...so although it's fun to place 1st, not every time....bot levels way to easy."
8633,"Game is currently filled with cheaters, boosters, teamers, and a buttload of Chinese players using VPN to come to NA purely to have higher ping, high ping in this game makes it so you can't be hit, parrys dont register and you essentially become a god. 

The entire leaderboards for ranked are dominated by boosters and teamers. 

In it's current state, do not touch."

8636,"[[ INVITE CODE ]] for NEW PLAYERS.

8637,Great Game
8638,"love it, the game is not ""too hard"" i believe most negative reviews are fps players that dont really wanna put time in the game and learn it tbh"
8639,Basically just get comboed by a 3 button mash that allows you to be one shot and hcain cc'ed til you die. Broken weapons and non stop stun locks.

8641,"at first everything was fine, but the devs or executives arent fixing the biggest problems in the game

infinite juggle from tarka, GS stoneform too noob friendly, even blocking blue charges
and their new 1v1 mode was a nice idea but it has a bad system that forces you to pick certain weapons

ofc all these VPNers on the EU server arent really that great either, but its only the tip of the ice berg"
8642,nahhh
8643,ya know what. I like it a lot.
8644,free pls
8645,really good to play though sometimes the sever doesnt work well
8646,CHINA ONE NUMBER SUCK MY PP
8647,This game is amazing <3 The only thing that I would complain is the lagging :(
8648,"The game is surprisingly good - it has really impressed me as it looked quite generic.

Pros:

* Silky smooth parkour - not just leaping over walls, but climbing walls/trees, hanging from chains, zipping through trees using grapples - it has some of the best ingame movement I've experienced and it is smooth as silk responsive.

* Good round lengths - the games dont go for too long which suits me as i often have limited time (small child to look after)

* The combat is fast paced and satisfying yet if you're caught by surprise, there's room to evade/escape using the game mechanics. It's not EASY to detach as such, but you're not getting 1 shot from across the map from some bush hiding sniper.

* The map is beautiful - diverse and has a range of different times of day providing very different lighting.

* Cosmetics are monetized but its not in your face - nor pay to win.

* Excellent sound design - from the combat itself to being able to hear enemies in the area depending on what surface they're on, what they're doing etc.

* Interesting selection of heroes

Cons:

* Could use a few more heroes

* The game uses bots at times which aren't a dealbreaker, but I would prefer to know if i'm dealing with a bot or a player as bots can initially seem quite challenging until you get a hit or two on them when they turn stupid. You can mess around and practice against bots whilst some humans appear botlike but then become harder challenges. Personally I'd prefer no bots at all as it's never 100% clear when they're bots

* The season pass and ingame currency costs are only in USD - painful for someone in Australia.

All in all, I highly recommend this game.
"
8649,Impressive game.
8650,"I can now fulfill my deepest fantasies of playing as Cody Fern with red eye shadow grapple hooking people and shooting them in the face with a pistol while flying through the air towards them. 10/10 character facial customization, Fantastic combat and movement. If you are in the slightest into the concept of a battle royale this is a good one to play."
8651,Really fun experience battling it out in a test of skill. Visually beautiful game with the exciting game play to match. Similar to PUBG but more fast-paced and skill based. Think PUBG meets Assassins Creed. I recommend this game to anyone who loves a fast and exciting battle-royale and loves slicing up foes.
8652,fire
8653,"At first I was skeptical in getting the game but I gave it a shot and don't regret it. A lot of bad reviews stating they need to add region block, I'm sure that will be one of the first updates that will come out. Give it a shot."
8654,a
8655,"Edit: Game is unplayable in it's current state. There is currently a huge problem with chinese people playing on the NA server abusing their extremely high ping, making it completely impossible for actual NA players to enjoy the game. It is impossible to time blocks and combos properly when the other party is snapping around the battlefield slaughtering everybody and the devs refuse to do anything about it. Until this is fixed, I am changing my review to negative

Game is really fun but between the final beta and and release,  the devs decided to lock a bunch of cosmetics behind a shitty microtransaction based loot box system. The gameplay itself is a nice change of pace and I've really been enjoying the game. Only complaint is the movement system seems to be a bit unrefined for a twenty dollar game with as many microtransactions as your average f2p mobile game

Edit: Game was fun until the Chinese players took over and ruined it. Now every game you get killed by a squad of 3 people with ping so high you are dead before you even see them"
8656,ok
8657,"I fucking hate this game. BUT you should definitely buy it and spend all your money into it, Just to go in game (after taking some shrooms for your depression) with nice cosmetics and rage when you get stun-locked by the spear for 10 minutes, or die too greatsword off of 2 swings. But it's okay because the shrooms kicked in and you realize the world isn't so bad after all. :) (no sarcasm actually give it a try i'm addicted)"
8658,"Game is too hard and fun. Ranked needs more bots so we can climb. Not enough bots in top 500 matches :^)

Game is balanced and punishing. Do not spam buttons or you will regret it. All in all fun game and worth the try."
8659,"Stuck at start page, cannot start. F**king game, don't buy!!!!!"
8660,aerial gs spam
8661,"Cool concept with some fun game play, sadly the game does not run very well especially when there are multiple people around. Some optimization needs to happen for this game to be better, also got to gold in ranked and then instantly started to play against all Chinese players not very fun to play against people that cant be parried half of the time and dont take damage. Ultimates also are way to broken during a fight so much so that for alot of them the best counter is to back off and stop fighting not a very fun way to play the game. overall gamplay is fun but needs some tuning and the game runs like shit."
8662,absolute glitchy cancerfest filled with chinese players queuing in other regions to get ping advantage. save our money; this game is absolutely garbage.
8663,Really fun game I am very bad at!
8664,This game is pure adrenaline rush when you get in a fight with a bunch of skilled players or even battle royale and you go blow for blow with another top fighter. Had one of the best PVP experiences ever when I was #3 and I fought #2.
8665,Finally a game that feels like it mixes up the Battle Royale genre. Digging the cosmetics they're providing and I hope to see them continue to support the game.
8666,"Very well made game, however Trios abusing rank diversity is ruining ranked (2 top tier players ques with a bronze smurf which results in them going up against golds). Just have a limit to trio party rank limits and also please nerf dagger and long sword."
8667,"Unique melee based br with asian aesthetics, 
huge movement component and rpg elements.

Easy to learn, hard to master, extremely high skill ceiling. 

Competitive, very fun but equally tilting at times. I like it."
8668,"The melee combat is immersive and fun. You can change up your combos on your enemy but they also have the chance to try and counter you, disarm you, and launch a counter attack. 

The movement is subpar to none. Think of Pathfinder in Apex but on Columbian crack cocaine. 

The character creation is hilarious. There's way more customization than should be possible and it's amazing.
Think RPG customization levels for the characters. 

There's tons of unlockables too.

It is seriously one of the funnest games I've played in a long fucking time"
8669,It is quite promising. New look for a battle royal game. The game itself is good. There's a lot of potential.
8670,Good game. sLOp Control. Thurp lIKE.
8671,"Something needs to be done about the Chinese players using VPN to play on the NA server, otherwise a decent game. The cosmetics are expensive but they are optional so whatever."
8672,"the game is very cool and fun, also good character customization, also tits, also very fun gameplay

now fix the servers then thisll be the only game i play for the next 3 months"
8673,"The game is still fun and good, however there are few issues that needs to be addressed as it scares off my regional players. Biggest problem, there has to be a region lock, or at least for NA and Canada. Gaming culture is very different here and we have way more casual players than any one remotely interested and skilled to learn games in and out. Every match is barebones ruined by asian players coming over and kicking our butt, using NA server as practice dummy.  2nd big issue, really coming out of first is that the game has HUGE skill gap. that has to be addressed, either keep skilled players separate from casual players until casuals ""skill out"" the casual sandbox, or force on close up the skill gap some how.  I personally wont touch the game until region lock gets implemented. how they going to block VPNed players from Asia away...? i have no idea, but they ruin experience for us."
8674,Like apex but less guns
8675,Trash lag heavy attack spamming parry doesn't work ass garbage

8681,"This game is actually really great. The gameplay/animations are amazing and it keeps me wanting to play more. However they don't region lock players based on their Geographical locations. China is Region Locked but they get around it via VPN to play on NA servers. SEA players all over NA servers and surprisingly are at an advantage due to having high ping. 

The higher you get in the ranked playlists the more and more ping abuse you will see; i.e. people teleporting around, you hitting someone only for them to somehow kill you when their HP was Zero and some hacking... Only ran into a few players who were blatantly using some sort of ESP (firing at bushes when you are hidden from players). 

If the developers take the issues that have been brought to their attention seriously then this could be an amazing game. But only time will tell."
8682,just when you thought battle royale games had run their course...
8683,good shit
8684,this is what it would be like if Monster Hunter World removed all the monsters and became a battleroyal... love it.
8685,love the gameplay
8686,solos plays very well however trios is a little too much unga bunga and i really with they had duos. besides that its fantastic 9/10
8687,yes boing boing

8698,10/10 Give me more
8699,"Fun game, but as I I kept ranking up my ping just kept getting worse and worse. Too the point I cant even play the game anymore due to how choppy and laggy it is....

Will change the rule when region-locking and servers are fixed."
8700,"I love this game.  The combat here is so skillful and the skill floor and ceiling are closer than you might think.  You must however practice the moves.  I suppose some folks are complaining about that.  

I am a 47 year old gamer and I can compete."
8701,"I couldnt even play the game because it took sooo long to load, and when it finished loading i get a split second of being in the game and it starts to load again. Over and Over until it just took me to the main menu. NOT WORTH PLAYING!!!"
8702,This game is really fun and challenging but the only issue i have right now is after a few basic attacks it puts you into a charged attack and that can screw you in a fight so in my opinion i think that should be changed or removed all together. charged attacks are good and all but only used when needed not in the middle of a fight. The parry system to counter the charged moves is one of the coolest things tho. over all i love this game and everything about it if you have been looking at this game to get it is worth the price and best of all is its skill based and not a pay to win game. 10/10 would slice someone in half with my greatsword again
8703,The game goes Hard. i don't need to say more.

On the higher rank you get constantly matched with asians who have a big ping advantage.
Ultimates are extremely unbalanced. One buttonpress can win you the battle. Thats why almost everyone plays the monk.

A lot of Asian players in NA servers and other small things but devs always have questionnaires about the state of the game and all known issues I have are being addressed in future patches. Overall, super fun game with friends! Well worth the 20 bucks."
8720,its ok!
8721,"Huge Potential.
Fun but should be free due to ingame purchases and needs a lot of improvements"
8722,"high skill gap, tough game, rewards skill, button mash and you will lose. purchase price to limit smurfs with alt accounts. cash shop for cosmetics ( which you can earn the majority in game). 

this is my first ever Battle Royal and I love it. I die all the time, but when you outplay your opponent it is super satisfying. 
I love the local ranking system so you can see your skill on your character on a small scale.

The characters and editor are awesome.
the community seems awesome, people saying GG in chat after you beat them, etc.

My only complaint is my own skill level, which is up to me to change. GG.

8733,"Constantly fighting players from overseas. It's impossible to hit them. Straight up not fun

I lose every game to china. Every. Single. Game."
8734,"The Rock-Paper-Scissors combat system doesn't really work. Unlike good fighting games you will not find yourself trying to anticipate what sort of an attack your enemy is going to use. There are no mix-ups, fake-outs, or techs happening here. Instead winning fights in this game is all about who has the better gear and who gets the first hit in.

The combat loop goes: Grapple> Stunlock> Spam Quick Attack > Grapple > Stunlock> Spam Quick Attack

Whoever gets the first grapple in usually wins.

 I have tried many times to use the blue charge-up attack to try to outplay people who spam basic attacks. I don't think it works like it's intended to. I was hoping that the ""blue"" attacks would work the same way as the blue parrying attacks in Absolver. 

If somebody hits you during a ""blue"" move in Absolver they are punished hard for it.

If somebody hits you during a ""blue"" move in Naraka they can usually just keep swinging and stun you out of it.

Instead of a game about strategy and reaction times like most fighting games Naraka's fights are always one guy wailing on the other stunlocked guy until he dies. There is no way to punish an enemy for spamming the quick attack on your helpless stunlocked character. In trios there is no real way to outplay two people attacking you at the same time. You just die. I might just be bad at the game and playing with other people who are bad, but this has been my experience so far.

The map is the same 4 trees, 6 houses, and 7 rocks copy-pasted over and over again. There are only 4 or 5 unique structures on the map. The grapple can be very frustrating at times. It does not always bring you where you want to be. It will stick you to the geometry seemingly at random.

There is a lot of potential here, but this game just isn't worth 20 dollars in its current state."

8775,"MAKE THIS GAME FREE TO PLAY SO IT CAN THRIVE PLEASE!
I gotta say, this is the best $30 I've spent in a long long time. This game is super fun and unique. The art work is beautiful, combat and parkour are very smooth. I'd recommend this game to anyone who like BR genre and want to try something different and more action-y instead of the typical fps.
PROS:
- Everyone can be spooderman
- Beautiful graphics (running at 2K and everything on high)
- KUNG-FU!!!
- Characters are hawt!!!
- Eases you into the game with bots for the first couple of games, then uses skill base matchmaking. It's a nice touch for newbies 

CONS:
- Marital Arts and oriental design is still a niche, hopefully this game will last a very long time (looking at Spellbreak lmao)
- Most of the UIs and systems are copy and paste from Apex Legends (good thing is it makes it easier to transition from Apex to Naraka)
- The Glyph system is my only real complaint about this game (similar to Runes in League of Legends), but this is a matter of taste, you might appreciate that this system gives you more customisation over your account and playstyle

TLDR: Despite some minor CONS, I rate this game a solid 9.5/10, and I don't usually rate games this high. It's totally worth it. And if it doesn't meet your expectations or not your taste, your can refund it within 2 hours anyway. And trust me, within 2 hours you'll know!"
8776,this game is my new addiction its just straight amazing
8777,"Hello potatoes! 
The game is good. It's exactly what I expected :). It makes me think of history, the story is full of action and the players are getting better every day. The game is well controlled, the game ideas are good, the fights are amazing.
If you don't like the idea of the game, it doesn't mean it's a bad game.
Do you want to play something else? go look for another game on the market but don't get caught up with people who struggled with this project.
Do you want a more realistic game? you have nothing to do here."

8789,"This game - even though it is Chinese and has Gacha mechanics - is surprisingly good. Bought it an just can't let it be. I don't know which game triggered me like this for a long time. The fights are fluid and a lot of fun. Weapons seem balanced so far. In my opinion there is no best weapon. The weapon just needs to click with your style of play and it is well usable. Heroes are not so well balanced but that is normal. Some skill sets seem better for solo play, some for trios. But no hero is overpowered and just needs practice to be countered right. Regarding the Gacha mechanics... As of now they are only for cosmetics - which is totally fine. If you can live with not having your favorite skin there is no need to whale. Battle Pass - which also exists - skins are far better then tha Gacha ones if you ask me. And the Battle Pass is fairly priced. Definitly worth the 20 bucks!"
8790,I need healing.
8791,"Ever wonder what would happen if you mixed Apex Legends and For Honor?
Well here it is, a fast paced, melee focused hero based Battle Royal.
Character specific abilities, decent progression, and LOOT BOXES, everyones favorite battle royal mechanic for dumping heaps of money into for immaterial skins. From the slightly clunky feel to the beautiful animations and effects, the game itself is very well made. Although it could definitely use a retouching in certain places, such as the massively annoying inability to hit enemies on a slope with counters, and the fact that counters cant be done after certain actions and only in neutral stance. The extremely difficult fact of being outnumbered and unable to move due to hit stun from multiple enemies. On the other side you have a wonderfully put together product with attention to the little details like backstories and artistic renderings of the heros, the minor map details with environmental hazards like bees and birds making noise if you disturb them, all the way to a massive water wheel that crushes enemies in its path, and the near perfect hitboxes for attacks making it possible to dodge duck dip dive and dodge out of harms way while flowing into your own counter attack. This game has a way of making you feel like a bad ass mythical fighter capable of flying through the air and raining hell down upon your enemies. 
There's a ton of good and bad with this game much like any other competitive game out there, so its definitely not for everyone. It has a decently tough learning curve to be anything other than a spamming monkey abusing bots and newbies. But there's genuine fun in it and if that's what your looking for i say Go for it. 
Solid 5/7 from me"
8792,Booba 10/10
8793,this is so fcking good mate go buy this sht
8794,"I saw this game back a few months ago and thought it was cool but had my doubts.
After playing it I realized how good it is and feels.

It offers a deep combat that allows for mind games and high outplay potential. Lots of animation cancelling stuff that's so good.
You can win fairly even if the opponent has better loot, it's hard but do-able.

Incredible movement, there's a lot of animation cancelling that allows players to move freely, I'd say it's movement competes with Apex's.

Runes, it has different types of runes that gives you stats and that extra something to the stats affected.

Characters variations, they have really different abilities and offer different things to the game. You have 3 choices in each ability (Basic Ability and Ultimate). In my opinion they seem really balanced and everyone seems viable. There's really good characters and good characters.

Character visuals, they look so good, until you customize them to look like a Goblin. And that brings me to Customization, which is imo something new to the genre and amazing, that needs to be implemented more.

Now the bad ones.
It's a paid game with a paid Battle Pass, which doesn't pay for itself.
You'll have to pay a little bit more just to get the next one. That's not essentially bad, but unnecessary.

Some customization items are behind ""gold"" which is the paid currency of the game. They are really expensive (For me at least) and they are not that worth it, unless you really want it, it's just better to get the Battle Pass.

There's lootbox also, but they give you things from a pool. There's paid cosmetics that are not in that pool, and are those paid with gold.
Lootboxes are obtainable by playing.

It's an aggressive system that I don't really agree with. This game should have been F2P with a good anti-cheat.
I haven't met any cheaters but I've seen cheats already been made for the game.

Player Base: It's a growing player base, you dont get Big Game Numbers. But that's a problem at least in regions that are not NA or EU.
I play in SA and in random hours I get NA games, which are very difficult to play well since the ping is 160+ and outplaying gets harder.

Overall, it's an awesome game with gameplay that I haven't seen before, rewarding and high skill.
Definitely buy it if you want a fun and challenging game.
You can ignore the monetization and enjoy it 100%.

"
8795,"first game I got 15 kills, loved it"
8796,nice game
8797,So F$%^&ing good.
8798,"went from full health to ded when one bane breath hit me.

imbalanced as hell. also lag."
8799,"Do not buy this game, there are no regional servers, so you'll constantly be playing with chinese players who have 800 ping and teleport around the map. Additionally if you are north american and don't speak chinese, which most of you don't, you won't be able to communicate with your team at all. This is the worst design I've ever seen in an online game.

Great concept, fun mechanics, horrible regions and useless teammates. Just skip this garbage game and play anything else. Also once you reach platinum it's ONLY chinese guys that can't speak english so good luck having any type of communication, que times are about 2-5mins and the game just launched. No western players will be playing this game in 1 month.

Oh also to add, at higher ranks (platinum and above) it cannot fill a full game so it will either fill it with bots or give you no team. I've had this happen like 15 times, I spawn in with no team."
8800,"fluid movement, fast combat, classes are fun. It has an awesome aesthetic! highly recommend for weebs and BR savants. the environment in which you interact with is very pretty"
8801,"This game doesn't cater to the weak, there is a big skill-gap in this one. With that being said, it will serve you best when you put in the time and effort to rise to the challenge of your fierce opponents. 100% recommend."
8802,Great game no one snips you from across the map and T-Bags
8803,very good
8804,"Would even donate my kidney to keep this game alive, good game, just buy, and play."
8805,"Naraka: Bladepoint is a battle royale game without guns, which is what caught my attention. When I booted this game up I really wasn't expecting much as battle royale games aren't really in my wheel house. But after playing for a while, I grew extremely fond of it really quickly.

Unfortunately, lately the player base has gotten extremely annoying with how they play. To clarify, most of my deaths are at the hands of a third party who just waits in the outskirts while I fight another player. This happens way too often and feels cheap when you die this way.

Another problem is the balancing of weapons and characters. If you want to win, pick a greatsword or spear. They are the most spammable weapons in the game. To the point of everyone using one of them, and at the end of the match one of the top three will be using them. Two of the characters in game are completely OP compared to the abilities of the others. One becomes a giant that can grab you and hold you, or slam you to the ground. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that he can do this from a good distance, making escape nigh impossible in a 1 v 1.

The other character has an aoe that nearly wins every fight for her. She throws out a spinning blade that stun locks you while she peppers you with attacks as well. This eats through your armor and health and by the time you get out of it, the only thing you can hope to do is kill her before she can lay a single hit on you.

And this is all without mentioning its ping issues and the multicultural issues you have in each match (i.e chinese players wiping every server)

All in all, if you like battle royales - go for it, you may find something here that you really enjoy

If you don't, then I wouldn't waste your time or money. This games fanbase is already becoming extremely toxic and spamming any easy combo they can get instead of trying to get better at the game.

P.S If you use Greatsword or Spear, you aren't as good as you think you are."
8806,Fun mele and ranged combat. Amazing looking game. Most fun battle royale right now.
8807,Netease you monther boom shakalaka
8808,"Hackers everywhere. Game does not provide replay feature to watch how you die. And this type of game is hard to identify hacker. Hack report seems not work at all. I dont know how this company handle hack reports but my friend told me I have to clip the moment I found the hacker, I am not free to do that. Gameplay is great but dev seems not taking serious on banning hackers. Soon this will be 2nd pubg or apex. Game is still enjoyable at the moment but not sure for how long if hackers encounters into the game too much."
8809,that was good
8810,"Finally an original battle royale with a unique combat system which is very refreshing. The movement is also very different from other battle royales, you can sword dash, tether and dubble jump. A lot of skill goes in to this which makes it way more fun than in other games where you just hold W. This ensures there are almost no boring moments. Had a lot of fun with this game so far and I'm exited to see how it will develop."

8832,"Pretty fun game and gives you a good amount of time with bots before playing real people. only downside is its a climbing game so you will face a lot of people better than you who are climbing alongside you. A fix to the rankings is my only negative tho. Character design is also beautiful, just have to pay for great skins. No shame in that to pay developers."
8833,"its really
"
8834,Dope game
8835,"I like the style of playing this kind of action game
"
8836,GOOD GAME need better servers and weapons balance
8837,"i think this game has a focus on being beautiful, character customization, and predatory micro transactions. 
unfortunately those three things dont make a good game.
mechanically i think the game is crap. you cant get in half the windows, you cant climb onto roofs that have eaves 90% and EVERY SINGLE #$%^@ house has eaves. The combat is fun when your attacks dont phase through all the chinese people who play on US servers with 200 ping. 
if you like being CC'd in combat by endless grapples, and endless combos by spear/dagger combined with broken unbalanced character abilities.
Imagine Overwatch, where every character has a broken game breaking ult that the only counter play is to run away, but combine that with a bad rock paper scizzors fighting game, then combine that with a battle royal that has 3-5 minute que times.

8844,"It's like you took what I would imagine Sekiro's grapple system felt like (Didn't play it, but watched it),  Sprinkle in Apex's Character ability and special ability with the team of 3 and solos its fantastic, Took Shadow Realm's ashes(BDO's BR)  and sprinkled them on the combat style, then you got real spicy and decided that you were going to use league of legends rune system to give advantages to really flex the fact that you leveled up a lot to smurf on the newbies, then yall really decided to put realm royal runes in the actual game too.... and THERE'S MORE now we take the servers and we allow everyone from all over the world with any level of ping to connect to your match and BOOM. You have this lovely little title that is extremely refreshing and crispy like a Mcdonald's sprite. CWISSSSPYYYY.  Also, forgot to mention when you die and spawn back manually they give you a fighting chance by spawning you with weapons but no armor which in my opinion is a great thing.

Anyways, I definitely recommend it although the trios lobbies are who can grapple juggle who's teammate first sometimes its still A LOT OF FUN. It's definitely worth the 20 dollars and if you have friends that will embark on this insane RPG BR hell of a mash-up! Also, solos are pretty fun too but I wish there was an arenas mode like Apex or the mode they have which is a deathmatch solo que only (whack) but it is really fun and allows you to try/test all the weapons in the game minus the runes in the actual game (Souljades). Regardless I think that mode is the best way to level fast and get a feel for the game outside of the tutorial. Hope you enjoyed the review <3"
8845,It's good. I returned it at first. Then I bought it again.
8846,good
8847,i sure love killin
8848,"a very very hard game with a lot of mechanics, but its definitely one of the best competitive Battle Royale games out there.

the skill-gap might be very frustrating to new players. your gonna die a lot. my best advice starting up players on the game is to play Blood Bath a lot. better to practice fighting people then dying and respawning a lot. To better learn the fighting mechanics first rather playing the Battle Royale looting for 20+ minutes only to die from other players.

also remember your first 2-3 games are filled with bots so get crazy and get a lot of kills but just don't get it to your head. this was the most frustrating thing I experienced in the game that nearly made me quit before giving it a real shot. thankfully Naraka's official Discord members have saved me from doing so, where they shared their fair share of frustration due to the skill-gap. also do not worry you will get better with time and effort! game on!

I spent $19.99 to get the game and its totally worth it! 

also my in-game name is Shinig4mi lets play!"
8849,"I cannot understand how so many people recommend this game. The input delay is huge and unresponsive, I can press A to move to the left and yet my character will lock walking to the right randomly throughout matches. Maybe this is better played with a controller but M&K feels terrible. Combat is meh.. I was hoping for more skill based fights more like for honor where you can actually win with skill, It's just as good to button spam and then hold one of them on occasion to charge to attack. 90% of any ""player"" you see is a bot. On top of it all the server or player connection is really bad. My last match I put 3 dagger combos through someone and not one of the hits registered, and my person kept going through them, but somehow they were still able to hit me the whole time, and that was it. not worth the time to get better at the game when the game itself just doesn't work as it's supposed to."
8850,"Good Game no doubt. I hope ""chinese"" cheaters won't overcrowd the server."
8851,Good Battleroyale game but many woman there :( XD
8852,Entertaining
8853,"TL;DR - Terrible, money-hungry business practices. Bots fill lobbies. No real gameplay.

They will match you against bots for your first 2h of playtime, in order to make you feel like you're doing well before you can refund the game.
There is no level req. for playing ranked, so you can grind ranks on bots.
Combat is entirely button spam. There is some real strategy and complexity possible in the combat, but button mashing works just as well.
Abilities trivialize any real combat. (Yoto Hime can just hide and wait for her insta-kill ultimate)
Parkour is cool on paper, incredibly janky in practice. I've fallen through the map twice already.
The devs claim that bots are used until you hit a ""certain skill level"" but don't specify when. But many players have said that bots are still in their plat lobbies. You can tell when an enemy is a bot when they heal in the open, mid fight, or jump into walls because their coding is so shit.
If your queue takes too long to pop (because no one is actually playing this no-name BR) then it gets filled with bots."
8854,"Just a heads up for new comers.. all your games in the begenging you will be facing bots. In which they dont seem to tell you. So if you felt like you were doing great and then all of a sudden your facing a huge skill gap against real players, would be because they have no idea what there doing. All I ask is for a simple Ranked Mode, and a Casual Mode."
8855,insane
8856,game
8857,Really fun Battle Royal with a very high skill cap
8858,"Finally a fast-paced, skill-based battleroyale that feels good and has appealing graphics * -*"
8859,NicUuuuuh!
8860,dope game
8861,its a sick game khant
8862,"just no, maybe one day when it will get better but right now noop. 5 games an only  a few actual players the others are just bots. i felt pushed to like the game, gonna wait for when it gets better and maybe come back."
8863,love the game
8864,"actually takes skill
"
8865,Awsome game for any skill level. Highly recommend to at least try if you like battle royals. Warning its addicting :P
8866,"Absolute fun, can't stop playing it."
8867,"As somebody who plays with inverted Y axis, this game is unplayable but looks great. Until that problem gets fixed i'm  acting like a retarded monkey every time i get into a fight."
8868,"Remarkably deep, a technical fighter that stands on its own with a unique blend of influences. Difficult at first but incredibly rewarding to improve, highly recommend watching guides on combos and learning to crouch cancel your exit lag before you give up on the game."
8869,"This a fun and action packed game. Love playing it with my boyfriend. The graphics are amazing along with the customization. You can make your character look like anyone, I swear. The weapons are great and have a nice selection and range of difficulty/ However, I feel there are still some things that could be fixed, like lag and some of the parkour moves. If you have a HDD it can cause your game to shutter or stop all together and this can obviously be a problem if youre in a fight. Parkour can sometimes be glitchy when climbing buildings or going through windows. Overall, I'm addicted to this game and look forward to the new updates and fixes."
8870,i like boob physics 11/10

8877,fun
8878,Kill people fun
8879,"The game is fun but i can't recommend it in the current state.

The $20 dollar buy in is too high for a game that rocks a premium currency to buy skins and loot boxes and is so aggressively acting like a free 2 play game with it's pricing when it very clearly isn't. There are currently plans for them to release new characters for Tae (In game currency) and gold (premium currency) literally screaming free 2 play module here. It's an okay melee focused battle royal with a rock paper scissors still of combat, sporting 3 modes. Solo/Trios/Blood Bath (FFA brawling) and a battle pass which you will also need to buy since it is not included in pricing.  

Will change review should this game ever go free 2 play."
8880,"First PVP game i love in a long time.
Money transactions are are for cosmetics.
All face to face fighting."
8881,"* Some weapon types overall just doesn't feel balanced.
* You match up with bots and players.
* There is a 100 meter draw distance on enemies, which can really make it difficult to plan strategies.. Making enemies just appear out of thin air in front of you.
* The game is also incredibly bad at explaining the combo-system.
* Battles overall just feel random.... Not sure if it's because of network lag or not..."
8882,Naraka: Bladepoint feels like if you took Tekken and threw everyone into a wide-open map to duke it out. Slap in some sick grappling hook moves and you got yourself Naraka: Bladepoint. I really like it.
8883,Look up at the sky.
8884,"Game is super fun, and has a large learning curve regarding weapons and movement. Everything as far as characters and weaponry is balanced. The reason for my negative review however is the nonexistence of region locking, playing with other US players is all fun, but chinese hackers, and Max ping japanese players that cant seem to actually hit, litter the game.

Add region locking, and i'll change my review~!

Edit- Weeks after Naraka seems to be banning people on discord who bring the issue of region locking up. Not looking so good. On the upside the frequency in which you encounter hackers you meet does seem to be shorting out!"
8885,A nice breath of fresh air from traditional Battle Royale games . Its also very fun
8886,I can finally prove my skills as a shinobi & become Hokage so the village will respect me. Believe it!
8887,No.
8888,Pretty good if your into pvp and battle royal style games and of course KATANA. it has a pretty fun combat and also the grappling is the main attraction! tenchu man.
8889,MUST PLAY
8890,Impressive game with amazing graphics and mechanism.

8895,"My PC didn't handle the game very well. Constant frame drops shifting between 10-60. Really bad game performance even on the lowest settings. 

Was really excited to play with my friends, but unfortunately it was too much for my computer.

PC specs if u care
GTX 1060 3Gb
i5 7400 CPU
16Gb RAM"
8896,"fixed my issue games awesome

8897,so goood ty
8898,"fun game 9 hours in, i think u need to spend atleast 1000x as much time as i have to become any good at it but its fun and i u like to grind br this is it, deffinatly high skill gap which only makes the game more fun for me atleast (only playing this cause warzone has deverror and they cant fix anything damn rats)"
8899,"Game has a lot of great aspects, but it seriously needs region locking. Its annoying being absolutely dominated by chinese players over and over. Also the improper teaming on their end really ruins solo plays. Outside of that, super fun game.

Edit: Parry also needs some review, either needs to be able to be activated mid combo, or crouch/jump to combo cancel should be removed."
8900,Its like Final Fantasy + PUBG
8901,CHINA NUMBA ONE
8902,This is the battle royale experience I have been looking for. Combining the fighting and movement of Batman Arkham games and the feel of an RPG this battle royale is so refreshing and a must play for those who like a challenge. The game starts of very easy and can become a bit repetitive and grindy but that is the same with all Battle royales however in this case it feels worth it as there is a ranking system to work towards. The focus on melee weapons is also refreshing and makes it very hard to camp for the win and forces players to engage in tense battles. Teamwork and good tactics is also a must in this game if you want to be highly ranked in the trios gamemode and requires lots of coordination if you want to make it to the highest ranks.
8903,The game is a lot of fun. It takes the typical  battle royale and puts a melee spin on it. The movement in the game feels great you can scale walls or grapple hook around the map. They have a large variety of cosmetics including character and weapon cosmetics. While i am not the best at the ranged weapons they do feel very gratifying when you do hit your shots. Im a big fan of the legend abilities as well as the ranged combat. So if you like battle royales and you are willing to take the time to learn the games mechanics you will have a great time. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that when you first start playing it seems as if there are bots in the game when you first start which makes the wins feel a little less meaningful.
8904,"If you have unstable connection, don't play this game. If you have no friends, don't play this game. If you have anger issues, don't play this game. If you want to relax after hard working day, don't play this game. The map is beautiful and detail, houses are modeled very detail, that where you got stuck when trying to climb up and down. Parrying mechanic sometime not working if your connection ping a little above your opponent. And sometime you got into stunlock combo and can't even fight back. All i learned so far to win is afk hiding, avoid combat, and third party in the last circle, not so interesting game huh?"
8905,"if you are not sure about getting this game, allow me to remove your doubts, just get the game cuz its great, nice combat, combos, abilities, design and mechanics, the only bad part tbh is the fkin trash players that can ruin the experience sometimes, like mostly in ranked, they just keep hiding while you fight 4 other dudes, and then jump you when you are like 5 hp and kill you, and the game doesnt mind it but actually it encourages it, the ranked system doesnt give a shit about how you fought and killed 10 other guys, or if you died the 10th (with those 10 kills and good looting xp) /60 , if that you could still lose ranked points, while if that mf that kept hiding survived more, he'd end up gaining ranked points. also the game is a nice solo experience, but i assume its way much better when you play trios with your friends.
if you dont care about ranked then ignore my complains cuz there are several modes that you can enjoy ."
8906,its fun actually ngl
8907,"I was really excited to play this game, only to find out when getting close an enemy my ping will sky rocket to 13000+
It's not my internet, not my ISP, not my PC.
It's the game, and whatever they use to fake your on screen ping. Connecting from OCE to an SEA server and it indicated 30ms. HUH? thats not possible."
8908,yes good
8909,boobies
8910,                                                       .
8911,"I have played almost all of the most popular battle royal games and have gotten bored within a few hours. This refreshing take over the genre allows for skilled melee combat combined with unique parkour for a more enjoyable experience. No longer having to worry about building mechanics or sneaky long range shots, this game changes it up with quick grapple and powers to encourage brawling instead of pesky long range wins."
8912,"10/10 despite frame drops, VC issue was finally resolved as well."
8913,Good
8914,I got combo'd from 100 to 0. 10/10 would get combo'd again
8915,"So i played 18 hours game got to the current rating to 1700.

So the balance champions are very bad and they not taking action over couple of weeks and beta test was obvious they too powerful. Such as Otohime or the champion that can make yourself a titan that pretty much only way to is to run ultimate rules this game.

The next weapon balance legendary spinning weapon can lock the person to the wall impossible to survive.

The Great sword terrible broken it has block mechanic that other weapon doesn't have but it has high damage output compare other weapons.

Another massive problem you get plenty of bot players that are not real and they will ruin your fun because you kill them easily and when you meet real player he insane strong abusing every i mentioned above and make the game not fun.

Another massive problem the region are not being locked so i'm playing in EU i get people from ASIAN and other country that make different in pings that make people teleport behind you with no abilities that are being used.

Also if you getting knocked dodging away enemy can dodge back to you and get lock you in stun lock animation that you can't survive.

This game also should give some chance to advantage to the player that is being knocked down on the ground instead on devastating him even more.

Another problem there is cheaters who will not be able to knock them because well they are cheating.

Total game rating 3/10 this game need to go back to early access and fix the game massively."
8916,diancok
8917,Play with SSD. Game kinda struggles on HDD but it's still really fun
8918,Nice game with unpredictable matches.
8919,"THIS GAME IS CRAZY!!!

I can't even... For the first time for a LOOONG WHILE i got more than i bargained for, AND IN A GOOD WAY.

First of all, THE combat, the movement, the gameplay, every aspect of the core gameplay feel amazing! You can just jump on a tree come slashing back down on an enemy then dash away, throw your grappling hook to enemy and pull yourself towards it and slash on the air! HOW COOL IS THAT DUDE!

Second, YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE ALL CHARACTERS, i am not talking about buying skins dude, i am talking about full blown sliders, changing eye, jaw, and stuff. You can buy lots of cosmetic items, not just a costume, a hat, backback etc.

Third, You can change and unlock skills of your heroes, they actually get pretty impressive powers the more you play.

Fourth, Out of the box, all the modes you would want is here, Trios, Solos, AND MORE, even custom games!

Fifth, what are you waiting for BUY IT! 12/10"

8928,yes
8929,"Game is unique and uses good ideas from others BRs
Really love it so far 

While this game can be hard to master you can quickly rise to an average level where you can have fun and see a path of progression.

The only issue is chinese people coming to NA servers but DEV will address this issue soon

8930,good game
8931,bopte
8932,"Very Stylish Combat Skills Play, Good Job for the Creator. I hope there's more Item to be used and Characters added more like samurai"
8933,Decent game and quite enjoyable with friends. This game has potential but we'll have to see what happens in the future.
8934,Just play Tianhai and run around tossing people until you run out of ult.
8935,"Before I start writing this review you should know that this is my first ever serious review and I write this one with a gametime of 10-15 hours. 

Naraka Bladepoint (will call it NB from now on) is strictly seen one of my first Batte Royals. I usually dont like the genre, but give it a go now and then with free titles like Warzone (but i am not a fan of shooter as well). I am usually a player who plays PvE RPGs or Soulslike games. 
This game is not like Dark Souls but reminded me a bit of it of the feeling. (or i guess more like Sekiro but i never played it)
First of all You have 2 Game Modes, Battle Royal and Deathmatch. I played mostly the BR one which u can play Solo or as a Trio. 

The Combat System: 
Its unique, for sure. You find several different weapons melee and ranged where each of it has its own combo pattern, which is also upgradeable via soul jades you may find in game. 
You also have a hook which can be used to travel or to attack an enemy which gives the game also a lot more movement and action.
The parry is also usefull to disarm the enemies and make them lose their weapon and vulnerable to your attacks. 

The Character/Hero: 
ITS CUSTOMIZABLE! You can buy or earn outfits and accessories but also customize your character in the editor, for example change the eye color and iris or just the hair and a friggin lot of sliders for like every part of the head/face. 
There is also a fun system where u can upload a photo and the programm tries to recreate the shape of the person in the foto. 

Well now to the better part for probably the most people:
Each character has different talents and skills and you can unlock different version of the talents which prefers the most to you. 
The game also has a glyph system which upgrades when you level up in the game so you can put more glyphs in the slots, and make the combat even more unique!



The Map:
When you start a game, you have a bit of time to chose where you want to start your jorney and everytime the map offers different regions. 
After you started your jorney you can find several things typical for Battle Royal: Lootchests, Quests, shops and resurrection spots. 

But the world also offers activateable items for example fruits you can eat so your defense is stronger, 
or no one can hear your steps for a short time so u can be extra stealthy!



Over all the game offers a lot of mechanics and there are a lot to take in. 
Some people mentioned server problems, which didnt happen to me till now, so I guess they fixed it. 
The developer also have a Discord where you can open a ticket or submit ideas for the game.
Till now for me there is nothing negative. 
There may only be 2 modes till now but I guess more will come due to the fact that they did a survey and ask for what they should improve or do more in the future!
So for a player who doesnt play BR its quiet shocking how much fun this game makes!"
8936,my waifu vs you waifu. melee only. 10/10
8937,great game
8938,nice gameplay
8939,Nani?!
8940,It's fun playing a BR that isn't just PepegaAim
8941,This game is amazing! Its such a fresh take on battle royale and the customization is insane too. I cannot wait for future content and more characters!
8942,"Gameplay is satisfying and it feels like an unique take on the BR genre. There's still issues with some glitchy movement and some overtuned weapons/heroes, but if the dev team keeps up the good work i believe the game could be great."
8943,cool game.

8958,"Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you

Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head I miss you, I miss you"
8959,no doubt
8960,"Im loving this game's style. But it has yet to become a more mature, smooth experience.
The most deal breaking aspect of this game are the weak servers. They have a lot of ping fluctuations and can easily get you killed with one little spike. With that in mind the servers have to be improved for this game to be truly playable to all of its community."
8961,it is fun
8962,"This game is a scam: Naraka tries to cheat the player into thinking he/she is playing ordinary Battle Royale matches, while in reality the player is playing against bots. The bots even have names to mimick players, The whole affair is outrageous, and is only implemented to make the player play past the 2 hours limit Steam puts on refund requests."
8963,my left click spoiled =((((
8964,good game
8965,very fun and addictive
8966,This game is ruined by all the chinese people playing with VPN in EU and NA

High skill ceiling, fun combat"
8971,yes
8972,Great!
8973,"good but i always lag ping
good game"
8974,One of fav games beside PUBG..Looking forward for more maps incoming..keep improvement..GG !!!
8975,bit lag but ok
8976,"This game is by far one of the worse games I ever played. I don't want to play with people from Asia and the EU which is the reason I play on NA server because I'm actually from there. The lag, the fighting, the random off que weapon prompts is annoying. The damage output is inconsistent, The characters aren't balanced. The game modes are terrible. Solo mode is just full of players that hide. The Trios mode has a free respawn counter that makes no sense. If you die you should stay dead unless you get revived from an actual teammate. The have weapons in the game that no one uses, like the pistol because its straight garbage. The ballista's located throughout the map is trash why even add this in the game when the main focus is melee combat. melee combat is what sets this apart from other BR games, so why add a big ballista that does an enormous amount of damage. The counter hit is trash and inconsistent, why it does so much damage makes no sense. all you have to do is stand still counter hit and you win. The counter hit knocks weapons out the other players hands completely. what sense does that make. if your unarmed you cant counter hit a person that has a weapon, but yet your character makes a counter hit movement but it doesn't work. Viper Ning sucks even though she is the face character of the game. The only characters that are worth a damn is The Monk that turns into the Deity, Yoto Hime, The healer, and Madara. The rest of the characters are sub par at best according to the damage potential and prompt abilities. The grappling hook should not have auto aim. It ruins the games. You will be spam grappled to the ground. It's alot of fun repeatedly getting tagged by a grappling hook you cant get away from because all they have to do is aim it in your general location and bam they snag you, no escape. Overall I hate this game and wish I can get a refund for the dumpster fire of a game that I had faith in when first announced."
8977,nice
8978,its just bad
8979,"Nice and fun game overall

The combat works as stated below
Light attacks>parry
Parry>Focus attacks
Focus attacks>Light attacks

Different kind of BR game with its own set of unique features
Examples
-You will still have 0 armor if you pick up the armor of the enemy you just killed
-Mostly Melee rather than ranged

Pros
-Quite satisfying if you manage to land a parry
-Skins are really nice even if they are of Epic tier
-Grappling really makes movement easier
-Each set of Weapon has its own unique combo
-Bunny ears on Matari 

Cons
-Each match usually has a lagger whereby their attacks register and my attacks dont
-Most characters come with overloaded kits such Yote Hime(CC on her side skill, Damage resistant while using her ult and teleportation all in one kit) or Tianhai (when in doubt just press V and turn into a gigantic Demon and spam grab your enemy giving them little or no chance to escape you)
-Kinda not optimized with the frames stutter and costant fps drop during the lobby and in fights( Mind you im using RTX 3070ti and still getting fps drops to 62fps in the lobby and in fights)
-get rid of peope who switch servers just for the ping advantage (frustrating af to deal with)

All in all, its a very innovative and fun game with many different weapons with its set of combos.Just implement something which restricts players with a certain amount of ping to enter the game lobby so it doesnt ruin the fun for others"
8980,yes
8981,"Great game from the customization options (albeit they would be perfect if you could change the color of the beards) to the combat. It feels smooth and oddly enough, the game looks like a really good last gen console game when the graphics settings are turned all the way down. Would definitely recommend downloading and playing on an SSD (which it recommends) but the gameplay is still solid playing on an HDD (which is how I have to play it). I will definitely be sinking many more hours into this battle royale."
8982,"Good but needs dedicated OCE servers, not just nodes from time to time as 100 ping is unplayable"
8983,"nice game, need fast pace for combo"
8984,I spent a shitload of money but I think of it of giving money to my relatives in China.
8985,yes
8986,This game is really awesome . Don't really like battle royal type of games but don't let that fool ya on this one .  really enjoyed it
8987,"well this game is nice, i like the art style and all stuff. Gameplay is fun but hard. But its so laggy and eat up almost all of my gpu and im using rtx3060 with the lowest setting in the game...."
8988,THE BR Gameplay was really good.
8989,i like skins
8990,sekiro online
8991,good game
8992,Its a different take on the battle royal more melee focused which makes it more fun for me.
8993,Cool concept but the game is terrible. Combat is almost completely random. I can clearly parry a blue attack but get hit anyway. Wish I would have refunded while I could.
8994,"First 3 hours or so didn't feel too good , but after it clicked it's been a blast!
Has surprising depth to the combat and movement."
8995,fortnite 2 is a good game
8996,"Needs region lock. Love missing a parry cause opponent has 500 ping

Remove bots, no one wants to fight them yet they plague every lobby"

9012,2.5 frames per second
9013,"Really love the game. Movement and controls are fluid. Combat is unique. It truly stands out from the rest of the BR games.

Biggest downside and may end up killing the game for me: It really needs region locked matchmaking. People playing in the wrong region to abuse high ping is actually a frustrating issue that I run into over and over again. My hits don't register against them, I can't counter their attacks, I literally just stand there and get wailed on as someone rubber bands around on my screen and beats the s*** out of me. 

Aside from that really great game. Boobas. Great physics, pretty, good combat."
9014,I highly enjoy the combat and skill cap for this game so far
9015,"Until they get a handle of all the Chinese cheaters and VPN users, this game will die as quick as it succeeded."
9016,gg
9017,好游戏，能玩很久的
9018,nice game
9019,"Great game, but uninstalled due to majority of games ruined by server hopping players and boosters from Asia. 

Game needs a maximum ping restriction to play on servers otherwise will remain unplayable. Adding region locking will not fix the problem due to VPN.

As much as it is nice to see them briefly address this as an issue in a recent q and a, the game in its current state is borderline unplayable at times."
9020,"awsome

9021,Fun and Addicting
9022,"every system in this gam efor me its very good, ive been waiting for this kindda game for a long time, and it was just like wha i expect it was. every character is costumisible too, and all the cosmetic is doo sick. litterally love it."
9023,"chw3dx6j8d cod code
"
9024,"So far SO FUN! I am still noobish, but learning how it all works. The early matchmaking does a good job of starting you off on a sliding scale; so you aren't served to experienced players on a silver platter, to be gobbled up. You get your ninja legs in bot lobbies, and soon after you start to feel like ninja royalty...it gets real.  Real players and real skill.  Look out. You may feel like you had too much fun! But that's OK. No other game does properly, what this one does. Fast paced, ninja style Battle Royale Combat! YEAH! Go'on an' GET IT!"
9025,:) nice
9026,Very interesting and fun battle royale that doesn't over emphasize the concept that it is one. Would highly reccomend.
9027,"21 hours played in 36 hours fuckin stupid addictive game makes you feel good and frustrated in the same time like league of legends.
dont buy this if you love your sleep time
thumbs up cuz there's affection system for your gaybros"
9028,Pretty fun. Even better if you have a premade team of 3.
9029,"Very fun, unique, game.

No performance/lag issues here. Settings on low helps with FPS (I maintain 140-150fps on low settings with a 1080 and a Ryzen 5 3600x).

If you like fighting games, this if for you. If you like BR's, this is for you.
First few games are only bots to help you get acquainted with the combat. 

I recommend looking up a movement video and a combo video on youtube and practicing in the training area before hopping into games - you'll body people in the lower ranks with just an hour of dedicated practice and have a lot more fun."
9030,"I really like this game idk what else to say, it's fun"
9031,Tempted to give it a bad review beacause there's no emote that makes Yoto Hime sit on your face but I guess it's alright.
9032,"Masterpiece, little pricey doe, worth it"
9033,good
9034,grappling people big fun also tits
9035,"This is the best battle royale game I have ever played.

Pro:

-each melee weapon has its own combo
-many ways to kill an opponent
-unique combat mechanism(basic beats parry, parry beats charged, and charged beats basic, master this and you can get many kills)
-successfully parry can make enemy drop their weapon on the ground
-its hard to cheat since aimbot is useless cuz of the combat mechanism,
maybe theres other cheats but I believe its harder to cheat in this game compare to other battle royale games
-not pay to win,
the micro transaction is to buy pretty outfit and weapon skins and I think thats reasonable,
if you are stingy, you still can win the game with default outfits
-everyone can be a spiderman.
I think this what makes this game feels superior compare to any battle royale game. The grappling hook feels so smooth to travel into any buildings.

Con:

-theres only 3 mode which are solo, trio and deathmatch,
well its like other battle royale games but I think its really cool if the dev can add 4squad and 5squad mode hahah


I am sorry theres only one con I can give at the moment
This game deserves a good rating so I give 9/10
For people who is complaining why the game is not free, please understand that not all good games should be free, both paid games and free games have their own advantage and we should understand that. If you cant buy it, then dont buy. Video games are not essential. Its a luxury and people should only buy when they can afford it

"
9036,"Not worth purchasing this game, it has alot of free to play mechanics, really buggy, you can have NASA's internet speed and this game will still lag, recommend waiting for this to go free to play. also battle pass does not come with the purchase of the game."
9037,"really enjoy the game, well worth the 20$, all ive played since launch. if you decide to get the game, enter this referral code when you first sign up (only one chance to use a code) chwfet4kk4"
9038,yes
9039,"lots of fun
"
9040,"Quand Sekiro (Nioh) et Apex Legends on un bébé ça donne Naraka Bladepoint , un bon Br qui change de tous c est Br shooter cancer est remplie de cheaters , un jeux pas facile a prendre en main surtout quand on monte dans le classé spamé c est attaque ne marche pas et demande une certaine dextérité , en espérant que le jeux évolue sur de bonne voie et feront un petit équilibrage sur les héros (surtout prendre 3 fois le même perso cancer dans les games)"
9041,Amazing battle royale. Worth 20$
9042,"A very unique battle royale compared to the others, would rather say it's a mix between Nioh, Apex Legends and Sekiro. It's a very technical game as it requires players to master their combos, parrying, dodging and managing their abilities. As your account level grows, the game offers you talent slots to give you a small effect boosts of your choices. The game offers a small composition of heroes (at least for now) just like in Apex, you can either play as a healing hero, a buddhist monk, a fire monk, a sandstorm manipulator, a lady that goes invisible or a hero that can stun every hero in a certain radius for a good amount of time.

The game revolves around a lot of parkour and grappling around, there's no limit of what your character can climb, and without the fall damage in this game, it is really fun to dive from high buildings.

You battle enemies in 3 ways; melee weapons, ranged weapons and unique special abilities. Mainly you play with melee weapons because if you don't have any when an enemy gets personal with you, you won't make it out alive. The arsenal has a lot to offer; katana, chinese long swords, two handed swords, staves, daggers and a very rare weapon that I've only seen two times in my 50+ games, some sort of melee shredder. The ranged weapons' arsenal a lot to offer; full auto crossbows, bows, muskets, canons, missile launcher (very rare to find), a pistol-shotgun hybrid and a rare flame thrower.

The battle pass system can be compared to Fortnite; it has a free pass and another that you have to pay for. It is a bit greedier since you can only get Gold (equivalent of V-Bucks) by either paying with currency or leveling up your Advanced battle pass, which you should pay through Gold. And even if you pay the pass and get all the Gold out of it, you won't be able to afford the next pass, you'll be missing a small amount of it, which you have to pay for compensation for the next pass.

Even if the game is a bit greedier, I've still managed to get 3 Legendary skins and one Crimson skin (which is even more rare than a legendary skin) out of the immortal treasures that you can get for free by playing the game."
9043,"So far it's been a fun game. Been playing with friends. We made an orc clan with the character customization and have been playing the last few days. 

Some tips:
1. First few matches are gonna be bot matches to ease you in. Don't fret it gets harder quicker. 
2. Bloodlust mode for getting better quicker and learning how to fight pvp.
3. Collect all the doramu's? (whatever they are called) during pre match 3's. It will give bonus loot win or loose to whole lobby if lobby finds them all. (including silk).
4. Try to do the cultivation quests for each character or at least the one you use. It will unlock new moves."
9044,"Another style of a Battle Royale, highly recommended for people who like narcotics and who like the old fighting style"
9045,"Insanly fun, very competitve and I like that."
9046,"solid game, worth the money

- amazing graphics, designs, and environment
- easy to learn, extremely high skill ceiling combat
- highly customizable cosmetics"
9047,"Basically Sekiro but fortnite edition. Honestly one of the better battle royale games ive played. There is a P2W feature, but its more for cosmetics than for anything else. I enjoy the combat system especially with the introduction of the grappling hook and the idea of glyphs, talents, and skill sets to change the way to play. The character customization is absolutely phenomenal, the fact that the devs had handsome squidward in one of the reveal trailers is only proof of that. I have no problem with the game mechanics but the UI needs to be worked on. Major complaint I have is the fact that there is no region lock, meaning that I can play against people from Asian servers with ridiculously high ping and not even be able to touch them which can be very frustrating. Its even worse on ranked where you play against sweaties.  there definitely needs to be weapon and hero balancing, but from im seeing they have already started to work on it. While it does have its flaws, this game is definitely worth its cost and is a fresh take to the battle royale genre.

Overall:
+interesting heroes
+unique skill sets 
+character customization
+combat system

- UI
- no regionlock
- ranked is very sweaty (not for casual players)
- need for weapon/hero balancing"
9048,mantab!!
9049,"great fights, pretty easy to pick up"
9050,The game is really nice and fun to play.

Really hard"
9055,"This Game is fun! The Movement is insanely smooth and combat system has a high skill cap, i like it! If you want to play the game, you can use my code: ch4ky4crm8"

9059,Fantastic
9060,great game (:
9061,"Being used to other BR's such as APEX/COD.. this BR hits differently than others do. 
There can be some idle time of looting and walking around but there are other in-game activities to do-
such as bounties to get into fights sooner. I'd say the game is decently optimized fighting is pretty smooth,
there parkour and movement mechanics take a minute to get used to. I will say that the complexity level that comes within the game is a bit rough but learn-able and may deter casual players.
I see a lot of reviews/youtube videos of the game having bots i can admit there has been maybe 1-2 games that were unranked i played that confirmed that but after a few games i was matched with real players all the time.
Other than that the game is pretty well developed with a lot of action and i'd give it an 8/10.

Pros:
Graphically beautiful
Intricate movement system
Weapons seemed to be balanced (if not devs work on it)
PvP is great when having engagements.
NO CASH SHOP P2P SYSTEM 
  
Cons:
Some walking around idle time.
May seem like a lot first getting into it with there glyph system page.
Netcode with players during fights (haven't experienced this too much but seems like devs are aware and fixing it)
"
9062,"Games fun.
There is depth to it like mordhau and chiv but not at all the same game.
BR is interesting to see for this type of game but it fits.
Yoto hime is a bit over tuned I feel for getting gold focus in her ult but other than that all of the chars are in line either doing dmg or not taking dmg for an ult, you either excel at one or the other. The ranged weapons exist but are easy to counter by just attacking and you'll destroy the projectiles.
I've had a lot more fun than I thought I would and I highly recommend this game for 20$!

Edit 9/7/2022 Positive review changed to Negative

You know what? Fuck the Chinese I'm sick and tired of this bullshit I'd rather play league of legends where every teammate is tyler 1 want to be that constantly throw matches and tilt.

9071,"Good game. 
Just buy, dont ask."
9072,Great first impression
9073,good game 20 hours
9074,Its good and fun but doesn't have very good servers. I average 20-30 ping in other games and average 75-100 in this game. Also the Great sword makes me want to die.
9075,"This game has everything you want as a weeb, huge boobies, cute characters and feeling like you are playing a Attack on Titan game. It is currently blowing up in playerbase (Hitting 110k payers in the last 24hrs) and with what I have heard is that this game will be releasing on console soon. As only having 5 hours on the game, there is a huge learning curve to the game. lastly, go get it while you can :)."
9076,"For an hour fun a day this game suits my preferences. Unfortunately there is only a recommend yes or no ... but a maybe or something else between would be my true rating.

First of all, I think this game suits more a F2P Model with its pretty expensive Battlepass and Hero System.
20 Bucks for the base game is where you can say ""I got many games with more for the money"" ... especially as you have to play free almost everything anyways and you have Items you wont get without Battle Pass. 

This is not the very best Battle Royale you will play, but its a very solid one, with a unique gameplay. The fighting system is, for me at least, not the easiest. To master it, it might take some time. 

You will have Bots in your first matches, but thats okay, as this allows you to get into the game. 

Until now I experienced imbalances on characters. Tianhai is pretty overpowered in his ultimate. Also the firecannon or rapid fire crossbow can be really painful and are better then other weapons. Although the firecannon is a unique weapon which you mostly find in special chests.

9077,Need to see more butt
9078,needs region lock
9079,"cool
"
9080,Finally a BR that does things a little different. It is hard but super fun once you get into it. And it is rather cheap too. So why not give it a try? ^^
9081,"Quite the format for a BR game, something a bit different from all the others because of the sword melee fighting."
9082,good
9083,"This is the greatest game ever, its worth the $20, my friend told me about it and My first thought was no, but I got it and is the best purchase I've had in a while."
9084,HELL YEAH!
9085,"So far the game has been really fun the only things to be careful of is that the skill gap can get crazy once you get to higher ranks maybe im just trash but some people are crazy good at this game, the heros are really fun to use and the weapons are always being reworked to balance things out overall if you have a group of friends you can destroy whole lobbies its a very unique battle royale i recommend buying it :D"
9086,I don't know why but I like it.
9087,<3
9088,server is super bad will not give any good review until dev fixed
9089,when you counter your opponent they drop their weapon. If your fast enough you can steal it and the proceed to beat them with it. 10/10
9090,"Very well made game, once you get pass the Micro-transactions and stun-lock spam from spears and a few of the other weapons."
9091,"Fun combat, nice graphics and a variety of unlockables just through playing the game and not paying."
9092,"jiggly boobs + thicc sword = best combo

edit: game dead. Mainly China players"
9093,Love the game its really fun! Its worth the cost also.
9094,"Great and amazing game , i seriously love it and will continue playing it , 
But i will put a negative for now ONLY BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING REGION BLOCKED SERVERS !!!
What in the actual fuck is that ??? why do i need to play with 150 ping on CHINESE OR NA servers in a game where REACTIONS MATTERS ???!!!! 
Like that makes no sense  to me , i love this game , but please they need to do something about it , its straight up disgusting i couldn't recommend the game to anyone with this disgusting disadventage you put yourself into in 60% of your matches ,
Anyways , i love your game , but what is this retarded decision ?

edit : Didn't talk about the DISGUSTING RATE OF 0.3% to get a RED QUALITY cosmetic item in this game , You do have a pity after 100 lootboxes you HARDLY GET since at some point you won't get lootboxes at all , like there is just no way to get some more , but then , no more pities , you could spend 500 euros and never even get one , even in GACHAS you don't have such a low droprate."
9095,good
9096,"in my opinion the game gave me a new concept of battle royal i liked it with the melee weapons and combos etc. and every hero has his own skills you can use for combos..

you can use my code: chxpnfcrqx to download the game from the game website: https://www.narakathegame.com/

Thank you and have fun <3"
9097,nice tits
9098,"TL;DR Easily worth 20$. If you're on the fence cuz of negative reviews, its just people salty about bots/cosmetics. Do yourself a favor and get into this game. You wont regret it 

I hesitated buying this game because of mixed reviews, and at first glance this game looks like another chinese money grab game.

Im making this review to tell you if youre on the fence, its worth it. Once you start picking up the combat things start clicking and you discover more mechanics as you play consistently. Map design is top notch, graphics are pretty good, it has some wonky hit reg sometimes and some bugs but nothing that wont be fixed over time.

The dev team seems to really listen to the feedback they're getting from players which is another plus. Excited to see where this game goes. 

"
9099,Absolutely worth it! I'd give 9/10. It's a completely a different type of BR. I'm addicted :D
9100,Interesting.
9101,yes
9102,if you like hack and slash this is the BR for you
9103," Great game, lots of potential for a game that just launched. The developers are very responsitive to community feedback willing to improve fast any major problems.

Broken weapon? They nerfed it right away. Lack of servers? They worked to add more. Making a new character? Asks for the community what they want.

The game has some high skill demand, since it's very competitive if you playing ranked matches, but the Quick play and Blood arena are very fun for casual play. 

Stunning graphics, gorgeous characters with full customization. Runs way smoother than some other demanding games like Black Desert Online, looking as good or better. It feels a lot like Vindictus, Dinasty Warriors, Onimusha. Devil May Cry as well.

If you don't like ""hack & slash"" games, that are not buttom mash friendly (you need to work on your combos and attacks bcs they can get parry or blocked, then that's not the game for you. But I'd say, either give it a try or watch some gameplays before listening to bad reviews. Game is NOT perfect, but the developers are quickly working on it so it will most likely not take long till it gets polished.

You can complain aboutsome aspects of the ranked matches, but with more players joining as this gets more popular and balance releases, I don't see a problem in the long term atm."
9104,"Simple to pick up, hard to master. Fun for the whole family."

9106,FIxed
9107,"Edit: at 20 sept 2021
[This game is infected with a ton of cheaters (I encounter some top world player who use cheat) , 
wall hack that u can be seen and get ambush
Luck hack that make cheaters get legendary item at first 1 minute after start game
auto parry that make cheaters nearly win all most of match
motion hack that make cheaters faster than you 
Energy hack that make infinite energy
and other fantasy hack that make cheaters like god (this cheat is easily to ban so in the higher rank I not see it but above examples are harder to detect) 
Report system is bad , you must known ID-Number for the cheater that you report
and how to known that is TYPE THAT PLAYERNAME TO FIND with the game that allow you to use ANY LANGUAGE to create character name]


This game is good. All weapons , characters are fun to play.

but some players in the game ruin the concept of it.

this is my first battle royal game so I dont know that it a common problem of this style or not
In game We have
  1-1 battle royal match that turn into 2(or 3 4) vs 1 battle match cause they start game with friend 
        this game main damage is form melee combo so if you get swarm you must be die
  3-3 team battle royal match , same problem at 1-1 , I have experience fight with 6-3 or 9-3 in mostly game
  Deathmatch , this mode is funny I have nothing to complain about it

I recommend this game graphic , gameplay , character model is really good"
9108,ok lah
9109,"holy shit please make the training mode not require internet connection, I cant test things out unless my connection is good and it is really annoying. Please do something like how dota 2 did where their demo mode doesn't care if you disconnected"
9110,i love it to the core of my being!!!
9111,wadadad
9112,best game ever
9113,"Will change it to positive when the game does something about these damn Chinese players playing in EU servers, lagging everywhere, unable to register hits to them but they can spam you down. 
  Go to you own damn server ffs...."
9114,If  u like brutal or BR just play this game.
9115,Good game... Good physics..... One more point please bring more latex skins for Viper Ning and Yoto Hime. Yoto hime bikini skin tooo.....
9116,GOOD GAME
9117,Great game but we need an OCE server.
9118,
9119,"The worst dragon air i ever seen in my life (one shoot you ) and of course the most level you have the better starter stats you have, no chance for the begginners players to win .Not recommanded !"
9120,"Game has some serious problems with optimalization ( even on rtx2070 with latest drivers and dlss on, im sometimes having microstuttering during fights). Framerate in bigger cities with more players is terrible. You can often meet players that are terribly lagging, which is giving them advantage in combat. First two hours are against bots only which is funny, because after 2 hours you cant refund your money. Also, this game has the most agressive and greedy cash shop ive seen so far, 90% of cosmetics you cant unlock with ingame currency, the game is forcing you to spend money on every corner. If you really want to test this game out, set time on your phone ujnder 2 hours and refund it, you will thank me."
9121,不推荐 怕你做噩梦被震刀
9122,10/10 good game
9123,Keep asia players on asia servers... watching someone red bar during a fight is mad annoying. Can't recommend until a better system is in place to deal with high ping players.
9124,"The gameplay is fun BUT. Constant disconnects during Early/Mid/Late game are infuriating. When you are having a fight and suddenly everyone freezes and you just have to sit or run around there getting killed on the enemys screen. When you reconnect you are happy to see that you are spectating your killer/ or if you get left outside the zone IS absolutely ass. 

Would recommend but the network is absolute trash with multiple Disconnects during matches or people are Ddossing/Lag switching to make it happen"
9125,fuckin amazing
9126,If you're looking for a game where your mechanical skill matters then this ain't it. 0 Skill involved in fights. 2/10 game because booba.
9127,"Great combat mechanics specially melee!, this game kind of reminds me of Dinasty warriors (Used to play as a kid so not 100% accurate) but PvP."

9132,"At first i loved it, but... 

you can't release a game where one can't make a mistake in certain situations and the game won't respond to your input or does what it wants. Trying to climb walls 3 times before you finally manage to get up while a group is behind you, getting stunlock with full stamina but can't evade or counter actions, broken parry system where you either cant pinpoint the exact time when to or you get parried and drop your weapon. Stuns shouldn't be allowed at all. When did Game-companys think it was a good idea to take control of the player, i will never understand.

Skins and mechanics look nice tho, this is more a PUBG kind of type where there will be better ones in the future. This ones a predecessor to something cool.

Edit: Also only Solo and Trio queues"
9133,my only complaint is my ping but its because of where i live.. overall its a great game
9134,"Overall, I love this game, it has a complex movement and fighting mechanism. It's super fun with different enough characters and the developers are updating the game regularly. They're starting an e-sports league with 100k prize money as well. I definitely think this game is very easy to pick up, fun enough to keep on playing game after game without getting bored. And a battle royal with melee weapons is really fun, I have to say it does feel more engaging.

Now to the cons. 

1- My main problem is the movement sometimes feel a bit clunky especially while climbing. Some structures can get hard to climb and I saw big streamers of the game struggle with it sometimes as well, but general feel of the movement is amazing especially if you know some tips and tricks.

2- I don't like the fact that this is a paid game and not free DESPITE the fact that there are paid only items like skins, loading icons etc. I mind you, they are paid only and they're not even in the lootboxes or the Battle Pass. This feels a bit greedy on their part. If they were in the lootboxes I'd be fine with it but making them paid only is a bit weird considering they're base skins and not event skins. They should make everything available on lootboxes in my opinion.

3- There are talents that players can get with their levels like increased grappling hook speed, increased cooldown on Ultimate, increased luck for rare items from drops. Even though these are not game changing they do effect the player's gameplay. So whenyou're level 10 and you're in a game with a 50 level player, they will have more of an advantage over you. Does this effect the game massively? I don't think so, but I do think it is an unnecessary addition to a Battle Royale. 
It reminds me of the early days of Rune Pages in League of Legends, you had to pay to get runes  but now they're available to everyone from the beginning to level the ground.  It is an unnecessary advantage that people get, considering 50 lvl people will already have more experience with the game. 

4- Characters also get variations to their skills more you level them up, is this a huge problem? Again, not really. You have to level your characters to get sometimes better variations of the skills. I honestly think some are better than the basic versions.


TLDR : Game has problems, by giving people the incentive to play more to unlock better skills, better talents it ends up as PLAY TO WIN instead of PAY TO WIN. I think this is a bigger issue than the paid only cosmetics that are not in the lootboxes, that's about cosmetics. Everyone should have access to all of the characters' skills and player's skill tree in a Battle Royal when the game isn't even free. Again, I don't think this effects the actual game in a huge way but it does give more of an unnecessary advantage to the players who get to play more often which I think is unfair."
9135,"Still a BR, but definitely my favorite."
9136,So satisfying when you kill someone @-)

9148,"I like it, so far its really fun, runs smooth for me which is not always easy to do, I have potato net. I'd recommend, if you like battle royal style. Graphics are nice, not toxic in chats, bloodbath is fun too."
9149,"Game is overall amazing, really nice concept, it has some bugs (which game doesn't though, but nothing deal breaking). Price is on the point, just where it should be. Gameplay is really nice, at first you have intro to the game to get the ropes of how it works, and the controls, and after that you proceed to play with other players.

The reason why I'm not recommending this game at this point is only because of one skill, or should I say game setting, which is ""Automatic player target grapple"", which auto aim on player the grapple and you can get close to it.
Now you're wondering ""well it's just one skill, gtfo noob"" and I'd agree but, that skill can be spammed as long as you have grapples in your inventory, so no CD on it, it stuns you when you get grappled so time to press dodge and avoid getting hit is really minor, and I'm not gonna mention chain grappling and getting killed just by spamming that skill.
If and when they remove this ""feature"" from the game, and add  CD on grappling to the players, then the game will be really great to have and play.
Until this is resolved, I can't really recommend getting this game as you'll get frustrated when you get killed like this. 

P.S. Yes you can use it too and abuse the hell out of it, but this isn't really how the game should be played.

9150,Amazing game.
9151,Bad Game
9152,the game is super awesome with the melee attacks and super barkour moves you can do it is super fun but it got some bugs that need to be handled like your weapon will switch own its own in the fights but overall the game is super fun i encourage everyone to try it.
9153,"Surprisingly solid battle royale that manages to carve a position for itself with it's great movement and moment-to-moment combat. The biggest cons are the microtransactions, which thankfully are only cosmetic and the deceptive lobbies full of bots for the 1st 2-hours (i.e. the amount of time required to forfeit steam return policy)."
9154,"To be frank, I think this game is a great game for people who have friends who are willing to play. This seems like a really fun game to play with friends since teamwork is actually impactful for trio queuing.

That being said, I don't recommend the game because the solo experience is rather boring. The gameplay loop is VERY similar each game, and this makes it feel like I did the same things in two different games, which should not be the case for any game (CONS section for explanation).

We can start with the pros, the mehs, and then the cons.

PROS:
1. The game is beautiful. While not the most stunning game in the world in terms of textures and general graphical fidelity, they did a great job crafting a world that not only looks fantastically good, but also feels smooth and cohesive, and there are plenty of small details that make their world have a truly remarkable feel. I found myself a few times saying ""Wow, this game looks really good,"" which is not something I do often for games.

2. Mobility and controls feel really good and characters feel very fluid. Once you get used to how your character controls, especially learning animation cancelling and other neat tricks, you really get a feel for how fluid your character actually is. Despite the fact that there is a LOT of mobility baked in, it also isn't so much mobility that it's overly frustrating, and there's a definitive tradeoff for managing mobility and damage.

3. Characters and abilities are diverse, clearly visible, and impactful. Playing with each character genuinely feels like you have to play a different way each time*, and good vs bad ability usage makes a big difference in how your fights play out.
*see cons

4. Teamwork is heavily rewarded because of all the complex mechanics. Syncing grapples on a target, target selection, stunlocking, covering for heals, all of these are extremely important details for teamplay and this game does a great job of keeping the teamplay identity alive.

MEH:
1. TONS OF BOTS. Playing early on in quick matches and early ranked play, there are COUNTLESS bots present within the game. They are immediately obvious even to a player who has never played the game before. I'm not sure if there's anything that's going to be done about them, but they are rampant currently and it makes the game feel hollow.

2. The UI could be a little better. It wasn't immediately obvious to me the first time playing that I ran out of grapples until I tried to use one and didn't have any. If I had gotten into a fight at that moment I would have been at a significant disadvantage. How many grapples you have IS visible in your UI, it's just not immediately obvious and I think the UI could do with highlighting certain things better. Also, the inventory system in general feels very clunky when trying to switch glyphs or weapons.

3. General mechanics are VERY difficult to learn. The skill floor for this game is really high, there's a lot to learn, and your character is going to feel clunky for a while until you really learn the controls. Timings for parrying/counterattacking are tight, and unless you have really good reaction times, are not always reliable. This can be a PRO for some people who enjoy challenging mechanics.

CONS:
1. Weapon balance. For something so important, they aren't balanced at all. Spears in particular are EXTREMELY overpowered due to their insane mobility and reach when combined with grappling and doesn't have any sort of damage tradeoff. This makes my earlier PRO of each character feeling unique feel a lot more like a MEH than a PRO. Since what weapon you use generally dictates what kind of fighting style you take, having some weapons just be MUCH stronger than others railroads every character you choose to take to that style. It feels awful. It feels so awful and bland and boring that it had the heaviest influence over my negative review.

2. Along the same lines as CON 1, grappling to initiate fights is very powerful and fight defining. You can get a significant health lead by landing a grapple. Keep in mind this is not even hard to do since grapples auto-lock. Grappling feels too impactful for fights instead of their more intended usage of travel, which grapples do a great job of.

To be completely fair, I do NOT think this is a bad game. They could easily fix the CONS and make this game a LOT better in my eyes. The only reason I do not recommend it is because the solo experience is not good enough on its own. If a game requires friends in order to make the gameplay loop bearable, then the game has failed already."
9155,Highly recommend
9156,something new. love the concept.
9157,.
9158,like
9159,"Hackers, ping abusers, unbalanced weapons, braindead stagger-meta ,clunky mechanic,terrible terrain,quick match mmr for the rank mode, not to mention 50% players you met have a chinese name, which mean game so dead in worldwide.All this game have is a fancy graphic but with all the shutter i have to toned down to a ps2 game graphic (i run this garbage on a rtx 3070).Top 100 leaderboards SEA, but i think im just gonna stop here,not gonna fight my ass off to top 5 just for 8 point then take away 14 point if im stop at top 30"
9160,love it! one of the best battle royale games that i played so far !
9161,made for weebs
9162,Interesting game. I look forward to playing it more.
9163,Lối chơi khá hay
9164,好玩
9165,"good game, simple."
9166,"Wins Battle Royale, Didn't Use gun. 10/10"
9167,Bought this game because I saw squidward. Many Waifus were made. I am now a badass Bella Poarch.
9168,"Servers are getting worse each updates.
"
9169,really creative BR
9170,"I lost everything, I had so much during the last open beta and now it's all gone.  Don't get this game because it will wipe all you have after major updates"
9171,"Get hit with a grapple hook and stunned while they close in.
Continuously be unable to dodge and/or get one shot as your getting hit on the ground.
Obviously broken abilities and characters. 
Wall climbing is a nightmare."
9172,"Really fun take on the BR genre. The combat flows, the characters are interesting, the grind isn't bad, the microtransactions are just cosmetics, and the graphics are actually pretty decent.

But the devs aren't region locking the game, and the chinese are all over NA servers using lag to their advantage. It's quite difficult as this is a melee oriented game, and the devs are intentionally screwing NA players. So enjoy this for the 2 or 3 weeks NA players will deal with this before abandoning it entirely, always happens with games like this when devs wont do what they know they need to do."
9173,"Premise is misleading ""warriors gather to xyz island to obtain the power of 2 dead gods""

all we do is grind coin like crazy so our matari got that sexy ass egyptian skin that shows both of her thigh. 5/7"
9174,Good
9175,Fun melee based battle royale. Changes up the standard BR format by a lot and adds a refreshing feel to the genre
9176,A very refreshing BR that has the usual BR thingies but with good combat~
9177,Game hay
9178,i like it alot
9179,ncie
9180,yes
9181,"Hands down the best game I've played in a long time. Optimization is unreal. The devs are top notch & so is the community. The content, insane amount of detail, nothing else like it. 10/10."
9182,a
9183,its alright.
9184,nice game
9185,"Pros:
The combination of Battle Royale + Action is not very common.
Sexy girls and outfits.
It is easy to start.

Cons:
Greedy in-game purchases as a 20-dollar game.
High spec requirement but the graphic is just normal.
The action system is way simple, if you regard this as an ACT game.
"
9186,good
9187,Very nice boobs but everything else is ass
9188,amazing game if you take the time to learn it.
9189,"Nice game, i really like this game but sometimes my grappel stuck on building and can move.

overall this very good game, i hope next update, can bring new hero and weapon"
9190,"Game is fun, Cant Complain. Combat is Diverse and Competitive. Learning Curve isn't unmanageable for those who haven't played similar games. If playing alone Trios might be a bit meh sometimes due to people not knowing what to do at times, But it is very Doable with competent people. All In all A game I see myself playing Consistently for a long while."
9191,Very nice game :D
9192,EZ
9193,The combat is great and sits in my top 3 favourite BR's. The character customisation is amazing for a BR. I wish the game wasn't B2P so that more of my friends would jump on but I'm glad I bought the game. Def do recommend
9194,gabe likes
9195,This game has a lot of Chinese players in Na servers just killing everyone and not having a good time they need to fix this now because it literally no fun when u just get spawned killed by a random Chinese player going try hard when u want to learn the game
9196,"Cute Anime Girl battle royale? What more could you possibly ask for? This game has a pretty killer learning curve, but assuming you learn how to combo and parry, you will basically annihilate everyone. I've played a lot of BR's lately and this is something fresh and new, the emphasis on movement and stealth is interesting and honestly a first for me in this genre. I honestly can't rate this game enough, Play it, if not for the BR do it for the anime girls ^^"
9197,"Expected a martial arts game to be smooth and fun but it is Clunky as hell.
Refunded."
9198,"Super cool! I'm normally not into battle royale at all, but this is the twist I needed. 
Huge fan of the customization too. The business model makes me feel like the game is going to be able to keep pumping out content, so far it's all cosmetic as well."
9199,Game is sick.
9200,"This is not the one. At least, not for me. I didn't even finish the tutorial and I could tell I was going to hate trying to actually fight people with these controls."
9201,Well I played 12 hours straight when it came out. It's a really good game. Don't listen to the haters. Watch videos or streams first before deciding
9202,FUN :)
9203,"Havent played much but so far it's great! Love the close combat and the movement feels amazing, if you don't have it downloaded on a SSD good luck, itll lag and such if not on one."
9204,g00d.
9205,great
9206,"wanted to love it, waited a long time, was telling all my friends about it initially, but after a week it feels unplayable to me. Combat is a mix between 2 set combos and a counter that triggers randomly mid combat but never when u actually press the buttons to counter????????? Fighting makes no sense and i get worse and more confused every time i play, though i've read the guides and watched tutorials

Maybe just me but controlling my character is very frustrating and i constantly lose to someone just spamming attacks while im unable to use my counter which sets off a random attack attack then another random or counter when i'm clicking a single attack button, either im bad or playing with 2-3 sec delays with 50 ping 

Getting my character to run is weird and delayed, getting them to stop running or dashing is weird and delayed, trying to use attacks while doing both is consequently impossible to time for me

There is no way to stop someone from hooking you from afar, stunning you, then spamming attacks, knocking you down, charging an attack and knocking you down again

Yes i get kills by timing a hook and spamming a combo too but this no fun

Was hoping combat would feel fluid like gunz 2 :(
"
9207,"In my last ranked game I had 2 teammates get picked off one by one.  They proceeded to talk shit to me and resurrect because it was still early in the game (when it still lets you resurrect).  Then they each went in one by one and died.  I proceeded to get shit talked as I then beat 2 teams in a row (not bots) 1 v 3.  I then won the game solo in trios.  People are assholes, this game is the shit."
9208,i like it
9209,great
9210,23 games and one win :}
9211,NOT EVEN PLAYABLE LAGGING SO BAD DONT BUY YET
9212,One of the best games!! should make it free for all :D
9213,"We started playing on August.. We came back now after a lot of months.. Devs doing a good job with content / DLC / Skins/ Battle pass.. but still they dont fix the thing that Asians coming into EU with VPN and ""smurfing"" casual players on Silver Lobbies + also they have ping advantage.. Great game, smooth but still unplayable and not fun at all, U either meet bots or Asian smurfs. I DONT RECOMMEND IT."
9214,This game was more fun than I thought it would be. Simple to get started and more to mater in the combat system. overall I'd give it an 8.5/10 for a BR.
9215,gud
9216,"Brilliant game, verrrry difficult"
9217,I suggest trying it out even if you are only slightly interested. More fun than I expected to have especially with a couple of friends to learn with.
9218,:)
9219,nice game
9220,Best battle royale made no cap.
9221,"issa good yet?

9222,Amazing. The combat is so deep and high risk high reward that it made the boring survival turned into a fighting game.
9223,Don't buy this it's full of bots
9224,I hope you have the greatest internet ever because if you don't then you're going to be capped with crazy load times that go way beyond the loading screens. GLHF 7/10

9230,fun
9231,"One of the first games of its kind where, no matter how badly I sucked and got destroyed... I still legitimately had fun. Winning combat, especially against multiple enemies at the same time, is super satisfying... The combos take time to get used to, timing is important. The weapons, surprisingly all feel unique and fun in their own way. Characters are mostly balanced(healer is a bit annoying all the time due to high health she can dish out far to fast). Honestly, its worth a shot."
9232,yes
9233,"I like everything about this game, however I would like a better way for training with friends; instead of doing a custom match. I do love the game. ^_^"
9234,"I really enjoyed the game and it's worth it
I wish if there is a mode for ranked duo
I hope in the future there will be more maps and more characters to play with
they should start enforcing region locking players ."
9235,"The game will mach you against bots for the first games to make you feel good and skilled at it but after that you get straight in with the crazy tryhards and hackers where you get one shot and you don't even know where is the enemy. 
I really wanted to like this game, I like action blade and soul like games. But this one disappointed me.

9236,很不错，超出预期了，就是服务器偶尔不太行
9237,DDOOOPPPPPEEEEE
9238,"Best Game ever! I'm kinda bored of all the shooter type Battle Royals and shooters in general, so this game is perfect. I bought the game today and already have 5h in it (still  playing at the time of writing this. 10/10 Would recommend!"
9239,Amazing best game I have bought for ages
9240,Amazing
9241,"pretty fun game , just need more heros and a bit balance , after that would be a decent and fun battle royal :)"
9242,"this game is for the people who spam their abilities faster, you're gonna win the first matches cause you're gonna play against AI-opponents as they mention on their site, but then, good luck."
9243,Fun and a bit different BR :)
9244,"love the weapons, combat & character customization"
9245,10/10
9246,Huge bewbs bro. How can you say no to this.
9247,"I played this game in two betas, before buying it. The first beta was great, the second was terrible. Why? because some players just moved faster than you, chained actions faster than you, and there was nothing you can do - you always lose. The difference was hard to see, but after some testing with a friend I could see it: if I counter just in time, he wouldn't even see the red glow happen and I'd just get hit. If he told me before attacking and I counter before he attacks, I counter and he gets hit. Crazy.
Testing against the computer in the free training room also showed that I can escape combos that are impossible against some players - those that seem to have hyper speed. same for players escaping combos that you normally can't. 
I bought the game to try and see if they fixed it, if not just refund. They did, and I had fun, even reached top 500 multiple times... until a couple of days ago, when we went back to the bad old days of super fast enemies spamming one move for easy wins. 
Don't buy it unless you know it's been fixed - it's frustrating as hell to play because now you have an even harder time noticing the difference which was already hard before, but you can still see people escaping combos they shouldn't and killing you 100-0 with combos that should be breakable."
9248,GOOD game xD
9249,fun anime girls
9250,Shroud...
9251,"Actually a pretty decent BR game, far east setting is nicely presented. Fighting is fun. You will encounter bots in the first few matches and they do not represent how you will engage/will get engaged later on by players. Bots are easy af, but the ranking systems seems to be pretty decent so I would advise to power through the few bot games and learn the ropes. You will need the experience when you fight other players."
9252,"It's honestly such a good game to play,  think of a fighting game like Soul Calibur but in a Battle Royal format. 
its great fun, the skins are amazing. and so far the community has been overall great. 
"
9253,nice
9254,great game
9255,fun sweaty game eksdee
9256,"This game is really solid. more fun with friends. 
lots a reviews on here regarding combat, worded better that i could. 
some things need balanced (im lookin at you long distance grab ult!) . but it seems like the devs are taking care of that in a decent timeframe. 
worth the 20$ entry IMO

EVERYBODY WAS KUNG FU FIGHTING!"
9257,fresh idea and the movement is nice however combat is all about who catches who first and who spams the fastest. Literally you would get stun locked until you die if the enemy catches you first. Horrible combat system. I would recommend they add some sort of stamina system/limitations to spamming but highly doubt they care to.
9258,Game still garbage and I would not recommend this to anyone.
9259,"Anyone planning to buy this, use my code chq7a8jxp7 for Poggers ingame rewards."
9260,Onek bhalo game moja paisi
9261,
9262,theres like no cooldown between counters so people just spam it the whole time
9263,"Game is fun. Would recommend to try it, but be ready to face waves of laggy chinese ""players"". That either gonna ignore each other and focus kill you or just lag out like there is no tomorrow half the time
So up to you too decide if its worth it or not."
9264,"as long as you dont have a loot crate gambling problem this game is fun.  Reminds me of a bunch of other games smushed together.  map is easily navigable with parkour and grappling hooks.  the combat is fun from button mashers to skilled.  Trios is fun without a huge need for team composition.  Worth 20 and then avoid micro transactions and it is worthwhile. mousewheel is default ping....but if you hold out you have a list of options 
"
9265,"Super high quality BR with really unique aspects that set it apart from other BRs. 10/10, couldn't recommend this game enough.

I'm going to change my review a little bit after playing more. The Desync in this game is really abysmal. If I attempt to parry an attack, half the time the parry WILL NOT register at all.. VERY frustrating to play.  If the parries register correctly, then I'm fairly happy with the game, as the review above states."
9266,hard to play at times to much bs with the grapple spam and the spam in general
9267,gg
9268,"Best battle royale on the market imo. Very refreshing entry to the genre compared to all the other fps ones. The learning curve and skill ceiling is very high so you are always learning something new, The customization is super in depth if you like the sort of thing. Cosmetics generally look pretty good so far hope that continues. My only gripes with the game are lootboxes, and some players having super high ping from China. Overall so far i'd give it a 9/10 and recommend it to anyone that is looking for something new and exciting."
9269,Different kind of playstyle from your usual battle royale. Graphics are stunning too with various kinds of selectable audio languages for your avatars.
9270,Great game! love the combat system.
9271,Its like playing a cooler version of rock paper scissors except rock doesnt work and at that point you just keep picking scissors and winning.
9272,Dope AF
9273,noice

9275,vedy vedy good
9276,fire
9277,Played this game for over 20 hours at this point. I really enjoy this game. It has a little learning curve but once you get it its a very fun time.
9278,Nerf 4 dicks you idiot
9279,"The game runs exceedingly piss poor.
The connection to servers are insanely laggy from NA
The game itself stutters at the lowest settings
IF you're lagging you can't even get out of combos, 

I'm sure it's a problem on my end right now somehow, but unless I can figure this out, I think teh game has poor optimization."
9280,50% players on EU servers are chinese.
9281,Many chinese very nice
9282,"I like this game but when in fight suddenly the ping went high, it will affect my gaming experience."
9283,"Naraka: Bladepoint is a great spin on a BR game, there's so many unique things about it, from completely different fighting styles depending on the character you play/main and roster is ever increasing with a current of 7 characters (if you got the game before the end date - Yoto Hime) though everyone I guess calls her ""booba girl"".

Customization: the in-depth character customization is sometimes too indepth where people ruin the looks of the characters but who cares? isn't that part of the fun too? on top of this there's multiple different types of outfits, grapples,accessories, hair styles and weapon skins that you could be grinding for or get super lucky and get the best ones in your few ""loot boxes""

Loot boxes and progression: here I guess this is where the issues persists. you can play the game and get I  guess what you want without spending a dime on these areas as the challenges are quite easy and the rewards are very small amount to the greater part of the game, and there's ""silk"" things you can receive for the ""time to time"" switch up on the silk store items. other than that there's lore to each character where you can grind their challenges to unlock their backstory and get loot boxes 5 times up to getting a animated player avatar for that specific character.

Gameplay: of this unique battle royale is completely different to any other it's based on many factors from weapon types and strengths from multiple different melee weapons from daggers, swords, katanas, ect and ranged from pistols, bows, cannons, ect. though the game is more based around melee combat where ranged is weaker makes you more vulnerable. other parts come in to play where it's really a team based game where some characters are healers others fighters then there's ""tanks"" or so you will. Each character has a unique ability and ultimate from healing team mates over time or insta heals to throwing fire bombs or becoming a huge 4 armed character. This allows players to truly choose their main and love what they play.

Ranking: This I feel needs a lot of work as there's many issues when it comes to match making I am currently working towards myself to reach Diamond league or so, and I am going against players who have played over 100 more hours than me. so they have a lot more time to understand the game, even though I have managed to get to the top 100 players in my location and 45% or so in the world for trios. 

Weapons: I want to address some of the melees are stupid Overpowered, Spear, Dagger, Greatsword depending on use case, and a few others. some of these weapons there's timing to counter and you just cant. for example Spear players can do a tactic where they can stun lock you indefinitely through doing parts of a combo then cancelling it into another and you have no chance to dodge or get out of it before they get into the next combo making you die basically instantly.

Last thing I want to address is the optimization on the game, Hard drives: the game runs fine when not really fighting anyone and just looting/travelling the world but as soon as you get into a fight at the start or loading into the map expect the framerate to actually go to 0fps for up to 5 seconds. so in some sense the game is utterly unplayable if you don't have a hard drive. I guess this is why the devs recommend using a SSD.

SSD: now I don't have a SSD myself yet, though from what i have talked to friends about the load times on a SSD and HDD for this game is slightly different for the waiting lobby. though I need to say when you first load into the lobby you can expect to see infinite load screens on a HDD or when picking a character they don't even load in. where a SSD is perfectly fine like any other game. though what my friends say there is the same issue of a freezing state when first loading into the actual match but the SSD will work perfectly fine after 2 seconds where a HDD will stutter for 10+ seconds then still experience issues over the match.

I guess this is where I say I recommend or not with this game it's hard to say it's a love/hate thing it's such a great BR game and completely different to any other on the market but there's many issues the game needs to get done and fix. I should also state that the framerate on a HDD and a SSD is essentially Identical only issues come in is when things load or render.
but personally I would say my opinion is mutual with this. yes and no to the recommendation."
9284,"Game is fun best battle royal type game i've played but server are shit constantly crashing cant stay connected...
Some hackers...
You have to tell the game 3 times you want to stop playing to stop playing"
9285,"Chinese laggers in every game, chinese players teaming in solos, poorly optimized game (fps lag with above recommended specs), poor net code (players have consistently bad ping), chinese laggers with 400 ping gain a competitive advantage from lagging, items are poorly balanced

they even charge money for this game"
9286,Excellent graphics. Classes are balance.
9287,so far so good~
9288,i will play this game for ten years
9289,Really fun game. Unfortunately half the time you start a game and get immediately destroyed by a chinese player fully kitted in the first 30 seconds. Currently I recommend but we will see how that changes in the next few weeks.
9290,"Very cool game, definitely worth a try"
9291,"Posting this to clear up some mis conceptions. The biggest one I see is there is no server region lock, there is. If you are NA and try to play on Chinese servers, and vice versa, the game wont allow you. However using a VPN can circumvent this.

Overall, the gameplay is fine. Its essentially a Sekiro BR. The combat does well enough and is quite fun.. when it works. The servers are literal dog shit. You will occasionally  get massive ping spikes. For some games that isn't too bad, but in a game where reading opponents and counterattacking is the play, it can ruin the games experience on its own. The devs did mention they were looking to address this, but until it is fixed, this game cannot be taken seriously. 

Overall I like the game, but the server issues really hold the game back.

This game also has a severe boosting problem and win trading problem. It gets worse at around platinum and up. I still would not recommend this game at this time."
9292,great
9293,OKI
9294,THe game itself is actually not that bad but everyone just plays 2 charackters because a stun for like 2-3 seconds is just toooooo much and the dagger is kinda broke
9295,good game
9296,"was a fun game, its worth to get on sale, I wish it was f2p tho since there is so many f2p br's out on the market that is just as good but also f2p."
9297,"Nice gameplay, unique champion but still have many bugs"
9298,"Game hay, đồ họa đẹp, chạt chém đã đời"
9299,good game. very sweaty
9300,"Refreshing battle royal combat. on the surface it's paper scissor rock but there's definitely some psychology and mad ambushing to sway the tides involved.. people 100% hide in trees waiting for you to do something dumb before raining fire and steel on you when you're mid-menu upgrading your gear.  Yes the first few matches are against bots but once you start playing against only players the difficulty is satisfying. 

Still learning the ropes between the different heroes. Definitely wish there was a Duo's mode. Hopefully the game get's well supported by the dev team and stays populated with players."
9301,"the game is really good, u require a brain and skills unlike other games. there is still alot to learn about the game which makes it addicting"
9302,"Great game, easy to understand and fun to play! Weapons are all very viable, and the grapple hook aspect is a nice feature."
9303,good...i think?
9304,Fun ~ <3
9305,awesome game with marvelous graphics
9306,very much yes
9307,"battle royale game with a unique skill...
hopefully there have an update in the PVE and it will be very cool"
9308,"Nice game with hella graphics. For those who are concerned about the graphics, I'm using a GTX 1660 with I7-9700K processor and can run with high graphics. However, I would suggest running in medium for the best gaming experience."
9309,This game is A LOT of fun. Naraka Bladepoint as something new to the BR genre that with a strong emphasis on having actual skill with many different weapons instead of fps skills. All the weapons in the game are viable and that you do NOT need to worry that you have to get a meta weapon in order to win. Overall a very immersive experience that current BR all feel the same. Highly recommend the game especially with all the content you get for buying it.
9310,OK GAME HAY. GOOD GAME
9311,hehe
9312,d
9313,great game cant stop playing
9314,"Nice concept. The game has a very low skill floor while you literally only need to press W and mouse1 to kill, but a very high skill celling. it demands a dedicated time to learn all weapons attack patterns, gameplay mechanics, and constant awareness on the surroundings. You are more likely to think about movement whole analyze the situation and surroundings to decide wheter it is a good fight or not, rather than the actual fight itself.

I would say the current cons is that difference between a new player that just spam Mouse1 with a katana and an expert that cancels out the 3th charge attack of longsword to avoid getting parried by crouch cancel to proceed and use the airborne combo is too much of a deal, which could be discouraging after coming out of 2 games in a row with 24 kills where every enemy is a bot that cant even graple. That might be because the game has been around in beta for quite a while now, making it challanging for beginners"
9315,"Better than Apex.









No but seriously it's very fun, enjoying it thoroughly"
9316,Fk chineses hacking in game
9317,"Nice ""Vếu"""
9318,nice
9319,OKOKOK
9320,ok
9321,NICE
9322,"Very cool game! But doe's suffer from high ping Chinese players on VPN exploiting the lag to make it hard to time counters/hit on them, you see them spam charging attacks and beating everyone because players just cant time their counters and hits don't always register on themhowever I have faith they are working on a solution and the game will be awesome. The game also needs duo's as trio's is to chaotic imo... you really cant do much if you get pinned by 3 players which is easy to do with grapples as long as one lands a hit.

The game will get much better I'm sure so I recommend giving it a try if you would like a decent melee BR :)"
9323,Super addictive!
9324,YES
9325,"Use my Torchbearer code for cool rewards if you plan on getting this game/naming your character: 27ch4t64m8re

I never write reviews but I really love this game and I want it to be successful.
It's probably the best Battle Royale game, ever, (for me at least) for a few reasons:

1. Solo queue! If you have no friends, like me, you too can be competitive on the ladder!

2. In-depth melee combat, it's not just rock-paper-scissors, it's about combos and baiting your opponent, spamming one attack won't let you win duels later on.

3. Multiple weapons, each with unique different playstyles, and since it's not a shooter you don't just need to learn how to aim, every weapon feels different and plays different.

4. Parkour, and you can spice it up with animation cancels and such (although sometimes it can be very clunky in certain areas but apparently they're working on improving it).

5. Devs seem to be listening to feedback in general (took them 1 week to nerf the OP as f*ck Dagger as I'm writing this review).

6. Microtransactions are purely about cosmetics.

7. Amazing character customization."
9326,very nice :)
9327,blade go brr
9328,"Fun combat system, beautiful graphic, smooth movement, looking for more new map and characters incoming and PVE if possible"
9329,"gameplay gets a little repetetive, and theres not too much incentive to really delve into the combat, but great music, style, and feel."
9330,"Fun take on BR. Good combat, decently balanced, beautiful graphics. Looking forward to more, hope the community grows and they take the game in the right direction - by focusing on new content, balance, and game design instead of micro-transactions and cosmetics.

Thought I was getting tired of BR games, but it turns out of I was just tired of the same old FPS games."
9331,Yes
9332,maganda tara laro na
9333,nice change of pace from all the other BR games i find it fun and enjoy it   with that said its not for everyone but if your looking for a cool fun swordsman game with simple controls and hero's come play
9334,yea

9337,"Alright game. 


Pros:
-Game is very well optimized. 
-beautiful graphics
-really fun grappling mechanics very well done.
-enjoyble combat system where anyone can be a winner 
-Death circle is actually extremely well balanced. Probably one of the ones I've ever seen. 


Cons:
-the ability to respawn on your own and getting right back to the fight. (by far one of the worst system ion the game)
-Ultimate abilities are extremely unbalanced and overpowered depending on the hero. 
-blocking and forcing someone to drop their weapon. its fine on its own but the problem is that when you drop your weapon you're also knocked for a 3-4 seconds, by the time you get back up you are dead.  
- a lot of cheaters. Saw some people get killed at the end of match and instant get revived by themselves. seen people teleport right in front of me while playing Yoto Hime  geared out with either purple or golden gear, I've also witnessed someone instantly kill a whole squad of  around him while he was healing himself. overall great game."
9338,yes if they gave the codes from tiwtch and other stuff
9339,Unplayable from OCE due to abysmal server lag despite 90-100ms to SEA servers. The game simply will not register hits. Will refund if not fixed in the next few days.
9340,better find yourself some armor real quick son
9341,"Please use my torchbearer code: ch8prntjnr

This game is really good in solo's but trios needs some work its a spam fest but the combat feels good.
The only complaint I have is the Chinese players using VPNS to play on NA servers.
The game is fun so I'll recommend it hopefully devs fix the issues soon."
9342,"Such a good battle royale game.
Pluses:
- this play is based on 80% Melee fight and 20% ranged; 
- a sightly view; 
- all in all remind me Sekiro))) but in multiplayer mode. 
- pleasant music ( subjectively ).
- not feel a monotony.
Minuses:
- a high price. 

In generally recommend to buy.
"
9343,"Must try
"
9344,"ok quick breakdown of the game.
With bots: not even fun, played 3 games 1 trio 2 solo, won all three with ease, really boring, would not recommend.
Without bots: pending review since bots are still in the game but I'm assuming it's going to be awesome, 10/10 would recommend.
In short, if anyone at the dev team sees this review, remove bots, then your game will be incredible.
note to players: anyone thinking about buying this game, don't until they remove bots. once they do, 10/10 buy this game."
9345,"with increasing Naraka playtime I feel increasingly disappointed with the balancing of this game (and any other games from Netease lmao)

-Greatsword is a trash weapon when it's supposed to be ""heavy"" but ppl can be like ooga booga and your greatsword be gone, it's should be like this ""when weapon clash, greatsword downtime shorter"" but in reality? everything can shit on Greatsword
on the other hand, Spear is near OP, you can CC-chain other ppl and deal huge damage at the same time with near to zero counter (do i need to bring out the spinning thing?)

-Tianhai's ultimate is braindead, imagine an ultimate that can cuck other ppl ultimate from a distance, sounds fun to play but super annoying to play against
speaking of cuck, what's the purpose of the escape bar when 100% of the time will be like this: if you got grabbed then you got yeeted, receive huge damage & zero mitigation or whatsoever with the escape bar being pressed like not even halfway
I guess the escape bar is there just to create an illusion of ""you can counter this, you are a great player"" but in reality, it's there to show how useless you are when you can't button mash against a braindead skill
hell, Ning can offer a wide range stun but at least she needs some proper positioning or she gonna die before the stun, while Tianhai? just pure monkey noises, no skill needed but a bunch of gain
bet like 80% of top players use/abuse Tianhai bcuz they are a bunch of [redacted] 

-judging of how ""cheat websites"" appear like a week after release and this game is from Netease, idk, your call, i won't say anything

tl;dr:
-if you're somewhat good at battle royale? try this game, it's really worth your money BUT keep in mind that this game is from Netease and you know how bad they balancing stuffs (i'm looking at you onmyoji arena)
-if you want to start with battle royale by playing this game? don't, it's really hard, try something else first to familiarize yourself THEN come back to this game for further consideration"

9347,"Anyone that says this game is ""clunky"" or ""braindead hack and slash left click only"" refunded the game after realizing they were shit and didn't want to learn it.  10/10 would recommend especially for MMO/BR lovers"
9348,goooddd
9349,good game
9350,"this game is so much fun , have not had fun like this in while , highly recommended , ya gotta get this one"
9351,its a battle royale fighting game... but too often with problems of hit not connecting due to bad connection...
9352,sever lag

9354,So great
9355,stupid game

DO NOT BUY!!!"
9357,"nice game
"
9358,Good
9359,"Love the game. Its different enough from the shooter style Battle Royal to be fresh and enjoyable.
Matchmaking needs to be balanced"
9360,"First i saw it, watch gameplays, streams, it feel boring, but i gave it a chance and its worth.
Its Great game. Where you need to use brain. 

Game need repair a jumping minor bugs, they are sometimes annoying. But game is still great!

Small Gacah inside isnt something i like, but to compare with OverWatch or CSGO after they release. They were expensive and also had gacha inside. 

I highly recommended game."
9361,It's a fun BR.
9362,good
9363,"Nothing exciting. It wont keep me playing all day. But decent game to pass the time when I feel like being 3 shot in the opening 2 minutes.

Sprint and dodge are the same button. Goodluck blocking anything when you are in AU and playing on SEA.

Played it again a few times, still a bag of moldy cheese. Pretty sure I'm playing against 54 bots and only 5 other real people."
9364,"I am enjoying the game so far has fast paced game play the weapons are fun to use has a good selection of characters with different abilities and a bunch of skins for weapons,accessories and characters also GOOD TITTY psychics ;)"
9365,The Naraka Bladepoint of Naraka Bladepoints
9366,Rules of survival just chinese
9367,not worth it don't buy.
9368,"I don't remember being so pleasantly surprised by a game in the last 10 years. It's like a mix of all the things I like. Thanks you! After 22 hours I'm still terrible, but there is no way I'm giving up on this masterpiece.

Ah nevermind, first patch they broke controller settings. No time to explain. made some changes to how Xbox one controller works in the menus. I'm not relearning shit after 70 hours."
9369,So far so good
9370,"Don't waste your  money on this full price. They have shit servers and no region lock so, every game has tons of foreign players with shit ping teleporting around. If you don't have teleporters, you'll probably end up getting disconnected during a fight.

Players in this are some of the biggest cowards I've ever seen in a BR. Doesn't help that the rank system rewards cowards. People will literally do everything they can to run away from even after you get up in their grill and smack them a few times, because you get a better score for your pointless rank, the longer you survive.

If you're playing trios prepare to get third partied every day, because again, cowards. I wouldn't even bother unless you have two friends to queue with. No one talks and 90% of the time it's chinese players that pick terrible spawns and run around together as if they're playing duos.

Solo is the only thing worth doing, but it's painfully obvious this game is going to be dead in 8 months. It's just one of those games that you pick up and can smell it's rotting digital flesh immediately. It just has that familiar feel of, ""Oh yeah this game will be dead in 8 months and servers will shut down in 12""

Weapon balance is non existent. Either you get combo locked by a spear, greatsword, or dagger, or you get juggled by the bloodripper which the entire community hates, because once you get it you're basically invincible. I actually won a solo match and killed 6 people all within about 1 minute and a half with that because it just so stupidly broken and op. 

Range weapons are kinda useless unless you get the swarm, which is like a ranged k-mart version of the bloodripper, stupidly broken and op as well but lacks the nonstop assault the ripper has as the volley it launches isn't continuous until breaking, like the ripper is.

Also remove your stupid fucking pop-up banner shamelessly begging for social media follows every time I close the fucking game. It's embarrassingly pathetic and only annoys people.

Aside from all that, it's fun to jump and grapple around like a ninja."
9371,"Good game that needs some work. 

Pros: 

-Good character customisation, (you can make some weird shit)

-Each character is pretty unique and has cool abilities, and they all are pretty strong, so each character is viable. 

-Since the game costs 30$ cosmetics are given to you by playing the game and so are crates, so you don't have to take out a second mortgage on your house to get good looking skins for your weapons and characters.

-The game is pretty unique and stands apart from the other BR games on the market and it's pretty fun to play by yourself or with friends. (I personally don't like BR games, but this one is pretty fun and is one of the games I can surprisingly say that I enjoy). 

-Crates are given to you pretty often, and you can buy them with in-game currency that you earn from playing, (and it's a reasonable amount). The drop rates seem to be not bad since I've gotten quite a few legendary skins with only 30 hours on the game.  

Cons: 

-CN players are in NA servers quite a lot so it gets pretty annoying. (It's still not that bad since I haven't felt like they are laggy in any way, but it's still annoying). 

-Server issues in other regions

-Costs 30$? 

I don't have many cons yet since I haven't played too much, but if I run into any I'll add to this. 

(I'm not in the SA or OC regions so I don't have any complaints about those server issues. However, they have been working on fixing those issues and it looks like they'll be fixed soon). 

The community is active and the devs are listening to what people want so it's looking like the game will have an ok future. 
If they fix the server issues and continue to add content I'd say it's worth it. 

As the game is right now, I'd say it's worth it to buy if you have 30$ laying around and want a different spin to a BR game.
If you're an SA, or OC person, (or if you're not near any main server things), then maybe wait a bit until they have tested and fixed their server hubs."
9372,"This game would be great if it got some things right AND working.

Parrying -
Get parried > use your second weapon > both players go back to light attack spams and now you're both deflecting off each other unless the other one has a faster weapon. 9 times out of 10 its gg since you can go into stun lock with just dagger light attacks or spear. Game rewards you for doing one thing right, spamming parries. 

Grapples -
This works 80% of the time, you grapple someone they get stunned for a split second, ok makes sense. Now the other 20% you can grapple a dude 4 times and he'll continue hauling ass in that direction like nothing's happened.

Weapons - 
Daggers, Spears, and Longsword are the meta, hands down. Dagger has a 12 hit combo that you're not getting out of. Spears have a 4 hit light combo that has massive range and faster than most weapons so its easier to trip people before they can get their first hit out. Longsword's charge attacks are mad fucking strong.

Tianhai -
Literally the best hero, great in team fights and great in solos. His ult is insanely strong in an open field so if that's where the last circle is then gg. In high density places or even a small house, his tier pretty much goes all the way down. He becomes invulnerable as soon as he hits his ult so its an easy oh shit button, It lasts twice as long than every other heroes ultimate. and he gets a second health bar which is basically double his base health."
9373,"Good game enjoy it so far by now, smooth gameplay"
9374,"This is what a BR should be, fuk walls, fuk campers, fuk bushes, fuk snipers, Fight me bitch use that sword.

Edit: After an extra 180hrs i have concluded that this game is still amazing."
9375,"Game is not perfect but it should be f2p somewhat soon, then it'll be totally worth it to try out since yea free. It has nice cosmetics, regular updates, and is not p2w so that is all appreciated but like I said, the game does have issues too."
9376,"I don't have much time on this game so this review isn't about balance or the minute mechanics as it is about the big glaring problems that anyone can see no matter how bad or good they are.

This game has some amazing potential but I feel like it has quite a few big design flaws that need to be fixed, not just a lack of content or anything like that.

Problem 1: Countering.
Countering feels oddly inconsistent since I started playing. Actually pressing lmb and rmb together isn't hard, but the counter itself doesn't come out instantly. There is a small delay to it which means you have to basically guess when they will use their focus attack (blue aura thingy)

Pulling off a counter is a great reward though, please keep it in, just fix the timing.


Problem 2: The spear
Fuck this thing. The greatsword is braindead but it at least has counterplay. That's all.


Problem 3: The camera
Why is the FOV so damn small. It feels like 70 or 65 or something like that. While being third person obviously helps I can barely see what's going on around me, let alone spot enemies since the camera is so zoomed in.
Please add an option where the FOV can be increased, or decreased if you're a masochist.


Problem 4: Grappling hook
The grappling hook is a neat idea but it's way too easy to hook onto retreating enemies and hit them with a grapple attack.
It locks on with a generously big circle around the crosshair and pulls you right to them super fast. You can't avoid fights if you're spotted with a few exceptions. Normally I would like being basically forced to fight but it's a battle royale so consider this: You just finished fighting someone, you're low on health and your weapon/s is damaged, you then get jumped by another player and try to run away, but he can just perma grapple you without any mind at all. Kind of infuriating.
Please remove the lock on, so you can actually dodge grapples.

That's about it. This review was quickly written so there will probably be a few problems and typos in it so don't rely on this review too much.

"
9377,"one of the best BR , deep gameplay n swordfights, not just button smashing. u need to be good in timing to execute those combos or counters. all the characters has own game play too, awesome"

9379,Yes
9380,"Game pretty good.Nice gameplay, it's hard to learn but after some match i can play better and better"
9381,"fk this game lag and delay af, don't buy this game if you don't have rtx 3090,i9. fk my money"
9382,"Game is great, some performance issues which required going into power management settings for Nvidia, but after all that the game is a blast. I really love the 3 dimensional gameplay. The combat is really fun, easy to learn hard to master kind of thing. There really isnt alot of bad to say about this game, for sure give it  try. And at the current price point, its honestly a steal.

Be warned, it seems lagging is an issue for some people. Like I said, I had unplayable levels of lag that required me to have to go into my Nvidia control panel and change the power management settings."
9383,"ez
"
9384,"vv good game 10/10, new br with diffrent aspects."
9385,the style of the game
9386,Still could use some balancing I think but really fun battle royal
9387,"Wait until it switches free to play
50 hours played. Boring 2 click combos for every weapon.
Counter attack is broken. 
There is no way to grind through ranks as it places bronze + platinum players in same lobby.
Every fight is the same thing (Grab a spear and mash and hold left click)


"
9388,"The game is good, but I just suck at it. Stun Locks or in another word, ""Juggling"" are a really big thing in this game. If you happen to get caught in one and the enemy knows really good combos. Kiss your A** goodbye. Timing is key, but I can't do anything to save my own life. Seems cheap at some points where I am trying to get out of attacks and my character just takes it. I uninstalled the game when 5 solo games in a row I faced players who didn't flinch once when I attacked, but I when I got attacked, I was flung in the air like paper just taking a beating and died. Another Battle Royal where it's fun at first, then you get to play with good players and it becomes...not fun >_>
But If you want to try it out. I say go ahead and see if I am wrong. I enjoyed it for the first few hours. Maybe you will too."
9389,"I am not a fan of battle royal game at first. But, Naraka prove me wrong. Different concept with skills and use melee weapon to play is different experience!!

Recommended!!"
9390,Very good
9391,"WHAT? HOW CAN PEOPLE ALLOW SO MUCH FUN IN SUCH GAME??
WHY DO I HAVE STRONGER URGES OF PLAYING THIS GAME THE MORE I GET KILLED??
WHY THESE MICROTRANSACTIONS DOES NOT EFFECT MY POWER? BUT ONLY GIVE ME COSMETIC ITEMS?

9393,This game is awesome! AHHHHHHHHHHH!
9394,nice game
9395,L
9396,I LOVE IT
9397,This battle royale is legit! Very fun!

9399,Too dope. Just get it. Really.
9400,big good
9401,Awesome Game. Worth every Dollar. cant wait to see what other champs they come out with!
9402,:D
9403,"one of the best game on steam, worth any penny"
9404,"even with the lowest graphic setting, this game looks amazing
I'm still learning all the tricks, it is very different from shooter games such as csgo
with all the skills and stuff, I feel like it's a bit like league or dota2
if you like pubg or moba games, this game is definatly for you"
9405,"game runs so smoth my hard drive cant keep up holy shit now this is pod racing 
they need to do somthing with this game to where it runs better right now its not finshed"
9406,"All right here goes. After 60+ hours spent on this game I am ready to make a review. Would I recommend this game? Yes and no. I gave it a thumbs up I know but there's still some things wrong here. If you intend to play this game casualty, go ahead. If you intend to play ranked, get ready to be disappointed. The rank starts you in bronze and you work your way up as any ranking would go. But I've noticed a pattern for 2 days now. I made it to gold rank and have been there 2 days and ever since I got to gold, I am getting matched with teammates that are silver and bronze ranks. I am getting players that disconnect and throw games. The grind from bronze to gold was fun and I had fair and decent games and felt like every death I had was fair. But now I just can't enjoy it anymore with how bad the matchmaking is at gold rank and up. I don't know what happened but it needs some work, because matching with people not at your skill level just isn't fun for anyone. Other then matchmaking, some hero's need work on their ultimate's. Tianhai's titan is busted. Yoto Himes sword is busted and Viper Nings stun needs to be reduced a little. Personally I feel those are the hero's that need work the most when it comes to balancing. The weapons are fun to use but some of them need balancing as well. For example the longsword, spear and greatsword are all pretty strong, maybe too strong. I enjoy the game for it is but it needs lots of work on some things."
9407,"Awesome movement system, great high skill ceiling melee and ranged combat, sexy characters, high quality voice acting and runs well. Oh and the audio design slaps.

Recommended! ...especially for weebs

PS: Linux support would be a icing on the cake."
9408,"Good and fun game but needs more balance and new servers. If you're a try hard like me, then you might enjoy the game even with all its annoying aspects.

Pros:
-Just like any other BR, with a few twists here n there, so if you like BRs with unique characteristics such as Apex and Realm Royale, this should be a pro
-Unique combat mechanics, where if you kill an ACTUAL player, it feels very rewarding because you have to use different combos and features to kill each enemy (unless they're really bad, then u just spam left click LOL)

Cons:
-Some continents don't have a dedicated server, so, for example, you'll encounter a shit ton of Asian players in NA servers
-95% of skins are pretty garbage in my opinion, regardless of rarity, price and whatnot
-Some weapons are very unbalanced, meaning: if you get caught lacking by a FUCKING DUMB ASS (jk) and they just spam left click, you might get obliterated depending on which weapon they're using, because you won't be able to dodge, block or escape at all, unless you're using one of the characters with the ability to instantly disarm an enemy or teleport away
-If you're a casual player/not competitive, this game really isn't for you. You MIGHT have some fun playing trios with your friends and all that, but overall, the game is full of competitive tryhards who sweat themselves to sleep (actually, they don't sleep at all) and piss themselves in their chairs because they can't stop playing for one second to use the bathroom
-Another annoying thing (if you have a not so good pc to play this game, running on minimum settings) every time that fucking bootleg, wallmart, dollar tree, purple Shenron looking ass dragon shows up in the sky, it feels like your fps drops by 20
-Since it's pretty much like any other BR (in a way) and still needs work, it shouldn't cost $20. If anything, it should cost $10 at MOST

Overall, I enjoy the game because I'm a tryhard, but it doesn't mean the game is great. It needs a lot of fixes, and definitely isn't worth its price, so that's why I wouldn't exactly recommend it as of now. Now if you're a tryhard, have some spare bucks, and are used to getting pissed over losing in competitive games, then go for it!"
9409,combat is satisfying af
9410,i fukin llove it !!! yea babby!!! ill see u on the battlefeild watch ur back buddy!!!
9411,first impressions this game is sick. really enjoy it so far.
9412,Innovative.
9413,"Good, fun, battle royale game. Quite refreshing considering we've been getting shooters for the past few years. This has potential to be a big game. Time will tell."
9414,"I hardly review games, this one, exception! I was waiting for this type of BR and man is it nice! Loving the weapon ranges although I hardly use some of them like the Cannon or Pistol or even Bow due to the fact that movement is so fast it makes aiming impossible. Unless they bring some jades that help on aim then I don't see the point of some of the ranged weapons. All in all, the game is great you can have a lot of fun but it can also drop you down into a pit hole. 

Game has been working great at first and after the BOT's warm-up games at the start I started having some FPS drop issues, like 1 FPS every first game once I opened the game. From there on everything works with hardly any FPS drops during the match, however still present. I have this on an SDD and my gaming Pc can handle a lot higher than this game's spec.
I am not recommending this for the FPS issue and MOSTLY because there is no point in EU, NA, SEA servers when I am from the EU and play with all the SEA people in my server which is prob the reason for the FPS drop DUE TO LAG, I even get the lag sign above my head. Must def region lock this otherwise I basically spent a pre-purchase and a battle pass that I won't be able to enjoy.  Will keep trying to play however I might delete if the FPS and Region Lock doesn't happen."
9415,Best match ever
9416,The server is not good 4 play
9417,good
9418,"Ninja Gaiden meets Attack on titans meets soul caliber.

Waaay too much fun, please do not buy unless you want to have fun!!!
Only 20$ too!!"
9419,hella fun
9420,Great battle royale with both fighting modes and skills and stuffs. I love how balanced the two types of weapons are (although it's a bit tougher to use ranged with all the mobility this game has).
9421,best game ive ever played 10/10
9422,"Very good BR, nice skill curve dont listen 2 iq ppl brain u in comment"
9423,best game
9424,"Hello gamers, just got the game today, been playing 9 hours in a row. So:
As a new player involving myself with this game was a HUGE and awesome experience !
There is not only one Battle Royal specific game that made me feel this enjoyment as Naraka Bladepoint made me feel.
My first impression as a new player is a extraordinary good one, this game has HUGE and unimaginable potential.
Game is smooth, combat is so fantastic, mechs are good too.
So the feeling that i got as a new player is something that no other game made me feel in around 2 or maybe 3 years
The first hours have a huge role and impact for new players, this will decide if you stay or not in the game, as for me ! Naraka:Bladepoint got me from the first hours.

I'm looking further for this game development and i will be a daily player supporting the game and community.
Wish you all the best, PLEASE try this game, you won't regret it, but if you do, you still have the refund buttons that can help you get ur money back if you don't spend more than 2 hours in the game, but if it will happens as it did at me, playing 9 hours straight without realizing how time fly's, you won't be able ;P

Anyway for 20 bucks, this game surpass many big title out there already !
So please, DEVS ! do not disapoint us ! 
Good luck, and see you in ""The God Lands"" !"
9425,"MELEE WEAPON GO SHOOSHHH
"
9426,Kombat.
9427,good
9428,Love the game.
9429,Very fun to play a new experience for me on Melee Battle Royale. But my only complain is they should have made this F2P if they are going to intorduce battle pass. I mean they are just milking their player base dry and that is not a good thing they would loose revenue fast that way. and wont be able to attract more players to fill in the gap.
9430,"Imagine an amalgamation of Apex Legends, For Honor, & Sekiro. 

Definitely weeaboo-as-fuck & wouldn't want it any other way. This is the most fun I've had in the Battle-royale genre by far. I've never been a huge fan of Battle-royales in general, maybe because FPS's aren't my strongest/favorite game type. This scratches an itch that I never thought existed."
9431,"Game is solid, but people rely on projectile weapons in a melee based game. Gameplay is solid, combat system is phenomenal, and the map is good. Overall 9/10. Personal opinion all projectiles aside from the bow should be removed."
9432,Exactly what i have been waiting for
9433,gameplay is fun different weapons feel different. overall really good! combat is interesting.
9434,"click = light attack, hold click = heavy attack, left click + right click = parry. parry>heavy heavy>light light>parry this rock/paper/scissors style combat makes for some crazy mixups to outsmart your opponents"
9435,nice
9436,already full of cheaters not worth the money
9437,basic but good.
9438,Brilliant game :) anyone tired of guns can check this out
9439,"Dude you need to quit fucking texting My Waifu. Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and My Waifu are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my My Waifu but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and My Waifu’s love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and My Waifu are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give My Waifu my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my My Waifu and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my My Waifu :)

TLDR It is a-lot of fun, a very unique battle royal that is melee based. You can make a Waifu. Your girlfriend will break up with you."
9440,fun game
9441,is gud
9442,"Extremely fun game, everything about it is amazing and totally does what i expect it to. I love the combat and the movement and the whole idea of the game. 10/10."
9443,This game is not beginner friendly i do better suggest that new player test all the weapon 1st in free training and go drop in bloodhunt for you to practice the weapon combos and blocking!
9444,"Pros:
- very high skill ceiling (if you are into that)
- combat is fun
- just teleport at the beginning of the game, you can see where other players are also starting. So you can avoid or go HAM at the beginning of the game.
- There is a deathmatch game mode to practice before you go into the sweaty stuff
- The circle will hardly ever kill you, it's more there to just prevent camping or to prolong games.

Cons:
- chinese players had the game a month before NA, so you will notice a difference when fighting against one, but that also means most of them are at the higher ranks so you won't face them early on.
- monetization is a bit harsh, you got loot boxes, battle pass, with 10-20$ cosmetics on a game you pay for... not a big deal gameplay wise but, its unethical. The skins are really nice in the game and it's a shame that they feel unobtainable.
- some characters are imbalanced, like most games you hope the devs will fix them in the future. But, as of right now there is a clear meta in the game, where if you don't have the character on your team you are at an extreme disadvantage.

TLDR:

If you like Battle royale type games, melee combat, high skill ceiling, and GRAPPLING HOOKS, then I highly recommend this game. I've spent 40+ hours and I still feel like there's a lot to improve on, I learn something new everytime I get rekt."
9445,"great game
"
9446,good
9447,OCE servers are a lie.
9448,"friggin awesome its like the pvp of ghost of tsu wish they would add pve or single player modes but still really good

9452,"Actually a fun game, fun gameplay & weapons. But without region lock im not interested in getting killed by 300 ping Asian players who cant be hit due to their ping. ggs"
9453,nope it runs like trash just wait.....
9454,"Games good, microtransactions are only a problem if you make them one. Plain and simple if you don't want to spend your money DON'T. Or if you really like the game and want to support it go for it!"
9455,very fun
9456,Player Base is becoming toxic super quick.
9457,Best BR I've played in awhile. Always wanted a melee based BR? Aim sucked but still wanted to play a BR? Here you go. Zero pay to win. More to the combat than just tutorial and advanced tutorial just play around and learn or watch a video. A ton of verticallity.
9458,"Not the easiest review to write. Love the uniqueness it brings to battle royales, it's beautiful, the face customization is choice, and the movement is awesome.

The controls translate well from FPS's, so that's nice... but [*insert deity] it's a very hard game overall... it's unforgiving, rage inducing, and hands in the air ""WTF"" moments. It's apex level 3rd partying fights, it's weapon balance needs work (thinking of spear lock downs)... but it's super rewarding when you win fights and duels.

Anyways, I hate it. 5 stars."
9459,"Very fun, Very skillful, Very greatsword spam, very parry spam. I love it!"
9460,its fun
9461,"Great gameplay, they just need to improve on loot accuracy"
9462,"Fun! but spam click combat, 0 skill, very laggy and holy shit they did not optimise this game"
9463,Great game
9464,Stan for Kurumi
9465,"Most broken battle royal ever seen .. Plenty of bugs,  Zero balance."
9466,"Better luck running cyberpunk 2077 on epic with >120fps on day 1

Ill just quote the biggest bullshit part about this game 

""Recommended system requirements""
OS: Windows 10 64-bit
Processor: Intel i7 7th generation or equivalent
Memory: 16 GB RAM
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6G or equivalent
DirectX: Version 11
Network: Broadband Internet connection
Storage: 20 GB available space
Additional Notes: a) Can run at 1080p/60fps; b) We advise you install the game on an SSD for a more streamlined experience.

"
9467,gout chop
9468,Big boba go boing
9469,Good Game
9470,"no region locking, no duos, trios is a huge mess, greatsword is stupid, 10minute queues for both quick match and ranked, ults that deal 80% of ur total hp and armour, countering is basically RNG. Just a huge mess zzzzz"
9471,"Enjoying the combat so far. Not a fan of battle royale games in general especially shooters, but got this for the combat and not disappointed. Traversal freedom is also very good. Good weapon depth but not too complex moves or combos which makes for very fluid and fast paced melee combat.

Technical side no issues so far. Has DLSS also if needed. Running smoothly at 1440p 100+ fps all ultra on 3070.

Two worrying things so far :
1. Map biome variety is not present. Every location looks the same, This definitely needs to be improved. Initially this may not seem important, but map is something that is constant in every single match so might get boring overtime.
2. New heroes that will be released in future will need to be purchased either with real world money or in game currency. A bit cautious on how the pricing will turn out. 

Recommending the game if you are fan of fast paced melee combat/martial arts and parkour."
9472,"Super fun high skill battle royale, seems like it's easy at first but once you look into strategies and rank up a little bit the game fully turns into a mind game and outplays."
9473,I like it.
9474,"It is a good game althought it needs to be better optimized, it runs at low FPS and the combat is clunky"
9475,fun game
9476,"if you take the time to learn the mechanics, this game's skill ceiling is obscenely high.

that being said, its also a massive clusterf*ck. Great game, super fun to play competitively with friends!"
9477,Best Fighting game in a long time.
9478,"Nice game, but still have to enhance the sever, Ping kinda bad even though i played at SEA (50-60ms to me), there's still lag ping

updated March 24th, 2022
 Ping problem is solved for now, although there are so many cheater i still enjoy this game in my way. But to be honest after a few lately update, my laptop now just can play this game with ~40fps, it used to be better (like 70~90fps) but now i cant play it like i used to before.

my laptop configs are I7-7700K and VGA 1050Ti. Already installed this game in SSD and upgrade my RAM to 16GB"
9479,"Has some good ideas with poor execution. Combat can be fun, but it can also be clunky. Game can run smoothly, but it can also stutter seemingly at random or inopportune times, even on high end set-ups. The character creation is fun and surprisingly intricate, though you can't edit the hairstyles sadly. Bots are ridiculously easy to play against and present no challenge, which is a problem because you will be playing against them ALOT. I don't think I have to mention the microtransactions, thought I will say they are very reminiscent of  pretty much any free to play mobile game despite its $30 price tag. 

Naraka: Bladepoint has the potential to be a great game and an even better battle royale. However, in its current state, I don't see it retaining prolonged interest. 
"
9480,very nice
9481,"Let me start with the positives, the game is gorgeous, the characters are all unique, and the animation is fluid. The game rules itself are no different than any other BR game, loot, circle closes, rinse and repeat.

Now the point was supposed to be but it has melee combat and it utterly fails at that aspect. The combat is very similar to the Koei Warriors games, which is great for single player games but for competitive just does work for me as someone who plays fighting games. Each hit leaves you in stunlock which lets the combo go through, until it ends with a knockdown and a okizeme situation. It then becomes a guess of are they gonna wake up dodge or grapple away. The defensive options are just too limited in a game focused on melee."
9482,Yes
9483,"Great game, must play, all day, everyday"
9484,hollo
9485,"the combat system gets boring and stale within a couple of minutes. good idea, bad execution."
9486,goode neiii
9487,"auto aim for enemy players is bullshyt to the point if u get ganked by 3 players u cant do shyt to get away
good game nonetheless"
9488,most aggravating game ever made :)
9489,Really fun battle royale! Comiing from Spellbreak to this felt really nice with similar freedom in  movement and the melee focused combat is quite novel in a world with so many shooters.
9490,"Do you like Sword Fights? Do you like Melee? Do you read novels like ( Almighty Sword Domain, Rebirth of the Thief Who Roamed the World, A Will Eternal, Nine Star Hegemon Body Art, Emperor's Domination, Overgeared, Divine Throne of Primordial Blood, and the list goes on and on) ? if so what are you waiting for ? the list goes on and on but if you truly like the dynasty/Wuxia design and mythical weapons design you are in for a ride. But if you don't like battle royale game i still would ask that you give this game a chance after all ( 1 hr 59 mins free then just refund if you don't like) (10 GB STORAGE REQUIRED)"
9491,Very fun and refreshing battle royale for those who enjoy combat games.
9492,"Honestly amazingly fun game, combat mechanics are great, game runs great, smooth fps, high skill ceiling, , my only problem and huge problem with the game is that 80% of players you play with wont speak english or they'll have oriental character names you cant read.. Also alot of people you fight in game are going to have a ping symbol next to their name showing you that have 300+ping. Not sure if the NA version of this game was full released in the east aswell but it definitely makes it hard to be a english player playing competitvely because most the people im partnered up with dont speak english and I also dont know how to read oriental lettering so i can't call out my friends names for help.... Not sure how the trio tournaments are going to work when most people on the leaderboard are not from north america.... UPDATE : they changed the matchmaking system and its actually alot worse than it used to be. you will be paired up with people with over 7 or 8 ranks different then you in ranked matches..."
9493,
9494,good
9495,Cool game
9496,"after 3 days of playing NARAKA: BLADEPOINT i can confidently advise that you play this game,
100/10 i didnt know i never knew i needed this game in my life, but here it is and im in love with it.
where to start...HMMM LETS SEE, 
combat: with limited characters and weapons to choose from you would think meh ill get bored of the game real quick
YOUR WRONG.
THERES SO MUCH EFFORT PUT INTO THE ACTUAL COMBAT SYSTEM OF THE GAME THAT THERE IS NEVER A MOMENT WERE IM JUST MINDLESS SITTING THERE TRYING TO GET RANK, EVERY SECOND SPENT FIGHT STILLK GETS MY HEART PUMPING EVEN AFTER 3 DAYS
NO PAY TO WIN! BIG BONUS THERE, oh and another thing the game actual gave me a title for being 3rd best in my city, talk about knowing how to make someone get more competitive then they already are.
finalwords if you're looking for a game that you can play with friends or just straight up massacre tons of people for fun then NARAKA: BLADEPOINT  is your next best purchase.
oh and for all those freaking out thinking the game is just bots, do more research next time, they introduce the game to you with bots to ease you into it and make you more confident and more easily adjusted to the way the game plays, then as you rank up and get batter and the controls they take them out.
honestly i don't write reviews but naraka deserves it, i hope to keep seeing more and more people playing this game is simply the best battle royal out there"
9497,Amazing
9498,tits
9499,"There is nothing on the market like this game. It's basically a Battle Royale 3D fighting game.

The gameplay is fluid and complex. It takes the fun looting aspects of Battle Royale games and gets rid of the boring inventory management, gimicky fort building and getting sniped from across the map by a guy hiding in a bush. The inventory system is simple and traversing the terrain with parkour and grappling hooks is really fun, I guess I just wish there was more than one map.

The combat is very fast-paced and involves a lot of animation cancelling, combo strings and juking, and has an almost unlimited skill ceiling. It sucks when you get stomped by someone who knows what they are doing (which will inevitably happen when you first start playing), but it's also really rewarding when you do well. I'm currently in Gold V for solos (~top 400 in NA) and the adrenaline rush every game is insane.

There are two game modes, solo and trios (3-player teams), and every game has 60 players on the map. I don't play much trios, but there is a lot of strategy around team compositions.

Some players have complained about the MTX, but really they are exclusively cosmetic. It is in no way pay-to-win. Also, the battlepass is pretty cheap and gives you a ton of cosmetic stuff and practically enough gold to buy the next season battlepass for free.

My issues with the game are pretty minor. Fighting high ping players kind of sucks, but honestly I haven't encountered that many (even from other regions). Also, some weapons (dagger) and champions are a little overtuned, but they are mostly pretty balanced. This is definitely my favorite game of the year so far."
9500,"I played Naraka: Bladepoint for 25 hours and completed +100 matches in solo and trio modes. Here are my toplines and a glimpse of the game review:	

1. The UI is the weakest point about the game, feels outdated, unfinished but fixable.		
2. Mobility and melee combat is the “centerpiece” of the game. 		
3. As you climb the ranking system, the game quickly becomes tough, and just mashing buttons won’t take you further.		
4. The game offers much more than what the price tag asks for.  	

[i]There is no way you can go wrong with Naraka: Bladepoint, you get what you buy: Melee Combat Battle Royale. Both genres are well-known and any hesitation about it can be solved with all free-to-play options there are out there.

BR is crowded with shooters options and different variations of the same. Last year, the genre “opened up” to the Fall Guys phenomenon and game developers have shown BR can be much bigger than already is.

Naraka: Bladepoint is far from being as revolutionary as Fall Guys was, but it is part of the unstoppable transformation of the genre.[/i]

9508,"Imagine the Naruto Chuunin Exam but in a game. I have experienced no real bugs here, no pay to win content and fun gameplay. Microtransactions are cosmetic for the moment though I think it may wind up being a necessary evil to unlock future characters down the line. 

First few games are against bots, then once you improve you get pitted against other players.
The team are pretty repsonsive to the player base when it comes to big issues (namely gamers abusing net code from overseas to queue up abilities). 

Highly recommended for people who don't think they like Battle Royale games, you'll be super pleasantly surprised."

9515,good
9516,"Lets put my self right in front! I suck at BR games but somehow i do enjoy this game! I get frustrated if I loose but it does not kill my interest on the game instead it just peaks me more and more and gives me the feeling of wanting to be better. I have been experimenting with the controls and so far I highly recommend the keyboard instead of the controller since there are so many hot keys and the camera angle does not move automatically on your characters perspective. 

I will give this game more time and a rating of 8/10 for there are still so much more that can be improved in the future. I am still so new to the game and I still cant consider my self qualified to give such bad points that I know would only reflect back on my own lack of skill on the game. 

Like all the other reviews the skins and other pay-walled items does not give a boost or buff it will only show who is spending money for aesthetics so it does not matter who has the best looks or weapon skins at the end of the day this does require a bit of luck (in game) to get your hands on the gold items that are hidden somewhere in the map. 

If I were to suggest something for the game maybe at least give the most basic (grey) items or weapons at the very beginning if its possible its kinda hard walking the entire map naked with no weapon or armor and the bag is just full of armor repair or HP items."
9517,THIS GAME IS IS SICK
9518,"[h1]It's a mechanically fun game with issues and questionable design decisions[/h1]
[b]It has potential but at the moment i would not recommend getting it.[/b]

The game is interesting, there's mechanical depth and bunch of content in terms of weapons/characters.
Monetization is quite aggressive - you'd expect that by paying 20 bucks upfront you'd get some higher standard than free to play games like Apex but no - there's exact same monetization scheme with very expensive skins, lootboxes (with dupes btw.) and mobile game like psychological ploys, like the game asking you whether you really want to quit with no other way of dismissing the prompt for more than 24 hours or default interaction for lootboxes being ""open one more"" even if you don't have any in your inventory. All in all sure enough, monetization so far is only for cosmetics and in future for heroes (along with option to unlock for free - the key will be here in just how much favorable would be the pricing for actual money to unlock new heroes than grind them for free).
Performance isn't as good as one would hope it'd be, the game looks okay but it's nothing groundbreaking, hopefully that'll improve over time with promised DX12 update - in the mean time DLSS is a life saver if you can use it.
Some people also reported severe stuttering issues along with game freezing entirely for couple of seconds during combat, personally i never had such issues but there's plenty of videos on reddit demonstrating it with no known cause or solution.

All in all those are relatively small issues if you're interested just in gameplay.
Gameplay wise there are balancing and small technical issues which potentially could be worked out with time.
The biggest issue so far is high-ping abuse where people can just use VPN to connect to different region datacenter, this results in every match having bunch of such abusers which currently aren't being blocked in any way from doing so.
In practical terms both EU and NA servers are dominated by chinese people, couple of hours in the game or a quick glance at leaderboards clearly explains current status of the situation.
Chinese population on non Asian servers is easily tenfold of what i've ever seen in any other online game, be it paid or free.
To clarify a fraction of that might be legitimate people living in given region due to work/study circumstances but given the unparalleled scale of the occurrence i'm not inclined that vast majority of such people would fall under this category.

I would recommend giving this game a try when (or if) there are some technical improvements made, especially to networking and handling bad actors when it comes to ping abuse - be it from china or any other region."
9519,"Me and a Friend got it and we live in Brisbane, AUS.  So far so good on the Devs with their ""Node"" they have set up in Sydney. 
 We're getting around 40ms and the game is playable.  Only played a few matches with bots but we're having fun warming up.  Loving everything so far and hopefully this game does well.  The Devs listen so if they keep it up they deserve it."
9520,good game something new in br
9521,:D
9522,"the game is so bad,

the combat is cluncky
if you have a bad ping, you cannot get hitted, so you win every fight
cheats everywhere

WHAT IS THIS GAME OMG"
9523,This game is soooo good but it need an OCE SERVER!!!!!
9524,Pow (short for powers)
9525,this game is amazing the players that are giving it bad reviews have bad pcs for this age and lag all over and die to players like me i can see their frustration but its not the games fault they need to upgrade and get mad this game is amazing i cant wait for the new characters :)
9526,"great game, really enjoy play with my friends"
9527,good game but grapple is auto aim..need to fix it.
9528,"grappling hook, parkour, make waifu, yes"
9529,"Boobs like melon , sexy ninja"
9530,"melee battle royal is something new, enjoying it"
9531,as someone who hates physic i really do find this game's physic incredibly good especially when  it Jiggles.
9532,"Is good and cool. Good combat, i dont like BRs but i like this one.

Few things i dont like - 90 seconds lobby (too long) and 1st minute skirmishes if you havent found melee weapon and armor can be annoying (you cant really run from people)."
9533,"Kungfu battle royale? well, why not

"
9534,It's the most fun i have had with a Battle Royale to date. It's combat is pulse pounding and the game is gorgeous. If you have 20 dollars lying around i recommend this game.
9535,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Love it."
9536,"Honestly, this could be a great game. Let's ignore the fact that some weapons need certain tweaks and balance changes, because that is not a reason to hate the game, although it is very annoying. Mechanic of a fight is so far really enjoyable, mobility and graphics are great and the game is really good during certain hours. To be precise, during hours that most of China, Taiwan, Korea etc. finally have to sleep. The game's biggest flaw is as other comments said the servers. I love that Europe has their own server but i kinda doesn't mean anything at the moment. You cannot enter a game, with no Asian players having ping that goes absolutely mental so you can see them teleporting around the place and taking damage in kind of random moments. When you get into a party with high ping players and start a conversation, they might speak english but if you want them to keep talking to you, don't you dare to ask where are they from and why are they on this server, because from my experience, their microphones suddenly break and they became deaf aswell. 
When the moment that too high ping cannot enter a match, or servers are locked, this game does deserve thumbs up, but no way at this point. It is too big of a issue and it ruins fun competitive gameplay that you pay 20 euros for."
9537,"Game harder than Sekiro double hard mode XD. 
Joke, they are in two entirely different genres of games, not really comparable. 

[h1]Best Battle Royale Game I Have Ever Played![/h1]

The game is challenging--has a much higher learning curve than other battle royale games--but super, super, super fun once you get used to the mechanics. 

Every weapon has its unique combos and every character has his/her unique abilities and builds that can be customized to a degree. It goes beyond Fortnite, Apex, or PUBG, with super fast paced combat that requires you to read your opponents' move and react to it in a split second, and super fast mobility in game with grappling hooks. It also has elements of games like Kurtzpel, Smash, and Dragon Ball Fighter, where you need to learn the optimal combo with your weapons and characters to lock enemy down. The unique counter and focus mechanic makes the combat more interesting by providing ways for you to fight back mid-combo, by reading or predicting the enemies moves. Moreover, the graphic of the game is fantastic; everything is super artistically designed and creates a perfect atmosphere of Eastern Warring Kingdom Era. 

If you like battle-royale, combo-fighting games, definitely give the game a try!"
9538,Titties.
9539,I love the skill gap that makes this game competitive. There's a big learning curve but once you are past that the game is really fun.
9540,"This game is amazing, it has so much potential they even have their own dedicated discord server to report bugs, glitches, meet new players from different regions, give tips and tricks. This game has an amazing concurrent community and they are working on solving issues with other regions like mine. This is being achieved by opening more nodes or regional servers."
9541,Hands down awesome
9542,"i love this game personally and i consider it one of the best Battle Royale games i have played , it has many things to it , like you can parkour everywhere swinging your katana using abilitites flying from place to place , also it has alot of UWU characters the game is just amazing"
9543,fun but spear needs to change zzz
9544,"After playing this game for about 20 hours in trios and solos both ranked and quick matches. I can say the state of the game seems healthy as ranked seems to have more higher skilled players than quick matches. I would personally recommended to play some bloodbath games and training before hoping into some games as you will probably get chewed up pretty fast. 

The game seems to be more orientated about making your own combos with certain weapons (melee) and adjusting to different characters. 
Game isn`t pay to win which seems great as the in game currency you make can upgrade your abilities and you cant buy this currency, Only cosmetics but some of the free cosmetics seem pretty fire. 
Theirs no Duos which is quite a annoyance but matchmaking isn`t too bad. 
Map design is great as you do feel quite immersed with the surroundings and the sounds of the game. 

As of so far i am really enjoying the game and definitely recommend the game to anyone reading this. I guess we just have to see what the game holds in store for us later down the road."
9545,"Game's good fun and quite unique. A BR that I actually enjoy as much as PUBG, although, they are completely different :)"
9546,gg
9547,the control is too bad

-Combat (some of the combos you can pull off)
-Hero Types (pretty diverse)
-Game/Server Performance

Cons:
-2 prominent weapons and their broken combos.
-Spamfest on grapples and light attacks.

Its a descent battle royale and surprisingly well made chinese game.

9553,WHAT A GAME
9554,is fun
9555,I like swords
9556,"This game needs serious changes otherwise it will die very fast. Pros are that it is a very fast paced melee oriented BR with some ranged weapons such as a bow, musket, and cannon. It has a very fluid movement system that allows for intense chases, combat fluidity, etc. Cons the combat is a fucking wreck, the game makes you interested with the flashy combos and weapon variety but in all reality the game has devolved into using 2 weapons and light spamming with them into a stun lock that you cant get out. If youre playing solos and dont choose Yoto Hime, Matari, or Kurumi your chances of winning drop exponentially. Yoto Hime basically gets a free kill evertime she uses her tactical, especially if she uses her ult. Matari with a dagger is a light spam fight that makes you want to pull your hair out and smash the closest object possible. Kurumi with her abilites whether it be in the final circle or just in a 1v1 fight is nigh impossible to kill. Trios is a whole other beast that I wont get into for this review. The game claims to have an impressive anti cheat software but I cant count how many times ive been double headshot sniped by a bow from a ridiculous distance away by some player with Chinese or Japanese characters as their username. I have yet to see it with any player that has an English username so clearly there is not equal regulation when it comes to the Asian fanbase of this game. Its extremely disappointing that this game has devolved into light spamming, obvious hacking, and clearly over powered characters. It has the potential to be an amazing BR that could claim the throne of melee BR's but unless they make the proper balances and changes to melee combat it will continue to be nothing more than an aggro spam fest simulator."
9557,"Great texture, great mechanism."
9558,Dope combat.....fun......
9559,"iz gud

Edit: Game has a great core concept and stands out from any other Battle Royale I have played. That being said there are some core issues that need to be addressed with both connections and game-play before I can honestly recommend the game.

There is no ping restriction to the servers so anyone can connect to whatever server they want. This poses an issue in a game with tight controls and parry timing when up against an opponent on the other side of the world (literally).

Additionally the weapons and characters seem to be very unbalanced. There are some weapons that are completely worthless compared to others regardless of whether they fit your play style or not. 

The ranking system has some serious issues that could be addressed with some transparency on how the scoring works. Why when I get 15 kills and do 20K damage in top 3 am I only rewarded 11 points, but in a loss where i'm still within top 10 and have only 4 kills do i LOSE 7 points. Its frustrating and makes any progress towards a ranking system feel hopeless.

Aesthetically the game is fantastic. All the characters sound, look, and feel unique. The environment is great (spare the few times your character will be stuck from some free running glitch)

The main issue is that this game is being pushed so hard as the next big e-sport without having the dedicated team to balance and regulate content it would need for that legitimacy.

TLDR: Amazing Concept, Poor Execution."
9560,"a battle royale game i truly enjoy with some fast paced action and combat, with hardcore parkour. I've had this game less than a week and i already got 30+ hours on it, it certainly is worth the price."

9564,"This game have a lot of potential but i hate the loot system in any kind of games  especially when we already bought the game.  So far the combat is good, the parkour,grappling and hook system is so satisfying and i can see this game got a high ceiling level of mechanic so people who want to play this game need to learn the depth,mechanic,trick,timing & counterpart otherwise you will rage XD"
9565,"good game
"
9566,yes
9567,very fun combat system i liekes ;)
9568,I don't recommend this game in the slightest until they fix the servers or at the very least add a proper OCE server over the node that almost never does what its supposedly meant to do
9569,Having fun so far!
9570,"Game is fun, battle royale kind of game with difference aspects. Graphics is good. Would recommend!"
9571,ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
9572,So far so good 🤩
9573,"A very solid BR game if you don't want to play a shooter. 

The combat and movement systems have some real depth once you realize how many animations you can crouch and dash cancel. Once you get a feel for it, this game can produce some of the coolest looking battles I've seen in a multiplayer game."
9574,"To start I would like to say that I hardly ever review games negatively. I actually really enjoy this game and play trios with my squad a lot. That being said, this game needs a serious hero balance. Its almost unplayable at points, especially when you can stack the same heroes in trios (cough, 3 Yoto's, cough). I've been following this game for a while and want to keep playing but something needs to be done or else i'm going to lose interest quickly. Certain heroes feel very underwhelming and others are clearly superior. I understand its impossible to make it perfect but a few small nerfs and buffs would go a long way for the longevity of this game. I'm genuinely having fun with the game as a whole and will change this review when i stop getting one tapped by Yoto ults."
9575,"Let me preface this by saying I absolutely DESPISE battle royales but this one is so dam addicting ! I was initially interested in the game just because of the art style but after putting in 30 or so hours over the weekend, the gameplay is hella on point! Unlike other BRs, you don't just spend half an hour looting and then fucking die suddenly just because someone sniped you from halfway across the map. 

PROS:
- Cosmetics are freaking sick ! 
- ABUNDANCE of progression system which makes you wanna play continuously, every 
  hero, every weapons, has something for you to work towards to, not to mention the 
  battlepass is very fun to level up as well. 
- Every weapon can be OP if you learn them. 
- Every hero has their own gimmick and they're all fun to use.
- GRAPPLING HOOK!
- Map verticality & Freedom of movement. 
- Character customization is insane. 
- You can summon a fkin Anaconda from the sky?! 

CONS:
- Price and droprates for Lootboxes are BADDD :/ (Idk the actual rates but I got like 2 extreme loot from over 250 chests opened and one of them is from a guaranteed pull)
-  Optimization can be better

Honestly, just give it a try.."
9576,this shit is dope
9577,This game is awesome a breath of fresh air from all the other typical battle royal games and you don't have to be a sweaty pc player as I play this on a handheld device and still get wins . Check out my channel ( 2D over 3D ) if you don't believe me. Anyway please support this game and get it now you won't be disappointed 👍
9578,"yeah it's pretty fun

9579,Kurumi best girl!
9580,game needs a better tutorial i think but after learning the mechanics it feels so fun to fight people
9581,"Best Battle Royale Game I've played so far!!!

- Very fun to play and not tiring and stressful like the typical gun fights on other BR games
- Flawless combat mechanics, variation of play style and weapon of choice
- Utilization of player's environment

- 10/10 boob physics"

If you want to try a new kind of battle royal, give this a try.  Naraka's gameplay simulates that of Sekiro due to the grappling hook system. It's fun to play but difficult to master. Been playing this since beta last summer. 

Cons include spiky Ping and MS at peak hours."
9593,"* First few matches are against obvious bots, this means if you don't like the game within the first few matches, refund, or else you wont be able to

The gameplay is fun, challenging, and different. I usually dislike battleroyales, but this gives a nice good spin the genre. I like the action based combat which is deeper than you think, the more you dig in, the more interesting it is. 

Combat    9/10
Graphics   8/10
Gameplay 9/10

If the game was cheaper, or free I'd buy outfits more, but for $20 entry fee, outfits are a optional thing for you to buy, or gamble as you level up via lootbox. Overall, I do recommend it.
"
9594,"I didn't play in the beta, but I now have over 100 hours of game time and I love it! Deep combat and customization in a martial arts battle royale, done so very well! 

Currently I'm top 500 solo players, and top 7 percent teams. A learning curve yes, but very rewarding, checks so many boxes that I wished for in a game!

See you on the battlefield!"

9603,"Really not a good game- be cautious with your purchase. I got the ultimate edition because all the gameplay I saw seemed so fluid and dynamic. Turns out it is flat and uninteresting. You start the game by playing against 100% bots and when you get into the big leagues (AKA normal games) the matchmaking teams you with similar players, but against any of the biggest sweats. Combat becomes impossible when trying to survive against the onslaught of brutal players. Bonus, with the ultimate edition you need two hours of playtime to access half the paid-for rewards (conveniently just enough time to make it so you can't return it).
I might try to play it again, but the pre-purchase/early game is not worth it. Save yourself."

9606,good
9607,fantastic game play
9608,Get ready for a bunch of people from Asia with 300 ping playing in North America
9609,this is one of the better battle royale games i've played. the learning curve on this game is very gradual but after playing for a few hours and looking at the combo lists you'll having a great time playing hot zones and coming out on top. the variety of weapons is very enjoyable having a major focus on melee combat but not leaving ranged weapons behind giving them very high damage due to it being difficult to hit fast moving targets with single shot weapons like the bow or musket. the rng is very forgiving making it possible to win with any loadout if you have the skill and an understanding of the basic combos and cancels. Overall this game is perfect for you cracked out adhd people. ALSO YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF SQUIDWARD
9610,"Naraka is a game that I really thought I'd like, but all the hype and goodwill I thought I had around it died as soon as I booted the game up. There are so many things I didn't like in this game compared to the beta test and honestly, the fact that the development team let it launch in such a way is just embarrassing. 

One character, Kurumi, is completely useless in the Arena mode. It plays similar to a traditional Deathmatch mode from any other multiplayer game, and you can use your abilities exactly how you can in the BR mode. Kurumi's moves all center around healing teammates, and since you can't HAVE teammates in Arena mode, she's basically unplayable if you want to win. Did you want to show off that awesome costume you got for your favorite character? Well, if it happened to be one of the ten characters in the game that doesn't have any abilities that can be used in Arena, sorry I guess. 

The combat that everyone seems to be praising is honestly not as tight or precise as I'd hoped. Sometimes attacks track, sometimes they don't, sometimes they track so hard that even trying to aim at another player while your first target is running away makes you swing at the dust they kick up behind them. The weapons all seem fine, but honestly I struggle to find a reason you'd want to use anything other than the Spear because the range is so long. For some reason, the default binding for Counter/Parry is M2+M1 at the same time, and using it this way was just needlessly difficult. Sometimes it would work, most times it wouldn't. I changed it to a side button. 

The game also employs the use of bots for your first couple levels/games. They say this is to ease new players into the experience of playing so they don't just get stomped by experienced players and all that. Honestly, I believe them. Starting a game like this up just to get steamrolled by a group of 3 sweats that have played the game since launch would make me refund it, so I'm not even upset about the bot games. I do think they should just let you know IN the game rather than in a news update on Steam. Because they tuck it away in a Steam News announcement, the chance exists that you won't even know you're playing against bots and that mindlessly mashing M1 doesn't work and by the time you're forced to actually learn the combat system further past that point, it's very likely too late to refund it if you decide that getting better isn't what you bought the game for. 

The new pre-order bonus character, Yoto-Hime, is probably the best character in the game by a long shot because she can always get out of a combo by using her ability and then once she uses it she has so many options. In addition, she's the only character with only 1 available skin, and this skin is only available if you buy it for $20...which is the price of the game.

The monetization of this game is the complete opposite of what it was like during the beta.

In the Beta, all of the skins in the game were able to be unlocked with either Tae (In-Game Currency) or Gold (Premium buy-only currency). Now that the game has launched and they have set this precedent, they completely change the way getting and grinding for skins works in this game. Almost every single skin is lootbox exclusive. I went through and counted myself, and if I recall correctly, all characters have 1 skin out of around 18 or so that you can purchase with Tae, and all weapons have 2. Characters and Weapons each also have like, 1 or 2 skins you can earn by grinding out to a high enough level by just playing the game, but BOTH of the skins that are earned this way are simple recolors of the basic F2P potato sack. Every other thing is ""earned"" by lootboxes. Each character also has a ""Super-Premium"" skin that you can buy with gold, and with the way the Gold is priced, you're spending another $20 for one skin.

 In a game that I had to pay $20 for? How much money do you need? When you launched with about the same amount of content that other F2P Battle Royale games have and then charge $20 to buy the game and then ANOTHER $20 to buy a single skin, you look greedy. When you charge $20 for a skin that I could previously buy with Tae in the beta, you look like liars. And when you lock almost all of the skins in the game behind lootboxes AFTER changing the method to unlocking them from the beta, you look like a refunded game made by greedy liars."
9611,good game and the first battle royal that out of my mind
9612,Noice
9613,"Friend bullied me into buying the game, then didn't play with me the next day. Now I have a serious addiction and am going through severe withdrawal in the few minutes I've stepped away to write this review. 10/10 would get bullied into debilitating dependency again!"
9614,"Can't recommend the game in it's current state. The release was fun and fine but shortly after people realized that the game favours high ping instead of the better ping thus people from other regions started to join other regions servers to get an advantage. Fighting doesn't become a skill anymore but pure luck. 
(Almost every game now on EU you run into someone with a Chinese name that's kill leader due to these isssues.)
That on top of quite a few balancing problems and cheaters in general makes the game unenjoyable. 
The game is great in it's core but something needs to be done by the developers. 
Region lock the damm servers or restrict access on a certain ping level."
9615,Good game
9616,"Great change of pace from other battle royale games. It's fun, refreshing, and has a good progression system. I haven't encountered any pay to win mechanics, yet."
9617,sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
9618,"It's a fun game, but I would hold off on buying it until they figure out a way to deal with the 300 ping players that teleport around because of desync. For some reason, high latency players can hit you, but you can't hit them, and when you get near these players, the game will lose connection repeatedly until they move away from you. This lets people using a VPN go and play on a server nowhere near them so they can abuse this problem. Aside from this issue, the game is great (the monetization is questionable, though)

It has a character editor that allows you to customize the faces of the default characters. The weapons are balanced for the most part, with nothing seeming like an instant win. The characters at the moment (could likely change in the future) all fill a specific role instead of being balanced around broken FotM picks like League of Legends. The game should probably be F2P, and it likely will be at some point, but you will get a lot out of the game for $20 if it looks fun to you or you enjoy fighting games."
9619,"The aesthetics of this game is fantastic.  The combat is fun and dynamic.    But it's not a walk in the park, it punishes you not learning or mastering the mechanics.  There are some issues with desync that can really ruin the experience depending on the connection quality."
9620,"This is a Great Game! The combat is well done and really engaging! Very skill based game! I really Enjoy it! Totally worth the price, if you are at least a bit interested you should give it a try!"

9635,"the game is so fast paced but once you get the controls and gameplay mechanics it becomes fun and really competitive, it rewards perseverance and patience mid battle but you always have to adapt because its not always going to be a 1v1 scenario."
9636,It is amazing!!!!!
9637,game is shit
9638,"best battleroyal
"
9639,It's a pretty fun game! One of the few BR games that doesn't frustrate me and is actually enjoyable.
9640,Phenomenal
9641,fun game
9642,"The game itself is extremely fun; however, it is plagued with some big issues. The devs guaranteed that Chinese players would not be able to join NA/EU servers (they had the game a month prior to global release so there is a huge skill gap) yet every lobby is plagued with CN players dominating it at every rank. There is a huge teaming issue in all lobbies as well. Standing on a pebble can cause your attacks to miss due to elevation differences. People with high ping are nigh unkillable due to teleporting around and you are unable to properly counter them due to it.

Overall, I would avoid this game until those issues are fixed."
9643,"The fighting in this game is fantastic and there's lots of ways to get cosmetics for free! 

+ The mobility in this game is amazing <3 I love it"
9644,"59 other players for you to stab, shoot, cut, chop, blow to bits, and set on fire."
9645,"it's actually a lot of fun to play, especially if your'e team up with your friends."
9646,nice
9647,"Really fun game, exciting and fast paced. Hate to say but if you're comp or internet are on the slower side, you will not have a fun time. Very hack and slashed type game play with some ranged mechanics. Games are relatively short so you can bang out a game or two before having to do something. All in all, I find it really nice for people who get easily bored of games really quick. 9/10 Very nice!
"
9648,"looking for a melee BR this is it!!! amazing graphics and gameplay, worth the buy for sure imo"
9649,"its the mele PVP game ive always dreamed of
i hope they keep adding more modes that are not BR"
9650,its one of a kind
9651,"I can recommend the game! worth the money.  >>>>>BUT>>>>>>

 But it needs some more features! like i would put mini bosses around the map for some kind of buffs for a different period of time in return for killing them! i think i would also make the combat system a bit more easier! I am not having problem killing peoples but i do know alot ppls especialy beginners are strugeling to MASTER the combos and of course the parry mechanics. i think  its good to not make it that easy to learn and master the movements etc everything related to combat! But you need to think about the players that dont have alot time for learning everything and practicing hours a day. Somebody might just wana pop online sometimes and play few games but maybe dont have more time so.. but in General the game is very good and i recommned highly. Hope i helped here and there. :)"
9652,im in pain.
9653,Nice game
9654,Fun Game
9655,"I hate BR games but for some reason, I love playing this game. It could be the fact that there are heroes with different abilities like Apex that can spice up the team comps. The combat is fun and fast pace for most of the time but when it doesn't work its really painful. Overall I think that Naraka can be a great game and the fact that I can be into a BR while I dislike most BR in the market, simply amazes me. Go ahead and pick up a copy and if it doesn't strike you fancy, you can always ask for a refund!"
9656,"If you're like me and you thought this game looked really cool but absolutely HATE battle royale games, don't worry. The game also has a FFA/Deathmatch type mode for people that just want the action.

Gameplay is pretty solid especially if you like action and fighting games and are looking for something in between, though one personal glaring flaw is that it is kind of a low blow from the devs that you're put up against bots up until you're near or even past the refund point. Just be aware of that."
9657,"One of the best BR i'have ever played for a long time. Fun and skilled, thos are 20 bucks well spent."
9658,good.
9659,"I actually really like the game. The combat is simple but complex enough to keep you engaged and feel like you need to learn more and ""git gud"". Sure there may be some balancing that needs to happen, but it's so fun regardless."
9660,Very Polished
9661,Give 24 Entertainment a 9/10 rating; give NetEase a 1/10 rating
9662,Be sure to put this game on SSD. Game is amazing.
9663,"Extremely FUN. Naraka needs more players.
Worth every penny.
Character customization, made Matari with eyes like a vagina, named her VaginaEyes. I am actually proud of myself. GG."
9664,"super fun! still a lot of mini bugs but all around a great idea, hope to see QOL updates and movement udates too!"
9665,"Haven't had fun in playing video games for a LONG time and this is so refreshing that it's not a shooter where I'm complete ass and everyone has already been honing their aim for years. It feels overly complicated at the start, but some practice fighting against ai and testing out movesets, then going to the all for one arena mode, and spamming it for a few games you'll get the hang of it a lot easier than playing actual matches which was a big mistake on my part at the start. It definitely has a rock paper scissor vibe, so it rewards learning multiple weapons for different opponents."
9666,It's different from other battle royales
9667,"Positives and negatives about the game.

+ Fun gameplay
+ Good take on a battle royal
+ No pay to win
+ Good balance between characters and weapons

- To much focus on in game purchases 
- Bad connections in a few games

Full Review of the game.

After 32 hours in the game i feel like I have a good take on the game. There is little story to be found in Naraka, the heavy lifting is done by the gameplay. I think they really have succeeded in creating a fun, fast paced and engaging combat in the game.  

The game has at launch 7 characters, all with unique skills and 13 weapons both ranged and melee. All the characters are useful in there own way, of course some more than others but it feels like there is a good balance. Same goes for the weapons even though some are slow to swing and others are much quicker.

They have implemented a good and smart rock paper scissors balance when it comes to combat. There is no block mechanic so light attacks can be stopped with a charged attack, a charged attack can be stopped with a counter, a counter can't stop a light attack. Sounds easy, is not so easy in the middle of combat and you have to react fast.

The game has a free for all combat game mode and battle royal for singelplayer or 3 people teaming up. Everything is fairly standard and can be compared to Apex Legends with the loot tear, you do get to chose where you wanna spawn on the map and you can se where every one else is spawning. There is no pay to win but the game has a big focus on buying cosmetics and loot boxes. The game is a bit aggressive with this for my taste.

All in all a good game, fun gameplay, can recommend to check out at least."
9668,great grappling mechanics
9669,big sword go swing swing

9673,booba
9674,"I think this is a fantastic game. It's so damn fun it's crazy. Think like Tenchu Rise from Darkness if you remember that.
The main point I'm writing this review is to hopefully disspell the ""negative"" view that you are playing against bots sometimes. Yes, the devs even flat out said ""Yes, it's to welcome new players.""
For those not aware, Fortnite does this too. It's not a shady tactic to pull a gotcha. It's to encourage players that they're good at the game and it doesn't hurt to feel good racking up some kills, getting better stuff, and then destroying an actual squad of players.
All in all I really enjoy this game. Cosmetic acquiring is a little grindy but not to the point of boredom. Some of it is behind a paywall but lots of it is actually earnable via completing missions or unlocking them, which is a tad confusing on the account of how many menus lead to x then y then z."
9675,"eh, it's okay"
9676,"This game needs 3 thing's:
150 PING LIMIT
Increased FOV! 
Reworked parry system...

Every single f'ing game I get matched with 400 PING SEA PLAYER ARE YOU MAD? Makes parry blocking dodging and hitting impossible... The parry is more luck than anything else... First the parry has to be perfect but even that is not enough you have to guess your opponents ping to make it work also you have to pray the key you bound actually works LOL... 

Could be a good BR IF they fix the issues that exist currently.

EDIT: Still not playable on EU because of moronic devs refusing to add a pinglimit and instead they working on making it ""better"" to have high ping player in your lobby. 

Reddit statement: We have optimised net code to ensure players with high ping don’t disrupt the normal flow of NARAKA’s combat. We understand it’s frustrating to play against players with high ping — so we will continue to evaluate this — it’s among our highest priorities to solve this issue.

9677,I like it
9678,"This game is so different and fun, plus who doesn't like looking cool with swords, daggers, pistols and flipping through the air?"
9679,"To make it short, I like the game. My experience is with the solo mode only so I can't say anything about the team mode. In solo it seems balanced enough once you know what the heroes do, and know the game in general."
9680,The game is good but the spear kinda too good for an easy weapon to us
9681,a fresh game
9682,"IMO this is a pretty underrated game and is worth $20 for sure. I have played many many MANY different types of MMO RPG PVP BG's and this feels like a very fine mix of modern multiplayer battle ground, and classic PC style PVP. The graphics are nice, the PVP is unique and fun to play. The one downfall, 1v3 in a trio, your'e getting slaughtered...Take the time to join their discord and find a trio instead of randoming, it will pay off. I plan on putting some time into this gem."
9683,"Such unique combat for a BR-based game. Puts such an emphasis on technical play and makes you feel the skill gap of players at different ranked levels when climbing.

It’s like Sekiro re-imagined as a BR.

The customization and skins are definitely appealing as well.

"
9684,its fun
9685,Perfect!
9686,was better in beta
9687,"Weapons feel the same. Especialy sword and katana. Attacks feel the same aswell, nothing really to do but click and hope you hit. Want to use a powerd attack? fat chance the enemy moves. Shooting is the same. No costumizing weapons/loadouts, you pick your favo weapon and then it's just, try to get a higher grade. Nothing more then that. Gem's are the only way to really upgrade, and you need to be lucky to find the ones you can even use. Like you got a Katana, you find spear skills. If it wasent for the graple hook and the wall walking this would just be ""The Purdge"". 

Ppl like this because they are thirsty for a good game. And sinds nothing good is really being released or it's just a rehash of a old game (like this is). They buy it and think it's good. Thirsty thisty gamers. Letting there standards slide because they are to bored."
9688,"favorite fighting game in years, simple as that."
9689,This game is TOTALLY AWESOME! THE INTENSE PVP AND COMBAT IS JUST SPECTACULAR! ESPECIALLY THE STUNNING VISUALS!!!! Also I HIGHLY ADVISE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE EXPERIENCING LAG GAME STUTTERS TO INSTALL THIS GAME ONTO AN SSD. IT HELPED SO MUCH! I AM NOW STUTTER FREEEEEE!!!!!
9690,Stunlock combat. So engaging. So much counterplay.
9691,"You kill and win for 3 matches...
You get killed instantly after those matches... NOICE!!"
9692,"good action combat. Very smooth compared to the beta. Solid launch with a lot of the issues in beta fixed. If you like action combat and you're a fan of battle royals, I recommend this game."
9693,Trees and bushes are speaking.
9694,"All of the reviews are pretty much talking about in game purchases and microtransactions which honestly shouldn't be a let down to play the game because they're all very much cosmetic and you can get access to pretty much everything without paying in game items.

Aside from that the game play is very fun its like dark souls met sekiro in a battle royale the mechanics are amazing the play style in each characters abilities makes it really fun it is honestly a great game and i do recommend checking it out and playing with your friends!"
9695,"This game is awesome all the way around. Fast paced, yet skilled fighting, along with amazing character movement and customization. The best in the ""Battle Royal"" genre. I would recommend to anyone not yet playing Naraka!"
9696,It's good.
9697,Holy mother of fun!!! This is a blast even getting pooped on leveling up the character. Test your mite in a Big sword battle. BTW BUY THIS FIRST THEN IF YOU LIKE IT BUY THE DLC. So to all the people complaning on the DLC READ THE ABOUT FIRST!
9698,Great game!
9699,great game
9700,great pvp
9701,Perfect Game except (I wish the graphic quality is higher and more realistic)
9702,dank mode

9704,chupaulo cacnio
9705,good game for multiplayer with 2 of your friends please use my code ( ch8tt68kck ) first time entering the game
9706,PLEASE FIX THE VC. I HAVE NEVER HEARD MORE RACIAL SLURS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE ( IN THE PRE GAME LOBBY. ALSO ONLY HAVE 19 HOURS ) AND YOU CANNOT TELL WHO IS SAYING WHAT SO YOU CANT EVEN REPORT. FIND A WAY TO FIX THIS
9707,"This game has it's moments. It is a fun take on the BR genre. A setting that is often underused in NA games. When the game flows it is a fast paced exciting team fight.

 But it has in game battle pass that you have to pay for. Loot box mechanics in a game you already have to pay for will never be a buy in my book. Are they currently cosmetic only? Yes but that is no guarantee that will always remain the case. 

The main page essentially funnels you to the shop to buy the latest dlc on top off the game you just purchased to go with the battle pass you have to buy every season; this will always be a downvote from me. 

This is all before we talk about the spotty slide jump and animation lock mechanics that are in the game that makes, the sometimes fluid movement, often janky and unrewarding. Leaving you frustrated in combat that often doesn't feel like your fault. If you mash buttons you will have a bad time, but there also isn't always reliable animation cancel for the technical side for combos. Some combos can be cancelled out of while others can't and there is no clearly defined combo type (doubt light, double charge, vert charge, etc) across all weapons. Some animations are que locked on one weapon but that same combo animation won't be que locked on another.

 This game has it's moments, it's just too bad those moments don't overshadow the negatives."
9708,perfect game
9709,Ran better in beta
9710,"Absolutely amazing refresh to Battle Royal style games. This is a lot of fun and different experience then fortnite or warzone. Thank you to all the creators, Devs, and publishers"
9711,nice)))
9712,"Fun game, I honestly hope more people play. Haven't looked at reviews yet, but I imagine there is a lot of bitchin about bots. Only the first few games you play are bots, so that people can get used to the controls"
9713,This game is very cool. You need to try it.
9714,Probably the most fun Battle Royale I've played.
9715,"This is one of the best games currently on the market, and I truly believe that.

COMBAT: unbelievably in depth but also simple.
what I mean by that is that its relatively simple to learn.  There are light attacks, heavy attacks and counters.  This works as a rock paper scissor mechanic.

You can be relatively decent ""button masher"" if you understand this combat.

But oh boy is it also in depth if you want to take the time.  You can dodge by sidestepping and EVEN duck under horizontal ""light"" strikes.

Its pretty fast and you can move around like a true ninja, which feels FANTASTIC as you play.  Again you can certainly work to be at the top skill gap, but you will find that with a basic understanding and little practice you can still be pretty decent and feel like a boss.

GRAPHICS:  I cant name a single BR that looks more beautiful than this game.  The japanese art style and environment detail is unbelievable. 

CUSTOMIZATION:  This is the insane part.  One of my biggest complain with multiplayer is the inability to really customize your character.  BR's typically put out a ton of skins that can differentiate you from many others.  Which this game does too.

But what it does on top of that is the most intense RPG-style customization that rivals even the BEST customization in any game.  Im talkin down to the eyebrows.

HERO SELECTION:  In depth.  Yes there are certain abilities which ""seem"" to be the best for solo play, but it really doesnt make a huge difference if you even kind of know what you're doing.  You will likely fight someone during their ult and get clapped a couple times, but once you figure it out its almost like learning a boss fight in an MMO.  Everything CAN be beaten with practice.

BOTS:  Yes there are bots.  But everyone complaining is being such a cry baby about it.  Especially in early levels the developers add bots so that you can learn the curve.  

It helps you to feel better, learn the combat, and be more confident.  As you climb the ranks there will be less bots.

If there were 0 bots, everyone would complain ""learning curve is too hard WAHH WAHHH WAHHH"".  call the wahmbulance bro.  The game is fantastic you salty MF, just play and get good.

All in all I have very little complaints about this game.  What I WOULD really like to see are modes like ""bloodbath"" but for teams of 2 or 3.  The combat is so excellent in this game that would really benefit from other multiplayer game styles.  I think most people are getting bored of BR anyway.

Do yourself a favor. GET THIS GAME.  It so SO WORTH 20 bucks.  I have played for 27 hours already.  That would be like I paid $0.75 an hour for some of the best entertainment I've had in gaming for years."
9716,"Awesomeness at Peak :). I got to know this game just a few months before the Final Beta, saw it on a random youtube video. Was hooked at the concept of the battle royal in the melee genre, was amazed at how this was and i loved the gameplay. Then the beta hit the steam then wow i was mind blown. Preordered it instantly and here i am playing this everyday :) Great game to play with friends. Great Soundtrack as well."
9717,"Controller adjustments still need to be made but the game overall is a great experience, very competitive but a good casual play through is welcome too very accepting community willing to share knowledge of the game and help you learn as well. solid 10/10"
9718,"PROS: 
- Gameplay fun.
- Fighting 1v1 is very fun because of the different combos you can do and also you can parry (darksoul style)
- Characters are pretty much balanced for a new game.
- Each character have a basic ability and a ultimate.
- I do like the fact that you can climb in trees and shoot at ppl with range weapons.
- Bloodbath gamemode is fun and is useful to practice before going in a BR match.
- In BR mode you can mark items for your teamates. I think they`ve done it well.
- A lots of different weapons.
- Very good graphics.
- Beautiful skins
- With a few hours of gameplay, I was able to unlock new skins without paying.
- Lots of quest and achievements.
- Character face customization is a good addition

CONS:
- IMO, Bots should be removed after 2 or 3 games.
- A tutorial on different combo strings with each weapons would be nice to have.

GAME MODE THAT WOULD BE FUN:
- Tournament, 10 or more players in the game but its 1 v 1 and others are spec. I think that would be cool.
- Capture the flag."
9719,Grappling hook go brrrrRRR
9720,This game is amazing. It's definitely the best battle royale out as of now imo. The character customization is a great as well. I only wish you could put more than one tattoo on a face but other than that 10/10 game so far. Would like to see the new characters they release later in the future.
9721,"Give the game a little time, it may seem like a cluster with rock, paper, scissor style combat, but the incorporation of [b]｢ [i] T h e G r a p p l e [/i] ｣[/b] enables movement freedom. Use this to your advantage and learn how to effectively reposition, reset, and reengage.

Edit 13/09/21: Can't recommend this game until region/ping locks get implemented"
9722,"very good game has ,it is something completely new and i love it"
9723,REALLY GOOD!!! servers can be abit dodge sometimes tho
9724,"An absolute blast to play. Sword combat feels so good!! Graphics are fantastic! Runs so smooth!

Best of all, I’m not getting dominated by someone using the new unbalanced weapon that drops every new season, (looking at you warzone).

Combines aspects of a lot of great games into one, once you start playing you’ll see what I mean."
9725,"well its decent, I like it but its not addicting for me...
so a solid 8/10 for this game."
9726,"wery good game...litle lagy,but its ok"
9727,"Trash game just mashing attack and if u parry wrong time you die against masher
hahaha, fps drop preformenc is joke even on 3080 and ssd
0/10"
9728,"I WOULD ACTUALLY WANT MY REFUND IF THEY DON'T FIX THE SERVERS. HONESTY ITS A WASTE OF TIME ONCE THE FIRST CIRCLE CLOSES OR BEFORE A FIGHT IT LAGS HARD. THIS GAME SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN PROMOTE TO THE NA REGION AT ALL. THE SERVERS AND HOW SLOW THE GAME LOADS ITS UNBEARABLE. OH THE FIGHT SUCKS THERE IS NO ESCAPING A GRAPPLING HOOK WHILE OTHER TWO ENEMIES ARE SPAMMING COMBOS ON YOUR LIFELESS BODY! DO NOT BUY SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE!
"
9729,"I'm enjoying this game way too much. It's a unique experience, very different style of battle royal. Ignore the negative reviews and try it yourself."
9730,"There is some problem with SEA sever, keep connecting even my internet fucking damn good"
9731,"Naraka takes a unique perspective on the battle royal style of game. It feels kind of like some weird combination of a really smooth MMO, overwatch, and whatever generic battle royal game you choose.
"
9732,good
9733,作为一个只狼以及Spellbreak的玩家，参与了这个游戏的删掉测试。一开始新手教程的时候第一时间给到我的是既视感，但是随着游戏继续进行缓过神来发现这个游戏相当不错，把很多元素结合的恰当好处，甚至有一个让所有男人爱不释手的捏人系统（捏着捏着你就不能退款了）。现在这个游戏算正式开服了吧steam上，我喊我同学来玩，从七月算已经过一个月了，他说你不提我都忘了这个游戏再说吧，好，现在开始玩天天喊着上线。懂了吧，游戏是好游戏，氪金也是量力而行，你们是第一次认识网易吗，这个游戏相比其他的我觉得还行了
9734,"Refunded, bad game"
9735,very good game
9736,New style of BR. I'm having an insanely good fighting experience and it's very fun to play.
9737,"This is the most fun game I have tried, in quite some time. The skill cap on what can be done, is very , very high."
9738,"nice graphics and gameplay
"
9739,"honestly extremely fun game specially for a br which i'm not very fond of but this game just feels fun to play the movement is great, combos are not hard to learn but you also need an understanding of mechanics to understand how some specific combos work otherwise it's not consistent. HOWEVER there are issues with players with high ping, players teaming in solos, and trios being a clusterfuck of a gamemode to play. If you are patient with the game and like the traditional fighting game paper rock scissors style give this game a try."
9740,"Naraka has a lot of room for improvement. As it stands, it's a great experience until you encounter players with absurdly high ping. NA servers are currently flooded (about 50% if I were to give a guesstimate) with foreign players. That's not an issue with me, the intentional ping abuse by certain foreign players however, ruins the experience entirely. I still recommend the game. While the ping abuse definitely is disheartening when you encounter it, I still have an absolute blast playing Naraka."
9741,"If You Like Battle Royales + Kung Fu, This Is The Game For You. Hands Down Been Having Fun In This Game Since The Beta & I Know It Has Room To Grow, But Maaane Do You Get Your Bucks Worth!!"
9742,"Awesome graphics and gameplay is just really fun, i would recommend 100%"
9743,ของดีก็ชนะ ของกากก็แพ้ไป
9744,Really nice game! It's fun to play with friends
9745,"every thing i wanted in  a game

"
9746,if you dont take this game to seriously youll have a blast lol
9747,"If you spawn near an enemy and they load faster, you already lost."
9748,Add duos and the game will be perfect.
9749,"Nice
Nice
Nicee
"
9750,"Very Very fun game with a lot of options depending on your play style. Although this game requires a lot of skill, mastery of the weapons and combat system is necessary to progress in the game. when i first started i thought it would be a button masher but i couldn't be any more wrong. still recommend for the pure fact of how fun and different this game is."
9751,"The fact that this game starts with a warning explaining that if it isn't installed on an SSD, you will experience frame rate latency and stuttering issues should tell you everything you need to know about the current state of Naraka.

Even just loading into the tutorial took me over fifteen minutes. Forget about loading into a proper game. I'm talking ten full minutes of stuttering, textures not loading, full stop lag, and unresponsive keys. And that is AFTER the game has already started in you're in a round. This game clearly isn't well optimized yet, from a networking standpoint and a technical standpoint. Which is a real shame, because it's a beautiful game with a very interesting concept and a fresh take on battle royale games.

I will be refunding this game and maybe picking it up later once they have worked out the major frame rate and latency issues."
9752,Fun Game :)
9753,the best
9754,"Disclaimer: I have played hours of beta
Game is not bad, but disappointed in the business model.
For what the game offers, content and everything around it, this should have been a Free to Play.
The skins obtainable in game are trash, while (of course) the one in the cash shop are at least decent.
If you don't mind spending 20$ in a game that should have been f2p go for it, it can give hours of fun.

Note that playerbase is deceiving, 80% of playerbase is from China (look at peak hours to have proof), and they WILL use VPN to play in your lobbies with really high latency, making some fights really frustrating
"
9755,Good game.
9756,The movement is insane
9757,so fun game
9758,Nice
9759,So  funny
9760,cool
9761,Super fun
9762,Very noice ;)
9763,"Great design, graphically outstanding, the flow in animations is a winning point and the fact they managed to make it possible that 60 people can fight at the same time without it feeling laggy or unresponsive is a technical marvel. The combat system is simple and fun but it does reward skill and tactics. I certainly recommend the game for 20 bucks but it's not without its issues.

The game can be optimized further, especially on lower end PCs. The leveling system makes it unfair for newer players or people that play the game less, especially if they are able to climb ranks with what they have and reach high elo, they will be constantly getting stomped due to the progression system. I'd say ditch that part and just allow visual changes to characters. The store is a bit of a mess and the 'free' currency doesn't offer much aside from recolors of the original outfits and weapons, even that's limited.
The chests are as bad as one would expect, with a lot of 'customization fodder' meaning you'll get a bunch of emojis and things you don't like with slim chances of getting an outfit you actually enjoy and that's not helped by the fact both me and my friend somehow managed to opened the same set of items on two different accounts. I think the devs should give attention to that.
Matchmaking could use some work, as it queued me with 50+ games with someone that's literally on their first game, and since the devs mentioned that bots are used for people's first few games I find it a bit odd how we got matched up. Unless I'm just playing with much better bots right now and I haven't figured it out.

"
9764,"The game is fun, however not region locking servers for everyone makes it so that people who play the game in US/NA are forced to fight people such as, chinese hackers and ping exploiters. I can link so many websites that ""Sell"" Bladepoint hacks for your account, ESP and the such... YOu really need to stop copying other games with spellbreak and focus on your actual game, not just a cash grab.. Now the gameplay is fantastic, some of the weapons are needed balanced, for a released game... you should have addressed the issue of. ""Spear/longword"" meta that everyone runs now.. just remove every weapon from the game at this point.. ""Speak= 4 attacked into knock back before counterable"" ""Longsword: 3 attacks into knock up before counterable"" its super easy to cheese fights, especially if you are a player from the Asia area where your ping reaches upwards to 1-2k. Ive had players teleport behind me as I have them knocked down and beating on them, they just vanish and instantly kill me from behind with FULL armor and HP as if the past 10 seconds of me beating on them was nothing, becuse of their ping, they just ran and healed before my game even registered, Fix your game

All I am saying, Region lock your servers, make it fair for everyone or this game will end up like spellbreak and all the others.. ""Flopping and dying"" The people who post ""Positive reviews"" Dont really understand the concept of.. ""I just played bots for the first 2 games OH MAN am I good."" Then they get into real gameplay and consistantly killed by players with Foreign letters for their names that you have no idea what it means. Let them play the game like that for a while and then see how their positive review turns.

Fix your game"
9765,I can't lie i was hesitant to grab this game based simply on all the reviews as I've played a lot of batter royal games and each one of them has flopped or hasn't been the type of game I've been searching for But this game is something insane the skill alone required is crazy there's lots of space to learn but you've got to wanna put the time into it. personally if youre thinking of getting this game i'd say don't listen to the reviews buy it and let your mind me the judge of the game rather than a bunch of salty 12 year olds crying over a BR game being a pay to play
9766,"This game has fantastic movement tech, great combat mechanics, and insane character customization. I highly suggest after you go through the training that you play the game mode ""Blood Bath"" so that you can learn how other players fight until you feel comfortable playing BR. If you take a little time to learn the movement tech, your characters abilities, and a few combos you'll do fine.

10/10"
9767,This is the first time i play Battle Royale with Melee weapon and i can said this game can go furthur more with the weapon and the gameplay of this game.
9768,กระบี่ผีเสื้อดาวตก Ver.Upgrade ชัดๆ เล่นแล้วโคตรมันส์ จ้วงแทง จ้วงแทง !!
9769,I waited for a Mele BR game for a long time. They delivered. Now I just want them to continue doing a better job (sadge I can't get rid of mobile gachas to play this more but believe me i love it :( )
9770,fun. yes. a little clunky. but fun.
9771,"Good game for fighting game fans and battle royale fans. Mixes the genre well. BUT there is a couple things that are annoying, there is only a parry no blocks which can lead to pretty annoying deaths. Someone just spamming lights can stun lock you into oblivion. There are some broken characters that can be annoying but that will hopefully be addressed in later patches. There is a lot more to like about this game than to dislike so for that reason I will give a 4.5 out of 5. Fun gameplay loop with a great customization options, and I for one do not mind the chests as you can earn them in game. So for anyone complaining about that, would you rather you can't earn them at all?? Didn't think so."
9772,goods game
9773, not worth 20 bucks
9774,Personally I like this type of battle royale and has been dreaming of it.But I have faced issues of stuttering during the game play when encountered with the enemies.I hope the developers look into this matter and fix this problem as soon as possible so that the players could enjoy the game better.
9775,"good game bt nightmare lagg tht makes ur character glitch , and most of time even laggs the character selection and map selection and jump into game directly which is really sad, hope they fix lag"
9776,It is a melee version of pubg with more diversity
9777,"Fun game. Was worried when a lot of the reviews mentioned bots, but it's really not that bad. The combat is fun, and it feels nice to actually play a battle royale game that feels fresh. My only complaint is that I wish there were less items locked behind microtransactions."
9778,GG
9779,good game nice to chill on with friends
9780,I'm too obsessed.. Love it
9781,its so good
9782,"Fun when there is friends to play with, like it because of the concept of this game"
9783,"I'm not quite sure where to begin with this project. I purchased the game at 11:00 PM, August 16th. The time of the this review? 3:00 AM, August 18th. In less than 48 hours, I have logged 34 of those precious moments in life into this particular game. The learning curve is steep. Those that do not care for the challenges a game like this could present to them, they would not hear a pitch from me to participate in this experience. However, if you're an individual who has found joy in a 2D slider fighter (Dragonball Fighterz, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Tekken) or even the likes of a title such as Dynasty Warriors, I can say from the bottom of my heart, try this game.

I have not had this much fun for the price of $19.99 in a VERY long time. Onboarding is so present, it's almost overbearing to some. I just have so much love and admiration to the Developers for producing in my eyes, a potential masterpiece placed in a genre that truly has been tried time and time again with few success stories. Is this the next Fortnite? Doubt it. But I want nothing more than to see this title grow in popularity and continue to alter the perspectives of individuals who may have had their fill of "" Battle Royale "" games. 

This is a BR unlike any of it's peers. 

If you find yourself picking this title up, Look for me. I'd love to meet and game with this community that is already filled with some of the most inviting walks of life. 

Huge thumbs up 24 Entertainment, bravo."
9784,very very fun
9785,"A good Martial Art style Battle Royale. However there are some gripes I have with this game currently. If only there was a 50/50 option on steam.

- This game was released in China a month early, Giving them the advantage in experience in the game. However they seem to have the tendency to leave their server and invade ours, Crushing any newcomer with skill or cheese. So its pretty odd to watch the rankings and notice a few non-english characters on something like an NA server or any server with ping to satisfy their needs. Also wanted to point out, We can't play on their server but they can?

- While Grappling is a cool way to explore or start a fight, People will tend to take advantage of it. Grapples will auto aim players and if its hit them, They will be stopped in there tracks and have to react to your incoming flurry. Now that sounds great until you realise you can carry heaps of spools with use them without any cooldowns. You will have fights of people just grappling around and refusing to fight unless they land one on a player. Or in a trio fight you can't even run away to heal up because of the constant grapple stuns. A certain region made this a meta by the way.

There is also the other issue Monk's ult. I'm fine with a giant asura walking around and grabbing people. I'm not fan with the instant 1.5 second transformation that instantly heals him.

Anyway the combat feels refreshing from other battle Royales. The characters each have their own personalities and voice lines which will entertain you. The map does look pretty including the dragon above you most of the time.

Would I recommend? Maybe or not yet. But feel free to try it, Its different from other battle royales at the moment."
9786,Original Battle Royal
9787,If you're sick of shooters this is the game
9788,"still need lots of improvements but it's fun so far.

please add trio VS AI mode because I just want to chill in this game :)"
9789,best
9790,"[b] Game is super fun. Here's what I like: [/b]

 - I haven't encountered a single glitch in 35 hours of gameplay!
 - Character customization is super detailed and awesome.
 - Character models are incredible and beautiful.
 - Cosmetics are very premium looking.
 - Graphics are amazing.
 - Optimization is done right. For a game with this good graphics, open world and so many abilities flying everywhere I can run the highest graphics settings at 1440p and achieve 60+fps with a mid to high tier system, and no stutter etc.
 - Combat is super fun and not over-the-top complex like some other fighting games, but challenging enough to appeal to a wide range of people.
 - The game encourages you to play with friends, but fear not! I have met many people playing as there is in-game voice and trio's matchmaking. I started playing with no friends of mine and now play with 6-7 people frequently just by being friendly and opening up my mouth.
 - Lots of daily, weekly, seasonal and character specific challenges to do with a good reward system for cosmetics.

[b] Here's what I think should be improved: [/b]

 - Nothing! It's perfect!
 - Just kidding...Definitely some ability and weapon balancing is needed.
 - Also needs a better system for explaining combos. I have noticed that if you charge up certain power attacks and follow with certain basic attacks you produce different combos which wasn't explained anywhere that I came across.
 - If you're in NA, server is awesome but I heard there is problems with EU/Oceanic.

That's it, feel free to leave a comment and ask any questions. Add me to friends if you want to play. Good Luck!"
9791,Addicted shit
9792,"I had low expectations for this game but the more i played it the more i enjoyed it, there are a few things that could be changed in the future but overall amazing game."
9793,Nice
9794,played for nine hours
9795,"If you love martial arts films, you'll probably love this. Combat is responsive and interesting and the characters and weapons all add a different flavour to the fights. They all have their level gauges too so you can work on that. Am just a casual player but this is pretty fun to pick up and play. I keep coming back to it and before I know, hours pass. Give this a solid try. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
9796,Battle royal comes with exciting new experience
9797,"Kinda interesting, but too expansive"
9798,nice game

9800,"TOO MANY HACKERS, especially Chinese players. AUTO COUNTER + ESP + HACK MAP !!

GOOD GAME BUT FAILED BECAUSE OF HACK."
9801,"You ever wish your Fortnite, Apex, PUBG, etc. etc. didn't have enough anime? Well get ready to hide in trees with muskets or teleport with a spear."
9802,"I really like this game so far the only letdown is that there are no servers in the OCE region as an OCE player trying to play on the SEA servers I have alot of issues with in game connection so much so that I get stuck in an area for half the game because I am having trouble with my connection as of right now I can't 100% recommend this game to OCE players until that issue is fixed, if it weren't for the connection issues I would recommend this game the overall theme of the game and gameplay are amazing but the connection issues make it almost unbearable to play"
9803,I played 3 games but spent  2.5 hrs in characters customization. I made shrek
9804,shrek
9805,I like
9806,Pretty solid game. Tip: Prioritise melee weapons over ranged.
9807,this game is really good
9808,"GOOD GAME

9809,yes
9810,Perfect games...I like this game!!
9811,Mmo combat without the grind. Highly mobile and highly enjoyable. i
9812,"Revolutionary game combined with ideas of PUBG, Asian culture and landscaping"
9813,"10/10 - A Beautiful, fun, parkour, samurai-esque battle royale game."
9814,"Good Game, I hope in the future there will be a different culture/theme of characters, Maps and Weapon skins. Ofcourse other characters from different culture will have different fighting style so it doesnt look weird that a viking or samurai like doing the same martial arts from Chinese, they can make this as DLC to unlock those characters. This will add a nice  diversity to the game.

No hackers so far and  i hope this will remain the same.
No bugs. Bot will only exist if you are still new to the game and getting less as you progress
microtransactions are only for cosmetics
"
9815,"First battle royal that i actually enjoyed, grapples makes you feel like levi from attack on titan, graphics are beautiful, combat entertaining and rarely repetitive."
9816,If you're looking for a game to kill some time and hack and slash your way through some scrubs while bearing DD milkers in some skin-tight cloth while wielding a big ass sword - This is your game.
9817,"Really excited about the game, worth the money"
9818,"Short answer: The game is Fantastic! I honestly did not expect to enjoy the game quite as much as I am. 
Pros:
Gameplay is smooth and Fluid with intricate systems that are made simple and easy to understand. The  intricate fighting system with customizable weapons and abilities makes combat fun and enjoyable. Also very few unlocks require any real world money purchase to obtain and are far from grindy to obtain or at least it does not feel grueling to do so at all. So money hungry is not a ideal that comes to mind when playing this game which is a absolute plus. The quest system is a nice touch and actually holds relevance to the games story. 

Cons:
The only problem I have had with this game so far is we need a better customization system for Controller layouts. Growing up on Consoles I am one of those people who prefer controller and this game does take some getting used to if you play using a controller for example rather than using the left analog stick to sprint you have to hold B to sprint which is also used to dodge and there is no way to separate sprint from the B button to map it to the analog stick while leaving crouch as B of course this isn't that big of a deal however it is a bit annoying when your used to the almost global norms for controller layouts that most games use or at least give you the ability to remap your buttons to match, a option as i stated that this game does not give you."
9819,nice
9820,"Really fun, enjoyable game. Optimization isn't the best."
9821,Love it.
9822,Hands down the best battle royal game out there right now! So many options as to where to go next with the content hope they don't mess it up.
9823,good
9824,"The best thing about this game: they stuck the movement. Moving your character is an absolute joy. Naraka also has the best 1v1 showdowns in any competitive game ever created. Its like the end of a Samurai movie. Fantastic battle royale and worthy of being the ""next big thing."" (I have 20+ hours in the beta as well)"
9825,bots
9826,if you love a battling game style it WORTH.
9827,"Game is fun, looks great, and has some cool features in it"
9828,"Think fortnite with dark souls combat and a mature aesthetic. 
A breath of fresh air for the battle royal genre, Naraka:Bladepoint is, without a doubt, one of the smoothest,most satisfying Battle Royales out there. It has a pretty high learning curve, but it is extremely satisfying when you kill people in this game. The developers put in a lot of care into making this, and it definitely shows. Smooth movement, intricate combat, and boob jiggle physics. What more could you want?"
9829,no oce server!
9830,paid 20 dollars for game and another 20 for skin of hot girl very good game
9831,"Goated
"
9832,This game is really fun. Takes a bit to learn combos and stuff but once you do its fun!
9833,Fun and hardcore
9834,Do not buy this game unless they region lock china. Same problem all battle royal games have when they launch. Hacking problem is out of control.
9835,Do not miss this game. all charactor have sickpack or cow milk
9836,"I have had many people download this game after watching me stream and play this. I have described this game as Dynasty Warriors meets Apex with a hint of Spell Break spawn map. The game itself has a lot of potential; and right out of the gate it is fire. The scenery, the gameplay, traversing the map. My only gripe would be that many of us wish there was a block button and not just the counter. Like yes it is clutch when you can cause someones weapon to drop but when you get overpowered by three people or more, there is literally not much you can do; no grapple or dodge could get you out of there fast enough. over all this game is a strong 7.5/10"
9837,"good
"
9838,"I really like this game, but my game crash like 2 times in middle of fight and i don't know if the server make the game lagging"
9839,Really fun when playing with your noob friends. Hope can have choice for 4 or 5 people in a team
9840,"very good cosmetically , combat does take some skill to learn unless its a 3v1 , and cash shop is only cosmetics no dumb p2w stuff involved , character balance is pretty damn good so far. 
{{REGION LOCK OTHERWISE ITS A NEGATIVE}} game is great but 300ping asian's using only spears is about 90% of my deaths"
9841,"This game is really bad, it has massive balancing issues and the combat over feels like a mobile game. The only reason I got this game in the first place was for a friend however the few times that I do play by myself its just udder chaos. People use broken combos to make it so you cant move, others use broken abilities which just makes the combat even worse, and some just hide in trees or bushes waiting for the last 2 players to duel it out before they make they're play.

I will say the only enjoyable times are with friends in tro matches because at least then you have a team to back you up and save you from some of these game mechanics"
9842,This game is greate
9843,"I'll review it later i wanna play more but it was fun like Apex, Spell Break, or Pubg. I'd like to play more but technical difficulties"
9844,"At least in this game you cannot be one shot in the head by some random bullet or by hackers. Fights are NOT over in .01 seconds. There is actual skill needed to time counters and chain combos, along with avoiding getting yourself countered. Overall, I much prefer the flow of battle NARAKA provides vs many other BR titles.  While there are times you can be dominated by others, it feels a lot more balanced. 

I am disappointed that the game is not f2p, as this has pretty much turned all my friends away from playing right out the gate. But the game is worth it if you dont mind the cost."
9845,"Will change my review if they let us rebind Z. Free my Z key from moonbane and let us rebind moonbane as well thanks. Otherwise, amazing game. Super optimized, i was so surprised at the smoothness of the game."
9846,"This game saved my life.

I am 64.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 8 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 6th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my game hand... the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't win any matches, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two... With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 flipping minutes to the lobby music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 8 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you."
9847,"Janky movement, janky combat, janky UI."
9848,imagine sitting on a chair of razors but you get to look at cool swords and people being cool
9849,I would like to recommend this game because the fighting is pretty good and moves look and feel good. But unfortunately i cannot. Its plagued with Chinese players in the US servers and in my opinion its not worth 20 dollars in its current stage. I would say wait a little while for it to go on sale or for them to fix servers. Its also seeming like a p2w game to me with the abilities you get and things you can buy. Its a shame this game has come out like this.
9850,"no fix for Chinese player invasion on NA servers after 3 months
no fix for greatsword after 3 months
buffed dagger
trios being nothing but ult spam
devs dont care about anything but money

game is absolutely trash"
9851,get rekt
9852,Combat is amazing.
9853,"130 HOURS into the game, at start i gave this game a positive review, but i have DELETED that review completely as of now since it no longer deserves to have a positive review.

as such I UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES recommend this game it is a straight up bad game and that wont change as of now for the forseeable future,

the DEVS are not interactive and dont try to improve the game and the support unit doenst exist

you can make as much tickets as you want on issues that you have bugs and you can report as many hackers that you want, but nothing will be done the DEVS turn a blind eye to these mathers and the ''Support unit'' will shove all tickets and reports aside never to look at it

I myself made as of making this 134 HOURS review over 10 tickets now, of which 8 are for games where i have 3+ kills with 1 ''omnious blade'' skill from ''Yoto Hime'' for a mission because my mission doenst go to completed

i even sended multiple screenshots and/or VODs of me doing and completing the mission of each of those games to the ''Support unit'' in my ticket that i sended, however all they will say is ''we will look into it'' on which they will proceed to close the ticket after saying that, never to look further into the mather as if it never happened to begin with, or they will say that you didnt meet the requirements even when you have sended a small VOD video with you clealry doing it and screenshtos of you doing it

same for hackers when you report someone or make a ticket on a hacker, they wont look into it and dont try to resolve it or ban people, the company cares more about selling the game and getting money then actually pleasiing the comunity

this is very dissapointing and a let down as the game itself at base good, yet the DEVs and ''support unit negelect the players to the point that people quit after a few hours or after the first week"
9854,"yes
"
9855,Nothin gets me going like getting my ass kicked by people with worse gear.
9856,"I'm here for the gameplay I swear.

8/10"
9857,"This game is similiar to apex legend and it is especially pretty addicting and good if you don't really have a good eyes to see far for game like PUBG and Apex Legend

I love the battle royale system and the focus on the close combat
"
9858,"Before you buy, I recommend to read this review.

I had a chance to play this game in last beta, where I achieved Silver I rank in solos. I was satisfied so I pre-ordered ultimate edition and I can say, I'm happy that I did that. It's unique by complex melee fighting mechanism (based on ""Rock, Paper, Scissors""), where every weapon has its combos and weakness. Basically, if you known most common combos used by other players, you can perfectly outplay player with much better gear than you. There are range weapons too but it's easy to use (If you can aim obviously). Battle-royale mode is same like other games - You'll choose palce in map, you spawn there, looting stashes around map and trying to be the last alive.

Right now, there are 7 different characters and everyone offer different spells and possibly style of play. Spells can make huge impact in fights but you must use them in correct moment, sometimes it can cost life if you try to spam then in the middle of opponent's combo. Game modes are ""Ranked"" (Solo & Trio), Quick match (Solo & Trio) and Bloodbath (Basically deathmatch). You can find classic features like character/weapon skins, lootboxes, battlepass and quests. Game has great wiki, where you can get informations about fighing and movement.

In overall, if you hate learning combos and you are looking for a game where you don't want to spent a lot of time, I can't recommend this game for you. This game require motivation to learn new things and take time to master it. On the other hand, I can recommend this game for everyone, which looking for cool battle-royale game, inspired by Japanese culture."
9859,"Your usual chinese cashgrab, shit servers, infested with laggy chinese"
9860,They nerfed Yoto Hime
9861,"If ''For Honor'' was Chinese and a Battle Royale, this is what you get. Great combat system, but with some glaring flaws which after a while will make you want to commit 1st degree murder. I really want to love this game, because it looks and feel amazing. But then you meet 3 Chinese guys with latency all over the place, with either Tianhai or Yoto Hime(the most broken heroes in the game when playing trios) all using spears and greatswords, (weapons which requires roughly 3 braincells to completly master). The things i have yelled while playing this game has all but ensured that if there is a heaven, im not invited.

This game has so much potential and It could be amazing. But right now i can't recommend this game."
9862,"amazing, buy it"
9863,"7/10 (due to control lag) but if they decide to fix it and continue to improve it'll be a solid 9/10

Unique feeling BR with fast paced combat and class system for fighters. The game play is high action combat mixed with acrobatics and a blocking/parry system. There is significant input lag (healing/armor/weapon repairs) depending on what your doing and the running is nothing more than a brisk walk. If they can fix those things to make every aspect of the core game play fluent then this is a solid take on the BR genre. Hopefully with how diverse the characters and map are they continue to add more content and iron out the potentially game breaking nuisances.

Beware that there are plenty of Asian player groups that will team up in trios and solos just to wipe the map of people with US names and then fight at the end by themselves. It's extremely noticeable in solos too where 4 or 5 players with Asian names group up and wipe players that way so they can boost each other. It's happened in at least 10 or more of solo games I've played."
9864,ok
9865,"fun game! lots of character customization, fighting is simple but also in depth enough to keep the fights fun. have installed on my regular HD and no issues for the people saying you need SSD to play..... play it! dont listen to the hate!"

9867,"Cheaters already in game, ESP WALLHACK, AUTO PARRY & ETCS * THIS IS WHAT VERY I REGRET TO BOUGHT IT.  Think about the states of this game what will happen after few months!
When the problem will happens? After u spend time few hours go through the tutorial, skins, and many matches of BOT.   (Which can take over 2 hours and makes the game NONREFUNDABLE on Steam).

if you post in the forum cheaters in games. 
you will soon end up response like aPEEx legen2x. 
""there is not cheaters in game""
"" you skills not good enough""
"" i already in game xxxhours and never saw a cheaters""
 Get what i mean? 

COMBAT & HEROES NEEDS TO TWEAK.. GLITCH CAN GET U GRAPPLE UNLIMTED STUN. YOU CAN""T 1vs3 in this game. unless they're all totaly newbie.
CROUCH, PARRY, DODGE NOT WORKING PROBABLY, u will get kill by mindless spaming attack, coz u will stuck & can't dodge, teleporting enemy & etcs.

-in rank solo mode, you will face LOT OF SOLO PLAYER TEAM WITH OTHERS PLAYER. since this game mechanic can't really 1v3. have fun!

pros
-1st battle royale melee combat "" also bunch problematic combat & glitch, heroes & combat needs rebalance & rework.
-cool skin can be bought during grinding ""LOT OF GRIDING"" not sure what happen after u reach full levels""
- lot of glpy combination like ARENA OF VALOR for end game usage ""that will needs u lot of time to grind if you not purchase anythings""

If you think this game will be no cheaters compare of other current popular fps game that infest with cheaters.
Please think TWICE BEFORE you wants to get the game.

Anti-cheat will never be solve once cheaters infest it, think about current popular fps games like apeex legend2x, CODD warzone1x, PUBGG1x. Game will still running of many many years.

NOT RECOMMEND FOR THIS GAME.

9868,This is the best game out right now. Probably the best game ever for fun/dynamic play. Follow my ladder climb @gameraholics on twitter/twitch
9869,"This game is actually a lot of fun. It's a high-paced BR that can be overwhelming at first but is fairly straightforward once you get the hang of it. Only leaving this review as a not recommended because they don't region lock players. Playing in NA might as well be playing on Asian servers playing against a bunch of 500 ping players who can't be hit. If they start enforcing region locking, I will change my review.

Revising my review to say that now that I have grinded out ranked I am getting MAX clan boosters in the majority of my games. Another reason to stay away from this game. Blatant partying with nothing done."
9870,Good asf
9871,"Updated review: Devs killed the NA fan base due to lack of needed updates/fixes (e.g. ping lock). Game had alot of untapped potential but is now a dead game.

Old review: I have played the battle royale genre to the point of boredom. However, Naraka does something very different. It combines concepts from a bunch of my favourite games (For Honor, Sekiro, Assassins Creed, etc) and makes it work. The combat and parkour feel very fluid and dynamic, with all sorts of combos and out-play potential, without getting too difficult. There is an assortment of game modes to further sharpen your skills. Other than gameplay, you can spend hours customizing the different heroes with many types of skins/accessories to choose from. The bots can be annoying in the beginning, however, they are replaced by players as you level up. Final verdict: if you are competitive and like 3D fighters with lots of customization, you will enjoy this game."

9880,"The absolute most inconsistent game I've ever played.

Pay as many streamers as you want to play your game, it's dead in a week with how inconsistent this game is.

People spam left click at each other and it's an absolute 50/50.
There's zero actual skill required to play this game, just ping. Person with better ping hits the grapple hook.
When you do land your grappling hook, there's a chance that it doesn't even effect them. REMOVE GRAPPLE HOOK STUN AND YOUR GAME IS BETTER.

This game is absolute fucking GARBAGE. Not even sure how it even got released. Characters jump everywhere, auto lock happens at absolute random for absolutely no reason on players. God forbid you fight anywhere near a ledge because there's zero chance to hit anyone that's climbing with a melee weapon because you just swing forward and the little ""aim assist"" they have for melee weapons doesn't work vertically, only horizontally so you're just auto locking in circles when someone jumps. Speaking of jumping, if you try to jump through a window, it better be PIN POINT DEATH STAR EXPLOSION ACCURACY, because it you don't you're just going to climb the building instead of jump the window because they game's parkour system (though fluid on your own) is an absolute shit show during combat. 

The tutorial doesn't teach you anything about max stats on jades, doesn't teach you anything other than how to left click, doesn't teach you to upgrade your Glyphs..or whatever..., the leveling system and the whole out dated League of Legends Glyph system puts you at a retardedly low disadvantage if you're just starting out.

Absolute buggy in terms of nonregisters on hits. You can see yourself hit someone with a weapon and they'll somehow still damage you while on the ground. 

Should be paying me to play this absolute filth game.

Definitely a waste of money.

Wish I could get a refund. Never wanted to get rid of a game more in my life than this game right here. 

But they trick you into playing, what you think are player lobbies, with bots for 5 games without disclosing it's an actual full bot game, before actually putting you against players to realize how absolutely AWFUL the experience actually is so you can't refund and that's how they play you."

9901,"Brand new, competitive, and beautiful. BLADEPOINT captures gameplay elements from popular titles, making for an intuitive yet original experience. The combat is fun and fast, but is not overly complex, ensuring you can have fun instead of becoming overly focussed on what button you need to press next. Mind you, it will require quick thinking. 

The presence of a very familiar ranking system secures BLADEPOINT's stance as ""the game that will steal you away from whatever you were playing before."" So, fair warning.

 If you're no longer enjoying your ""most played,"" this is your arena."
9902,"Fix the Weapon Lag
Give me Duos
then i am happy
Does not feel right yet.

edit:

Game is now out for a few days, balance is broken thanks to lots of monk + spin to win lady players (no clue what she is called, here to play not to remember names)
If you fight against high ping players you will definitely be at an disadvantage.
Also the game is defnitely tracking your postiion (It showed me my rank in my hometown???)
Who knows what else it will syphon to china in the background."
9903,"At first the gameplay can feel 'mashy' but once you get the hang of things you find out weapons have combos, and mashing the same combo can get you punished. The game has a high skill ceiling, and I cant wait to see what new weapons and characters are added. However, the business model is extremely frustrating and micro-transactions are constantly shoved in your face. 

Constant battle pass level up notifications, skin discounts, you even get asked are you sure you want to close the game and if you want to follow them on twitter! If you did want to spend money and purchase the battle pass, you'd have to pay $15 minimum instead of the normal $10 due to the in game currency being made to match china's money. 

There is almost no way to make your character look cool or stylish without chipping out 23$ on a cool skin. Yes skins are just cosmetic but that doesn't mean that this developers greedy business model cant put a bad taste in your mouth. Even with the frustrating business model, the gameplay is fresh and it brings something truly unique to the battle royale genre. The weapons feel nice to use, landing combos is satisfying, and getting high kill games feels earned once you get past the bots in your first couple games. 

The game also has a ranking system for your city, and state. Meaning that even if you're just an average player, you can still get recognized and have a unique name in-game by being top 100 in your city or state (also in the world if you're that good). So while the game does have a greedy and foul business model to monetize their game, it is still fun to play and is 'only' $20."
9904,"-Laggy servers make counter-play nearly impossible.
-Experienced foreign players using VPN to dominate new North American/EU players is a little absurd."
9905,Very fun first couple of games are against bots so you can learn everything a bit then you get to play against real players.

9914,Its pretty cool when it works. Sometimes it feels like I'm fighting a lot of bots though.
9915,"One of the worst games I've ever played. Don't bother getting it. People who have already played the game (such as chinese or betap layers) dominate all of the server, and the weapons are poorly balanced. The ""rock-paper-scissor"" style combat it goes by doesn't even work half the time, and it's just a piece of shit."
9916,"This Stupid Trash Arse Game is a waist of time!!! If you are looking for a fair fight against other players, this is not the game for you. Though the game looks fantastic and the mechanics seem cool, the combat system and gameplay are GRABAGE!!! Once an opponet starts attacking you, you have no way of fighing back unless they miss!!! And they rarely miss!!! You can't block/counter when they are hitting comboing you!!! You can't dodge no matter how many times you press the key to dodge!!! You can never activate your ability to inturupt their attacks NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU HIT YOUR ABILITY KEYS!!! AND THEIR GRAPPLES ARE SOO OP THAT YOU CAN NEVER RUN AND HEAL BECAUSE SOMEONE IS ALWAYS GRABBING YOU AND THE GRAPPLES STUN YOUR MOVEMENTS TO DO ANYTHING!!!!
It was a fun game at first and I really want to enjoy this game and what it has to offer, but this game is a waist of my money and time, until the combat is fixed and fair. Don't waist your money on buying this game. It is not worth it."
9917,poor optimization
9918,"In a nutshell:
Is the game fun? Yes
Is it consistently fun? No
Is it worth the 20 euro? Not really, it has to click with you on a personal level.
Definitely not worth buying the Deluxe or Ultimate Editions.
Combat is extremely inconsistent, I had a game where I won with 16 kills with pure random clicking.
Rest of my games I got completely stomped, even when using the games rock-paper-scissors like combat system. It never feels like I am truly in control of what my hero does.
Movement is clunky sometimes, especially in crowded areas with a lot of buildings.
Graphics look really good though, the eastern Asian aesthetic is something I'm personally weak for.
Music also pretty gud

Worth a try? Definitely, but it needs so much work to not become Hyperscape 2."

Is built for 1v1 not 3v3, so the 3v3 mode is a total mess of just 3 players spamming mouse 1 on you.

Polearm is totally broken, can just hit people a mile away with ultra fast attacks that lock on.

Don't even bother with a ranged weapon, someone will just grapple to you and 1 shot you whilst you're swapping weapons.

Game will die so fast because the whole counter/combo etc. system is just dreadful outside of 1v1.

Havn't even mentioned the fact its not region locked. Enjoy fighting a chinese player with 4000 ping..."
9925,samurai fortnite
9926,"Major performance issues, connectivity issues, asian level MTX systems, complex but very janky and frustrating combat and infested with intentional bots.

1 vs 3 is a joke in this game, you'll just get stun locked to death.

Countering doesn't work the way you'd want to, you can't just counter at any moment you have to wait for your attack animation to finish completely which feels frustrating for reasons you'll discover upon playing the game.

That being said I am enjoying it for what it is, grinding up the leaderboard but I probably wouldnt be playing had I not thrown money at their battlepass system.

positives include a complex combat system with pretty ambitious parkour which upon a lot of refinement and balancing could be much better than it is. The game clearly had it's sights set high and didn't reach that mark, I can see there was effort and care put into the game in certain respects.

What they must do is fix the performance, I can't be dipping into the 50s on the lowest settings at 1440p on a 3060ti with dlss performance mode on and gpu usage at 35%. Fix that, give me smooth 70fps+ all the time with no connectivity issues and I'll be pretty happy.

Make the combat feel better, give 1 vs 3 a chance instead of inevitable stunlock. Make combat less frustrating.

Do these things and I have no real major complaints other than the bots, which is such a questionable design decision. If they fixed these things there would still be other things to be critical about like the lack of life to the map and view distance being messed up."

Chinese experienced players and bots in every game, running around with 1s ping dominating. ""clans"" that team up illegaly, to my knowledge no action taken. You cant chat with other players? To hide the fact that there are mainly chinese players and bots even on european servers? Intrusive lootchestsystem. A talent system like LOL, why would that be a good idea? Regrettable $20 and an uninstall."
9939,Super fun game to play and something refreshing because each weapon has combos! Ohh and game has that sweet parry mechanic so enemy drops the weapon it is amazing!

9948,"Basically, the game makes a good impression. However, several factors bother me, which is why I cannot * currently * recommend the game. One is that the gameplay still doesn't feel 100% fluid. Sometimes I get stuck on walls, stones or other objects. My character does what he wants, but not what I want. The settings should also be made a bit simpler here. On the other hand, the balancing of the weapons bothers me extremely. Once in the grip of the opponent, I can hardly really free myself from the grip. Then I just die without really being able to free myself from it. That is extremely frustrating. If there are updates on this, I will also revise my feedback accordingly. I will continue to play, but the review remains negative until few updates. =)

[h2]Update after the 1st Patch[/h2]

The first major patch made my opinion a little more positive. Unfortunately, the balancing is still very disastrous. For example, the katana is currently far too strong and the movements are not yet 100% ""smooth"". Still a positive development. As soon as my key points improves, I will turn my review into a positive one. =)"
9949,It has OCE servers now.
9950,"This game should be F2P by how much you can spend ingame + brs not being F2P is lowkey cringe these days.

This game also has a lot of Bullshit in it and some characters are clearly better than others by a large margin (atleast in trios, i dont play solo). 

That being said, this game looks and plays amazing.
It really is a lot of fun and i do not regret buying it.

9954,"if you have played this since the start then you have a huge advantage over new people since the higher the level the more upgrades and perks you unlock. The upgrades consist of many things but the most important yet annoying one is the grappling hook perks for the grappling hook is the most used thing in the game and if someone has one good luck getting away it is quite hard to do for it stuns you. Not only does it stun you it can reach pretty darn far with the perks upgraded and the weapons for some reason on first hit stun you. The grappling hook perks should get nulled or its gonna be hard for new player to enjoy the game, but besides that id say hopefully the servers get fixed cause it is kinda hard to play it. finally the game is fun and the customization is amazing almost better then bdo.

Feels like a mix of Apex, Black Desert and Assassins creed. Devs said bots are in early matches so keep that in mind when you win your first 2-3 games back to back. In ranked though that goes away and its pretty sweaty and challenging at times. Definitely a good try for 20 bucks."

9996,This game is built so that all you face is bots at the start to make you feel like you're great at the game before you are out of the refund period of 2 hours. The bots are horrible and the game is boring because of this feature. Not even worth getting to the point of playing real people.

What is [u][b]Naraka[/b][/u]?

Naraka is a 60 - player Action Battle Royale and offers you numerous methods to fight with other players, whether with a great sword / spear / bow / katana and much more you have too a grappling hook Which makes it easier for you to move. Naraka offers you besides the Battle Royale a Battle Pass with 110 levels, the possibility to customize each character the like you want it, a Loot Box system with different rarity levels and much more.

[u][b]Conclusion:[/b][/u]

I think that the game is definitely different from the other Battle Royale games which makes it unique at the beginning I said this game it would not be mine but as I played it in the beta I had to change my mind about this game and find this concept just cool, it's especially fun with friends but also solo! so I would also recommend it, if you want to buy it and support me you can simply enter the invitation link [b]chd6nqfchf[/b] when choosing your in-game name :^)

[u][b]GER[/b][/u]

Was ist [u][b]Naraka[/b][/u]?

Naraka ist ein 60 - Spieler Action Battle Royale und bietet dir zahlreiche Methoden dich mit anderen Spielern zu Messen, ob mit einem Groß-Schwert / Speer / Bogen / Katana und vieles mehr zu dem besitzt du einen Enterhaken womit dir, dass hin und her Bewegen von einem Punkt zum anderen erleichtert wird. Naraka bietet dir neben dem Battle Royale stuff zu dem noch einen Battle Pass mit 110 Stufen die Möglichkeit jeden Charakter so anzupassen wie du es möchtest, ein Loot Box System sozusagen mit unterschiedlichen Seltenheitsstufen und vieles Mehr.

[u][b]Fazit:[/b][/u]

Ich finde, dass Game hebt sich auf jeden Fall von den anderen Battle Royale Games ab wodurch es einzigartig wird, am Anfang als ich dieses Spiel gesehen habe dachte ihr mir es wäre nicht meins als ich es dann aber in der Beta angespielt habe musste ich meine Meinung zu diesem Spiel ändern und finde dieses Konzept einfach cool, es macht vor allem Spaß mit Freunden aber auch Solo! deshalb würde ich es auch weiterempfehlen, falls du es dir Kaufen möchtest und mich dabei Unterstützen möchtest kannst du ganz einfach bei der Namen Auswahl den Einladungslink [b]chd6nqfchf[/b] eintragen :^)"
10017,"A modern Martial art Battle Royale that might live for more than 3 years! Just report hacks, team-up and any kind of cheats to create the best PvP game!"
10018,For the first few games you will face bots (since everyone wants to know). After about 3 or 4 games you start to face real people and you will slowly get used to the game mechanics and you will find out what weapons you like etc. Its hard at first but you will get the hang of it with trail and error. Definetly one of the best battle royale games I have played in a long time. Highly reccomend.
10019,lit
10020,"For being relatively new it's pretty good I would say, for me personally not yet fully worth the price (will come with guarantee though).

Personal opinion: There is still a ton of micro adjustments to be made, I'm not sure whether or not the devs. will end up doing them though (I did sent my review ticket to them)

Gameplay is quite fast pace which I enjoy a lot, zone ends up pressuring you a lot more than in other BR's which is also a very good point, so you can't just stand in it for 10 years like in Apex Legends for example lol

There is still a lot of bots in the game (which I don't really understand why, because pretty much every queue from top 100% to top 10% was less than 3 seconds, so they have more than enough players in my opinion.)

Two things that trigger me most about this game: That you actually have autoaim in this game (in settings) which takes pretty much all the skill you need away from the game (You don't have to track the enemy yourself and you don't have to aim) (I can understand it if you would leave this option only for controller players but why PC?)

The Second would be: If you get countered (which is relatively easy to do) you drop your MAIN weapon... Seriously who came up with this dumb idea? What am I supposed to do without a weapon? Also being countered leaves me stunned for half a second so you're pretty much dead with guarantee lol.

This kind of forces you to never use your charge attack, which I don't see the point in."

10025,"Amazing game & mechanics, it's that game you can invite a friend over and have friendly spar to get better (like in anime or other games like Tekken). It's pretty fun to duel someone and you aren't hard locked into losing it (some combos are deadly but even then there are windows of parry/escape + you have abilities that can be used to create that window).  The triage of your arsenal, i.e., normal attack, charge attack and parry is a balanced triangle, normal attacks pass through parry but are weaker than charge attacks, charge attacks are stronger but take longer and can be countered by parry and parry can be used only against charged attack, if done right then it disarms enemy and stuns them hard. 

Aye, it has big bitty mommies and a cash shop for cosmetics to appeal to folks and that may seem a bit cringey but the gameplay makes up for all of it (it's nier automata type selling point lol). 

Oh and don't be offput by the bots in the game, they very much exist and will be encountered but not for long. But where and how many depend on your skill level . When you start off you will be put at Bronze V and at that level you will find bots in ranked matches, but after Bronze IV you will rarely ever see them in ranked. In free for all mode you will find bots often. The bots are not that dumb and boring, they can do most things normal players can (but go into healing at low health and are just targets for picking) and are decent bit interesting to fight. (Unlike bots in other games like PUBG). 

As for ping/latency, it's nice that they have a Singapore server so SEA can play without high ping, there are  other regions including EU and NA. Though you will frequently find chinese pro type players in your lobbies."
10026,Lit action and combat
10027,"Really fun game, similar to Warframe style combat except in a battle royale. Intend to play it a lot for now, but inevitably it will die sadly. You can't charge 20 bucks for a battle royale then do massive in game currency costs as well. Hell you just can't charge 20 bucks for a battle royale in general, the game is already doomed to fail because of that unfortunately."
10028,ITS SCHWOL
10029,"This game is honestly awesome due to it's unique movement, but I've read quite a few negative reviews from brain-dead chubby-cheek losers complaining about how the game should be free. They didn't even mention anything about the game, only that it should be free and that's why they gave the game a negative review. Like, why even leave a review if you're not going to leave any constructive feedback? I've also read a few reviews stating that monetization is an issue in the game... but it's not. Not a single item, that can be purchased, has any bearing on how a match will play out. Everything that can be purchased is purely cosmetic. If you expected, even for a second, that a Chinese made game would not be monetized, then you have gone full stupid. Naraka has gameplay issues, like character skill balancing issues to solve, but that can be addressed next season. I think, right now, is the best time to hop into Naraka and smash every key on your keyboard until you make it to the top."
10030,generally a good game
10031,"Game's kinda cool, not a big fan of Fighters or BR games but my question is why are my lobbies bots? 

Would be a positive review but I didn't buy this to fight against bots running into walls and healing in your face."
10032,"It's a fun game, but there are so many bots at the moment in both casual and ranked it's a bit embarrassing."
10033,"1-laaaag lag lag laaaag lag
2-when the game starts you have to wait 7 min for the map to be fully loaded 
3- your playing mostly againt bots"
10034,"ping so high when i playing this game , cant play, i waste money for game can't controll their ping"
10035,best game ever
10036,"i love the tiddies :)
"
10037,"I do recommend this game, it's fun to play, better with friends
But i do not agree with the price, BR is so common these days, it can't create hype anymore so why set the price at 19$? I'm not saying that Naraka should be free but i think 10-12$ is a more suitable price, after all this is just an online multiplayer game, players make this game work, with the price of 19$, people would skip it before trying it (i like Naraka and i introduced it to some of my friends who i know that i would like the game but they skipped just because it cost 19$). So i think lower the price will do good for Naraka.
Oh btw, there're gacha and battle pass ingame but it doesn't affect gameplay, just want to clear this out"
10038,The best game u will ever play ..
10039,"good game, game hay"
10040,"This is a fun game! I love the ability to move around so much. The mobility is just awesome, especially the grabble hooks. However, we definitely need to grow this community because i feel like I'm going against bots 85% of the time. That is the trouble with battle royals. =(
Also, if you get the game and make an account. Please use my invite code. =)

10041,tis fun
10042,"Ninja Battle Royale done right . . . what more can we ask for? 

Yes theres QoL touches that need to be made but the core gameplay and vision is there and i cant wait to see whats in store for the future of Naraka : Bladepoint and its community"
10043,nice game
10044,锁区+每个区段位不共享， rnm退钱
10045,the dodge and parry system works like shit
10046,Git gud game! Not recommended for players that easily get tilted
10047,"Its fun, Its different, Its a hard game, BOOBA PHYSICS."
10048,"The gameplay is very refreshing. it's a new take to the battle royal. only complain is that their are no servers for Oceania. being put into other servers with people dont speak english is a huge pain in the aSss and lets not forget the ping spikes up and down which leads to random times the game laggs so when you get into a huge battle with 3 other teams 90percent of the time you will lose..... i give it a 2 out 5  GIVE US OCEANIA SERVERS NOT NODS

after a 1 year. the game has improved first their is now sea servers, which means that the ping does not go over 100 unless ur in an asian server which happens from time to time. it has add heaps off content as well as new heroes. remember to install it on SSD if harddrive their will be game buffer and lag when loading into a match other wise this game is a 5/5"
10049,verry lag my graphic is gtv1050 rrarm 8gb still lag
10050,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Of course it's i good game!
10051,"If you love those old MMO RPG style PVPs(hack n Slash), This game might be for you.
What makes it better is you skip the Grind for Gears and go directly to the fight.
Its just as usual to all Battle Royal games, You need that good RNG on Drop"
10052,"Decent fun game, need maybe a month of QoL changes and some balancing to feel fluid .

Very high skill ceiling, light attack spam stagger needs counterplay. 

Netcode needs adjusting, can't have people abusing 300+ ping on purpose for advantage.

Worth 20$, can benefit way more going F2P and will still make really good money from the cash shop.

7.5 / 10 

Can be a 8 or even 9 with how much QoL and less-clunky fixes/baalances they do."
10053,"The core gameplay issue for now:
1. Low FPS and low performance for low end PC, even with 1080Ti, my FPS is always lower than 70 in Bloodbath. Moreover, the drop FPS is really frequent in this game
2. The hitbox in this game is bugging. Sometimes u can not counter the enemy with red skill when they use nunchucks. Sometimes, Valda cui ult can be dodge by jumping or random action. 
3. Hacker everywhere.
4. Balancing problem 
U buff and make new weapons such as Dagger and Nunchucks too much. Then, that takes u a lot of time to neft them but still in vain.
The fact that Nunchucks moveset is really OP now. U can still move very far with its attack and catch enemy very easy with that distance. The blue focus of Nunchucks with full rage is really hard to dodge. I think u guys should test the new stuff hard and carefully. I am so bored with a lot of imbalanced stuffs ingame
5. Customer support is so delayed with Narakafest reward.
6. U completely ignore the team-up issue ingame. Though player sent u a lot of evidences and videos about these illegal team-up phenomena."
10054,Good Game
10055,I play for the plot I swear
10056,nice
10057,Good game
10058,"Pros:
- very fun
- fast paced
- doesn't require too much aim
- instead requires good movement
- combos are very fun to do
- each weapon has a different playstyle
- crossbow goes BRRRRRRRR
- my old gpu can still hit 60+ fps on lowest settings

Cons:
- very dependent on network to pull off combos
- i think it's very hard to be good at the movement
- as usual, the lootboxes
- you can go p2w and unlock talents really early (correct me if i'm wrong)"
10059,I didn't expect to like this game as much as i did. The combat is satisfying the movement feels amazing. The only complaint i might have weapon balancing (what game doesn't suffer from this) and also only singles and trios. Id like a doubles playlist and maybe a quads. Or an TDM type game mode. Hope this game stays alive for a bit because its actually pretty fun.
10060,"10/10, Also them Chinese players are cracked"
10061,"If you like battle royale and pvp, give it a try!
The game has gotten a lot better since the last time I played. Servers are less laggy and seem to be optimized. Combat is much more balanced, no long que times for a match. And how can I hate when best girl YOTO HIME gets a new skin ^^. There's a lot of fun to be had in the game currently and events going on!"
10062,nerf Tianhai
10063,no oce servers
10064,Ehh its good. My rating 7 stunlock death out of 10.
10065,Very intense gameplay. Grappling hook is well implemented though it needs more work regarding the auto aim feature.
10066,Great game. Definitely recommend to those who love action and battle royale.
10067,Dunno why other reviews trash this game tbh. This is basically if Warframe was a BR and had better mechanics. 10/10 would highly recommend
10068,8.5/10
10069,"Pros: 
booba



cons:
not enough booba"
10070,"This is probably the first Battle Royale game that I've enjoyed.

Edit: Now that I have an additional ~100 hours into the game I felt it's time to update my review. The game left a strong first impression; a primarily melee based battle royale with good movement and still good range combat that felt balanced. That said, I've found my desire to keep playing has declined significantly, and I think it's largely due to the character abilities. The balancing there could still use work. Abilities on most characters feel either worthless or totally overpowered, there is very little in between. If there were game modes without the abilities I think that would be a good band-aid, but it's something that needs work."
10071,"I like this game . Normally, I dont play Battle Royal but this game change my mind."
10072,"it keeps crashing, fun game tho
Edit: crash probably 30 times now"
10073,ok
10074,Play the game longer than 10 minutes and you will love the game. Incredible combat system for a BR and the character designs are beautiful. What more is that you can fully customize your character and attach accessories. Overall great and fun game!
10075,Really fun and unique taste to the BR scene. There's definitely issues that are real annoying when it comes to the combat but overall it's fun.
10076,fun!
10077,game good
10078,niceeee
10079,this games a blast. all though im utter garbage at it i feel as though i want to get better. i will 100% be sinking hundreds of hours into this game. if not ill let you know
10080,game is very nice
10081,bad ping sea
10082,"Came in expecting some nice combat and nice graphics, stayed for the intense and fast paced high skill cap combat and gorgeous graphics."
10083,Apart from bots great br.
10084,"The idea, combat system and the art style are pretty good. But the game in its current state is not balanced. Lot of cheesy tactics and playstyle. The optimizing, hitbox, hit registry, collision box are clunky. I've played this game since beta and the dev has improved the game quite a lot, so I suggest you wait like 1-2 more months until the next update. I dont suggest the game right now."
10085,"1. the game costs 20 bucks (not f2p), sells battlepass and cosmetic loot boxes
2. almost all bots in early ranking matches
3. no OCE server
4. made by NetEase
5. made in China
6. can't beat Chinese players / Chinese players ping too high
7. CN server and other servers block each other's ip

The above covers almost 90% of the negative reviews in English and Chinese, so don't buy it if you can't accept them.


1. 游戏为买断制（$20），售卖通行证，外观还要开箱子
2. 低分段几乎全是机器人
3. 没有大洋洲服务器
4. 网易出品
5. 中国制造
6. 打不过中国玩家/中国玩家ping太高
7. 国服与外服互锁ip

以上几乎涵盖了90%的中英文差评，接受不了就别买它喽。"
10086,"So i think most people looked at this and went. ""Oh, its chinese fortnite."" and then went on with their day because honestly battle royales are kind of a meme genre at this point and i don't blame that mindset. My mindset however was a little bit different, I saw this, initially had the ""chinese fortnite"" reaction, and then my heart stopped for a moment as I noticed the melee combat. And the 16 player death match mode they included. At which point i immediately bought the game, muted the regular OST which, props to the composer is pretty good and i'm sorry i'm ignoring his hard work. But i didn't buy this for Wuxia battle royale-an. I bought this because this is actually  the closest i'm ever going to get to another Mad World or Anarchy Reigns style game.  My recommendation is based entirely on that even if the balance can be a little iffy sometimes. especially in solo queue Battle Royale. but god it feels so good to actually get a kill spree going while you have Sick YG, Doujah Raze or Vstylez blaring in the background. I am heavily biased in this opinion and i'll fully admit it too."
10087,"the monk guy parried my sword then he grabbed me and didnt let me go. 

5/5 would let monk daddy grab me again
"
10088,"Very fun battle royal, just gotta work in getting gud"
10089,"too many lag spikes 
the grapple mechanic is not fun (when grappling another player)
blue armor is too rare
Counter should not be two attack buttons because it would sometimes buffer an attack rather than a counter
Hit stun is too high
IF you do land a counter and the follow up hit it would sometimes not damage the enemy even if the stab animation goes through
Poorly optimized, graphics are meh and i still drop frames on low

10093,Ninja Gaiden Black the Battle Royale also Big Sword Go Slash so great game totally recommend. Just need to put in Duos and fix some extremely high pings and it will be perfect.
10094,"Looks like this will have a high skill ceiling, very wild fights. Definitely needs some tweaking with abilities being a little strong right now, but over all lots of fun and has great potential. Nice change from the usual shooter BR."
10095,Great!
10096,"A-Friggin-Mazing!  I can't remember the last time I spent this much time on a video game.  This is a very fresh take on the Battle Royale feel.  Sure, the same concept of getting to the circle has been done.  But this combat?!  The characters and abilities?!  The CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONS?!  Truly I had no choice but to come on here and write about this because I need to do my part to make sure everyone gets this game!  It is a BLAST and although as frustrating as it can be learning, that moment you master countering, and dodging in the split second that it counts is so rewarding!  Now I just need  to find gaming friends to enjoy this with.  But shout out to all the work that went into this because this game is the best.  I've never been so glad to have a nice computer to be able to play it on.  P.S - you should definitely try and look at some of the tutorials online to help you learn tips and tricks from beta.  It is actually extremely helpful that they give you a tutorial at the beginning but I'm finding myself just looking at videos online to get better.  Good luck!"
10097,Great game feels good like sakiro and ghost of tsushima kinda :3 love the mechanics.
10098,"Mate, get on it.


But legit, great combat system that relies heavily on timing.

Large variety of weapons to select form in a PUBG style game. 

Each weapon has it's own unique weapon combo, which makes for fun learning.

Characters have skills and ultimates that are used and charge, similar to APEX Legends.

Give it a crack and,

Get on it mate."

10103,"good game
"
10104,"Started playing the game slowly started to like it once i figured out the advanced combat mechanics.. 
Exactly a day after release its already filled with aimbots and wallhacks chinese players being put on your team in trios screaming in chinese at you. No region lock so you could be swinging at someone in the past with 300ping. This game needs massive work and an actual anti cheat."
10105,Best BR ive played coming from a cod and fortnite player. movement is just so nice. and it just looks real good tbh. highly recommend plus its only 20$
10106,very good
10107,。
10108,Awesome game. Fun matches. Doesnt take long to find a que. Definitely worth the 20.
10109,"Played for alot 5 hours, Game runs like crap on a Ryzen 7 3060 and there are cheaters in this game ALREADY.. Auto blocking all the time and has ESP hacks.

This game is ONLY IN BETA AND THERE ARE ALREADY CHEATERS, Hopefully i get a refund, Waste off time."
10110,nice game
10111,Combat and mobility is pretty fun

10114,"I actually dig it, outside of the cosmetic prices it is a fun game. Would of been epic if it was F2P that would be my only complaint."
10115,bill
10116,Very good game
10117,"The idea that you stop having bots after 2-3 matches is a lie. I've played around 14 hours and I'm still getting bots at like 1500 rating solo. Very easy to tell, they will always heal right in front of you when low on HP. Or lead them into a small shack and run to the other side and they just run into the wall forever. This game is still full of bots, it fucking sucks. 

I like the game a lot, but they need to rectify this, even if they are afraid the playerbase may not be able to support a full 60 long-term. I'm willing to wait in queue longer, knowing that I'm actually getting the full experience and not just bullying an AI. It's not fun."
10118,"Wow....
I had low expectations going into the game and I'm still disappointed...
If you get enough frames to make out a semblance of motion on your screen (seriously, frame stutters every half second) then the wonky mechanics will have you barrelling over your enemies with little control while they grapple chain stun you to death."
10119,not good
10120,"Awesome game, introducing OCE servers soon at the request of player base which is pretty hard to come by"
10121,Busted combat system makes it fun to take it up the ass
10122,AMAZING GRAPHICS And ALL THE BLADES
10123,"The first game I've logged 20 hours in 2 days into in a while. Pretty polished for the most part, I can see areas where there could be improvements but other than the occasional hiccup this game is a blast to play. Highly recommend for anyone, offers a fresh take on the Battle Royale genre as a whole, and has such an immersive and beautiful handcrafted world.

It's addicting, and it's fun. I can't really ask for more from a game."
10124,Good combat. Nice cosmetics. Challenging rank and awesome cosmetics. I can't wait to see where this game goes.
10125,good game

10135,Thisss bihhh fyeee!!

Review Update: This game is still by far one of my favorite BR games to date."

10148,"This game is absolute fire. Melee combat in a battle royale works a lot better than you think. You get to play as the HAWT asian women in your area but instead of being horny they just kill everyone around them. This game is worth the 20 or 40 or 100000 dollars you put towards it, I guarentee it."
10149,Its dope. Tactics meet technique.

10162,"This game brings a different taste in battle Royale style games. Although the fighting physics can be more smooth, the overall experience feels good and balanced... except for last second Tianhe ult. Dont let Tianhe survive at the last second.

10166,"First time writing a review on any game on this site...I stayed up all night playing, that should tell you everything.... Refreshing take on BR games with its fluid and stylish combat mechanics."
10167,Don't listen to all the review bombing. It's just salty people who want a f2p game or oceanic servers. Amazing game. Coming from a long time Apex Legends player. The mechanics and gameplay are extremely unique and entertaining. An extremely high skill cap means you will never get bored of this.
10168,"The first games have thinly disguised bots (i.e. bots that clearly are bots, but have ""normal"" nicks), clearly to make you feel good about yourself while pushing you out of the 2 hours refund window."
10169,"The game actually feels really nice, apart from the random FPS lag spikes (I recommend installing in SSD if you have one), it runs and feels rather smooth!
I find the combat fun and the equipment system is rather straightforward and easy to understand.

If you heard complaints about there being BOTS, don't worry about it, you will be matched against BOTS for your first 4-5 games and then start to get matched against real players.
Overall solid Battle royale RPG game, I recommend.
"
10170,"Fun game and fast paced action combat game (BR).
The movement is fluid, it feels like spiderman.
If you want to play smoothly this game you definitely need to do following things:
- having at least 4G vram and 8g ram
- install the game in the ssd.
- update nvidia driver, cuz the newest version is optimized for naraka.
- lower all graphics setting if you sometimes have ""ping spikes""

Notice: the first 2 games you will match against many bots and few players.
This game has high skill ceiling so maybe you need to practice a lot, and sometimes you may feel frustrated."

10176,"really amazing combat
PvP combat is very complex, recommended for any hardcore player!"
10177,"i feel bad for this game, i dont where when wrong but since they put some sort of parring ability make it look really dumb to begin with. this isnt dark soul, bloodborne and sakiro. i dont blame you if you make this kind of game for specific kind of people. so people for me, have some sort of passive ability. i will close my curtain for this game. and push the refund button. definitly going to uninstall this game. 

first : grapping ability are suck, cause you stuck in current movement mode where you dont have control over grapping on something. and it's take too long to release from whatever you grapping. like tree or bolder.

second : this game is not for people who push their limit. cause from logic perspective, after you knockout you cant parring. apparently this game can. so fuck you balance we going to give some high alert player advantage over this game.

third : switch weapon, take to long just to switch weapon. i know they want to make it the niches of different from other game. but you know sometimes better be in traditional way.  it's okay to take 1 second or 2 but i think it's more than 4 or 5 second just to switch weapon.

10189,so desperate for players again that they lie in their patch notes now? pathetic company. hurts more that the game itself is so good but the devs refuse to region lock or fix the servers. removing this from my steam list so i never have to see it again or wait for patch notes to tell me some bs about servers balancing ping. RIP.
10190,good mechanics
10191,mmmmmmmmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
10192,Very fun unique BR with a death match mode good for learning combat. People who say combat is clunky are the ones who try to spam attacks and get punished. You will see non spammers taking down people with ease as they learn combos and dodge tactics.
10193,"china man high ping tencent fans ruining game playing with vpn in an high ping favored game

region lock pls dev ty very much pong jing against me auto parrying and teleporting woo"
10194,I only have 3ish hours right now but the game feels easy when you are playing battle royale. It's like playing against bots in battle royale. The deathmatch mode feels more challenging as it feels like you are actually playing against real players. The combat in this game is incredible and is worth the 20 dollars. I would like seeing a 1v1 mode added to this game though.
10195,A fun unique take on battle royal. The combat and movement systems are fun with a good variety of weapons and move sets to change things up
10196,"I love this game. I don't quite know how to describe how much I love it, but I'm going to try. There are games, special games, that require skill and strategy, where the competition is fierce and the difference between a champion and just a player comes into rare and clear focus. Starcraft is like this, so is League of Legends, or Fortnite.

This game is such a perfect blend of all the things I love... it's like Tenchu: Stealth Assassins combined with Dynasty Warriors and maybe Tekken or Street Fighter; then wrapped up with Starcraft or League of Legends cosmetic stores and leader boards with a soupçon of Battle Royale mechanics.

Having most of the weapons in the game be melee really makes the combat great, and meaningful. Combos, interrupts, disarming your opponent and martial arts are all things you can do... or if you're like me, mostly you have it done TO you. Yet, in spite of how awful I am at this game, I can still enjoy it, because you really viscerally feel that the other person beat you because they were clearly the superior player, and not because they had an aim-bot or anything like that.

I can also enjoy the game, because of how overwhelmingly beautiful it is. The settings are great, and detailed, and yet subtly muted so as to allow the vibrant color of the characters to shine through; like anime characters bursting with all their color and outrageous animation into the real world, the contrast between the mundane and the fantastic allows you to always feel like the main character. The balance of the aesthetic is perfect. The little details like the sound of running across clay shingles on a rooftop, contribute not only to the immersion of the game, but also strategically. It's hard to be stealthy while ""clank-clank-clank"" you're running over terra cotta shingles, and it impacts your game play.

I will likely update this review later, because I've only just scratched the surface of this game. The one thing that put is head and shoulders above the rest, is you can tell that this game was the labor of love for a great many people. It's worthy of being called art, as well as a game."
10197,Easy to get a hang on. But hard to master. Good matchmaking so you mostly play with people at your rank/level (that's what it feels like at least). Finally a BR I actually can win in 😂
10198,:)
10199,Amazing!
10200,Enjoying the game so far just feels bad no oce servers yet
10201,"Spammed trios with 2 mates all day, I can't remember the last time I have had this much fun. Really well optimized game, smooth combat, skill based but rewarding parry system. GRAPPLING HOOK FEATURE IS INSANELY GOOD. Absolutely recommend"
10202,Can't recommend until they add region lock or ping lock to the game.
10203,"Let's go by parts as my dear Jack The Ripper says,I have played around 19 hours (approximately) If you have played Sekiro,or Black Desert you will be very familiar,The aesthetics is beautiful,drinks a lot of Japanese mythology and ancient gods and the map shows it as there are very spring landscapes,or rice fields there are also places more ""dark and that these places show as the dark side of this same mythology and all compressed into the same map.

In terms of combat, it's like pure Ninja-style combat, meaning that you use swords, swords, cannons, crossbows and bows, plus a mechanic called a reel, the reel is a hook that you can use to climb trees, grab people and perform combos, then each weapon has a different melee style and these weapons have several types of attack and just when the opponent attacks you can do such a parry that the weapon falls to the ground as if it were in real life, regarding the ammunition you use as a utesilos to repair with R and the character in question is on the ground filing the weapon, or cleaning the barrel of the rifle or things like that, it's amazing.

The customization each character you can customize as you want,you can shreeck any character real or fictional and there is a FACE ID recognition that putting a photo the game automatically makes that character by AI,honestly it is a great game and could be hours and hours praising it,seriously try it."
10204,good game
10205,Games great!
10206,very fun indeed...new twist on BR games
10207,This game has potential...
10208,"First I saw this game and thought ""Smh another BR game that'll flop by next week"", but then decided why not give it a shot, graphics look good, combat looks fun, and the characters look appealing. Gotta say, I don't regret one second of it. It's fun, addicting, and I don't see it's death anytime soon. 
Only negative I'll say is that it seems some people with bad internet have the edge in combat, you'll be attacking them but no damage will be done then out of nowhere they combo you. I'm sure the servers will be improved in the future. For my conclusion, is the game worth $20? Yeah... yeah it is. Very good price for what you get In my honest Opinion.

oh yeah, booba. Can't forget that."
10209,"Honestly, this version of the game is even worse than the beta tests. Never ending bugs and spamming ability on attacks, uneven terrain that causes your hit box to be hit and not be able to hit back, parrying frames and heavy attack animations that don't do anything make this game almost unplayable. Not to mention the massive pay walls to get anything makes it seem scummy. Give it a year or two before you even bother trying this game, it needs so many updates that I can't believe they'd actually release this the way it is. My gaming group and I had a much cleaner run while playing the beta tests, and I feel like that's saying something. ALSO, this game is littered with hackers, and they jam every single player into like 4 servers, so there's 0 skill based match making, and 0 anti-cheat at the same time. Really makes it seem like there's no point to making the game ranked if everything is just mashed together. Devs, please take the time to review this games flaws and fix it. I would not recommend even bothering with this game until it's had serious updates. As is, it's definitely a waste of money."
10210,"Stun locking is way to strong.  everytime i try to exit the game it asks me if  i want to keep playing an i have to disable it asking me every time i want to play. any time you open up the tidal (battlepass) menu it always asks you if you want to buy it.  

i understand the combat   Parry(red) the charge attacks? (blue) if someone is parrying use a light attack an just dodge the light attacks.  but what happens when you play trios an 3 people are using a charge attack and a light attack, your dead because of stun lock. let me have a general block 100% of other games have a block where i can hold up my weapon an block any attack. its annoying trying to fight someone just to get stun locked over an over untill death. i try to dodge away/grapple away but still ending up getting stunlocked to death. 

dont waste your time or money"
10211,One of the best games ive played in awhile. Hack and slash easy to grasp Battle Royale. Don't get me wrong it does take skill to be top tier but anyone could hop in and have fun.
10212,"The game has potential, the main problems I have with the game are as follows-

1. Grappling hooks, when you are fighting people you pretty much just get non-stop stunned by getting hit by the hooks. There is no cool down on the hook so just get hooked every second. 

2. Combat, combat just seems like however hits first wins the fight. You just get knocked around and stunned without any real counter play, aside from two characters being able to block melee hits for a few seconds.
 
3. Character abilities, there seems to be two or three characters the feel really strong and are pretty much must play. Viper's ult is an AOE stun that feels like lasts for ever, and seems like the only counter play is running from her. Which you can't do while getting non-stop hooked or knocked around. Then there is the guy that turns into a titan, it seems useless sometimes but then insanely broken other times.

I wish there was a neutral rating. The game is playable but extremely frustrating and not fun at all."
10213,This game is AMAZING!!!
10214,Very good
10215,This game is legit amazing! :D
10216,I enjoy playing the game!
10217,"This game is beautiful and you owe it your attention. 

YES, ITS ANOTHER BR.

 NO, ITS NOT JUST ANOTHER BR.

 The combat and weapon combos/clashing with lights and heavys is so satisfying and bad***. Then throw in 5 or so characters with their own abilites and ultimate(can slightly modify/change abilities/ultimate).Plus some great mobility with grapple and wallrun/climb mechanics. They also have a glyph tree that is pretty similar to LoL's classic rune pages.

Face, eyes, skin, hair is all SO CUSTOMIZABLE(Cant change facial hair COLOR atm). Can really make your character feel like your own.

This is such a refreshing BR that has its own unmatched vibe. I cant really use another game to compare it to(thats a good thing). It looks like ghost of Tushima map wise, and TenchuZ like (in a sense)for movement. 

Combat is alot of fun(make sure you have a good binding for targeting enemies, as it does the aiming/directional following for you with weapon swings when targeted(Not a bad thing!). That leaves you with movement and heavy or light attack combos, as well as option to parry which will result in opponent droppin their weapon. 

Somewhat of a learning curve as far as weapon combos. But if you look at the guides in game menu for each weapon, it really isnt that hard to get the hang of. Let me tell you, once you start clappin cheeks on this game...you are gonna be addicted. Also its not pay to win at all. Money only gets you cosmetics. You have to unlock the Glyphs with the in game currency(choose your glyphs you want to level or unlock wisely. The currency is a bit slow to build if you arent completing quests/dailies.

FYI- PEOPLE WILL SAY ""2 MANY BOTS""
Your first few matches(ranked) are a tutorial of sorts where its against bots. Or first 10 matches if you do quickplay(I think). After that, assuming you arent just terrible and sitting at bronze 5, you wont see really any bots at all. Maybe in quickplay? Idk I spam ranked. No bots for me.

TLDR: GET THIS BR, ITS ORIGINAL AND HAS AN UNMATCHED FEEL TO THE COMBAT. PASS THIS GAME UP IF YOU ARE WEAK AND CANT TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO TO GET INTO THE FEEL OF IT.  IF YOU ARENT A SOFT AS CAN BE JERRY FROM RICK&MORTY... DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, TREAT YO SELF TO NARAKA:BLADEPOINT! 

Or stand up and fold yourself 5 times."
10218,"Booted it up, went into my first random game. 7/0, win. Second game, 12/0, win. Third game, 6/0, win. I'm not sure what the hell is going on, but I'm undefeated and didn't pay much attention in the tutorial. Low skill factor. Button-mash PVP style. It's strangely a good time. It's like Ring Of Elysium with samurai aesthetics. Some cool abilities. I think this game will be getting better over time, they've put a lot into it. I found out DX12 is coming soon in an update, looking forward to it."
10219,"Fun game but poor balance. 

They are trying though."
10220,cool fun boob physics weapons
10221,gg
10222,"-Beside Gacha for cosmetic items, the game is pretty fun and good, the gameplay mechanic is truly epic with variety of weapons and combos.

-From close range combat rambo to stealth, a very unique way of play
I’m not really a fan of battle royale game but this one get me hooked :()

- me like close combate game's so its a good game UwU"
10223,Really good close combat focused BR. Amazing aesthetics and game-play as well.
10224,very fun br
10225,"good game
lots of potential
microtransactions are cosmetic only so who cares, also u can unlock most of them by playing anyway

higher skill ceiling than i initially thought which is good

NA servers are p good"
10226,"My favorite (Battle Royal) style game on steam. I'm not even a battle royal guy, but I love the dynamic of this game. Of course the start was rocky and the game will have bumps along the way. However things seem really promising. The fighting mechanics are F'N nuts! If you are a fan of the martial arts and love character creation, I highly recommend this game. I'm telling you folks. stick with it. This one is special. My heart says 10/10. lol but the way the game is currently i'd rate it 8/10. I know updates and bug fixes will take this game to great places."
10227,"BEST BATTLE ROYAL I HAVE EVER PLAYED

It feels so fun and rewarding
TOTALLY WORTH $20 HANDS DOWN
Best time I HAVE EVER PLAYED
COMBAT FLOW IS AMAZING
CLIMBING MECHANICS IS FLAWLESS 
THEY SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THIS BEAUTIFUL GAME
GET IT TRY IT AND I PROMISE U WONT REGRET IT"
10228,"Monetization is a bit agressive, shouldn't be this much for a paid game, otherwise good game."
10229,"The game tricks you in the first few games by matching you with bots, so you feel good at the game and wont refound it. This is really shady."
10230,good game
10231,it's a great battle royale game with its unique gameplay
10232,"u  play only against  bot  even  in the  ranked  game  !""!!!!!!  dont   drop  u money in  this game"
10233,"Cool concept and really fun to play, but with so much stun locking and such incredibly difficult parrying it's hard to see this game being successful among casual players. It's okay if a game has a high skill ceiling and complex combat mechanics, but this is too hard, atleast for a BR. Combat can be fun and challenging without needing the focus level of someone being on 10kg of Adderall.."
10234,"This is a battle royal something different to the rest, martial arts  and melee weapon combat with cool power ups!!
Definitely worth the money."
10235,This game has alot of potential. The fighting is extremely enjoyable and satisfying. I love the art sytle and all the cosmetics.
10236,I kick my husbands ass in this game
10237,Not usually a fan of BRs but this game is SUPER fun.
10238,I die by Chinese crack squads too much
10239,"Gameplay is meh, nothing special. You'll be playing against bots.

Tag on the hundred layers of monetization from lootboxes to battle passes to skins and different currencies on top of a paid game and this is a hard pass for me. Refunded.


This is everything wrong with monetization in games today. This is just too much, even if it were f2p."
10240,actual good br
10241,"I hate anime

BUT......

Naraka Bladepoint is epic as f***"
10242,stop whining and get good
10243,game is great just need to fix some balance issues ahaha
10244,"Fantastic combat, fun art style, doesn't often feel like I'm disadvantaged to straight up losing due to an unlucky spawn"
10245,Make sure to have an SSD otherwise it is almost impossible to play. I believe this is one of the best and most unique br games with some of the best gameplay!
10246,"Even if gameplay is enjoyable, after three months, still region lock is not implemented."
10247,boobas
10248,"Super fun pvp game, intuitive controls, balanced classes easy to pick up and have fun"
10249,"Apart from the BS of some interactions due to ping, the game has a very solid base. Could also use some work in the transparency of certain game play features, example: a short clip showing the parry timing vs every weapon would be fantastic."
10250,I have created abominations in the character customizer and I can't stop send help
10251,Totally worth the price
10252,"My first time playing a ""Battle Royal"" style game and I must admit this is impressive. Love the combat and skills required thus making battle very complex and exciting. All around, there's a lot to learn regarding combat engagement and team-play to really go deep in this game. Kudos to the developers and hope there will be more updates in the near future to make this game ever more satisfying. - 5 Stars!"

Characters keep repeating the same fucking phrase every 3 seconds.
0 humans, the 4 matches I played every enemy I faced were bots. Won the 4 matches, in a battle royale.
This is like an Early Access game disguised as a full release."

มันเป็นเกมที่สนุกมากในรูปแบบทีม 3 คน แต่ถ้าจะเล่นโซโล่อยากให้คิดดีๆ เพราะเกมมันไม่ค่อยสมดุลในด้านโซโล่
แค่ทุกคนมี ""ท่าไม้ตาย"" เอาไว้ใช้หนีตายก็ทำให้เกมนี้ปวดหัวแล้วอ่ะ คือไม่รู้จะบวกกันไปทำไม กดอัลติก็หนีได้ง่ายๆ เลย

Total: 90/100"
10278,"Fun spin off of the battle royal genre.
"
10279,"I usually don't like BR games at all. I find them far too boring and reliant on gathering skills and playing like a coward. While Naraka Bladepoint still suffers from general BR issues, it still feels worth playing, and has several ways of forcing conflict.

Along with the classic ever-shrinking ring, there are quest scrolls you can pick up that promise great rewards if you can complete a small task. One of these is the ""bounty"" quest, which marks a certain nearby player as your target, allowing you to track their location to a certain degree. That player is also notified of the bounty on their head, and whoever survives the encounter comes out of it with a hefty coin advantage to spend at one of the game's many ""merchant"" chests.

Melee combat is the game's main focus, and verticality plays a huge role. On the surface it's a simple RPS system: lights beat counters which beat focus attacks which beat lights. This ends up being a lot deeper due to the varied melee weapons with different strength light and focus attacks, and further deepens once you get used to the game's dodging, sliding, and grapple hook based movement systems. All of the weapons have their strengths and the fact that the community has jumped from calling at least 4 different weapons OP and broken is a testament to their balance.

Finally the heroes are small in number but varied enough to be interesting. None stand out as particularly op, although some of their ultimates are more annoying than others. Once again the community can't decide which hero is the most broken, meaning they're probably all pretty viable at this stage. I'm sure in the future the meta will develop towards favouring one or two, but so far I haven't felt like any choice has been overly weak."
10280,.
10281,"This game is FRICKING AMAZING! So different from anything else on the market. This game got a lot of depth, great customization (even free ones)."
10282,THIS GAME IS FUCKING HARD AS FUCK
10283,"I enjoyed this alot, since gunshootout is everywhere now in my county."
10284,"Some skils and jades needs a bit of adjusting and implementation new melee mechanics required to make it more about fighting rather then disengaging.The game just released so its definetly in a good spot right now in time we will see 8/10 So far!

If you like melee games you will really enjoy this!"
10285,"A very all around balanced game. recommend it! this is just the beginning, Naraka has a lot of pontential."
10286,I like Boobs :D
10287,"Unique battle royale with satisfying melee combat. Character customization is a big plus. Monetization is the same as in Overwatch, cosmetic loot boxes so nothing too outrageous."
10288,yes
10289,Just git gud
10290,"So i bought this game when it had a ton of negative reviews i can't remember why is it because it's from china or cash shop stuff i can't remember however.

The game is a really fun its a battle royale the game starts you vs bots and maybe a few players i guess either for player base reasons or to ease you in but after a few games when you go up against humans and get destroyed you cry and adapt and overcome.

The fluidity of the game i would say is like a mixture of Gunz the duel running around the map and dark souls stagger mixed together. Lots of skill expression with parry which can disarm people then steal the gold weapon and kill them lol and pretty fast lobbies leads to a very entertaining game. You can have some rough moments with rng items from loot for sure but if your prepared to learn you will have a good time.

Conclusion
Graphics - Great
Gameplay - Exciting and skilful
UI - could do with a bit of work for setting options i think but overall its fine.
Some more optimisation and i think the game will feel 100%

Tips for new players - Grappling hook is your friend and crouch move while your healing to keep your self active."
10291,"Awsome game atleast for the price u pay for this!
Will entertain me for many hours <3
The blocking can be a bit hard but its good its not to easy as in for example chivalery"
10292,"Love this game so far. I've only done 2 matches, but it's super fun"
10293,GG
10294,"""None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why""
Stop waiting and play the game, We need more people in the NA servers. We need more to take on the Chinese, they're too good."
10295,"Great fun and the party system actually works unlike a lot of recent releases. 

Combat feels good and there is a lot of action compared to other BRs."
10296,"If you love RPG elements, PvP and BattleRoyale I'm pretty sure you gonna love this game."
10297,"Makes me sad to the core this is ""another"" battle royale.
Wish they went for an arena type or anything else.
Such a beautiful game ruined by a trend."
10298,when i see 3 monks i get 10 fps
10299,"+Great combat
+Diverse characters

Easy to get into but insanely high skill ceiling"
10300,"I'm playing on the NA server and on the main menu it says 40ms. but in game is at a steady 150ms. So yea the servers are super shit at the moment. But its not just that there's no way to play the game on any drive but ssd. I installed it on my hdd and the lag spikes are just unbearable, it is prob a mix of it being on hdd and the shit servers ngl. Anyways at the time of writing this I cannot recommend this game at the moment. Hopefully with the games popularity and influx of money they can optimize the game and servers so that you can play it installed on a hdd drive without issues like every other single game. Usually the only issue is increased loading times, not the case with this game. Any lag is also a very big disadvantage, it being a battle royale and all. And this ain't even a little lag this is an unplayable amount of lag. FIX YOUR SHIT! I have way above min and recommended specs btw and so this couldn't be the issue and I've heard people with 30's series NVIDIA graphics saying they've also had performance issues. AGAIN FIX YOUR SHIT! If all of this is fixed the game seems like it could be very fun as it has interesting mechanics and lots of potential."
10301,Amazing
10302,A different twist in a crowded area of gaming. In depth fighting and customization allows for an enjoyable game to keep coming back to.
10303,I like this game
10304,fun game
10305,"I wanted to love this game, I mean it looks amazing. 
But I felt that the combat did not feel as good as I seen on some of the positive comments. 
My specs are far above the recommended requirements, but it felt like playing with 30fps even though I had ~180-200fps. 

VICTORY!
My first game (solo) I had 12 kills, am I amazing? No, but the bots are incredibly bad. That many? Yes. And they can spawn right in front of you.

ANOTHER VICTORY!
My first game (trio) I got 6 kills, bots constantly spawned right in front of us. It was at a ridiculous level. 
Are the bots somewhat difficult? No, they start spam-trying-to-heal while you slap them silly with a stick.

+ It looks good
+ Great new idea for a BR
+ Great physics, wiggle wiggle

- Combat felt, meh
- Looting felt slow, due to inventory layout
- How are there so many bots in a game, it's seriously sad."
10306,Amazing combat
10307,very fun much wow
10308,Obviously the game if fresh and still needs work and more content but overall I am super happy with it! the combat is amazing the graphics are beautiful and the characters are pretty balanced. would 100% recommend
10309,Good game for feeder
10310,"Good Game :)

10313,Great gameplay!
10314,good game
10315,"There's plenty of ideas at play here that try very hard to make the game enjoyable, but all of them fall short of beating how clunky the game play is. Only one character transforms into the Vajra, which immediately makes thing unbalanced. Weapons themselves have little balance, and combat devolves into whoever can knock down the other character, Dynasty Warriors style, first. Grappling, one of the novel features of this game, is made frustrating by the fact that any attack, or enemy grapple, will cancel your grapple. Meaning that if you try to grapple to maneuver in combat, you will just get ganked. Ultimately, no, I can't recommend this."
10316,Not Bad
10317,Epic graphic with very fun
10318,NAYSUH
10319,good
10320,"This game is really fun. I get the same feeling from another battle royale game if I am getting third partied. There are ridiculous teammates that engage then escapes, leaving me behind the fight. This game would be a lot better if we get more precise and easier pings such as last seen enemy, attack, timer to engage etc. Also, it would be really nice if we get language/region select because I keep playing with screaming chinese people. If not, maybe better scroll voice commands?

Overall, this game takes battle royale to a different level wherein you have to learn every combo, dodge movements, and counters to every heroes and weapons. It just lack of pings and communication whilst in combat."
10321,"Very much fun, beautiful graphics and intriguing combat system."

10331,the first games will be filled with actual bots id say the first 2 hour period of playtime but after that you get merged with actual players and becomes an enjoyable learning curve
10332,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME GAME!!!
10333,"I usually listen to Steam reviews as my sole source of what's good to play and what isn't.  Had it been ANY other day, I would've just brushed this game to the side.  However, i've grown so desperate to find a new game that I finally sat down and said, ""I'm spending this hundred bucks on my account TONIGHT...""  And wow, there couldn't have been a better time, because I ran across this absolute GEM.. 

I brushed the reviews to the side even further once I saw the Battle Royale tag and instantly got curious; so I looked up YouTube footage instead.   Saw that the game looked pretty interesting, figured i'de give it a shot.  

6 hours later, and it's 6 a.m. and I work at 8 a.m.

The game is bloody THAT addicting and good.  Unique, and extremely well polished game for it being in its earlier stages.  This game is going to be huge, so I recommend if you're reading this before August 19th to get in on the action to get some collector items!  (if you're into that sort of thing)

Either way, this is the best new game i've played this entire year.  And i'm going to be playing it for quite awhile too, if the devs keep up their work on this.

It's a fresh idea, brought to you through a seasoned concept that we're all familiar with.  It combines the best parts of every Royale, and puts it into a massively user friendly, easy to learn style.. insanely unique style.  As the combat does not involve Modern Day TurboChad M416's, AK's, AR15 variations, and Futuristic Sniper Rifles.. instead, its the absolutely decked version of a CHAD ASF Medival, with a tinge of magic style that no other game has come close to attempting yet.. (maybe Realm Royale is the closest it gets in this style, albeit, it's a long shot of pale in comparison differences between the two we're talking here, however).  And what i've written so far has excluded the combat in the game, which is the draw of this game itself.

With all of the weapons, in coordination with the unique character abilities, and built in runes.  Coupled with the Glyphs you can pick up which can grant broad overall increased unique stat bonuses.. all the way to changing how weapons, (and sometimes your character in general) functions... it creates an absolutely ENDLESS amount of diversity in your gameplay.  

No two games are exactly alike, yet, every game is virtually the same. -- I dont know how to word it, this game is just incredibly unique --  It's so worth the amount of money.  And speaking of money, nothing in this game is Pay To Win either.  It is purely cosmetic features you're paying extra for with the differentiation between editions of purchase.

This game also looks beautiful, as well as has SO much going on at all times.. I can see myself playing this for thousands of hours before getting bored of it.  From the in-game events that randomly happen and only happen once every dozen games or so.. sometimes back-to-back... to the missions that you can collect, in game.  The quests you can receive outside of game.  

There's a team aspect I haven't even tried yet.. but saw there's healing, and tanking abilities along with all of it... if you're on the fence, just buy the game already.  It's stupidly worth it, and my only warning is:  GOOD LUCK NOT GETTING ADDICTED!

(P.S. As I stated earlier, Steam reviews REALLY FAILED ME ON THIS TITLE!!  If you look at the reviews, people are literally spamming bad review after bad review because this game is so ridiculously good.. and the individuals aren't able to play it because they don't have a server for their area of the world yet xD.. if that doesn't scream: BUY THIS GAME.. then idk what does)

P.S.S. I feel like i've missed out on so many things with this game too.  I work in 2 hours, i'm putting this review up before I g2b because these dev's need more hype.  This game deserves it all!  So i'll close with the dynamic of movement in this game -- It's absolutely INSANE!  You can literally move off EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF TERRAIN IN THIS GAME!!!!  You can jump off a wall, and go into a sick combo spin slash... every movement, every block, every hit...... it all feels rewarding.  It all FEELS genuinely incredible.  and most of all, it all feels so fluid and very, extremely well put together.

The skill ceiling is so high.. yet the game is setup so casual.   It's literally the most casual, deep game i've ever experienced in my nearly 30 years of gaming.  

And yeah.  I'm going to be thinking about this game all day at work, and cannot wait to get fired for sleeping through my alarm clock sometime this week due to sleep deprivation from going absolutely insane because i'm going to play this game too much.  

The only drawback on the game so far, is that there is a slight problem with shooting weapons incredibly far distances.  The hit registers are weird on that spectrum, but besides that (A) it still works (B) it makes up such a miniscule part of the game, it really doesn't matter.

TLDR:   HURRY UP AND BUY!"
10334,super unbalanced game oof
10335,You throw hands against 59 other people. It's dope.
10336,The most fun I've ever had in a battle royale game.
10337,"Bad connection, stuttering, rendering and connecting at the same time"
10338,"Honestly, the game looks amazing, and I can see it definitely being fun.

You may question my strange way of phrasing in seeing it being fun, well let me explain. This game.. has too many bots. The game doesn't tell you, but the first few matches are going to have these ridiculously easy to beat, brain dead bots. Like as soon as you break their armor they will try to slowly walk away and heal letting you easily destroy them. This is all a business tactic to make you feel like a god in the game, giving you a good experience so you can stay longer past the refund period, which is kinda shady to me tbh. I know its $20 so its not that expensive of a game, but its really scummy to make you pay a box price for a game and then basically try to shake down more money out of you by saying ""Oh hey, here are all these cool cosmetics, but you have to pay even more to get them! Haha! Give us your money!"" That's why most BR games are Free to play with a cosmetic shop, its a working model, there is just too much greed in this game.

Back to my original point, I played 5 matches and other than my friend, I don't think I ran into a single other player and we won all 5 matches. It was so easy, too easy for me to recommend this game. I like winning, don't get me wrong, but I like feeling that its an earned victory and not me curbstomping Super omegalul ez bots. It doesn't give me a good estimation of the gameplay in a supposedly pvp based game of my actual skill. It's like playing literally any first person shooter against bots that intentionally shoot a silhoutte around you even when you stand still and you can just mow them down by 1 tapping em. It's the exact same feel, very unrewarding. 

I heard people have said that after 1-2 matches you run into players, I played 5 matches with no players in sight (Or if they were they... were well... indistinguishable from the bots) At the very least a little icon should be implemented in to the nametags of players and bots so you can tell which is which. You don't learn anything going up against target dummies and the game cannot accurately gauge your skill by pitting you against target dummies that stand no chance of beating you.

Other then the glaring flaws of greedy tactics to keep players in the game and running an overbearing cosmetic shop that really should have a way of earning in game currency (SINCE YOU PAY A BOX COST FOR THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE) the overabundance of bots. The customization is awesome, the graphics are great, at times the combat feels somewhat clunky but overall is alright, the mobility and grapples are really cool but I feel like it should be a cooldown based thing rather than an item based thing.

If this game were to go free to play I would change this to a recommended review, but there are just too many greedy corporate strategies used in this game to keep you playing and shake you down for your money.

--Addendum-- Part of the community is really, really toxic and do not take kindly to any slight criticism of their game because they feel like its being attacked as if it were their own child."
10339,not bad
10340,i want to refund
10341,nice
10342,insanely fun XD
10343,"unstable server and laggy game with ryzen 9 3900x, x570 and rx5700xt"
10344,I love the combat mechanic of the game! I've been playing FPS/BR games for a long time now and now needed to play another type of game that is not first person shooter and I found this game! never disappointed me and had fun ever since!
10345,good game
10346,"Honestly a very mechanic intensive battle royal, but man it is pretty fun to play coming from someone who has usually strayed from BR games. I just hope the developers can listen to the players and improve the games current issues and I can see it as a banger game"
10347,"New experience of melee combat. It's time to ""bacok-bacokan !"""
10348,#1 Battle Royal ever made!
10349,"SkiLL= Like the game
No SkiLL = Hate life"
10350,pow
10351,have you ever seen a BR game that has 3 same characters in the same team? three Viper Nings in one team can screw the whole lobby up and this is sad. the game is great but please fix this crap
10352,Best Classic Battle Royale Game! Thank you for releasing Yoto Hime. Hope to see other new characters from Onmyoji! OwO/
10353,noice
10354,good game
10355,"I do not like this kind of game usually, but the graphics, the character customization choices, the scenery. Amazing."
10356,smooth fps
10357,"During the first couple of hours Naraka feels like a cheap mobile game, but once you actually understand the combat and the movement the game is a masterpiece. Highly recommended if you are a fan of melee combat games"
10358,"The only downside I have about the game is it's buy to play and they have loot boxes, battlepass, ect... otherwise the actual gameplay is very fun and takes a lot of requires a bit of practice. The movement is pretty smooth once you get use to it otherwise it will feel a bit clunky. There are bots in the first 2-3 matches. 

Game is a solid 7.5-8/10 it's worth the purchase imo.


"
10359,This game was great.. it just about time it become famous !!!
10360,Yes
10361,a very fun and interesting battle royale with great mechanics and so much great content
10362,挺好玩的，但是太卡，要是能出个大洋洲服务器就好了
10363,nice
10364,"Came for the gameplay mechanic aside booba, its good tho but need to optimize the gameplay more especially  while war with other squad. I rarely comment in the community because this game need to pay so thats why. Hope to see more update soon. Good game 24entertainment."
10365,It's still pretty good
10366,"No ping restriction. AFAIK there IS actually a region lock but the chinese and oce players are just using vpn's to play on NA and EU. Fighting high ping players is a miserable experience. Will change my review if it ever gets added.
"
10367,they call me chingy
10368,aWESOME
10369,Nice
10370,NOPE I dont want to play its too much work for so little reward
10371,It's okay.
10372,pretty fun
10373,Don't know why there is hate it a great game of your looking to play something that isn't a FPS shooter this is perfect!
10374,"A breath of fresh air from your usual BR. I have been a huge fan of fighting games & third person adventure/action games, and this ticks many boxes in those departments. Hoping this game takes off like other BR's, I think it's only a matter of time."
10375,"game dbrr
"
10376,I enjoyed the game but everytime i tried to play it i keep getting horrible frames (prob due to my specs)
10377,"cool fighting mechanics, movement needs to be improved more and the game needs to be optimized"
10378,"i'm not a guy that plays battle royale because hates the camping concept,, but this game brings you to battle close up using melee weapons. so more interactive gameplay, fast-paced (within 15 minutes per game), characters with two abilities (requires strategy to benefit them at max), and beautiful chara models. microtransactions are for gacha cosmetics only.

But downside is once you get pinned down by 3 people beating you up, you're as good as dead. idk, i'm still new player, still learning.

Overall amazing game, perfect for quick games to get into and hack n slash. must buy"
10379,Nioh like pvp combat
10380,"Pretty fun, looking forward to see future updates and stuff"
10381,"Unique and fun melee based BR game. Easy to pick up and numerous progression options that add that addictive grind element. Micro-transactions are plenty but all cosmetic, and overall design and style is appealing. Overall the most enjoyable game I've played all year.

9/10"
10382,need more optimization. 9/10
10383,"STOP ADDING BOTS TO BATTLE ROYALE GAMES
PLEASE"
10384,"One of the best Battle Royale games out there!
It's rly addictive and fun to play!"
10385,"having i7 8800k, 1080 8G, 32G ram, and placed in ssd dir. having 70% usage of proc and gpu, and got 58 fps in combat on lowest setting, so fucking awesomee"
10386,"Laptop don’t like this game because cpu and gpu are always over 7x ~ 90 degree. I recommand guys just play 3-4 hours then let your laptop gonna rest , if you dont want your components of laptop to become a hot pan"
10387,This game isn't optimized. I think this game was developed by noob :)
10388,my first fav survival game <3
10389,"anime waifu best

10390,bravo
10391,gud
10392,How can I switch my main server to Europe?
10393,"Keywords: bots, stun lock, spear, spam, lag"
10394,"don't mind about the micro transactions, they're very generous on rewards. good gameplay, but obviously need more improvement and optimizations"
10395,"NARAKA: BLADEPOINT has definitely been an overall thrilling experience for me from the art style to the gameplay itself. It's very engaging and intense at times, making strategical approaches more valuable before you start slicing and dicing your opponents. The only take away that I can find in this game is that there seems to be no real way to do anything when it comes to fighting multiple enemies at once, aside from popping your ult and ability while running away. You get barraged by focus attacks and normal attacks, practically making it impossible to focus on one opponent. Outside of that, the game is definitely worth the price. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good battle royale united with samurai elements."
10396,"very fun shank everybody
"
10397,Sweatiest battle royale in existence.  Seriously needs skill based matchmaking or something I am getting killed by chinese kids all day lol
10398,"Great combat, game should be free but still worth the $20."
10399,Albion 3d
10400,nice
10401,I'm flyin
10402,PLEASE ADD MORE HEROES AND MAPS
10403,"Great gameplay, can seem janky at first until you understand how the ""blue attacks"" work.  Overall game feels great and parkour mechanics are awesome.  Matches flow well and I think this has a high skill cap and huge lifespan potential."
10404,Good game
10405,"So far I like the character designs but there could be better outfits though, some of the outfits cost too much silk but eh. Basically this is a brawler version of Apex when it comes to getting skins and accessories."
10406,"swords go swoosh swoosh, bam, dead... pretty based

would rate based/based piss ph level:BASED"
10407,Only BR I like
10408,"for $20 its well worth it. Naraka has fun melee combat  and grappling play. The customization is very nice as well as gud boob physics. Don't wait for a sale. $20 is not much for what you get. 

I will say that the loot boxes are very low % for better items...which encourages real money for cosmetics, that is probably my only complaint so far. give us an option to use in game currency for the purple and gold cosmetics."
10409,"I've never really been into battle royals... but this one got me hooked. Love that it is actually based on skill, manages to make me feel like a badass ninja. Highly recommended."
10410,One of the most exciting and fun BR i have played in years. Great combat and amazing graphics make this a must play. There is so many items too unluck and skills to gain for your characters which makes it fun and exciting to log in and play. AMAZINGGGGG game
10411,"First impression : A really good battle royale game, with new hack-n-slash BR genre, superb graphics & customization."
10412,"iam not gonna recommend this game to anyone till you lock out high ping warriors from entering eu servers.
till then see ya !"
10413,Fun game good combat
10414,"good
"
10415,"Fun Factor Pretty High-Medium.

 Not Pay to Win.

Maps is truly a scenery to die for. Little details that just makes your day. Love to see more maps of this caliber!


Even though it high fantasy, I would like to see some realistic physics in the game such as fall damage..weather...etc.

Regardless, I was doubtful because of the ""new wave"" of quick buck Chinese game developers known for but if you are fine with  playing with random strangers from Australia to China, then you might want to give this game a chance. Its a breathe of fresh air in this genre that been done to dead."
10416,I honestly hate the monetization of this game but the actual game itself is so enjoyable that I will continue to come back to it over and over
10417,great game
10418,"Fluid movement, fun combat, good gameplay overall. Though it is unfortunate in the world of modern free BR titles that this one is not, I think that the gameplay absolutely makes it worth the money."
10419,dwedwedwedwedwed
10420,A great game!
10421,"Awesome game, hope get bigger"
10422,Super Fun!
10423,Fun take on a battle royale. Really fun with friends.
10424,This is the battle royal I've been looking for
10425,"Buy to play is not bad at all. Less bots and hackers. 

Stop crying about the cosmetic, it's in every game. Don't expect cosmetic to be free. The developer needs to make money somehow.

Gameplay and combat is fun. That's enough."
10426,the games is tons of fun and addictive def  worth it
10427,good game
10428,"Honestly Ignore the Mixed Reviews, this game is actually really fun, Combat is overall solid and fun, graphics and cosmetics are really good looking and its pretty well optimized. People are Review bombing currently due to the game not having SA/OCN servers."
10429,fun gaem
10430,wait... this.. isnt fornite :(
10431,good game
10432,Good shit.
10433,good game and graphics
10434,"lol this is the BR I was waiting for, just PERFECT"
10435,I like dis game a lot.
10436,The game is fantastic. Movement is orgasmic. Finally a battle royale here you wont get sniped form 50000 meters away. Combat is skill based but also gives players a chance if they havent gotten the hang of it yet.
10437,This game is v fun. Wish there were less bots since it makes the game feel cheep. Theres a good amount of depth in the combat.
10438,"This game was made and design mainlyh be chinese devs, it well designed. Though like any game it recently came out of beta and there are still some kinks that need to be worked out, just be patience and in t ime they be ironed out. When it comes to the game it self well there is a good possiblity you may encounter a lot of hangs and lag when loading the game and playing even if your ping is 18ms! i can only hope that they resolve this for the players at some point. This game is very deep and complex with buttons so you need to take the time to learn the controlls for each weapon and its abilities. 

Then we have the discord ... well ive been on alot and while the users aer pretty supportive and cool, the devs are very brick and mortar unforgiving if your just making a joke that supposely broke some rule and didnt reaslize it. they dont care and your banned. so i refunded teh game bc i can be part of a community like that that doesnt account for our own humanity and that everyone makes mistakes, it how we grow and become better people. the dont seem to care about that. so be careful on the discord with what you say this one takes no prisoners"
10439,"It started off good but the blocking system is terrible you have to attack in order to block , its really a game of chance than it is about skill and im not feeling it after playing a couple of hours of the game . Fix this terrible blocking/ attack system you got going on here cuz it unbearable"
10440,Nyaaaaaaa
10441,First time playing something like this AND i love it :)
10442,"Super fun game, give it a shot. If a style doesn't work for you switch it up. learn to block which can be tricky with hitting both mouse buttons at same time whenever they charge up a blue attack."
10443,"TL;DR

Pros
- Kung Fu, martial arts, Melee focused BATTLE ROYALE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Had over 80+ hours in beta
Excited for Naraka release.
When I played the beta. 
*This was THE most fun game I could remember playing in years.*
I LOVED Naraka. I was ready to play this game and this game only.


Finally, release day comes. Open it up. Do the tutorial again. Finish tutorial.

THE FIRST SCREEN THAT POPS UP WHEN YOU REACH THE MAIN MENU IS 
""HEY WANNA BUY OUR BATTLEPASS?""

S-sure! Its like every other battle pass where I can buy it, 
and use the money to buy it again later right?

No. 

If you save up every piece of gold given by the battle pass you still have to pay more later. 
Even after paying for the base game? Come on, please be a little generous!

Now I get it, some of you are screaming 

""THEN DON'T BUY THE BATTLE PASS, ITS JUST COSMETICS!""

But, please. try to understand. *try*. I wanted to buy the battle pass.
I wanted to support this game.

I was ready to buy the battle pass + spend money on cosmetics. Maybe I did this in other games because I felt like they were being quite generous, so I did not mind spending more. But with this one? you *have to spend more*.

*I was so excited for this game to come out* and then this happened. 
It felt like a red flag, a warning. 
There is no generosity here.
Only bots, and Chinese players coming to NA to stomp on new players.


Please, understand. I have nothing against the Chinese. I just don't want to fight an opponent with 200+ ping. I don't want to play SOLOs just to be obviously cheated by players who are coordinating together IN SOLOs.

Naraka, its not about the money, its about how you don't respect us.

我不是你的敌人
Wǒ bùshì nǐ de dírén


我只想做你的朋友
Wǒ zhǐ xiǎng zuò nǐ de péngyǒu"
10444,"I watched a friend play and I thought, huh... a battle royale where ranged doesn't cheap everything out?

A couple of abilities are annoying to deal with, and sometimes you just get screwed... but this is way more fun than pubg, apex, or 2weeks. Recommended :)"
10445,very but if you can invest the time to get into it
10446,Fun to play with friends :) highly recommended for a BR fan players !!
10447,"Game is super fun....Until you run into Yoto Hime with a spear for the 1,000th time,"
10448,Best fighting game ever once they fix ping top 10 for sure.
10449,"I'm only saying no because I believe your average player will not find this game as something worthy of spending a lot of their time in. 

I've longed for a BR game that allowed you to actually customise the hero look not just with skins, but their physical appearance. That part of this game is really cool to me. There's a lot you can do with how you customise your character's look. Overall, the game can be fun at times, but can also be a hair pulling experience. 

A game's mechanic should be easy to learn, but hard to master. This is not that game. It is hard to learn and harder to master. Combat can get janky when there are groups of people fighting all at once. Trying to counter, charge or dodge is chaos when everyone is hitting... well, everyone. The parkour portion of the game is cool, but can also be frustrating. Like trying to jump over something but for some reason your character just jumps up and down like a cheerleader and you end up spacebar spamming. 

Still, I do like it, but I don't see this game sustaining it's player base. The hardcore lovers of this game will stick with it, and white knight the shit out of it, but I believe your average player will get discouraged and eventually move on to another game. Despite what may seem like a negative comment, I do hope it does well. I like my Matari.

**Update**
Just re-installed, but started reading about the Chinese hackers. Uninstalled."
10450,"This is the best battle royale game I have ever played.

Pro:

-each melee weapon has its own combo
-many ways to kill an opponent
-unique combat mechanism(basic beats parry, parry beats charged, and charged beats basic, master this and you can get many kills)
-successfully parry can make enemy drop their weapon on the ground
-its hard to cheat since aimbot is useless cuz of the combat mechanism,
 maybe theres other cheats but I believe its harder to cheat in this game compare to other battle royale games
-not pay to win, 
the micro transaction is to buy pretty outfit and weapon skins and I think thats reasonable, 
if you are stingy, you still can win the game with default outfits
-everyone can be a spiderman. 
I think this what makes this game feels superior compare to any battle royale game. The grappling hook feels so smooth to travel into any buildings.

Con: 

-theres only 3 mode which are solo, trio and deathmatch,
well its like other battle royale games but I think its really cool if the dev can add 4squad and 5squad mode hahah


I am sorry theres only one con I can give at the moment
This game deserves a good rating so I give 9/10
For people who is complaining why the game is not free, please understand that not all good games should be free, both paid games and free games have their own advantage and we should understand that. If you cant buy it, then dont buy. Video games are not essential. Its a luxury and people should only buy when they can afford it

"
10451,so so fun!!!
10452,"truly an amazing game combats so much fun
"
10453,Great game.
10454,"pretty fun, nice take on a battle royal. I do not expect to play hundreds of hours."
10455,"This game is fun, especially if you're good at it. The only thing that's wack is that there's no region lock. So a lot of the time you get your booty clapped by Japanese players, and the sync is a bit off, still fun though."
10456,fun asf
10457,Very fun!
10458,"This game is great.  Fast paced combat that feels similar to a fighting game.  One of the better BR's I've played with very unique gameplay.

There are some concerns I have with some people experiencing heavy latency that can cause fights to be a little more difficult and a few of the mechanics to work improperly, but when it is working it's a whole lot of fun."
10459,Oten
10460,It dont feel complete its rough around the edges and the fighting is basicly a FPS type of melee fighting but not like the good melee games in its class its like apex legends but eastern fighters with no real reason to why or how people hit you somtimes and its really just a waste of 20$ i dont recommend its like fortnite with swords
10461,"Terrible just awful , parkour if u can even call it that feels sluggish and all over the place, alot of chinese people and bots that just dont do shit.
Combat feels i don't even know how to say it it just feels terrible."
10462,Good.
10463,The game is really fun
10464,aweawea
10465,so far i think the game is perfect and balanced.  it can only get better if they add on to what is there. no nerfs plz
10466,what a wonderful lovely game to play <3 i luv it very much ^^
10467,Just flat out fun.
10468,One of the best pvp games I've played. it's really fun and unique.
10469,trash
10470,"I don't gernerally enjoy BR's anymore but this game feels awesome.
-Very nice combat, feels like an fighting game kinda (very reaction based but still easy enough compared to most fighting games), there is a HUGE amount and possiblities for outplaying.
-nice TTK (not to fast, not to slow, perfect for a mostly melee based game).
-VERY IMPRESSIVE character customization (Black Desert like), i can make a character look like a real life clebretiy or even myself, you can upload a picture and it will create a face for example.
-nice japanese/ asian astethics. 
-good price, there is an ingame store with cosmetics and a battlepass, very similar to RB 6 or Apex"
10471,I'm addicted please send help
10472,"Like lots of people, I have mixed feelings about the game. 

The pros of this game are its art direction, fast-paced combat and team play. While the game is superb in these areas, the fact that it's a Battle Royale puts a lot of people off. And what's awkward is that the Battle Royale mode is limited to solo or trios, so you lose the social aspect of BR.

Art: 9/10
The art style in this game is extremely good, from the gorgeous illustrations to the 3D models. Everything has a great Wuxian finesse to it. The character creation in this game is awesome, especially the smart feature where you can upload photos to have the game generate faces. However, it is still not close to the Godly character creation system in Black Desert, mainly because there are no body sliders. Skins in this game are varied and I would say worth to pay for. I don't like  loot boxes but so far the skins I opened were pretty decent. Hopefully the developers add more heroes and skins in the future, because it is a big selling point.

Combat 9/10
To me, Naraka's combat reminds me of 2 other games I'm very fond of: Monster Hunter (The grappling hook and certain weapons such as great sword share a lot of similarities.) and 流星蝴蝶剑 (I heard developers from this game moved on to make Naraka, thus the similarities). The combat is fast-paced, stylish, and fun. The weapon types vary a lot and encourages different play styles. Despite how fast things happen, the combat is not exactly mechanically intensive. Even a boomer like me can do combos, animation cancels, and sick plays. Fights are more decided by reads, which should be familiar to Fighting Game fans. It's like playing a Fighting Game but removing the crazy pretzel inputs and the 1-frame links.  3 vs 3 combat is also very fun, but balancing might be tricky since certain characters will just be better at team-fights than solo play. 

Battle Royale: 3/10

Despite how great everything else is about this game. The fact that it is a Battle Royale just puts me and a lot of people off.  There are so many BR's on the market, there is no competing with them, and people who likes fighters gets put off by the BR modes. The down time in BR really break the flow of the game. Down time is good for social games since you can talk and just fool around, but in Naraka you can't even queue with more than 2 other friends. I understand the trio limit is meant to make the game less chaotic but it would be nice to have an option for large teams in casual matches. It was so difficult to get 2 buddies buy this game because nobody wanted to play a BR, and when we finally had more friends join, only 3 can play together at once. 

I mostly play Bloodbath because the combat is what I came for. I just want to fight, fight and fight. I wish the developers would put focus on that. And even from a e-sport perspective, death matches are just more exciting to watch than people running around the map. Another thing I can think of that would make the game exciting is putting more objectives on map to encourage contention between teams and force fights.

Final Verdict:

Yea, the game is definitely worth its price. Just really really really hope they shift away from the Battle Royale format and focus on combat."

10474,very fun to play
10475,"A nice fresh take on the Battle Royale genre. Pretty fun solo experience, more fun co-op experience. First couple ranks you'll see a lot of bots, then you'll wish you were fighting bots again.

Fights become very different once you start realizing people are good enough to parry attacks and utilizing the grappling system. The last few players fighting on the map is pretty sweaty, but fun at the same time.  Can't even get mad losing a good fight.

Very beautiful looking game. Customization of characters is insane.

Don't really like the Battle Pass in a paid game, but don't really care either. It has some nice rewards and the cosmetics looks pretty good. Pay if you want, don't if you don't.

Biggest issue is the fact you'll face some people that desync because it seems like it's player-base is global, I think. Worst way to lose a fight at the end.

As someone who adores fashion and customization in games, I wish there were more. We probably will get more down the line, and maybe some new heroes/weapons."
10476,This game F***ing sucks. Game put me in a infinite loop of auto attacks and the game was unplayable. Couldn't even od the tutorial because it was so bugged.
10477,iz good

10481,"This game is actually pretty decent. It has a new take on Battle Royale. Mostly focusing on martial arts and heavy melee combat, with some ranged weapons thrown in. 

There are some issues with connectivity for some and no region lock, but maybe that'll come later. The graphics are decent and look good, however the game does need a little better optimization for 1440p and up, at least for me anyways. 

The game play while being repetitive at times is still great and actually fun. It does appear that the game seems unbalanced at times, at least for me. Some characters seem overpowered and maybe need a nerf, such as say Yoto Hime. The overall combat system in this game is great, at least in my opinion. 

The system at times does seem to be a little flawed in the sense of that, the only way you seem to maybe potentially win, is to pick up a legendary, otherwise good luck. The game is cheap and for the price you get what you pay for. Lots of people don't like the micro-transactions and I do agree that it does suck. However, you don't need to buy them, they add no value and are purely cosmetic. 

Character customization is off the walls in this game. Other developers and games should take note here. I've heard of people creating some pretty neat stuff. 

The progression seems to be okay and not so much of a grind, but it could be a tad better. You progress through levelling up and you can acquire items that way or through quests and weapon progression. Overall this game is good and definitely worth the price. Like all the grappling that's going on in the game, I'm hooked."
10482,its fun.
10483,just buy xbox series S and play with gamepass looks sweet
10484,"good game im a huge fan of martial arts and grappling hooks 
never been a real fan of battle royals but im quiet pleased with this one"
10485,"Naraka Grapplepoint,a very unique and competitive BR.....My only issue is the grappling hook. It becomes VERY frustrating when someone spams grappling hook to initiate a combo. Within certain distances, there isn't anything you can do about it. Either reduce the amount of grappling hooks you can carry, take away the initial stun, or give it a cooldown."
10486,great game next big BR
10487,"Okay! Let me summarize! This review ain't meant for faint of heart. If you're reading this you may experience seizures or heart attacks MULTIPLE of them! You have been warned sir of the sirs or madam! Little bit about my background! I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top naraka player in the entire armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. While I play this game I'm the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.  I can be anywhere, anytime, and even dance on your head before  I kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands, imagine if i had a real weapon. Being that said this game is on point being the best battle royale game out there it has everything and me in it, what else you need. Aight cya later kid on the ladder or not ya scrub.

10493,a better variation of battle royale
10494,"Hey you guys, this is my honest review on the game, thus far.
Pros:
-Firstly and foremost, the game is pretty solid and basically gives you everything that you re hoping for.
-Great graphics, fun playstyle unique weapons, characters and skills. 
-Although the game has a lot of in game purchases it doesnt affect gameplay to the slidest.
-Unique gameplay, out of the box, battle royale.
Cons:
-During fighting, the camera is a little bit shaky, meaning the rotation of the camera while targeting a player is at sometimes unstable, nothing to much. 
-Low variety on characters and weapons, but i ll give it a pass cause its still an early game.
Overall, a pretty damn good game with a unique style of a battle royale. Still needs a lot of work. 
But for the time being, for 20 bucks its a terrific choice.
"
10495,fantastic i love it fresh take on all the BR games
10496,"I cant recommend this game to anyone in this state. With battle pass and filled with micro transactions  this game should be Free to play. Another problem , there is no region lock, you get a lot of Chinese players on NA servers teleporting everywhere with their lag and impossible to kill."
10497,"I previously gave this game a negative review based on the lack of servers in my region, After addressing the issue they have added OCE servers. This is tremendous that a company is able to listen to feedback and act fast on them. 

[h1] PROS [/h1]
[list]
[*]OCE servers
[*]A battle royale that isn't a shooter and has a lot of thought and love put into the game
[*]There's a game mode where you just fight endlessly for a few minutes and the player with the most kills wins. This is amazing for when someone doesn't like battle royales or you had enough of the game mode.
[*]The abilities each character has feels different and fun. especially the ultimate abilities
[*]The swordplay feels great and no weapon feels useless.
[*]The parkour feels very fluid and gives you plenty of freedom
[*]The developers listen to feedback fast


[/list]

[h1] CONS [/h1]
[list]
[*]There's a mechanic in the game where you have a grappling hook that lets you parkour over walls and onto trees, you can also use it to catch up to a player and stun them. this can cause a stun lock in trio when a full team is repeatedly grappling to you. 
[*]When someone has high ping, they have an advantage over you, and this can happen often.
[*]Speaking of stun lock, some weapons can cause it and it feels like counter attacking or dodging doesn't work at all, whether it is a lack of game knowledge or an actual mechanic, it can be very frustrating.

[/list]

[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]
The games concept is simple, but it works. The fighting and the parkour feel amazing and every game feels intense and fun. i'm not a huge fan of Battle Royales but this one impressed me, especially when the developers added an OCE server so soon after feedback really gives me hope for this games future.

[h1]9/10 [/h1]"
10498,It super fun but some times I have a lag spike so maybe that just needs to get fixed
10499,"Good Game.
If you dont know much about it. 
Just see the videos on twitch and you will love it, I'm convinced."
10500,actual good game.
10501,"Very polished! A lot of quests and things to do apart from the Battle Royal itself... And the battle Royal feeling is good! I like the controls... Easy to learn but hard to master!
You can climb everything!!! you dont get stuck like in COD or other BR games.
Graphics are very beautiful! Developers did a great job!

Thank you for a great game... keep up the good work"
10502,"My main issue with this game is the optimization, i'm getting under 50 fps randomly and the game generally microfreezes randomly with literally 0% disk usage (so it's not because it's streaming assets from the SSD), plus even though i'm in the EU and theoretically there are EU servers it still feels like i'm ""skipping"" in the map while moving and sometimes i see enemies teleport while jumping. the graphics are rather nice even at medium but the TAA implementation could be better (ghosts like crazy but it's true that this is true for most TAA implementations). the combat is pretty good all things considered and i like the movement system. probably a good buy when they optimize it and fix the servers (and maybe when it's slightly discounted as well)"

10505,MAKE FACE GO BRRRRRR
10506,"100 PCNT satisfaction guaranted, dont read the negative reviews, they havent played the game enough to comment much about it, for the price of the game, it gives you anti cheat something  BR needs thats when you realise satisfaction. anyhow try it out for yourself i recommend the game fully, textures and models are great

the fights are very skill based you need to practise to get better and learn moves to execute"
10507,"Fighting style itself is fine but some characters need more buff / nerf.

but seriously... Duplicate items in gasha is BS..."
10508,"
"
10509,"Game is Good, Can spend many hours in this and forget about the time. Solos is Great but challenging, and Great with friends. Combat feels great and easy to get used to. Movement wise, sometimes you clip onto random things but maybe I just need to stop jumping around so much.

Only issue is when you earn a loot box, I wish there was no duplicates - I got the same blue skin 5 times when there's lot of other stuff We could be getting.

I'd give this a 8.5/10"
10510,No oce servers. Refunded
10511,"great game, good battle royale"
10512,Great BR with deep customization to abilities and talents for characters/heros all set on a beautiful landscape!
10513,BEST GAME WORTH!!!!!!!!!!11
10514,"First of all this is a review for people on a budget or do not want to spend a lot on games.

This game has some fun but simple gameplay for a combat game. Thinking something like Genshin Impacts combat style. Although it is mixed up with some fun grappling and great movement mechanics but for my time playing the game i could only see the actual sword and archery play very shallow and lacked any proper weight or connection and just felt like a spam fest at points.
The maps are very low res with some nice lighting but some great textures and architecture, but placement feels very old school battle royale, take that to your own liking.

The customisation is actually so impressive and amazing to the point you can make your characters faces uniquely your own with many sliders for eyes, mouth, etc. The clothing items and the custom items also proves to be very interesting and unique. although the means of getting them seem to be quite expensive with a pricey battle pass, deluxe editions and gatcha mechanics, the game tries its best to either suck all of your time or all of your wallet away from you.

This game feels like it should have been free to play. The microtransactions feel horrible after you pay the price of the game and some of the items just aren't worth justifying. 

I would advise to get this game on sale or at a lower price as it has so much potential with it's own niche but is held back by floaty mechanics, hard to run smoothly even on an i7-9700k and RTX2080 at 1440p 144hz (it can reach high frames but the frame time dips and frame skipping happen too much).
It has so much potential and i hope it gets supported properly and maybe one day i will return to it as it is a interesting unique BR that has great art and ideas."

10520,"I normally don't like battle royale games they just seem like such a cop out at this point but this game is really fun and unique in it's take on the battle royale genre a few things i would like them to add is more male heroes, being able to change you're facial hair color / more customization options, a bigger talent tree with more options, a new map for trios and more weapon variety other than that the game is pretty much perfect and highly addictive, if you are thinking about buying it just do it you won't regret it"
10521,20 € worth? YES ofc!
10522,nice
10523,ping SEA too high
10524,very good game i love this unique way of fighting
10525,"Best game, better than DOTA"
10526,Love it when i go fight some dogs my game starts to download bitcoins and lag all over the place 10/10
10527,"A ton of fun to play, nice spin on the genre, finally found an online sword based fps"
10528,"Pretty good game so far. The monetization practices are a bit much, however, I don't feel the need to buy anything as the in-game reward systems seem adequate. Combat mechanics and movement mechanics are refreshing and well done. I thoroughly enjoy the RPG elements of being able change which moves your hero uses and the character customization which underlies it. Optimization is my only true complaint, as I can drop from 120 fps to 60 fps in some fights. I would say it this game is 8/10 so far. If they can't get the game optimization situated over the course of the next month or 2, I might lower my review score."
10529,"The 1st few games will be filled with bots . But its not a bad thing. it will ease you into the game and let you learn the basics of the map and give you a sense of what you get when you win a game. also give you a sense how much you would need to be good to win a game . 

overall it is your regular loot BR game . but it doesnt take much to find decent gear . i won so far 2 games vs mostly people and ranking up  at this rate i will prob hit top 500 soon . its just my 1st day so who knows.  also you have quests that allow you to get more gold so you can upgrade your gear and bag. sometimes quest are simple as go and open a chest. some are more fun like go and kill a real player in game . if you do that you will get ton of gold to be able to upgrade your gear. 

The game is complex . it looks simple but it has depth to it . cant click mash or you get insta killled. learn how to use grapple in and out of the battle its a must . be able to use the trees around you when the fights get like 3-4 people . learn the combos and try to get on a feel when to parry . 

I run the game not on SSD with 3080 and I9 10900 so i max out smooth in this game. probably depends on your pc. 

the game looks nice for 2021 game so that a plus . the skins are amazing but are behind a pay wall. i was lucky to get a legendary skin of my main so i am super happy but the chance for that is under 0.03% . imo get 20$ game and play . 

its feels different than other BR.  The game actually give you extra if you fight more . you rank up faster if you kill instead of hiding to be in top 5 .

all my games are 1vs1 never tried 3vs3 but might try it later once i am high enough rank solo and able to actually carry 1vs3 ."
10530,expensive store for us people in Argentina
10531,"+ Such SLASHY
+ Much MELONS
+ Very SWEATY"
10532,"Grappling hooks and melee combat focused (there are ranged weapons as well) if you like close quarters “in your face” fast paced combat then I would give this game a try. 
One thing that I wish was in the game would be full offline with bots just to casually chill out and play. Other than that, pretty solid (especially as they continue to patch it). 
The game seems to have a solid dedicated community already on Steam which is super good. Can’t wait to see what new features/characters will be added in the future!

-Infinite replay value game-"
10533,"Game is really unpolished, it was just released so it will probably get fixed but at the moment it feels really clunky to play, there are frequent lag spikes."

10535,"Lots of potential, but also lots of work needed to be a finished game. Wait for a big sale or wait for big updates."
10536,nice game

10542,great game and I didn't see much flaws. Just add more skins
10543,"Beside Gacha for cosmetic items, the game is pretty fun and good, the gameplay mechanic is truly epic with variety of weapons and combos 
From close range combat rambo to stealth, a very unique way of play
I’m not really a fan of battle royale game but this one get me hooked"
10544,"Apex Legends, just with swords. I love it, this is just my opinion."
10545,"Fun, needs a bit of tweaking but it's a breath of fresh air for BRs."
10546,nice new type of battle royale
10547,"p
"
10548,"Let me say up front: 
*The game is a Battle Royale that is $20. This is a bit steep considering MOST BRs are F2P.
(PUBG is also not free)
*The microtransaction model of this game is aggressive. 
*You will fight bots in the first few hours of the game
----------

That aside - combat is fun, fights are challenging (when you are not grouped with bots in the earlier hours of the game), and the game is gorgeous. 

Jiggly boobs and all. There is also an extensive character face customization tool for your heroes of choice. You can make them absolutely vile or beautiful as hell.

From what I've played - the game is a solid 7.5/10. It has a way to go to be polished - but the fun is there."
10549,yes
10550,"Nice game. Combat and Game-play are fun and satisfy.
The game has high skill-cap.
For starter you will matched with some people and lot of bots.
Until you reach about silver-III. you will start to matched with only player.
Which You can start to learn the rope (about combat) from there.
First advise be patient, even in fight. 
Second don't use Quick counter button it's not worked when you are attacked.
Always use left click+right click to counter.
Third your F skill are life savior to break from dog fight."

10554,basically everyone plays as 3 broken characters and that's it. No Duo's. Bots.
10555,im pretty sure theyre all bots
10556,This game is not only fun but it's even more fun with friends. You can group up and fight in many different game modes each with their own rules. This game is not only a battle royal for those who might not like that; it's also a team death match and free for all. With all these different game modes and over all great graphics it is a game I would recommend to all!
10557,"This game is so fun.. Its like Black Desert Online only PvP.... This game will be huge, great combat, great characters and unique abilities. This game is a mashup of BDO PvP, For Honor and Fortnite. Highly recommend."
10558,very very good game! NB
10559,the gameplay is amazing
10560,much good
10561,"For once could there be a neutral/mixed review possibility.

There is something here, but this game is very confusing sometimes, for me at least. Combat can be fun sometimes, but the constant stagger lock possibility kinda brakes the fun part of the game for me and it can be very annoying.

The counter ability should be replaced with some kind of a deflect skill ability or something else, because i think it doesn't work well. Or they should increase the counter window time. Maybe i will get better at combat in the future, but that is the feeling i have for it now.

Overall combat needs work and the camera too. Many times in the bloodbath mode, when you are fighting multiple enemies at the same time, the battle can go inside of a house and the next thing you know, you are fighting in the corner of a roof, with zero visibility. Good luck winning that fight. Combat feels OK in most parts, but many times i find myself asking, what killed me, why didn't my attacks go trough, how did the enemy parry/counter/evade that. So yeah, the combat is very confusing.

Weapons are fun, there are a lot of skills there, but i don't know, if there is any downsides when fighting against certain weapons, like katana vs greatsword or dagger vs longsword. I guess it comes down to the fact, that do you prefer speed over strength, but i haven't seen any major differences in the weapons, that is some weapon better than the other.

Ranged is kinda hard in the middle of the battle, with all the jumping and grapple hook using, it makes it difficult, but there is the cannon weapon, that can cause a lot of damage, shoot that in a group of enemies, and watch the fireworks go.

So overall, game is good and bad. I hope it will get better in the future."
10562,"As a MMO player this is a BR for me ... i am loving the combat even if its chaotic and the movement and graphics and everything is just great First BR in a while which i genuinely enjoy playing...

At first i was sceptical about the 20 euro tag but then i gave in bought it and it was definitely worth it can't wait to see what else they will add to the game"
10563,new type of fps
10564,So damn good
10565,I like it.. :)
10566,Changed my review was very hyped. Got to top now very disappointed on how poorly the game designed and how many flaws the game has. So I have played another 13 hours and came to conclusion that the game hasn't got any better since.
10567,"Very solid game mechanically. Fun and fluid combat for the most part as well. My only issue is performance. This game suffers from severe pop in, low frame rate, and poor connection to servers. I like the game enough to keep it but I think I'll wait to play again until these issues are worked on more."
10568,This is a good game.
10569,"This game is amazing! What a breath of fresh air from all the generic loot an shoot BR's.
The Combat although only being 2 buttons is actually pretty amazing, and that grappling hook! Dont even get me started on how amazing the parkour and grappling hook are to! Only been playing Solos so far, and its pretty easy to tell the difference between a bot and a player, but who care! its still a really fun game.
And the character creator is amazing, 10/10 used my own picture and its 100% me (if i was as jacked as Tem) lol"
10570,Great game! New and refreshing game!

10578,WOOOO YEAH
10579,The people leaving negative reviews just need to get good like me also I have a lot of sex and I'm very handsome IRL so...
10580,Love this game but have one question for the devs. Wtf did Kurumi ever do to you ok? WHY DO YOU KEEP NERFING HER STOP IT. That is all
10581,"Most fun I've had playing a game in quite some time, let alone a battle royale. Although, it doesn't necessarily feel like a battle royale either. Fun characters, reasonably balanced. Would recommend."
10582,"Dude...Just fix your internet problems and I'll come back... The game no longer sucks to me I just want to fuggin' play and have fun. But damn come on... Really? I got ethernet and this is literally the best you can do? Not to mention my fuggin' files got corrupted for no reason at all the moment I started the game the next day, I didn't even do anything to cause this it just happened. I let the game close and looked at task manager before it happened and I opened it again it said nothing about it being corrupted...what even is this...

Also your fucking quick play queue takes 10 minutes to even find a game. Probably more as I didn't even find one."
10583,Katanas
10584,"The games is amazing. Gameplay is simplistic and easy to understand.
Characters are awsome and the character developmet is also great.
Weapons look amazing and easy to use.
Costumazation is a little bit complicated but there is little need. If there are inserting more character then you don't need them so much"
10585,"Bought the game, played around in the practice mode and played one match before requesting a refund.

The main things that threw me off was that the first match was apparently against bots, which they do not inform you of. I don't mind fighting bots, but doing so when expecting other players is very underhanded.
The second thing is that the UI is quite terrible. The inventory and gear is very ""samey"" and cluttered. Looting an enemy puts their loot all the way to the left, while your own loot is all the way on the right, making management confusing at best.
The ""jades"" (which boost certain weapon skills or HP/Attack) look very similar and don't seem to have much glance value apart from color, which means you have to stop and read to see what it does.

More subjective (Obviously I cannot say this from the perspective of a good player) is that the combat feels.. Bad? Parrying is not smooth enough to be reactive, and feels like you have to bait with it. Attacks are very ""lock on"".

Grapple is fun as heck though."
10586,"
"
10587,Very unique and fun but i wish this game was free 2 play
10588,sure
10589,This game has bad server connectivity. Sometimes you go 1 or 2 matches without a disconnect then other times you will be disconnecting ever few minutes or unable to connect. I am using EU servers and live in the UK with 400mbs internet connection. Not recommended until they fix these issues
10590,Add me: 怪物
10591,"great game ,  please never make it free to play so the losers dont ruin it"
10592,"The game is far from finished. The developers are letting people play with over 200 ping which makes it almost impossible to play against when it comes to parrying attacks, which is a huge deal (Basically Chinese players invade EU and NA servers and make it unplayable). The game has bots, 33% bots regardless of ranks (except the first two games, which is 100% bots). The developers do not listen to the community, nor do they reassure the players that they are working towards a fix about anything. 

The loot box system is also scuffed, i have bought about 20 loot boxes and i got 1 skin i didn't have from before, and i really don't have that many. Buying boxes for skins is a HUGE waste.

I don't recommend you buying this game, the devs are ignoring the community."

10596,"It's fun but it would be better if you wouldn't get queued into a bot lobby everytime (Even in Ranked!). Gameplay is okay, because you only spam light attack and occasionally dodge into heavy attack and still win. I played 7 Ranked Games


 Wouldn't buy it as it is now"
10597,"Fun game, shitty publisher"
10598,"The game is just fucking great. Sure, it's definitely hard and players are skilled but the game as far as visuals and just overall playability. 10/10, would by for friends."
10599,"yes, very good civ"
10600,GOOD.
10601,great fun game
10602,clunky movement and combat system
10603,"Cannon headshot is awesome xD

9/10 - if online remains"
10604,Have been playing it together with a friend and I have had a blast. Really fun and skill based combat wich is really challenging and something different to the br game. Only thing is that they have to balance a bit but for a game that just came out the balencing is really really good. Have been playing a lot and I hope there will be a lot of good updates in the future :)
10605,good
10606,Weeb Royale
10607,fun combat with great visuals. Rec. with friends but solo can be good too if you like playing alone.
10608,yes gud
10609,"This game drew my interest because of the aesthetic and the promise of a fresh BR experience. Here are some thoughts on why I ended up refunding it;

Decent, if shallow, combat. Ammo/reloads are represented by weapon durability (typically melee weapons have much higher durability than the ranged). It all works pretty well, though I found the parry/focus system really simple with little opportunity for mix-ups. If this had been better I think it would have been enough on it's own for me to keep playing.

In general I think BRs are completely done now - while it's not your typical Battle Royale game, it's still the same old routine (though dying is less 'permanent') where it's more about hunting for increasingly better gear than the 'fun stuff'. Imagine if they'd made this something like For Honor (standard PvP multiplayer), or even some kind of PvE experience instead. If you *do* still want BR, this might be a good option I guess - for me, not so much.

It's a paid game with additional microtransactions (cosmetics); why? it would be great if you could unlock things through play/challenge. Every inch of this game is drenched in monetisation based design. No thanks."
10610,"If you want a battle royale that's different from you normal shooter/fps titles!! This game is the one and it does not disappoint.  Matchmaking doesn't take long, and I haven't experienced any frame drops currently.  If you want a fun game that takes skill.  Forget this review....just buy it...just do it!!  I'm having too much fun!"
10611,"One of the best games ever made and 24 Entertainment actually cares about their community. They fix bugs and make the game more optimized every time! if there is an FPS issue, make sure you install the game on an SSD."
10612,BEST BR I HAVE EVER PLAYED LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10613,"I love the graphics, the movements, mechanics, UI, mostly all of it! It's so addictive. A battle Royale on a different level! Get this game, you won't regret it!"
10614,"Naraka: Bladepoint is a game where you will permanently lose vs. a chinese hacker with 500 ping.
If you ask for help from the developers, they will ban you from the Steam community.
0/10 would never play again"
10615,Nice game
10616,cool game. 8/10
10617,"Very good fun,  graphics are superb and character customisation is reasonably extensive. Outfits are very well designed as are weapons but this early on the options are limited much like Apex legends was when it launched, bloodbath or whatever the deathmatch mode is called gives you constant combat for the duration and gives the player a faster route to getting the hang of combat."
10618,Was great in beta. still is atm.
10619,noice
10620,I was skeptical at first but i ended up really liking this game
10621,best game
10622,"Naraka: 1000ms-point,

EDIT:
After some testing i came to the conclusion that your storage device plays a huge part in this games performance. I have tested this on two seperate windows machines and it turns out that if you don't install this game on your SSD you will get constant latency issues and performance drops to the point where even the lowest grafic setting won't save you.

EDIT 2:
Please for the love of god region lock this game, the amount of chinese smurfs per match is a joke"
10623,"I like Battle Royale games but I'm picky with them. This, for me, is probably my favorite one on the market right now. It's unique, it looks good, and the game play is absolutely addicting. It definitely has a learning curve, so I found the bot matches necessary. Take time to practice and get good with every hero and weapon. Like any fighting game, combat favors those who know their combos and when to execute them better. Get it, enjoy it, but definitely be prepared for a little bit of a challenge."
10624,我淦呐，亚服都是些什么妖魔鬼怪
10625,"I am enjoying the battle, and as you learn and experience the game it becomes more interesting and entertaining."
10626,"This game is absolutely amazing!
Its super fun and brings new things to the Battle Royale genre that has been the same for too long.
This is not to say that the game is perfect, however, my few gripes with it are nitpicking in comparison to everything the game does right.
But lets list the bad things about the game:
-The movement system is not perfect, sometimes your character gets locked walking in a direction that you didn't want for a second, however, I imagine this is a simple bug that will be fixed soon.
-Also regarding movement, sometimes its hard to climb up to where you want to, if the place you want to climb has a roof, the character will often jump to the roof, instead of going where you were trying to go.
-Crouch button has a weird animation, and spam crouching is the best way to heal up while increasing the chance of not being hit, this one isn't really a bug, just something that bothers me a little since it looks weird.
-Some of the cosmetics clip through the character's clothes.
And yeah, thats it, those are all the negative things I could say about the game, they are very minor, but they are there.
Now, on to what I really love about the game:
-Amazing combat system, there are a lot of complexity to it, and there is a lot of combo potential when character abilities come into the mix!
-Amazing air movement with the grappling hook
-The souljade system is really cool, it feels like a revamped version of the runes in LoL, however, you pick these up in a match.
-Lots of character customization, I have never seen a hero-type game that lets you customize the heroes like that!
-The snake that shows up in the sky when the map is closing is one of the coolest things in terms of aesthetics about the game.
-The side activities are really neat and add an extra layer of things to do, as you can hunt for other players to get a bounty off of them, or hunt for treasure.
-The weapons are all very fun to use and unique in their own way.
-Characters have really unique and interesting abilities.
-Skilled players will always be rewarded over lucky players that randomly got superior loot. As having a max rarity weapon will not get you anywhere if your opponent is a better fighter than you, even if they are using a low rarity weapon.

And that about sums it up.
Overall, Naraka is a refreshing take on the battle royale genre. If you liked Sekiro's combat system, you will probably like this game, even if you are not a fan of BRs.
I recommend this game."

10636,good
10637,It's good ig
10638,"I really enjoy this game and echo the voices of everyone else that simply say... this is really fun!  It is skill based, but also has a low entry learning curve.  The controls are all very intuitive.  Just really fun!!

I personally don't think the Deluxe or Ultimate Editions are worth it unless you REALLY want that Matari outfit or want to support the devs.  There are other, better options to buy in game or you can just earn stuff in game as well and get a REALLY great experience for $20."

10664,solid game
10665,GG
10666,"Ok so first and foremost, IGNORE ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND TRY THIS GAME FOR YOURSELF.

Originally, I was not going to buy this game. I was reading negative reviews and was like ""Yeah totally not doing it."" 
Curiosity killed the cat. I ended up buying it just to see why people hated it and I've been playing all night non-stop. The game in short seems simple and easy but there's a LOT of mechanics involved and a LOT of things that can make you a better player.
The graphics are great, the gameplay is very fluid and smooth, there's some hickuppy things here and there but nothing that breaks the deal.
The COMBAT IS FUN. My first few games I had no idea what was going on; but when you really look into your combos and dodging the combat has an insanely high skill ceiling. 
Anyway all in all, the cosmetics are hella expensive; but it's no different then any other game. You don't NEED ANY COSMETICS.
COSMETICS DO NOT AFFECT THE GAME AT ALL STOP CRYING ABOUT COSMETICS COSTING MONEY.

tl;dr Try it for yourself its good"
10667,nice game

Whoever keeps their ult the longest will win the fight

Ping is the deciding factor

Dev team doesn't understand balance

Every ult will be the reason you die

Devs dont ban teamers

Game should be free, and would be free if the game wasn't made from a chinese company

If u win a game in the middle of the ranked ladders aka gold

you will lose all those points if you even die twice off spawn afterwards

10676,good game
10677,"game ok ok la , open cases all blue chibai..."
10678,6/6 game
10679,Good Game with friends
10680,"Balance is dogwater, Engrish abounds, lootbox and rune systems that make your headspin.

All for a lukewarm experience.

The combat wants to be inventive and fun. BR is a burn out game mode at this point, but it's almost tolerable. But balance issues are everywhere (have fun getting CC locked 100-0) and still suffers from the usual BR gripes.

Fun for a change of pace but probably won't relaunch the game."
10681,Fun and doesn't fall into some of the same pitfalls that other battle royales do
10682,so far so good
10683,Tian Hai goes yoink smack win :)
10684,ara ara
10685,Their are no servers for other Asian Regions and stuff but just for chinese people why is this game even global when all the time we are gonna be lagging and they are gonna play in a  smooth server
10686,good
10687,"Like. You play BR game like mmorpg, with awesome moving and graphics :)"
10688,Kurumi
10689,"B2P coinflip ""combat"".
You either kill someone in 3 seconds or grapple around like idiots until you run out of consumables.
Simple soulution would be to fix this stunlock cretinism and add movement speed penalty based on remaining health (you wouldn't be able to jump around much while stumbling on your own guts).
Or just make a proper arena experience like in Apex, this game would benefit far more from it than being a BR parody.

TLDR
Great game, terrible mechanics implementation. Good to try, good to refund ASAP if you don't feel it being 10/10 from start."
10690,"It's pretty technical so pvp can be quite hard but rewarding at the same time. I really dislike battle royal games but this one has a way of making me forget that it is. The micro transactions for cosmetics isn't a big deal, just play the game and get them at a slower rate than paying. I hope they keep the style of the characters, I like the semi realism. I would like to see the dodge system be revamped a little, it feels sluggish."
10691,"I don't play Battle Royales.  I do play Naraka.  The setting, the art, the movement, eye candy all over the place.  The skill ceiling is VAST, I won't reach it, but I will enjoy trying to."
10692,"Great game, although seems like there a lot of bots in the first games, really easy to win a game."
10693,Very nice game so far! A little bit rough around the edges but it's just been released so it's understandable. A great experience.
10694,Great game
10695,"please use my code: chpfdxwh6c 
thx 
i want you so much"
10696,"YEAH..... i changed my mind about last review that i did . Its TOP one BR game
very challenging game. Not easy for people who don't wanna use his brain.
And Combos in this game are insane ( Recommended for people who loves challenging )"
10697,Another BR games :D
10698,"Very fun br game. It is very well done with good combat mechanic. The game eases you into the game with good tutorial and first few matches with bots. This gives you a very good start. The looting mechanism could be better but other than that the game plays great, lot of people playing it. I love the fact that I can customize my own characters as well."
10699,"Game is really fun, seems easy at first, but starts getting a harder over time.  The cosmetics are a bit over priced for what you get. ""Final thoughts"" Keep pc out of reach of children, they will push the power button during rank matches. See you in game..."
10700,"An unique BR, full of action, never a dull moment.

The art style and scenery is stunning, would recommend players to install this game on a SSD but I installed this game on HDD and experienced very very few problems.

The combat is easy to learn, hard to master, you can tell the difference by playing in ranked and casual.

The characters are beautifully designed, none of them are too overpower.(Maybe Yoto Hime or Matari ultimate needs some tweaking)

Lot of monetizations, but not necessary. Most of the cosmetics in game can be earned by playing, and most of the skins are quite well designed.

In conclusion, Naraka: Bladepoint is still a very polished game, it has fast and responsive combat. Anyone who has interests in a fast paced eastern - martial art BR game, they will definitely enjoy playing this."
10701,TOP
10702,"so fukin good ad
"
10703,I love this game. It’s fun and not as punishing as other BR. The grapple is a lot of fun. It’s only 20 bucks so it’s not hard to pull the trigger on something like this.
10704,"I wasn´t into BR anymore so I was skeptical to get into this one, whoever I'm extremely glad I did! The combat is very fun with a high skill cap, it may seem simple at first, there's basically three main attacks, a light one, a heavy one and a parry, the game plays with this concept, paired with sick movement mechanics and you get a game that can be enjoyed both by the casual button smasher (Although it can only take you so far) and the competetive players interested in learning the animation crouch cancellations, parrying every single focused attack and stratigically utilize the character's skills. Secondly, the game has a really cool hero mechanic (think of overwatch as an example) that is also paired with one of the most in depth character creators I've ever seen, my character literally looks just like me and I've seen people create incredible avatars such as Zuko, Wukong and even an uncanny Patrick Stewart. This not only gives the game more variety and a bigger life span since they can keep releasing more heroes with unique abilities, but it doesn't feel like everyone is using the same 6 characters since the character customization is so good you can look very different from everyone else. In regards to the microtransactions, I feel like it's very fair given that putting money into the game will buy you cosemtics, all the characters are free to use right from the start and the start up price of the game seems pretty fair to me aswell. 

Just wanted to put in my two cents if it helps someone out there, at first I thought it was a half assed new BR that just wanted our money and had a very mediocre hack and slash combat, but instead we got a very detailed BR with some incredible fighting style and easy to get into but hard to master mechanics. Definetely a recommend from me."
10705,"im prefere this than other battleroyal game....

edit: hope this game have some trading card & achievment..."
10706,nice
10707,Fantastic
10708,Great game for the price. Good animation and great characters. If you join quick match you get to fight a couple of bots and players to get used to the game mechanics. If you don't want that though join trials. Balanced game. Got anti hacking protection.
10709,Good game
10710,Quá đã
10711,"Tried to refund it after 20 hours bc of loads of cheaters and chinese everywhere ... 

Switched to NA Server and finally can enjoy the game again ...

5/10 game is really fun but somewhat messed up in the background...."
10712,Despite what some are saying the game is actually really fun. The only issue i really have with it is the lack of store content. Not many modes either.
10713,Man.......This game fun af.
10714,Check this game out its a lot of fun!!
10715,"netcode is terrible, if someone with high ping fights you, they have a huge advantage, the majority of players are overseas, the majority are chinese who play on NA servers instead of their servers purely because of the ping advantage, if you swing a sword it often goes through high ping enemies, if you counter it does not register it but it will register high ping enemies hits on you. it is atrociously bad netcode.

i dont recommend until they fix it."
10716,Noice
10717,This game is fantastic. It's everything I wanted Shadow Arena to be. I love that they're actually doing something different in the battle royale genre and combat is great.
10718,"One of the few battle royales that is fun both solo and with friends (definitely more with friends). The movement feels good once you understand the basics, but definitely has an incredibly sharp learning curve.

PS: If you plan to play the game, take a referral code <3
cha4kndckr"
10719,"Definitely a change in the BR genre, The game has unique fighting mechanics, movement is fast paced and enjoyable. High skill ceiling in competitive modes. from a rating of 1 to 10 i would give this game a solid 8."
10720,I've been looking for a game to play in a long time and came across this game and OMG!! This game is AMAZING!!! Cant stop playing! I love it!!! Thank You so much!!! :)
10721,The game would be fun but it's an unoptimized mess. There's so much lag/stuttering. Honestly not worth buying until they fix those issues.
10722,Fun and Interesting. Has a little stuttering problem but that's because I don't use a SSD. Still playable though even without the SSD.
10723,"Im in NA West. There are so many bots, can someone explain?

I would rather get my ass kicked by real players then play bots anyday.

Edit:

After you rank up a bit, more the bots fade out a little more. The game is really fun and im glad to see it doing well on steam. Combat is a+. 

Sekiro+BDO+Any popular fighting game+ Battle royale

Interesting combo but it works.

edit #2:

I cant stop playing... i dont want to boot up any other game."
10724,Literally attack on titan battle royale
10725,"EDIT: Changing my review to negative until the dev's implement a ping lock, the amount of people abusing lag and VPN's is insane, once you hit gold/plat it becomes unbearable

In a fighting game even a bit of lag can be the difference between getting combo'd to death or winning and with the amount of people VPN'ing having your attacks go through people and counters not connecting is insane

This should have been done weeks ago




Pros:

- Great satisfying combat
- Good variety in weapons / characters
- Fun / Intuitive mobility / Parkour
- Wild Character customisation (would like to be able to add tattoos to arms/body though)
- Skill over items (if you are a skilled player you can easily kill someone with much better gear and take it)
- Cost is a deterrent to hackers, not having the game F2P is good for this aspect (however I think the cost is a bit high given the monetisation model)
- Gorgeous scenery and variety of terrain
- Skins are quite well done


Cons:

- Still some instability in servers / optimization (much better than beta)
- Needs better balancing on certain things which is to be expected EX: (yoto hime ult/regular ability are overtuned compared to other characters)
- Cost of skins is pretty steep given the initial price tag of the game 
- Battle pass doesn't fully refund the gold given let alone give you extra (see apex battle pass for example, its a f2p game and gives you more gold than you put in for the pass if you level it fully)
- Initial price of the game is a deterrent to getting more players in, i'd say if they cut the game in half it would be much better (cost of skins and such would still be steep even with cutting the initial pricetag in half)

Overall it's a fun game and i'm enjoying it which is why I spent the time giving it a review because I hope it grows and they add more content"
10726,good  game
10727,good game.
10728,"A boring, lagging mess. Felt like half my time was fighting shitty optimization vs actually playing a walking simulator with two seconds of okay combat."
10729,Actually a great game.
10730,good game and fun to play
10731,refreshing BR
10732,Just try it!
10733,"Great game to play with friends! A lot of fun! The graphics looks beautiful and the characters are interesting to play! For some reason I get a bit of a lag for the first game each time I boot the game, other than that a great experience!"
10734,"If there was a ""Yes & No"" button i'd click that, but for now I have to say no.

The 3v3s are spammy gang banging gone wrong.  9 times out of ten you're not going to have any recourse to counter or do anything to retaliate the constant stunlock and knockback even from basic attacks.  We can all agree the monk's Giant transformation is just ridiculous.  I was grabbed from a ridiculous amount away while invisible and not moving.  Like what?  

The combat its pretty neat, if only blocking were a more reliable thing, unless I'm missing something there (I get the system, and all that but it's just so wonky).  And for the love of god who though being able to grapple to your opponent via AUTO AIM that covers most of your screen...and to have that auto aimed grapple also stun you?  Even if you're in mid-grapple yourself..?  nah...that just isn't it.

Avoid this game, I mean yea, it's fun with some friends but after a while you start to see what it really is all about."
10735,The first handful of matches were bots for sure but it let me get a handle for the game before going against real people. The movement of the game is a lot of fun and traversing the terrain is never boring. I feel the game could use some more work and things added or changed but for the price i think the game is great and a lot of fun to play. Theres more to combat that first meets the eye and it will make you think during fights and you can't just spam(you may get lucky spam kills sometimes) theres actually combos and weapon attacks to learn. All in all a pretty good game I think people will enjoy if you give it a shot.
10736,"After participating in the betas and giving feedback, I highly recommend this game. It is not a pay to win game but there is the option to pay for cosmetics for characters and other in-game items."
10737,"The % chance to get the Extreme rare items is ridiculous low. Spent lots of $ into this shiet, and get nothing. FU$k U 24 Entertainment and NetEase."
10738,Now I havent played much of this game so far but I can say its super fun. The parkour and combat is just amazing. The game is even more fun with friends. I heavily recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a good time feeling like an absolute legend.
10739,"UPDATE ON MY PREVIOUS REVIEW:

Unfortunately this game basically makes you decide whether or not you are willing to spend your 20$ non-refundably as you get bot lobbies up until the two hour mark. Despite this its probably the best BR game ive played so far. Combat, animations, lighting everything is great on that front. It seems the devs plan to implement OCE servers around the end of August, so if you want a head start on em then get it now, its not unplayable like i first believed (although you may die to lag a few times)

A small tip: Think of this game as paper scisors rock rather than For Honor BR, because the combat isnt that in depth from my experience, but the ability to feint, grapple etc. makes up for it in my books.

My largest issue with the game is its rather egregious monetisation, with it being a paid game with BP, skins & lootboxes, but if you are willing to look around this fact then it may just be the game for you.

If you are have the disposable $$ to spend $29 without refunding (as you dont get the real game experience from the bot-padding) then absolutely give this game a try, some of the most fun ive had in a while."
10740,fun.
10741,"After a while in the beta and now after the release, I can recommend this game. But with a bland aftertaste.

The game itself is well done, of course with a few points for improvement here and there, but for the price I have my fun and love the alternative to the Battle Royal shooters.

In my opinion, this has an advantage: In other battle royale games, an ambush is more successful. There 1-2 shots from snipers are directly the downfall. In this game, however, the greater danger arises in hand-to-hand combat. This creates exciting escape attempts. Or positional battles between 3 enemy players.

The loot is simple. The favorite weapons can be found quickly in every game. There are already more weapons and heroes here than in the beta.

[u]Errors[/u]
I haven't had any bugs that affect the gaming experience itself. However, Steam does not seem to correctly notice that it was closed for me, which ""may"" be due to me.

[u]Shop[/u]
The big downside is the store. You pay for the base game and hardly get any loot or progress. In return, however, you will always be offered all the beautiful things, provided that you ""pay"" extra for them. There is even a battle pass, which you have to buy if you want the ""good"" rewards. 

As an example: The game costs me 20 EUR. I want the Battlepass? But I play casual and don't have time for 110 levels! Ah ok for another 25 EUR I will activate everything immediately? Good offer! Ah now I still don't have these 3 cosmetics .. can you unlock them or just buy them? They cost me another 35 EUR together. That would have made me spend 80 EUR without playing the game! So watch out!

At the moment I don't have the feeling that the developer would like me to somehow earn the cosmetics. More like making it as difficult as possible for me, so that I buy them insteat.

[u]Conclusion[/u]
So if you're looking for a fun alternative to the other Battle Royal games, you've come to the right place, as long as you can ignore the store."
10742,"Okay so, I had followed this game since release and participated in multiple of the BETAs, the first of which ran smooth as butter, the second...Not so much. I decided to buy this game in the hopes that it would be fixed and well it wasn't. Poor servers and poor optimization, I easily meet the recommended requirements and struggle to even load into the start of the match at times to pick spawn location then when I get near the end of the match any fight that has more than 6 players drops the frame rate from 60+ to about 15 which in a game like this...means you probably lose. These issues DO NOT occur to everyone however and some people theorize it relates to NVIDIA cards. The combat when working, is super fun and the movement feels smooth.
Now about the micro-transactions that im sure you have heard about. You have loot boxes, paid cosmetics, AND a battle pass. All of which feels a bit gratuitous for a PAID GAME. But there is one thing most people don't point out in reviews and that is the ""Pre-order"" or Deluxe edition loot boxes. Once you start the game you receive your Deluxe Edition goodies right away EXCEPT for the loot boxes which have you wait 2 HOURS to get. You may ask ""Why 2 hours?"" and that's simply so once you pass that time you can no longer refund the game which feels like a very scummy move to pull on people who may not even be able to play the game to its fullest yet wanted to try it for any period of time to try and resolve the FPS dropping issues.

TLDR: Combat is fun when working and the movement is good but poor optimization, servers, and an unnecessary amount of micro-transactions make it so I cannot personally recommend this game."
10743,Amazing combat mechanics. Fresh battle royale game which incorporates melee combat seemlessly. Highly recommend.
10744,"Not euphoric, but pleasurable."

10749,"As a heavy player of Battle Royale games, this one is the best so far.
I've never seen other BR game invested so much on graphics and gameplay like this.
"
10750,"In my book this game deserves an Overwhelmingly Positive. The reason why this game gets bashed, is not because of the game and its content, but its servers. The servers got some issues depending the country you are at. As for me Im living in Asia, and the experience has been phenomenal. Servers will be solved in due time. Mind you all, this company is new and its their first multiplayer game. Have some patience with their servers updates. Its not fair if you want to compare it to Fortnite or Apex's online services. I get it you guys are spoiled lol. Seriously though. Its a bag of fresh air for the Battle Royale genre and a must have for those who loves fighting games and rpg. 10/10 dont miss it!"
10751,Bought game. Game good. See leaderboards full of Chinese players even though NA. Instantly feel good as I pass them at their own game. 10/10 would grind Chinese again.

I would love for more skins for Koto, but I can't have everything :)"
10767,Nice Game
10768,great game great graphic hopefully can get frequent optimization from dev and hopefully theres a ton of new content in game like new heroes skills or weapon
10769,"best multiplayer game of all time, ignore the haters"
10770,shits janky as fuck and like the antithesis of smooth gameplay lmao
10771,This game provides a different look at the battle royal format. The combat and movement is incredibly smooth and fun. It has a decently hard learning curve but once you play for a bit you will get the feel for the game and have countless hours of fun! I would definitely recommend this game to all of my friends.
10772,This is naraka.
10773,"ill start with the good first graphics are amazing and the idea of the game is great! combat is graphically nice also but unfortunately the game play and mechanics is not as fluid as i would like, there is just too many clunky movements and sort of a robotic character movement climbing rooftops encounter glitches with the grapple where it doesn't lock on or it gets you stuck, i'm sure this will all be fixed with patches and updates but as of right now i feel its too early to get in. but its up to you if you can overlook that its a great game then. also the healing animation along with repair animation is way too delayed and unresponsive at time. marking a spot takes a split second to move and changing weapons also has a delay. very frustrating."

10775,Different take in BR scene! Really have been enjoying this game quite a bit!
10776,good
10777,This game is BETTER and much more FORGIVING than FORTNIGHT (I spelled it wrong on purpose)!
10778,Best game ever!
10779,"I don't care for Battle Royale, but this one is really unique and satisfying."
10780,"best Battle Royale game I've played in a long time, highly suggest. ignore the review bombers. If you're in NA, EU or China(for good server connection) you'll love this game."
10781,All your team mates in trios do is loot whore everything even if you looted the cairn or whatever its called. Even in a full 3 stack its pathetic smh
10782,"I've had enough with random teammates but I suck at shooters so Warzone/Fortnite won't be fun for me for a while.
This game feel great for me. There's  solo mode for myself and trio for when my friends are available.

Pros:
- fast paced movement and combat focusing on melee
- Different characters/heroes reminds of MOBA.
- Skill based combat. In last game I beat a few people who had better gears than I did.

Minor gripes:
- Game cost money and it's charging more money for the full battle pass already. It's all cosmetic so it's fine.
- Talent system gives higher level players an edge in stats over newer accounts. (Think League's runes system at the very beginning)
- The movements of each weapon are on the weapon customization page. It's crucial to know the characteristics of each weapon and I only discovered the writings today."
10783,"I never been so addicted at playing battle royale and yet here I am. Very fun game, highly recommended for ARPG like game fanatics out there."
10784,GTX950显卡也优化到了可以玩的程度，勉强给个赞吧（分开服务器毕竟有官方考量，可以理解，就是没有提前说明很恶心）

10787,yes
10788,jank
10789,is fun is pretty and is epic :)
10790,im in love. don't listen to cry baby reviews this game is great!
10791,This is simply the BEST BR game I've ever played.. the movement and combat is so fun! I would recommend to anyone!
10792,Should be free :(
10793,"This game went from 7/10 shrek super slams
To the singlest worst game I have ever played that I can't stop playing because it's way too much
9/10 shrek super slams

Game is now a solid 4/10 Shrek super slams as you can't find a game and every update has sucked."
10794,"There's a learning curve, like all BRs, and it feels fun getting used to it. Combat and movement is a great system to get the hang of, and if you like Onmyoji - well, it's from the people that made that cool gacha game and MOBA (Onymoji Arena). Would recommend"
10795,Needs some balance patches but overall a solid game.  As someone who hates BR I can still dig it.
10796,"Ninja free for all, what is there not to like?!

Definitely skill based combat, watch a video and see if ninja/martial arts BR is right for you.
Not really a battle royale fan myself , but this is definitely for the anime ninja fans out there.
I see myself frequently playing this as long as the devs keep supporting it and fixing things / balance."
10797,"This game is extremely weird. With what the game already has, the combat should have been much more exciting and yet it is not. The hit feedback is rather weak, enemy reaction to hits are bland (kinda literally), hit recovery animations are sort of janky, dodge doesn't feel satisfying, actually dodge doesn't reward at all, grappling hooks are consumable items that you need to pick up, weapons don't seem to be balanced, ranged attacks are so unsatisfying despite the difficulty to hit one...

These little things pile up and ruin the grand scheme of things; it's hard to put it in any other way. The game has something that could have been really exciting, and I'm sure it could be for some who decide to play this game, but right now it feels so underwhelming to me."
10798,"This is the first BR that i actually enjoy and cant get enough of. The customization are dope, the skins are sick and the combat system is simple but yet satisfying. I do however wish there where more available options in obtaining new skin, accessories, and customization in game rather than having to come out of pocket for them."
10799,"Combat seems balanced, def some bots in the early solo ranked games but after the first 2 you'll get matched vs better opponents. Seems like a high skill ceiling so many newcomers will need the bots early IMO."
10800,Awesome game!!!
10801,vn đưa tôi đến đây

10810,A nice change of pace in battle royale games.

10812,"aint so bad. pretty laggy in oce, but otherwise, its the one battle royale im not constantly angry at"
10813,hard Rs in the chat
10814,"One of the funnest BR's i've played and I've played almost alllll of them.

The initial negative reviews were from people that never played it or couldn't beat the bots in the first 2 or 3 matches.

It's a martial arts BR with swords, spears, muskets, bows, crossbows etc.....
There is a high skill cap, you'll just be button mashing at first but once you figure out the combat it's on and poppin.

Try it for yourself!

well worth"
10815,"Good beautiful game, but now I wanna see more intense battles, a bit more story line and quests!!"
10816,Good
10817,"Good combat system, interesting characters, unique climbing/grappel, good cosmetics. All around fun to play."
10818,NO
10819,"good
"
10820,"EDIT 11/10/21:
4/10 Game play is amazing, but ping abuse and dwindling player base in NA is making it hard to recommend. There are some easy fixes: ping lock matches (or fixing netcode), and listening to players. But the dev is just rolling out another battlepass with bandaid fixes. Will update this review if the game improves, but ranked play has became impossible, and quickplay became a chore. There was a great game here, but this dev is just looking to milk the NA audience for a quick buck. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 
First of all. It's a Battle Royale.
You know what to expect.
No story. No grinding boars in the forest. No 24/7 commitment.
Jump straight into the action.
As for all the people complaining about bots. They do that so you don't get your cornhole creamed instantly by simi competent players. People would probably complain more about that. 
By the time you're in Bronze III you'll hardly notice them. 
Also, if you have beef with the MTX there is plenty of free gear and drops. After afew days you will get to play dress up too. But it's pretty satisfying beating the whales and reminding them money can't buy everything.
Devs already got OCE servers up. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, but like I said they would probably complain about the game being too hard. For you soy boys whingeing, I heard Hello Kitty: Island Adventure is going free to play so you can hangout there. 
Enjoying this game a lot more than I thought I would.
8/10 (It's still a BR) 
"
10821,Good shit!
10822,if you like the circus then this is youre game
10823,Monetisation is a drag but everything else is pretty dope
10824,.
10825,Really Enjoy the Combat system! I've had no issues with the game at all. Well worth $20.00 just for gameplay alone
10826,"Feels like Dynasty Warriors running on Apex Legends Source engine, Would Recommend."
10827,9/10 pretty damn good
10828,"I did not expect Fortnite with bots 
The combat system is bland and very disappointing."
10829,seems easier than apex :D
10830,Great game~ A lot of fun!
10831,Boob physics
10832,Big tiddy anime slayer
10833,The game is very fun and definitely enjoyable but it is in need of a bit more work. I have to open and close the game a few times in order to get past the start screen but besides that I've only ran into a few map bugs. The multiplayer is well rounded and no you dont have to spend any money to be better at the game. If you want the customizations then hey drop some cash but over all it is a great game for its current stage.
10834,"inputs just plain dont go off, no matter how frame perfect, latency is probably the reason, they charge you money and by the time your fighting real players you realize the game is DOA, its not to prevent cheaters its to prevent you playing for free and quitting like anyone with a brain"
10835,unless you have an SSD this game is pretty unplayable.... stay away unless you have an SSD.
10836,"This is the one of the best battle royale games what i ever played.

Sooo unique gameplay + talent tree also a lot of variation upgrades, smooth parkour and so many quests to do.
Also unique features

Dont be scared of bots from beginning when you will grow up with your skills like... after 10 +- games they will be remove from your matchmaking first few games is still more like a tutorial.

For me 9/10 game

-1 point for classic loot box system from apex...  I fcking hate that system


Anyway i must recommend it"
10837,only this chinese battleroyale is not bad
10838,"Pretty great game mechanically. I haven't noticed any bugs or particularly bad balance issues. My only complaints are that the cash shop forcing you to buy odd amounts of currency so you can never run out, like 240 gold for $1.85 and 1200 for $9.25 when the battlepass costs 1360, and that the first post launch character being a slutty Japanese wizard with huge tits that doesn't mesh with the rest of the cast because she's a guest character from a phone game make me worry about the future of this game. But assuming the devs don't fuck it up, it's well worth the $20."
10839,chinese people ruin the game
10840,Probably the most satisfying battle royale out right now
10841,I don't think it's a multiplayer game I played 2 rounds and it was only bots unlucky
10842,good game. give it a try.
10843,very fun
10844,"The game combines all the best features of other games into a whole, which gives an incredible gameplay and varies the combat system."
10845," the game is amazing\, uyour friends are dick head and not very good, play minecraft like mike"
10846,"[b] English : [/b]
When I read the negative notes I am very surprised but after checking the authors's playtime, I understand better these bad unjustified notes.

[u] What I liked: [/u]

- The controls feels great
- The graphics are impressive and well optimized, I play in minimum and it is far from being disgusting
- The fights are nervous and strategic (you won't be able to keep mashing the basic attack like you did against bots thanks to the counter/parry system)
- The mobility of the characters is really good without turning the game into a shit show where everyone can't hit anything
- The inventory management is well thought out, you have to be well prepared with jades and consumable items (life, armor/weapon repair)
- The map is huge, with various biomes and possible weather conditions (fog, sunrise etc...) as well as many interactivity and events
- Several game modes available
- A good variety of items/weapons/characters
- A talent system (a bit like the runes in Lol) to customize/optimize your playstyle
- The balancing of the gameplay is well thought out too, for example in many BR the one who drops a legendary weapon becomes more or less unstoppable. In this game a successful parry can completely tips the scales of the fight by disarming your opponent and thus potentially stealing their favorite weapon
- Possibility to buy items from NPCs with the money you find by killing your enemies
- Quests can be found on the map (bounty, treasure hunt, etc...) which will often give you good rewards


[u] What I liked less: [/u]

- The balancing of the characters/weapons still needs to be improved (but we can trust the dev team)
- A ""premium"" shop/battle pass system is already in place, it's too early considering that the game isn't a F2P, we feel that the game will quickly become F2P with this economic model 
- The stealth could also be improved, and correct the ""abuse"" of the grappling hook vision that allows you to see through the foliage of trees from far (at least make sure that the tops of the trees remain covered when you are 20m away and on the ground. Maybe program a detection system in sphere's shade rather than a cylinder I dunno)
- The quest ""Pray"" is really slow and sometimes buggy, it happened to me several times that I couldn't pray in front of the statue because it was slightly elevated, they should increase the detection of the emote in relation to the statue and reduce the cooldown between the 1st and 2nd prayer because it sometimes screws up

TL;DR : So all in all I think it's a very GOOD game, the devs worked really well on it to offer us a good experience which is unique and pleasant and did a good job at it imo
I recommend it a lot if you are a fan or just curious, I hope they will continue to provide us with similar quality  content and not go down the road of ""make money by only working on cosmetic items"".


[b] FR : [/b]
Quand je lis les notes négatives je suis très étonné mais en checkant le temps de jeu des auteurs je comprends mieux ces mauvaises notes non justifiées.

[u] Ce qui m'a plu : [/u]

- Les contrôles sont agréables
- Les graphismes sont impressionnants et bien optimisés, je joue en minimum et c'est loin d'être dégueu
- Les combats sont nerveux et stratégiques (vous ne pourrez pas continuer de masher l'attaque basique comme contre les bots grâce au système de contre/parade)
- La mobilité des personnages est vraiment bonne sans pour autant donner lieu à un vrai cirque où personne ne peux toucher personne
- La gestion de l'inventaire est bien pensée, il faut bien se préparer avec les jades et objets consommables (vie, réparation d'armure/armes)
- La map est grande, avec diverses météos possible (brume, levé du soleil etc...) ainsi que plein d'interactivité et events
- Plusieurs modes de jeux à disposition
- Une bonne variété d'objets/armes/personnages
- Un système de talent (un peu comme les runes dans Lol) pour personnalisé/optimisé son style de jeu
- L'équilibrage du gameplay est bien pensé, par exemple dans plusieurs BR celui qui drop une arme légendaire devient de suite plus ou moins increvable, dans ce jeu une parade réussi switch complètement le momentum du combat en désarmant son adversaire et donc potentiellement lui piquer son arme favorite
- Possibilité d'acheter des objets auprès de PNJ avec l'argent que vous trouvez en tuant vos ennemis ou autre
- Système de quêtes en pleine partie (prime, chasse au trésor, etc...) qui vous donnerons souvent de bonnes récompenses



[u] Ce qui m'a moins plu : [/u]

- L'équilibrage des persos/armes restent à améliorer (mais on peux faire confiance à la dev team)
- Un système de boutique/battle pass ""premium"" déjà mis en place c'est trop tôt, pour un jeu payant ça fait vraiment stonks, on sent que le jeu va vite passer en F2P avec ce modèle économique 
- La furtivité pourrait aussi être améliorée, et corriger ""l'abus"" de la vision du grappin qui permet de voir à travers le feuillage des arbres de loin (au moins faire en sorte que la cime des arbres restent couvertes quand on est à 20m de distance et au sol avec un système de sphère plutôt qu'un cylindre pour la détection je sais pas)
- La quête ""Prier"" est vraiment lente par contre et parfois bugée, ça m'est arrivé plusieurs fois de pas pouvoir prier devant la statue car elle était légèrement surélevée, faudrait augmenter la détection de l'émote par rapport à la statue et réduire le cooldown entre la 1ère et 2ème prière car ça foire parfois


TL;DR : Je trouve que c'est un très BON jeu, les devs ont vraiment bien bossé dessus pour nous proposer une bonne expérience plutôt unique et agréable.
Je recommande beaucoup si vous êtes fans ou curieux, j'espère qu'ils continueront sur cette lancée de nous fournir de la qualité et non pas sur du full focus sur ""go de se faire la masse de thune en taffant sur les items cosmétiques"""

About Bots:
After 5th game , it becomes near impassible to see a bot,

Optimisation ;
Pretty good 

Gameplay and fun factors :
9/10
Parkour mechanics are really fun"
10858,it is a very fun game
10859,its cool
10860,"This is actually going to be my first ever Steam review!

DISCLAIMER: I am a mod for the official Discord so if that makes you think my view is skewed, there is my transparency.

Naraka is the first game in recent memory that I have been excited for, but that doesn't mean I don't have my problems with it.

Pros:
-The combat feels fantastic and has quite a bit more depth than you might expect.
-The character customization and identity is amazing (for the most part)
-Each character feels as though they are viable if played right, which is nice
-Each weapon has their moments of use and there is no real dud weapons anymore
-Games are engaging and the replayability keeps me from feeling burnt out or tilted.

Cons:
-At higher levels of play Tianhai feels very underwhelming compared to the rest of the cast, especially now that Yoto Hime is in the game
-Ranked NEEDS to be region locked, there is no reason that players from other regions should be on leaderboards for another region, it can be very demotivating for players
-The Tidal Crate system, while purely cosmetic, should be reworked a bit as the rates seem quite low

Wrap up:

I have a lot more I could say, but I don't want this to be overly drawn out. Overall my experience with the game has been wonderful since I first started playing back in April. I hope the game does well and stays alive, I feel it offers quite a bit that many people will find a lot of enjoyment out of!

~Astolfo"
10861,"i tried out the Alpha ? and then the Beta and now the game is finally released!. This game is so Pretty and fun with all the action for swords and combat. Movement is nice, combat is good and the abilities for each character seems to be good when it comes to balanced vs each other in a fight.

A good impression of the Creators/developers of this game , they are really good to keep the community up to date whenever it is a change or plan to change / balance stuff. They are responding to the community with good info and hope they keep this going.

All hours from now and when i first tried the game in Alpha stage ( early stage at least) i got amazed by this game. 

I love the sword fighting , the nature and the pretty look of the game . All characters are cool and good mix of abilities and upgrades.

If you like the Asian style of fighting, the styleish look of the characters, the looks and the nature surroundings with packed action Solo or Squad BR game this could be the game for you !.



"
10862,"The big sticking point, a melee BR, is done well enough and that's kinda agreed upon. But personally I can already smell the meta game ""use this weapon and this hero or else it's gg"" and I don't have the patience for it after all the other shooters and BRs. It's already spear spam and there are heroes that have invincibility skills aka the I'm Getting Outplayed emergency button. If this game lasts, I expect the player base to be as sweaty as Mordhau's or For Honor's with a touch of Smash Brothers weeb juggling simulator.

The cash shop is frankly personal preference, it's what you can tolerate. Many other reviews have put it in perspective. But I would say that justifying such aggressive monetization of an already B2P game is a sad commentary on the state of microtransactions in games in general. But yes, this game wants whales and people who like collecting and dressing up waifus.

And then there's the bot issue. I was excited for the Bloodbath mode because that sounds like a fun marriage of BR and DM but those lobbies are mostly bots and we know that there are bots at least in the first few matches of the BR mode. But the extent of the bot to player ratio is too much of a gray area for me. On one hand, it's fine to have something to stab while gearing up but on the other, fighting a bot and a player are wildly different experiences, so much so that you learn absolutely nothing valuable by fighting bots. But racking up 5 bot kills before you get backhanded by another player does compel you to try again. You could argue that giving players a false sense of progress/skill to keep them engaged in the game is a little weird and creepy.

Ultimately it's not as bad as some of the negative reviews say, but I agree with them more than the positive ones. The fanboys who studied the blade were never on the fence about this game and they're absolutely more willing to overlook very valid flaws in this game. But whether or not you are is the question."
10863,It's good.
10864,"Not sure if these reviews are bought but this game is terrible,Doesn't even feel like a game this is more like a chore if you buy and get on this game,i do not recommend this game at all,its filled with bots and i cant even find a single real player,i killed half the lobby because i was the only real person,don't buy it"
10865,I HAVE A GTX 1080 AND RYZEN 7 3700X AND STILL GET FRAMEDROPS SOMETIMES WITH LOWEST SETTINGS ON MY SSD. I GET SO FRUSTRATED WHEN FRAMESDROP MIDFIGHT 1V4 TRYING TO CLUTCH FOR MY DONKEY TEAMMATES LOOTING IN THE CORNER OF THE MAP. THE GAME IS VERY GOOD BUT WHAT THE F*******
10866,game is super dope fighting mechanics are amazing and no game is the same
10867,Best BR on the market
10868,"Game is fun, there is really good fighting mechanics and nice gameplay, but there are some flaws (obviously)

Goods:
Game good


Bads:
people complaining about servers they cant play on


also play the game more than 2 minutes, theres bots for like the first 2 rounds, but honestly i prefer bots
they are easier to kill because i suck at games and i destroyed over 5 keyboards and 29 mice because im so bad at games.

In conclusion, buy it, play more than 2 minutes and find some r34 art of the characters on reddit."
10869,"Although nothing like it, reminds me a lot of gunz and the playstyle of it, smooth movement although janky sometimes when there are multiple connectable surfaces near by  and game not knowing if you want to jump to another platform or jump down."
10870,"This shit hellllllaa fun my boy, no kizzy tho some one these ling lings be going crazy on the game hittin u with some MK combos, but other than that get this shit"
10871,Game is lots of fun learning curve is steep but worth it. Try it for yourself
10872,Best br out there.
10873,"this is a really great game for those who are tired of the classic battle royale games.  Now, i wouldnt recoment this to many people since there is a big learning process and it takes a lot of time to master your weapon of choice and your character as well as in game mechanics.  But over all a great game.  9/10 for me!"
10874,"The monetization is VERY aggressive, especially for a nearly £20 game. Although purely cosmetic, it can be understandably off-putting. 
Your initial matches are also a total slog. Playing with bots that can barely even walk properly, this game doesn't make for great first impressions. 

Stick with it though. You'll eventually get into games with real players, you'll string some brutal combos, and suddenly the game becomes a whole lot of fun and a breath of fresh air in the BR genre."
10875,"So far I have enjoyed it. Nice progression system that lets you unlock alternate abilities. Optimized in line with Nvidia so, Geforce experience will help. Recommend SSD install rather than HDD for less lag. It has controller support, which I think makes it easier but not bad on K&M.

Now people have been complaining about fighting bots in the beginning to ease people in. When you get more into it you will understand it was a necessary evil. The mechanics when perfectly executed by other players will destroy you, which will make you drop it.

You can host a private server for FREE

In-game event is a free for all with unlimited spawns and still counts towards weapon and character upgrades

Cash shop is actually not as predatory and considering its buy to play for $20 and most likely will have sales. I don't see problems with it, the skins in this game are Next Level Beautiful. Everything has a skin basically.

You can actually customize your characters looks, like actual faces for free.

This game has leader boards, a hall of fame, and rank system. So there's a definite push to improve as a player or team

Only downsides is there are some unbalanced weapons and characters, but not rage inducing. Optimization could be better, I have a 3070 and I don't experience any issues after I optimized but I can see for other cards it could be a struggle"
10876,"jiggle physics.
"
10877,"Combat is very bland, no skill involved really. Boring overall. I got my refund."
10878,"It's not a game without flaws, but it is incredibly fun. top 100 player on the leaderboard and I would recommend it to everyone who is tired of all the same BR concepts out there"
10879,"Think of an almost dynasty warriors battle royal with counter systems and abilities within combat.

The atmosphere is amazing, and the game caters to a variety of play-styles including a lot of stealth elements!

There are also a presence of old school league of legend like runes to grind for.\
Not to mention a ranking system and a unique game mode!

What can I say but I love it! 

My first and only review!

Warning: SSD Required to run smoothly"
10880,"Amazing, fun br game. Completely different, yet similar to other br games. Definitely worth the money. Played it during open beta and fell in love. 1000/10 would recommend."
10881,COOL
10882,pretty hard game but once you learn basic combat skill it becomes pretty fun game that brings a sense off accomplishment when you get the win unlike some other battle royales
10883,"NGL, they had me in the first half. Still no region lock/ping lock.  Changed to not recommended.

*original review ----------
Surprisingly fun. Amazing how there is not much desync for a melee combat BR. I've only experienced desync once and it was vs a player from china(Im just assuming because the name). The desync was in the free for all called bloodbath. Bloodbath mode is I believe 16 players in a small zone.  But basically he was running while stationary for a good 5 seconds.
The game shows in realtime people's ping beside their head. That's how you know they are not a bot. 
The devs have stated that we vs bots until 1200 rank score. Trios and solos have different rank scores. NEVER GO IN SOLO FOR RANKED TRIOS MODE. 1v1 1v2 fights are do-able. 1v3 is impossible unless the third is a noob/not there. Trios definitely needs pre-made groups for RANKED matches. Because right now the strat seems to be ""lets all focus one player at a time"" There are ways to defend yourself for a brief time, and thats by using your hero skills. But its a 1-2 second window of invulnerabilty.
--
IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING STUTTER, install the game on an SSD or m.2 nvme.  Update graphics drivers. The latest geforce ad even advertises Naraka. ALSO G-SYNC CAUSED ALL MY STUTTERING - it was turned on by default after updating graphics drivers. Gsync has always caused stutter in every game I play.
I should also mention that the stutter happens in the 'waiting' area before the match. And it happens when people pick their character and 'pop' into existence. I believe the devs can improve this with a few graphics options (like default character models for everyone, or an option to hide accessories). I noticed that in a lobby full of bots (they are jsut the default hero skins) theres almost no stutter. But when players come in with their heavily customized characters, the lobby is easily 20-30 fps. 
--
The devs are aggressively advertising the game with content creators. Pewdiepie is the most recent.
They have been very active in their official discord. The updates go there and not reddit and sometimes twitter. 
A lot of support and fixes are found in the important announcement section of their discord.

BattlePass(BP) is a few cents off of Fortnite's Bp cost which is about $10 CAD for about 2 n half months for this first season. The bp and cashshop are all cosmetics. 
We do not get back enough gold(premium currency) to buy the next BP though(unlike FN). It's about 80Gold short. It costs $1.85CAD for 240gold. They do not offer bonus gold for recharging higher amounts at once. They do offer lootboxes the more gold you recharge though. If you're really curious I would ask a streamer to show you whats in the BP. Of course this is all cosmetics and nobody is really going to see or care what we are wearing when they are busy trying to kill us. Focus on getting good before you try to drip.

We can pickup and use other people's cosmetic weapons if they drop them or die.  There is a ""freemium"" Currency called spectral silk which can be used to purchase cosmetics in the shop. Spectral silks are given from the BP/duplicate gacha cosmetics. There is a lootbox system like overwatch. We can get lootboxes for free by leveling up characters/weapons/BP. We can get more lootboxes by just playing and acquiring in-game money. We can get 4 lootboxes weekly with in-game money. The price of the lootboxes increase with each purchase. The prices reset weekly. 
---
The combat feels like Vindictus, PSO2 NGS. There is a Dark souls lock-on system and the tutorial didn't teach iirc.
The movement system feels really good, like its very weighty and the animations are really nice.
The combat is a rock-paper-scissors system. We can not go in and start slashing against a veteran player. They will counter, they will poke and will dodge and weave. You can weave by pressing crouch and the weave i-frames vertical slashes. Crouching avoids horizontal slashes. This is nearly impossible to do though unless you can read movements within 100ms. While MOVEMENT is weighty, combat attacks are snappy depending on the weapon used. There is a training mode which we do all these tests in. There are both AI enemy and AI partner. You can change the training settings to help practice specific combat situations. 

There are grapple hooks which are fun af. There is an issue for beginners right now where its hard to counter them. 
THEY CAN BE COUNTERED. Depending on the enemies distance that grappled us, we have two choices, either dodge/sidestep and hold our charged attack AFTER the stidestep, or if they are close, try to charge attack and release when they get close enough. This will counter grappling. If they grapple when they are next to us, well we are screwed if we give them that opening in the first place. 

Anyway theres more I could write about. I think the devs are pushing this game hard because they are being pretty aggressive with advertisement and communicating on their discord. I like that. Which prompted me to write this novel."
10884,i installed this game on the wrong SSD i uninstall it to place it on the correct ssd guess what they ask u to either delete ur character data to continue or purchase a DLC again to continue what a f thiefs dont ever play this sh**
10885,Good
10886,Its super fun. Its a melee battle royale game. Combat is like seikro with some moba like heros thrown in
10887,I dodged battle royals like the pest they are. But this game got fun melee combat and something like a arena mode with respawning. I like it.
10888,its good

10906,"This game is full of microtransactions, and they make you pay for the game upfront.  Total scam.  When this game goes free-to-play, then I will give it another shot.

10907,good game
10908,"[b] [i]Don't let all the negative reviews fool you. The majority of negative reviews have nothing to do with the actual game, and for the most part the complaints are not even that valid. [/i][/b]


This is actually an extremely fun and well-polished battle royale PVP experience, with amazing user mobility and complete freedom. It also has some of the best character customisation in gaming (You get a TON of options to edit and customise each hero. Heck, you can even upload your own face!)

So why the negative reviews? There are three main reasons.

[b] 1. People are complaining about the business model (It's B2P AND has micro-transactions)[/b]
Considering most battle royales are free to play, people expect this to be either free to play OR not have much micro-transactions. I understand where these people are coming from, but they are not looking at it logically. FIRST, all micro-transactions are purely cosmetic and does not affect gameplay whatsoever. So this game is NOT pay to win (Also you already have a lot of customisation and ways to unlock cosmetics without paying). SECOND, This game, although being a  battle royale, is UNIQUE from the majority of such games in the genre. How many melee eastern-fantasy battle royales do you know of? (majority of these are shooters) And at that, one that is executed well and super polished... which cannot really always be said of the majority of games in this genre. Logic dictates they can indeed charge a small entry price (only $20...) especially considering there are no other competitors at the moment. THIRD, the cosmetics are actually quite a bit cheaper than many other battle royales. If you're a cosmetic lover, you're actually paying less money in the long run than a lot of other Battle Royales and PVP games (Compare a game that is free + regular cosmetic purchases vs. a game that is $20 + cheaper regular cosmetic purchases. Obviously in the longer run, you're spending less with the second option).

[b] 2. Your first few games will have bots in them, and people have an issue with this.[/b] 
After the first few games, it's all real players...Now the negative review stems from the fact that, after you've finished the first few games and are now playing against real players, you've already past the 2 hour refund time on Steam. This isn't as big of a problem, as some people make it out to be. If it was inherently a bad game, and the developers did this to keep people from refunding a garbage product, then it's COMPLETELY understandable. But in this case, the majority of people will continue enjoying the game after the 2 hours regardless, because the product itself (the gameplay) is very good. With that being said, it definitely wouldn't hurt on the developer's part to change the system here, because it definitely does come across as a bit of scam.

[b] 3. Complaints about no local servers where they live.[/b] 
Many people are trying this game where there are no close servers, and for this kind of game you absolutely need a solid connection. But downvoting a game based solely on that? That really doesn't make any sense. 


[b]TL;DR [/b] 
The majority of the negative reviews have nothing to do with the game and gameplay itself. And upon further examination of the facts, most of these reviews aren't even valid. 
All in all, this is a really fun and well-polished game and it is truly a new and refreshing experience. Even if you don't like Battle Royales (I don't), you would probably enjoy this...especially if you like action PVP games or parkour games or team based CO-OP and survival games. The gameplay itself is smooth and rewarding, and has a high skill cap. Character customization is also phenomenal. 
Highly recommend.



Please upvote this so people can get a clearer picture of the review section. The problem with steam reviews, especially so at a game's release, is there's always tons of false information and assumptions going around and those get up-voted right to the front page. Reviews should not be made 10 seconds after playing a game. And you should not trust reviews that are made right after a game's release, no matter how many 'likes' there are."

10915,"This may start out negative but read to the end. (I have more than 6 hours played, I played several hours on a friends account before buying it myself).

There are a lot of bots. It seems like this game's launch didn't get enough exposure but with the streamer events hopefully it goes well and gets more people interested in playing.

Balance wise the 2h spear and sword are definitely the Meta. Ranged weapons are strong in some cases but it's a lot easier to just close a gab with a grapple and lay into someone with melee so they may need to do some balancing. 

Loot isn't too bad, considering once you level up you can increase your luck and improve the quality of loot you get as you're running around. This game is a BR so it has the pitfalls of every BR of getting loot starved but the skill system providing you with the ability to improve your luck is definitely a step in the right direction.

The graphics of this game are great, I love the way the weapons look and the way the map looks. They're also not too straining on your PC if you set everything to low and it doesn't impact your game play.

The Character customization is f***ing nice. You can customize your characters appearance to truly make them unique to you while still being able to identify as that specific character. only downfall is that no one talks about it so most people don't even know you can customize your character to the extent that you can.

Combat wise they need to do some tweaking there is a lot of weird interactions/small bugs to work out but overall it does feel very satisfying. The action combat and weapon combo systems are good, the grappling system is great though I think they need to add in an internal cool down(diminishing returns) on how often you can get snared/stunned/knocked down by grapples at any given time as you and 2 other teammates can just chain grapples and pin someone down. 

overall I hope this game does well but I'm worried about the health/life of this game due to it's underexposure prior to launch. Give it a shot. Get the basic 20 dollar pack game and try it out. They have a lot of in depth systems for each class. Providing alternate abilities, perks to certain abilities or almost completely changing the way you play a class all together just based on which skills you pick and which glyphs you choose to enhance. 

10/10 would recommend trying it out."
10916,Don't listen to the people who played for 50 min or less. That's all I have to say.
10917," Great game, totally recommend it"

10919,it good. need i say more?
10920,GOOD GAME ! HACK N SLASH !
10921,"fun
"
10922,"This game is an absolute blast to play. It has quickly racked its way up to my favorite BR in recent years. The combat is fluid and the learning curve is pretty high with its parkour system, weapon combo attacks, and animation canceling. 

The art style is also incredible and I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Battle Royal Genre."
10923,"Now that I've played a good bit more, I felt it was a good idea to go back and rewrite my review while leaving my original thoughts still intact. I feel the bots are useless in comp play. If you're not playing against other players but only 20% and the rest 80% are bots its not really that competitive. I feel in order to build good game play habits in the start you have to be facing what you need to doing in the start of the game. The bots build this level of security that you're playing the game correctly when you're actually not playing in a way that would even remotely prepare you to the actual PVP combat, which in its self I personally found WAY more frustrating then actually just having to deal with getting my butt stomped by players in the first place. So then it leaves you at a state where 20% of your match you'll feel like your fighting a player and learning how to actually play and the rest you're just M1 spamming a bot to death. 

TLDR: Game is beautiful and fluid and has a really fun game play loop. But bots in competitive aren't needed and you should just let players experience the game and let them learn like how everyone else learns in a competitive game, by failure not success.



OLD REVIEW :    Not too bad can be a bit frustrating at first when you dont understand what the weapons do, or that the first several matches in ranked you're playing against bots ( Which feels like its trying to lure you into thinking your great at the game ). Otherwise solid fluid and beautiful"
10924,Great game lots of fun runs very smoothly and the graphics are supurb
10925,I'd rather fight the entirety of north korea's best players than fight another chinese hacker or bot.

10934,"Full of bots, cant even play a single match with other human players! this game was insanely fun in beta, but they ruined it.

"
10935,"[strike] It`s a good game, even though there are recycled mechanics from other BR games there`s a lot to learn here, the map, the graphics, the colours and the characters are really good.
It needs some polish and they gotta really work on the netcode and latencies since this game is heavily focused on melee strikes and parrying, you need to have a stable server for that.
There are a lot of microtransactions but everything is completely optional.
The only real downside of this game is that it makes my pc literally boil and it is really heavy to run, but i kinda let it slide because there are ton of details, however it still needs some polish.
However it`s a good game, totally worth the price. [/strike]
 
It really pains me to say this but currently the game is filled with cheating of various extents even in low elo lobbies, it became a complete mess and unless you too use macro, cheat , or modify your net through vpn, it's unplayable and most importantly is not fun."
10936,So many bots and then all these players from china and shit come in to random servers just to kick your ass. there is no ranking system and by the time you finish customizing and learning the game your fucked and cant return it
10937,Don't buy this game. hot garbage. these are bots giving it good reviews. the melee system is boring and not complex at all. Just spam and when you see them turn blue just counter. its that in your face. Movement is clunky and feels like your character is being held down by chains if you're not sprinting.
10938,Pretty solid game from release! Much much better than it was in Beta and Im glad the bugs were fixed and the optimizations makes the game feel super good! I look forward to all the future changes and hope more people find this gem!!
10939,It feels a lot smoother. The options of weapons is great and it comes done to how you use them.

10949,"Great game, however I wish the main focus was outside of Battle Royale. The combat is pretty deep and versatile and it seems like such wasted potential to have the main focus be around chaotic battle royale. The combat seems more suited for team based arena modes such as 2v2s or 3v3s. But maybe in the future they'll add it.

Edit: After some time playing the game and the company taking their sweet time to implement a proper region lock I can no longer recommend this game. Most of the US and EU players have dropped the game because of so many Chinese players region hopping. Playing against players from a far region with their high ping makes hit registration and parry timing very wonky. The devs have claimed they're working on ping locking but it has been months now. I highly doubt it takes this long to implement one. Not to mention the countless claims of players hacking in this game."
10950,Good and fun with badies in it
10951,"I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It's an amazing concept, and honestly has a lot of potential but as it stands right now the netcode is just awful. I have recorded so many instances of me ""counter attacking"" and it never going off it's actually kind of insane. For a game that heavily relies on that as a mechanic to win fights, it's just stupid. Also certain characters are clearly and I mean CLEARLY more overpowered than others. The game can be fun, and when the netcode works you can have some amazing fights, but the majority of the time you face laggy ass opponents who's attacks are impossible to block no matter how perfectly timed you make it. Region lock your game, and fix your netcode, then I can say this game is worth playing, until then I will regret buying this game."

10961,Fun but Monk players are the scum of the earth
10962,"really great and refreshing Battle Royale game with nice fluid fighting similiar to Sekiro or Assassins Creed with a mix of Monster Hunter Rise Style of zipping around.

I Played the Beta for a bit and at first it was rough (in the beta) but now they improved the graphics AND the FPS are fluid, some new elements & content and the game just feels and flows great.

The game is fun, fast paced and allows for some high skill play with its moves and counter moves. 

Definitely a good new entry in the battle royale genre which found itself a niche with its melee focused gameplay which just feels great.

REGARDING MICROTRANSACTIONS:

yes they are there, even with a battle pass... BUT: the game throws the lootboxes (chests) at you at every opportunity. level up a character with gameplay? here is a lootbox! level up a weapon by using it? every few levels: here is a lootbox. Earn some ingame coin....why not buy another lootbox. you could unlock all cosmetics as of right now i believe by simply playing the game. and all lootboxes give you are some more skins and avatars...nothing gamplay altering or enhancing."

10964,"Bad netcode, no ping sorting or region lock, fairly greedy  buisness practices. Some promises were walked back on. If some of the things are fixed i'm willing to change because the game play is fun."
10965,"This is a great game, it will be greater if there are more weapon or fighting styles available."
10966,"As someone who typically doesn't like BR games, I fully enjoy this one.  The verticality/grappling hook gives a unique set of tactics & strategies and the melee is 'fast & furious' while requiring skill (spamming 'attack' is a great way to get parried/disarmed).  The only major drawback i've found is the parry frames for a successful parry occasionally 'seem' to work, but you ultimately fail.  And the attack frames by the time they start it's too late to parry.  They may have to open the parry windows a bit depending on ping/lag.   Other than that, a much better experience than most BR games."
10967,"Below Average Battle Royale, 80% of the players are bots, other 20% are 1000 match winners with max gear and weapons that will wipe your braindead team at the end of the round. Filled with microtransactions and other trash, unacceptable in a paid game."
10968,i love this game the combat is great the graphics are amazing just it just that some of the netcode hiddens the game for people in oce and sa the high ping of around 115ish isnt horrible its just parrys seem undo able
10969,"Interesting game 

But a lot of rush skill such as

1.Grab hook with no cool down
2.Run all time with no stamina cost
3.Slide awhile run
4.2 step jump
5.Unique rush skill of each character
6.long rush from tree or wall 

That make melee weapon distance almost no effective

You should have shooting skill for aim more than melee skill"
10970,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING, I recommend you play it !!!!!"
10971,"This game is really good.. and complex too. If you do not have enough time to get good at it, dont buy it. The gameplay is very engaging, to the point of it being a thrill. Totally recommended"
10972,its good fun frfr
10973,nice
10974,Awesome Game!
10975,"I have pre-ordered this game in June 17th. They promised to offer some starting gold. They never gave it. The customer support just dodges your every question and responds to a completely different question. The game is ok ( not the greatest , gets really boring if you play a lot, tried it in beta), but they went full money mode. Battle pass, skins  and other customization and for sure they won't give free currency. Full money mode. I had really big expectations about this game , but they failed to do so."
10976,"BEST CLICKER(+Battle Royale) GAME SO FAR!

QUICK TIPS:
CLICK TIL YOUR LMB BROKEN

Cheers. Thank you for the game devs🤗"
10977,"Honestly it's not bad, but i'm frankly just curious to know why it's good reviews so i dived into the game and find myself. 

The parkour and combat feels good, i feel grappling hooks shouldn't be a consumable item and more of a passive but cooldown be better added (maybe 2 seconds?), pick up physics were awesome and loved the ability to customize. 

But since i'm more a PvE player, PvP isn't really my style of thing. But this game is great for sure for PvP players. 

If you're curious if there is a SEA server, yup there is."
10978,"Impressive visuals, in-depth facial customization, lots of quick cosmetic unlocks, multiple play styles and character abilities, satisfying combat and team-play."
10979,good game
10980,Best BR game. It takes time to learn but it is very satisfying when you master it.
10981,"Cool game idea however the price isn't really justified, If it goes on sale or you just really really like how the game looks buy it but if not just save your money"
10982,good
10983,"Don't buy Ultimate Edition just for Matari skin.

Game is awesome for hack and slash lovers. I refunded my Ultimate edition copy and bought the base edition instead.

Fun and unique BR with cool movement and close quarters combat. Just ignore the MTX complaints. It's very easy to not buy anything and it doesn't affect you at all.

10989,"a samurai based Battle Royal in a nut shell, it's excellent."
10990,"I was reluctant and waited a few days to see how things would go, despite being interested in a non-mmo melee PvP experience.

The game is a lot of fun - easy to learn (rock, paper scissors combat based on timing) but hard to master.  Fun in trios if you have some friends to play with.  The solo matchmaking experience is standard fair, so I suggest finding some people to group up with or just play solos to avoid the usual frustrations of randoms trying to 3v1 instead of regrouping.

The network code could still use some smoothing and work to prevent occasional desync, but those instances have been fairly rare on NA servers.

It's a fun game and could even be a great game (best of its kind) if the devs continue to improve on the overall technical experience and balance."
10991,"Gross. Psychological exploitation on weak minded and human tendencies. Is this where the gaming industry is headed? Seems so. So much metagame with rewards, quests, currencies, battle passes etc. After first match i literally was clicking 5 minutes through various menus, rewards, levels, stats, unlocks and other crap. I bet the devs will make you regret every day you won't login. And also make sure, that all the good stuff is pay only.
Ok, what about the game itself? It's alright, if you played any other modern battle royale you will see how uninspired it is. Combat i see some potential in, especially in teamfighting tactics, solo will always be just worse version of a good dedicated fighting game i feel. It's got great visuals and sound, character designs are a bit over the top, with skins being over the mountain in a non-lore friendly way.
I would love it if i were a teenager with nothing but free time and aspirations to be the best at a videogame, that's the target audience."
10992,Really enjoying this game. Feels fresh and different compared to other BR's. First few games against bots is a great way to start out with. The difficulty ramps up quick once you play against other players.

11009,"People who complain about the skins being paid are extreme losers that need to get a life ASAP. Yeah, they are paid, but first of all, you get them pretty easilly through the lootboxes (yeah, yeah, I know stfu) that they give you (and they give a surprising amount), and second of all, they are skins, they are skins you loser they aren't mandatory; it's your monkey brain that thinks it is.

The gameplay and combat is fun and easy to pick up but hard to master; ending up being at least for me, the main reason why I even bought the game. It also isn't pay to win, which is appreaciated.

There are some things that I dislike, liek the fact that they ease you in the game with matchs filled with bots. They won't disappear from the game unfortunatelly, but you'll find a lot more human enemies. The servers seem to be global (?), since I seem to find a ton of chinese players that already know wtf they're doing, but idk...

And lastly, the boob physics are top notch"
11010,"I've spent a whole day on this game and I absolutely love it. I reside in Sydney, AUS and the latency doesn't stop me from winning a few matches. I would prefer OCE servers though. Definitely play the game for more than a few minutes. :)"
11011,its good
11012,Pretty nice game if you are enjoying battle royale game or a martial art fans
11013,"While it's fun in premise and feels really good when its working properly and has a good amount a depth for just 3 types of attacks, the combat is too janky, with combo chains randomly dropping, usually if your enemy is knocked into something, or attacks straight up phasing through players, especially with the ping issues other players have reported. 

The game seems poorly optimised to me as well, as my specs far surpass the recommended, yet the game lags so badly that it is unplayable (5 fps if im lucky) for the first minute of any match, with frequent freezing which becomes infuriating during fights.

The monetisation model is also awful, with a paid seasonal battlepass, a premium currency and lootboxes. While no gameplay is locked behind a paywall, if you ever want to look like anything but a recolour of the basic character either spend several times the games price or grind for hundreds of hours. For a game you have to pay to play, these systems are very out of place.

Overall, i cannot recommend the game in its current state."
11014,people playing this game are pro af
11015,"No OCE servers. horrible ping. 
game would have been huge in OCE is there were servers. S a d"
11016,"Game itself is fine. Its fresh air to battle royale with addictive enough gameplay. Monetisation could be better, its not p2w in any way but its heavy p2lookCool. Not even the first battlepass is included in original price. F2P would be fitting better with all those direct buys, lootboxes and paid battlepass. Also much better for number of active players. But game has quite big potential.
PS: Its extremly hard. I play every BR solo only and after bot phase is over I have feeling that every encounter even in bronze 1 is like world championship :D"
11017,ok
11018,"Even thought its a BR, its actually pretty fun and refreshing."
11019,"Highly recommend. Fun, competitive game. Also tons of customization options for your characters. 

If you're worried about it being a battle-royal type game, I've never played any, never liked them. But this one is great. The skill with weapons means you don't have to worry about finding those perfect items. Do you like Dark Souls (PvP) or Sekiro parrying and combat? Then this games for you! The combat feels so smooth and satisfying.

Also plenty of free in-game cosmetics that look great. There are so many places people just don't know where to look: Character level, weapon level, season exp levels, weekly and dailies. These all give random rewards including armor and weapon skins. Of course you can spend real money to buy more skins, have any of these haters even played video games in the past ten years?"

11026,"The game is good, I already liked its style before CBT and it had a differential: 1 South American server and that WAS GREAT for the Brazilians. But at launch, we Brazilians were faced with the REMOVAL of this same server and this became something extremely disappointing. Besides being a heavy game, we have to face a high ping and this makes our experience frustrating.
The truth is that they saw that having a SA server somehow could be a problem for them and they removed the server, giving the excuse that we would have ""nodes"" to help the connection. Nodes are NOT THE SAME THING as an SA server. Don't try to fool us with this nonsense. With this decision, unfortunately, I don't recommend the game to Brazilians at least. Not until they meet our requests and actually make a DECENT SA SERVER. They shot themselves in the foot with this attitude and will have refunds for MANY people."

it looks good, and runs very well, thanks to DLSS and Reflex features.
even allows you to customize some characters entirely (face structure and hair and all), which was a 
welcome surprise for sure.

a battle royale that actually puts focus on skill instead of sheer luck, and even offers game modes
that aren't battle royale, but more like deathmatch, which is always welcome.

i recommend this fully."
11034,"Spent about 20 minutes in the game, from Australia, my ping hits about 14000ms as soon as there's an enemy near me. Unplayable is an understatement. If you're from Australia, you're better waiting until they have an OCE server."
11035,Good
11036,"What a nice and refreshing game in the battle royale genre!
Beautiful graphics and atmosphere. The devs really put a lot of work into this game which is unlike any other BR out there with the amount of depth in skill and character customization. This really adds another layer of depth to the already often-used BR genre."
11037,"This is an early first impression, but given that it's the only Battle Royale I've ever enjoyed, I'm compelled to write it. Melee focus with impactful blows, fluid movement, and a combat system as a whole that's skillful and rewards intelligent play. There is room for mastery, yet it's welcoming to beginners. Importantly, losing generally feels fair, and winning a fight is exciting. The pace of gear acquisition is reasonable, and with the exception of armor, lacking any one item isn't a consignment to death.

Unless you're too frustrated by cosmetics locked behind RNG loot boxes and battle passes, it's an experience worth the price of entry. My one caveat is that matchmaking has involved a presence from veteran Chinese players who've had access to Naraka since 2020, so expect to be dumped on every so often. It isn't too common, but worth mentioning.

Side notes: Gorgeous visuals, consistent 60+ FPS on high settings with a 1070/9700k combo at 1080p. Surprisingly great voice lines and localization. Overall polish and presentation far exceeded my expectations."
11038,"Honestly, love the game !  Combat is hectic and a ton of fun. The mobility is insane and there's a lot of different playstyles depending on the hero/weapon you're using. There's already ranked in the game too which is really nice to see.

I'm all about that game honestly, you guys should try it out !"

11042,Amazing graphics TBH! Tons of options for weapons and clothes. At first you might feel Naraka is a combination of PUBG + Sekiro + Nioh 2 but it's better! it runs smoothly on my Razer Blade Early 2021 15 inch 3080 model with DLSS turned on and 50ms ping speed. I still don't understand how DX11 support DLSS tho. I hope the DX12 patch will support Ray Tracing in the near future!
11043,"I enjoy this a lot! definitely my type of MOBA.  Just one downside so far is South African players are going to struggle with bad latency, in some of the fights I get warnings check your internet connection then die."
11044,GOOD BUT FPS IS NOT STABLE
11045,"This game is crazy, love it"
11046,Fun game. Would be better if it was region locked. NA and EU is plagued by ping abuse from players in CN.

For those complaining about bots. You literally match them your first 3 games. If you are still playing bots after your first 3 games its because you are one.

11065,"Update: EDIT:

Current State of NARAKA in the West is not good. Not that it can't be fixed. There's a lot communication, marketing, and also disconnect from the CN Version. 

The Global tournament worlds in January whcih will be held in either China, Korea, or Japan is a 1.5 million prize pool. 

But if the game doesn't fix its jarring issues of hit detection, Long Sword Balance, Tarka Ji ultimate rework, Grapple stagger/stun lock in trios, I fear a early and more rapid player drop in the West. 

In CN and SEA, the game is thriving, but the community management for SEA, NA, EU is very weak. 

This is due to Netease either hiring third party esports production with no idea what the hell they are doing (EGL, Mineski Esports) or not hiring anyone in the west for Netease Montreal for a solid global team. Doing my best on my end to make LAN events happen and make change.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Saw Yoto Hime's booba and midriff, preorderd instantly.

But seriously, I've played all the betas, closed and open, and also played the CN Client early launch. The devs/publishers have felt like better Mihoyo in terms of communications, surveys and compensation for any issues. They got Pewdiepie, Shroud, Lirik, Sumit1G and a pile of H1Z1/Apex/Overwatch pros to play this game. This game will explode.

300k USD Tournament circuit in China. 100k USD coming up for global. This is your time to get good.

If you have played fighting games, competitively, this game will be easy to pick up. There's a lot of labbing, a lot of tech, and a very active NA, EU, SEA community. Get ready to get bodied, the skill gap is high. If you want to learn, the official discord is full of people happy to help you. So lets get this bread."
11066,"Enjoying the everliving hell out of this game, its fun, rewarding combat, aggressive play. its everything Ninja Gaiden should have been. theres a few combat mechs that i dont like, how if someone blocks you with a certain move it can knock your weapon out of your inventory and on the ground for someone to grab. Other then that. AMAZINGLY FUN BR"
11067,"First, the issues with the game: You will indeed fight against bots. But the more you play, the less bots you run up against. Also, you can't change the color of your character's beard. Which is VERY bizarre because you can change the color of almost everything else, including hair. The practice mode, although a nice addition, is also lacking. The practice mode really needs a way to have all cooldowns disabled so you can more freely test out the character's mechanics. Finally there is the movement, most of the time it's fine, but your character will regularly magnetize themselves to various ledges over and over again, it can get pretty annoying at times.

Now the good: A nice rock-paper-scissors style combat with emphasis on reading your opponent. The movement is fun and fluid when not being magnetized. The overall customization from appearance to playstyle is quite robust. Then there is the on-the-fly customization during a match; picking out a weapon, what soulgems to keep, etc.

Overall, the negatives that I have listed don't outweigh the positives. This game is an absolute blast to play. And it's not another FPS battle royal game!

EDIT: The beard issue has been solved with a recent update."

11087,"Not fun. You're either fighting bots, or sweats who aspire to go pro."
11088,"I won't recommend this for casual players, its extremely sweaty. Also if youre from SEA like me expect small lag even though you have 40-60ms ping(you know how it goes in asian/sea server). If it had smoother gameplay with less lag hits and optimized graphics, it would be a really interesting e-sport game, just not the 3v3s. in 3v3s its more of which team can burst 1 guy with stunlocks first, the skills are okay for 3v3 but if you put it in a solo br, expect to lose to a monk's ult in the final 1v1 in solo BR where the circle is small enough where the grab attck would reach you anywhere and not to mention lag hits(you know that split second when you're behind cover but you magically get hit for some reason). Skill based, sure but sometimes skill gets destroyed by lag.

The skills mechanics are really good and has potential but with lag sometimes the ""hyper armor""(yellow and blue attacks) doesn't pull through or when the parry timing is absurd to the point you can't reaction parry, you have to predict, which is hard sometimes depending the situation, for now parrying is easy since most people do the 3rd combo(which is parryable) but imagine when everybody knows how to play, goodluck guessing.

also here are some tips
combat: ""m1/m2 m1/m2 crouch m1/m2 m1/m2 crouch m1/m2 m1/m2 crouch . . ."" youre welcome. 
traversal: ""slide immediate hop slide immediate hop slide immediate hop . . ."" spam it just dont proc the quick fall animation, use audio ques from slide to do it easily.

Oh yeah feel free to give me some tips, I want to git gud."

If the fact that cosmetics are the money maker then I guess you shouldn't play it if that is your main cause of complaints.  You will fight bots initially but soon shortly after you will play against players.

11108,"Okay here we go: I have been waiting for this game to come out since it got announced. I love combat games like this and for honor, mordhou, etc. But this one is different. It has a beautiful world, great cosmetics, the movement is very swift and smooth, the combat is so refreshing and satisfying, and the characters along with their talents and cultivation are very fun and interesting. The games 2 different game modes are awesome and they make playing alone or with friends very fun, wether it be a battle royale or a free for all. Looting during BR matches isn't a hassle like most BRs, and its very simple and easy to do, even during intense moments. The replay-ability of the game is very high, considering you have many characters that you must grind out games with before you can begin to truly scratch the surface of their untapped potential. The same can be said for different weapons, it takes time to learn which weapon really suits you, based on their combos and damage and movement and what not, but the process is so fun. The controls are also very nice and may take very little switching around but they make the game feel fluid. The first matches until you hit level 5 (I could be wrong about the level but it's around there) are filled with bots for the most part, sprinkled with some real players, but you will definitely thank the game later for it, because once you hit the level at which you begin to play all real players it gets much more challenging but also much more rewarding! I can definitely see this game becoming a very big game. Naraka has a great team behind it and it needs all the support it can get! Join the discord and don't give up on the game when it gets hard, there is nothing else like this out there so let's make sure it stays here and have a great time!!!"
11109,"Dont let this game die, i buyed both, hunters arena and naraka, and naraka is a lot better, better camera, better playability, same graphic levels of hunter but i think is better cause is not so dark and with a lot of volumetrics effects, the cons is my first experience was full of bots, maybe if i get high level."
11110,"The visuals are stunning and beautiful, but the movement (especially with the grappling hook) needs some more work. I have a hard time understanding what objects in the way of the crosshair will affect or block my path to where I targeted. In thirdperson, there needs to be a dynamic distance-based crosshair or something to help.

The swordplay seems great but gimmicky, and very long motions that are difficult to control and seemingly easily punished by enemies.

I'd gladly buy the game in a while after it's smoothed out, but I feel my money is better suited elsewhere for now."
11111,"To be honest, this game is definitely worth playing. The fighting action is so cool. It's not fair that many people give a poor rating only because the servers in different regions/areas are independent."

11120,"I had the opportunity to play in the Beta, and on release date. It has already consumed much of my free time. Great combat style, super addicting, and very competitive. As long as you are willing to take a bit of time to understand the different weapons, combos, and abilities, you will really enjoy this game. Very similar to other fighting games like SSB, Street Fighter, and Mortal Kombat. Early on it will seem as though people are spamming but as soon as you understand more about the fighting styles and ""rock, paper, scissors"" style of this game it becomes such an interesting and mind bending game. 10/10 would recommend"
11121,"Got to play the beta! Now the game is out! Its amazing, the best Battle Royale i've ever played!"
11122,"yes
"
11123,"The artwork and design is honestly really good, it's a beautiful game. Butttttt there is an issue when it comes to gameplay, stun locking. If a team of trios come at you with katanas than you're pretty much screwed, you will be stun locked into oblivion. Another issue is the bots they use in game when you're just starting. Your whole lobby all the way up to account level 10 is nothing but bots mainly, and you cannot tell if they are bots or not unless you watch them run into things as well as always try to heal up in the middle of a fight. Just doesn't make it fun, I understand they want to introduce you into the game slowly than start adding other real players but it honestly was a deal breaker for me. It made it so boring and stall, when you finally get past the botting phase than you will most likely get decimated as players are nothing like bots in this game so you really don't know how to go up against someone who has a brain as well as knows how to stun lock you constantly. Also a small issue of ping difference, I play on US and I get people from the UK and China where I know I hit them but it doesn't register or they skip around on my screen making it pretty hard to try an grapple or track them.

Game Rating: 5/10

11125,"The game is VERY Fun, one of the best BR's out there.

They just need to fix hit reg.

I will assume this will be fixed in time, I like this game and want it to succeed so i'll give it a thumbs up for now"
11126,"To be completely honest, I played like 3 games and everyone felt like a bot."
11127,"This game has very fluid combat and movement, very fun. The only flaw is that there are occasional lag spikes that make combat difficult from time to time but, other than it being frustrating every now and then, it's still worth playing if you like action games with solid in depth combat."
11128,we need dou plsssssssss
11129,"I know its a controversial topic whether it good or bad,  but i believe it can be a good chance to proof China can publish a game which match up with different Asia culture."
11130,"A pretty well done BR. That focuses more on melee combat, than chucking plasma and projectile domination. On the surface it seems simple, but there is a deeper learning curve between the characters, environment, and weapons. 

Lots of matchup knowledge to be had. It'll take awhile to get used to the animation cancels, the baits, and what each weapon's weakness is. Character customization is the best I've seen in a BR game so far. You'll need decent upload speeds for a near lagless game. Since my upload speed is high, I have not experienced in-game lag since the betas, others have different experiences on that.

It has some pretty interesting lore, that can be built on future PVE/Story related content (Devs previously said if the game does well, they'll look into modes that tie in story more).

One thing I must say, I feel the Battle Pass is a little on the expensive side, since the game is B2P. And, it would of been nice if the Ultimate Edition included the first BP as well.

Overall, I've been enjoying my time learning the mechanics, the timings, environmental awareness, and the random B.S that happens during a match do to some bugs and a few wonky things here and there. I definitely recommend the game."
11131,"Pay no mind to the micro-transaction outcry... besides the one hero that's a DLC (so it isn't even a micro-transaction), all of the micro-transactions are cosmetic and have NO impact on actual combat or game play... if you want to you can get em, if not you don't need to worry about em... now, if it changes in the future and does become p2w, then I'd understand the frustration and I'd definitely change my opinion on the matter. But currently they're harmless. With that out of the way, I'm only a few hours in, but it's an exceedingly fun game so far. Slick and enjoyable combat, movement is fun, excellent character customization even without any outfits, no issues with ping (granted I'm on NA), and overall a very exciting experience. You do face bots in your first few matches so it can lull you into a false sense of superiority.. but it is nice when you're first learning the movement and controls. With that in mind, I sincerely look forward to all the future content! I definitely recommend at least giving it a try! However this WILL change if it ever does become p2w-ish."
11132,"Rlly fun game, it's refreshing to have a melee oriented battle royale for a change. This game has some awesome mechanics, the level of mobility is pretty insane, and you're able to change up the talents for individual heroes for different play styles."
11133,"The servers are TRASH, I have 23ms for the entire game but it randomly spike between 400-4000ms for no reason, Can't walk, can't run, can't loot, can't play. This game is terrible"
11134,Amazing aesthetics.
11135,"At its core this is an amazing game. The combat is challenging, but incredibly fun and satisfying once you get the hang of it. However, it really feels like the devs are on a mission to make this game as unpleasant for its Western playerbase as humanely possible. Chinese players plague every server using a VPN and spamming nothing but focus attacks (for those who don't know they are attacks which can be parried) because they know you will not be able to time the parry correctly because of their lag. This is where basically all the great mechanics contained in the game basically go out the window completely. There are of course people presenting the argument that locking out CN players from those servers would basically result in a dead game outside of China, but this problem could easily be rectified by making the game free-to-play (which considering the business practices within the game itself, would make sense).

It's a shame really. It's a nice, fresh take on BR games which I would love to invest many more hours into, but truly, what is the point if everything that I might learn will be pretty much redundant as soon as I go up against a lagging Chinese player?"
11136,excellent game
11137,should be free
11138,"This the unique games battleroyal mode i ever play, the grapichs so beautifull too. the mechanic simple to learn. keep upgrade this game to the best version (to developer) :)"

11140,"HERES A REVIEW THAT DOESN'T CRY ABOUT THE MTX SHOPS

Seriously, just don't buy the cosmetics. I don't get the issue. 

Game is fine, just learn the game instead of crying that you died to things you don't understand. 

Tips:
Light attacks will block/parry other Light attacks. 
Focus/Charged attacks (blue) will give you flinch resist against light attacks and can break someone else Focus/Charge.
Counter (red) allows you to block any Focus/Charged attack (blue) which allows for a followup, disarming the opponent.
Counter (red) can be interrupted by Light attacks.
You can feint your Focus/Charged by hitting C (also Crouch when held). 
While Crouched you can do a low attack. 

If you're met with light attack (left click) spams there are 2 ways to combat this. Try to spam dodge out of it, left click attacks are typically horizontal while right clicks are vertical. Side step vertical slashes, back step horizontal. 

Or (best way) is to understand when their Focus attack comes out. Every 3rd attack is a focus attack so remember the animation of the 2nd attack for a weapon, then parry in the window between the 2nd and 3rd attack, allowing you to parry the third Focus.

If you're playing against someone that's timing your 3 hit light combo you can hit C (crouch) to cancel your combo. So for example you'll do your 1st and 2nd hit then hit C breaking the combo making the next attack the 1st attack of the combo. 

You'll also do a slight lunge/slide attack when coming out of a sprint. The main use for this is sliding Focus attacks. One very nice technique is dodging (space bar) out of the way, immediately going into a sprint, then holding left or right click for your Focus attack. You'll then charge your Focus attack while sliding in the direction you were using it. 


I'm sure I'm missing more but there are quite a lot of ways to combat different situations and how you go about each fight will change based on your weapon. Tactics will change based on the weapon you and they have so keep these in mind."
11141,"this game is incredibly broken and unbalanced. half the weapons will just lock you in place when you get hit so it just turns into a game of who can hit first. 
half the characters abilities don't work the way their meant to work.
the ranged weapons all feel like crap.  

needs a LOT of balancing.
the first beta was the best version of the game."
11142,goooooooooooooood

11146,"Game is alright, pretty fun and looks nice, but the fact it forces you to grind bots right up until the point you can't refund it is kinda schemey. Don't think it has staying power and they know it."
11147,Get past the bots in like the first 3 games and this game is top tier.
11148,VERY GOOD GIMME MORE WEAPON PLS
11149,"10/10 get the game. $20 is a deal. 

The combat is really fun and unique.

I can't stop playing and I usually don't play games in this genre. 

The only way you need to spend more money is if you want to purchase purely cosmetic items, otherwise it is just as fair in terms of price as others games. 

The developers need to get paid in order to maintain servers, etc. and this game is worth the money."
11150,"-The gameplay is stale. I can see how people might like it, but it's not particularly deep or interesting, mostly spammy. 

-The monetization scheme is by far the worst I have ever seen in a paid game. They pulled out all the stop here: Battlepass, Microtransactions, Lootbox system with DISGUSTING drop rates. The Pre-order was supposed to include 10 of these lootboxes, but these were nowhere to be found for myself.

-It runs poorly even on a higher end PC, from what I have read this is a common issue.

-The multiplayer matches are riddled with bots. I want to say 90% of the ""people"" I fought were seemingly bots. 

-The tutorial and starting matches are designed (in my opinion) to keep you playing past that 2 hour refund mark. This was compounded by the fact that the game (for me at least) was running in the background even after I quit the game and I had to force stop it via task manager. Not a good look. 



NOT a recommend. There are way better games out there to play than one that calls itself a buy-to-play title but has the structure of a free to play mobile game."
11151,"Game is good.
No SA and OCE servers in an official global launch.
"
11152,Fantastic
11153,"Okay, so i'm here changing my review. I love the game, I think the game is insanely fun but to each their own. the game has a concept that this company can push into new heights if done correctly. As the game is right now, it has a lot of glaring issues to some characters being just insanely more powerful than others like a blade that spins and can block pretty much while protecting you from pretty much anything if you stay inside its area to having a 5 second stun and an 8 second silence. A bigger issue the game has is taking favors to players that have higher ping because they are playing on a server that isn't native to them. An example to this is dodging an ability or an attack that you clearly dodge just for the game to rubber band you back because they hit you on their screen but you dodged on yours. the game takes favor in these players which, in my opinion, is just not right. yes the game has its issues but I still love the game and really enjoy playing it. Though I hope they get around to fixing these issues or the game will die just as quickly as it rose in popularity, though only time will tell. If you are unsure about picking it up then wait and see where the game goes."
11154,"Gameplay and Visuals are good, but the game is sadly filled with microtransactions of all kinds, despite the 19,99-49,99 pricetag.

Premium Currency, Premium Skins, Loot Boxes and even a Season Pass.
 I suggest waiting for a big price-drop or the inevitable F2P switch."
11155,"A Battle Royale with a surprising amount of depth in Movement, Combat and Player Customisation. Its not perfect but its a nice breath of fresh air to have a BR that isnt a FPS. Cool theme Cool Gameplay."

11162,"Are you kidding me? absolutely unethical behavior to the point that I don't usually write reviews except for this one, just to say how undignified I feel. South American Servers available on the betas of the game but not in the official release, this is disgusting. This was not preventively informed, worst aspect of the gaming industry right here.
"
11163,"This game is fun. it's a fresh take and really doesn't feel like a BR game. it feels like an action RPG i'm having a lot of fun. 


having said that i don't like the ""loot boxes"" and I don't like the battlepass or whatever they call it. $20 entry fee and they slap you with every single chance to spend more real money. It has a F2P monitization system. 

it's a really fun game but keep a good hold on your wallet.

The free training area is really nice to spawn in and check everything out, and in any way I want.

11177,"GoGRRR — Today at 8:33 PM
This game is a lot of fun! It’s your typical battle Royal in terms of getting put on the map savaging for items. However, is stands apart with one of the cleanest freedom of movement systems I have ever seen in a BR. Traversing the map just feels very fluid. The combat system is nothing to laugh at. With a large verity of very different weapons from long range to close up sharpshooting guns to large great swords to the smallest daggers this game has a weapon to suit you. As far as characters you can choice from seven very distinct characters, with an ability that as you level the character up, you’ll be able to pick from one of three special abilities, and an ultimate that again you will in time have 3 different ones to choose from. Though some of the abilities and ultimate don’t differ as much the small change helps with playing different types of weapons or playstyles. In Naraka you're not locked into their character aesthetics (though they are very appealing). You can fully customize your characters facial features and skin tones with the outfits and weapon skins being in your typical BR loot crates. You can also buy some of them with other currency you get in game but mainly I have gotten it from playing matches and finishing challenges. Sitting at a 20$ buy in this game is strongly recommended."
11178,"The game is amazing and so fun to play!..... unless you are from Oceania or South America

After so much backlash, the developers said they were working on OCE/SA servers. they have now come out saying they will not be making any OCE/SA servers, leaving the game unplayable due to ping. They also baited people from SA, as the server was there in the beta and since removed :("

I don't understand why its not free to play with the massive large amount of ingame pay content like cosmetics, loot crates, battle passes and more. They have no issues paying big streamers thousands of dollars to do sponsors streams for 1 day though.

The company needs to care for their player base. The idea of making the game paid scared a lot of the people that really enjoyed the game in the betas.

The final nail in the coffin for me was launching the game globally without SA and Oceania servers. For what reason? I think they didn't reached their sales goals to justify a dedicated server.

Their solution is to setup a proxy with NA because its way cheaper than having dedicated servers.

Honestly this game is fun and does a lot of things right with the fighting and movement mechanics.

It's not worth full price it should honestly be Free (because of the amount of microtransactions). 

At least it's not p2w thank god. In it's current state it's so well polished 9/10. 

Would highly recommend picking up."

Nothing else compares to it, it's very unique and gets away from the running simulator / camping almost every other BR has. 8/10 from me."

Gameplay is fast and fun with a rock-paper-scissors combat style. The game is fast paced and gets better every patch. Give this game a chance for $20 I would say its worth it. You can always grind a bit for a new character using in game silver tao coin currency."

11232,"if Dark Souls and Ghost of Tsushima had a child, who became a battle royale addict, this is it..."
11233,Awesome game.
11234,"If you are on the fence about purchasing this game, I would highly recommend you wait until this game inevitably goes free 2 play.  I pre-ordered this game even though I didn't get a chance to participate in the open beta, because I'm a big fan of melee combat games and the gameplay trailers looked interesting.  That said, I am strongly considering requesting a refund for the following reasons (in no particular order):

1.  I paid $35 for the deluxe edition because I wanted to support the developer and so I could get 10 Tidal chests.  Once I started up the game though I realized Naraka essentially has the monetization features of a free 2 play game such as Apex: Legends.  On top of the fact that I don't get to open my 10 Tidal chests unless I play 2 hours (past the refund period), there is a battle pass that costs about $13 and you can buy individual loot packs.  Why the hell did I pay $35?

2.  The first several matches have been against bots, so I can't really tell if I'd like the actual gameplay against other players until AFTER the refund window.  I played both tutorials and was still forced to play against bots for another two matches even though I wanted to be immediately matched against other players.  

3.  The battle arena itself is incredibly drab and the spawning mechanic leaves much to be desired.  It's a grid based map and you can see where everyone has chosen to spawn.  Even though it's generic for all players to jump out of a plane/battle bus/dragon on a random route through the map, the option they've selected is subpar.

4.  Combat doesn't seem as fluid as the gameplay videos made it seem (big shock, I know) but since I've been FORCED to play against ONLY bots, I can't judge this aspect very well.

I might decide to keep playing the game and update my review later, but I strongly suspect my initial impressions won't change even if I try to squeeze 10 hours of entertainment out of this game."
11235,"Actually feels like im spider man and when combos connect, effin Kreygasms"
11236,"Fun, Battle royale but with swords
katana looks cool"
11237,The game has a lot of potential. But right now i would not recommend getting it. There are lots of bot players(Literally bot accounts) and it drags the game down. I would rather have to wait 3-5 minutes to find a game full of real players than 2 seconds for a game with maybe 5 real players at best(out of 60). The combat system is little bit clunky as you try to learn but I imagine you can really get to do some crazy stuff. I have refunded the game for now but look forward to a time where it is actually playable.
11238,yup

11247,"New Review:

Review after 4 hours and playing against many Chinese and Non-Chinese players.

It is still the same for me, actually. Maybe since I am in the SEA region so even if the Chinese come here, it does not lag too much, yeah, but it surely lags. But not all Chinese players are gods of this game, you know, even in 3 bloodbath matches, where we have to kill others, I got Rank 3 as average, with a Chinese earning Rank 1 only now time.

This shows that the China-men problem EU and US players are clamouring about doesn't exist in SEA.

Of course, I got owned by human players as soon as my honeymoon with bot players ended. And man, you can not even survive a minute without knowing the three rules in this game: 1. Blue Focus attacks are stronger than basic 2. Parry is stronger than Blue Focus attacks 3. Basic attacks are stronger than parry. Don't get it?

Basically, it means that if your opponent is only thinking of attacking, wait for the blue flash and parry. A single parry could kill an opponent in seconds; the parry will disarm the opponent and allow a follow-up attack. If the opponent is using the only parry, use basic attacks, and you win. It is a simple stone paper scissor model.

Parkour and Skill animations are great, Don't compare them against Assassin Creed Games; Netease doesn't have their budget. Keep your expectations light and you will surely like them. The anime-like skills of the characters are just awesome too.

Actually, my final thoughts on the players who just gave this game a negative review because of bots in starting are that they don't want to play it. I mean, even games like DMC and GOW will not send you to fight a boss character in the first hour; they will first teach you basics.

And for those who want the region lock. You guys or gals should stop considering this game as an MMORPG where servers are region locked. In Asian multiplayer games, it is prevalent for good players to use VPN to play in other regions because they can get top ranks there but not in their domestic regions. Top-level Chinese players will not come to your server with such lags as they dislike lags even more than you.

So ultimately, the game is good for casual and competitive plays. This game is made by NetEase games which have popular running mobile MOBAS and other multiplayer games. Even the character Yoto Hime from the DLC came from their world-renowned MOBA Omnyouji Arena, which actually is among the top 5 Global Mobile MOBAS right now, so you can expect them to produce good materials for the life of this game because they are already good at it.

Edit: I forgot about telling Battlepass. Basically, the battle pass is a good thing for all. If you don't want to purchase it, play the game, and it will give you the second-highest, purple, tier Cosmetic Skin free. And if you like the skins and have money, purchase BP to support the developers and enjoy your interest. This battlepass is purely cosmetics. This game has a talent system for upgrading your money, and no amount of money can help you improve it without grinding the game, just like many MOBAS in the net where you can upgrade your in-game fighting only by badges or glyphs upgraded from these Battle Points. 

And those saying that this should be free to play don't understand that they have removed any p2w element by being paid. Okay, it was not a good argument; how about this. How many will ever come to play a martial arts like BR game nowadays? Almost none. I actually faced a sick man who used rifles and canon in this game Yeah, he killed me many times, but even then, others banged him badly. Meaning is that this game is charging money because it is a very niche game right now. People will be happy to play Call of Duty for a BR, not Naraka. So that is why you have to pay to play this game. Since the customer base is tiny company had to do charge this entry fee to earn money."

Mechanics are too complex for most people. If you want a simple game to play, don't buy this one. If you want one where it takes ages to get used and understand to then by all means buy it"
11265,play a few ranked games and you'll lose the bots. the game gets extra fun when you actually start learning how to parry instead of just spamming attacks.

11269,this is an amazing game currently rank 58 na and rank 8 viper world there is an unlimited skill ceiling amazing graphics and an overall enjoyable experience the only bad thing so far is the skill gap in higher levels but for a newer person it doesnt matter and also as a brand new player the game with make u face bots ur first game to ease u into the expereince dont be tricked i even get a few bots in these top 60 lobbies but way less than lower ranks
11270,"Great Game,
Unlike competitive games, fun to play
combat may be similar to sekiro.

Minus : always force close"
11271,"I am truly enjoying this game. Many people have complained about the server types but on the SECOND day of being out they addressed it and are now fixing it. For those who are complaining about playing against ""Chinese"" player are simply just finding a excuse to cover up there lack of skill. With that being said this game involves a LOT of skill and is in no way pay to win. All purchasable items are all cosmetic and all look amazing. There are moments where I see myself getting absolutely CLAPPED by some players but they are simply just better. This game allows you to use the simple but yet complex combat system to come up with your own style for fighting or countering other players. There is a character leveling system that allows you to upgrade your character which in turn gives you very small boosts such as 1% to 2% grapple distance increase or speed. The most """"BUSTED"""" stat would be Luck but if you want that you need to swap out another stat for it which would in turn knock your combat down by 1%. Like I said very small buffs nothing super noticeable or even close to game breaking. If you see any NEGATIVE REVIEWS please check how many hours they have on the game before giving them a thumbs up because most likely they only have a max of 2 hours and are complaining about how they cant win."
11272,EVERYBODY WAS KUNG-FU FIGHTING!!!!!!
11273,"I CANT STRESS ENOUGH. DONT BUY THIS GAME. Wait for it to go free to play. It's 100% not worthed I wish I could get my money back.

The gameplay I SORT of liked, let me explain why: Yes it is fun and I love the freedom of movement, now when it goes into ""Aww lawd this is shit"" is when you get joggled around between 2 people and you cant do shit about it. Thats when I thought yeah, I dont know about this one chief.

Good thing about it though, at the start it gave me GunZ flashbacks, I was like: is this it? Is this the new GunZ? No is not. 
Could it be? Maybe... in games like GunZ or Apex or other royales, you can easily manage to figure a way to fight two people, in this game where the attacks magnetically connect to you, theres very little if not nothing you can do at all to not be jiggled around by two clowns spamming the left click."
11274,Good game!
11275,best pvp game
11276,"As long as Tianhai can fucking hold, grab and toss people I'm can't recommend it to people. Unless I hate them.
And yes, by hold I mean he literally can hold you and you can get hit by his teammate....WHILE HELD.

Overall a good game, but if there's a character that breaks the ""anyone can skillfully go through it"" mantra
That's just wrong man.

Not gonna lie, I half regret buying this game now"

11280,v nice
11281,"EDIT: From suggested to not suggested


So i'm saying this as someone who is going to upgrade their PC, and after upgrading  the game should work much better for me. However to say ""We advise you install the game on an SSD for a more streamlined experience,"" feels a bit misleading. I have all the system REQUIREMENTS/Recommended met, but I have a Hard Drive not SSD ( a problem I'm fixing soon ). Their statement makes it seem like optimal experience comes from having it installed on a SSD, but I would call it more a playable experience (unless you like load times after everyone spawns and constant jumping and freezing). While I'm upgrading my PC and it will work perfectly fine after I do, the System Requirements are def misleading (imo). I also find it important for a Battle Royal to be able to function on a wide range of computers to maintain player base. 

The game is fun, but if you only barely meet the requirements or recommended and don't have an SSD buy the SSD first"

11285,"This is one fine battle royale game 
i can invest time plus the game has 
alot of potential and it is really fun to play with

The one main thing i like about this game is that
it is way better than pubg because im able to spawn and rackup some kills
and eventually win a game where as in pubg im dead on arrival in which 
case i land grab loads of items and then a hacker kills me out of nowhere and
steals all my equipments
My final opinion of this game is that give it a try and you will never regret it 
which means either you buy the base game or wait for sale
either way its is certainly worth it in the end"

No words on ACTUAL latency on games. We've been treated as poorly as we've ever been treated by any game company, but the fact that there WERE servers in the past and now they take them away is adding insult to injury. I like the game, it seems amazing, but not if we're treated like this."

okay my review was from tilt. higher the elo the more the spam animation lock combos you run into. the game is fun when you are the one hitting the spam combos and terrible when you are the one stuck. its swings and roundabouts. overall I like the artstyle and the combat. good rank system. bad stun mechanics."

11299,the best BR nowadays.Excellent combat.
11300,Good game. Worth playing
11301,Played both betas and own the full game. This game is amazing in its own right. Don't expect it to replace your typical BR game but it is well worth the $20 and will only get better with time. I guess if i absolutely had to to compare it to something I've played. It'd be a well made Black Desert BR.
11302,BEST GAME EVER LUUUUURRRRR!!!!!
11303,pretty fun
11304,不错的游戏。。蛮好玩的
11305,pogu game aerol needs to get this right now no cap
11306,"The game is fun, thats the core of all the positive reviews.

The negative reviews focuses on lack of SA and OCE servers, which yes, will result in unplayable experiences for players in those regions (high ping and melee pvp do not go well together). So if you are in one of those areas, unless you can get low ping, dont bother.

As for the rest of comments regarding it should be free to play, loot boxes and battle passes. Meh, that's up to individual preferences as it only concerns cosmetics. I personally thinks the game play is worth the price tag."
11307,Damn Great !!!
11308,Very enjoyable.
11309,"Played a match and won. 
Thoughts about my experience.

-Battle Royal 
This is your average battle royal experience but with melee weapons. 
I wish they added a 12v12 with smaller maps on the side. That would be much more exciting. 

- Melee Combat 
Sword Swinging is very smooth in this. Not as smooth as what you get from a DMC series title but its up there. 

- Graphics 
Thank you to the Devs who decided not to make it look like a cartoon, 
Graphics is a 7/10 for me. 

- Overall 
After playing my first round in this, and winning 
I felt like I wanted more. I feel like this game at the time released with very little content and modes. 

--- 7/10 ---
"
11310,"most negative reviews is because of the company that designed the game is Chinese and the apparent task manager program of this game is in Chinese so they got terrified of ""would be chinese hackers"" stealing their data instead of commenting on the actual game. 

actually the top review of this product said the game was fairly good but still rated it down because ""you would be playing with chinese players most of the time"" and ""had troubles closing the program"" (???????). if this doesnt sum up the review being racially motivated idk what does lmfao."
11311,"Great game and satisfying mechanics, might be a bit of hack and slash yet it has its own reflection and deflection with combos, great introducing into action battle royale games, in hope it does not fall like other action battle royale games, it did great on the release day i would say. 

- Recommended for those who wishes to try the game for a long period of time not those who sink for few hours and wish to have a good experience.

The only Con: 
- high latency for us on the middle east yet manageable with Sea servers, and the introducing bot matches for several rounds"
11312,"Stupid game, they don't give a flying F for the SA and oceanic community. never buying a chinese game again"
11313,"Despite most of the mixed reviews on this game, i feel like it has a lot of potential as a refreshing BR. Still enjoying my time in here for now. The price point is rather low, most of the items are cosmetic anyway."
11314,LIKE
11315,nice game
11316,"I know a lot of people are upset by the loot boxes and dlc and I agree that its bogus but I have had a lot of fun with the game.  I get that it should be free in some aspects but $20 isn't bad and you don't need to buy any characters. (yet) I say try it out if you gotta refund you can, it can be tough after you stop w bots but I think i found my new go to game!"
11317,"This is tough to say, but I really don't like this game.

It has some awesome features that allow it to stand out in the extremely saturated Battle Royale genre. But not much else.

Here's [b] The good [/b] 

[list]
    [*]The game is beautiful and it's world is a joy to explore
    [*]Traversing the world incredibly unique and a ton of fun (think Assassin's Creed & Sekiro)
    [*]Characters and abilities are unique and all feel fun to play and customize
[/list]

Now [b] The bad [/b]

[list]
    [*]From the start I should mention this game has a monetization model ripped right out of 2017 with premium currency to purchase, a battle pass AND LOOT BOXES when the game already cost $20
    [*]While traversing does feel fun and unique, it is also extremely clunky. You will magnetize to every ledge or wall in an attempt to run or flee and it looks awful and feels dreadful.
    [*]Finally, the game has you matched against bots when you initially start playing and you'll have to meet a certain criteria to play with actual human players. How long will that take? Conveniently a little under 2 hours. I say conveniently because when you're playing against bots, you're going to feel like you're doing very well. But when you're finally matched with actual human players who could potentially be better than you, you might not like the game a whole lot. And 2 hours is the cutoff for refunds on purchases through Steam. Coincidence? Probably not.
[/list]

Again, I think this game is unique enough to have a strong community of dedicated players. But it really should have used a F2P model instead. If nothing changes, I don't see it having an active player base in 6 months."
11318,Great game. Gameplay is smooth. Servers need a little work. Otherwise great game to play solo or with friends.
11319,"Very fun to play. Ignore the negative reviews please, for 20 its like for free. Daily missions, exping you favorite character, weapons.. Highly recommend !
PS: Since there is a referral system and I don't have 20 friends, If you can use my link it would be greatly appreciated: ""chm7mhc3fe"". See you in game !"
11320,"I only played like 4 hours but I closed my laptop last night with the game still on last night on accident lol. I recommend it though, on one hand it is a good battle royale with really fun combat and movement, but on the other hand it has stupid lootbox/mobile game shit. Cosmetics and character creator is pretty cool though.  One thing I'm unsure how I feel about is how you can upgrade your character's skill and ult inbetween matches. It's cool because it gives you something to work on but I kinda don't like it in a br where everything's supposed to be random every match. Overall I'd say it's worth $20, but the mobile game menu and features kinda cheapen it a bit. 

Also only your first two or three matches are against bots. It is kinda annoying but it helps you get used to the game, and you will need it, because after that you get thrown in with the chinese killers that will kick your ass."
11321,Actually a great designed game. Could be a bit cheaper since the micro transactions are huge but besides of that its alot of fun. I would recommend it!
11322,"Extremely frustrating release for some regions. (SA specifically).
NARAKA: BLADEPOINT staff has promised SA/BR servers for release - as they existed during all beta phases that we've played.

When the game released (Aug 11, 11pm BRT) the only server we were able to connect was NA, with an average of 200ms for most part of Brazil. This type of fast paced game requires a low latency to be competitive. It is impossible to compete with people playing with 20~30ms when you have 190~200ms.

It is really really sad to not have a clear communication of the lack of nodes in these regions when the game released. It was a surprise for everyone, including BR community managers. Why?

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is averaging 15k viewers on Twitch. Just by having the main BR streamers playing it (and they were going to play if we had SA/BR nodes), it would easily bump to 30k.. EASILY...

I think this company is underestimating the community we have and making us all disappointed. There are players that played every single test and are now refunding the game.

Oh right, but you ""hear us"" and you ""act"". Sure you do. Next time, act when you need to act, that is prior to release. Don't fucking release your game without servers you had in testing phases. What was the point of testing anyways?"
11323," Naraka Bladepoint is dangerously addictive and rewarding with progression systems for each hero that allow you to customize your own fighting style in many different ways. For anyone who is a fan of battle royales and up close action RPG combat this is a great choice, and for a good price at that. These meek 12 hours of playtime come from one very late session last night. If that tells you anything about how this game can 'hook' players."
11324,"The combat feels great and you will only play against bots in the first few matches, so don't worry about that. I'm not really interested in BR games anymore, but this one really doesn't feel like one - and that is good, imo."
11325,"The game will often glitch and lag. Sometimes you will freeze in one spot and appear randomly in another spot. Plus this is not a Online Multiplayer Battle Royale. It's like dynasty warriors but worst.

There are two modes. The Battle Royale isn't really like battle royal at all. I've seen bots spawn randomly in the same areas. It's 3 people against random bots. There are no other players when playing battle royal because it could barely hold a 3 person group connection together. The other mode is just a battle ground where you are put in and just fight randomly. Which is alright. 

Also the UI is terrible and messy. 

The game is not worth 20 bucks."
11326,"SA and OCE players doesn't get the servers we were promised because they are trying to implement a node system that is doomed to fail and force people to play with 180ms+ and the worst part is that it's not even available at launch and it's gonna take 2weeks+ at best.

Not only that but the pricing model is terrible for non-us regions with not only a very high starter price but also a non-regional priced in-game store, meaning that buying the battle pass costs even more than the game itself."
11327,"2h in game and its fun and interesting, maybe kinda easy in Bronze. kinda feel like you met BOTs sometimes. But mechanics are nice and powers of characters it makes it different, not just by weapons in game.

I can recommended for nice price 20€"
11328,FUN and a well designed game!
11329,"Once you get used to the combat it's a pretty darn good game.
it's about time a BR was released based on melee combat."
11330,"Gameplay is a lot smoother than I anticipated. Sekiro meets battle royale is something I didn't know I wanted, but now I am glad it exists."
11331,"Shady business with the servers. They dont care, dont bother."
11332,lovely game
11333,"Curiosity got the better of me with this one despite my general dislike of BR games. I'm pretty awful at shooters so this seamed pretty ideal for me, given that it's mostly melee combat. 

Not sure what I expected, but I'm genuinely having fun with it. Is it mind blowing? Not really, but it's a good bit of fun and will at least keep me occupied for a few weeks. 

The cash shop is a bit obnoxious considering there's a box price AND a battlepass but as long as it remains cosmetic items only, I don't really care. One thing that does really rub me the wrong way though.... In order to buy the battlepass you need 1340 'gold bars' (the cash shop currency)... They only sell quantities of 240, 1200 or more.... Which means it requires 2 transactions minimum to pay for the battlepass. THAT'S CONVENIENT.  Just sell the damn battlepass for a set amount of real money...

11339,"The game have a very good concept, it is a battle royale indeed but the combat as movement sistem makes the game very unique as satisfying to play. The only problem witsh teh game so far is that currently there are no South Amercia servers and i am from Brasil so i'm lagged every match. Also, in a fight, in most cases the one landing the first attack is the one who is getting the kill because you can't block anny atacks (unless you have a character that have the ability to do so) and running away is not an option as well, you can try attacking back but when you get hit by an attack you're getting stunned on the ground and your oponent can hit you again and that cicles continue until you die. The graphics are really nice and the game itself makes me want to play another match"
11340,this game is insane ! i love this game
11341,soso
11342,g
11343,"Good game, should to play, very fun with friends"
11344,better then apexs
11345,"Do you recommend this game?

Me: Yes."
11346,"There's a lot of pros and cons with this game. Ultimately, it's a great game, though it's Battle Royale and the same mechanics applies with its competitors, it's honestly a fun game. I wasn't surprised at all when the first 2 matches that I had was full of bots, though there are certainly other people there. When I got to playing with others, it became more exciting because it got more competitive. 

I agree with most of the folks here. The game should've been Free to Play, since there's nothing different when purchasing it or downloading a free Battle Royale game. Though I doubt cheating won't be too much an issue here (hopefully) since getting banned might mean they need to create a new account and pay again.

Is it fun? Yes. Again, the items or certain mechanics may differ from different games, but it's still Battle Royale. You fight, heal, loot better items, get pissed off because your backup can't carry all of your potions and then die because you spent too much time managing your backpack. 

If you're still unsure whether to purchase this or not when you've already read reviews and watch its gameplay, buy it. Mandatory training takes less than 10 minutes and it puts you right into the game after. And, if after 2 hours, it's not your taste or liking simply refund it back. 

P.S. Just buy the base game. I got the Deluxe Edition and the 10 items I got from the lootbox didn't felt worth it. You can simply earn those lootboxes by leveling up or doing quest, one thing I didn't knew when getting into the game."
11347,nice fast gameplay
11348,"gameplay is good at all,dont know why ppl keep complaining with dumb reasons"
11349,good
11350,this is actually a fun game to play.
11351,"专门买来给个差评然后退款
Foreign friends, please don't buy this game.

As you know, Chinese games are the best in how to drain players' pockets. This game has endless internal purchases.

Also, this game is a competitive game, but almost all of them are Chinese server players who come to foreign servers to kill novices. You will have an extremely bad and angry game experience.

And the general playing method is the honor war soul plus assassin creed.

With this money, you might as well buy an assassin's Creed.

Look at the good comments of these employed, this is the consistent trick of Chinese game manufacturers., you can understand, right."
11352,pog
11353,Yes the game has it's flaws but overall a fun and unique battle royal

11356,So Far So Good
11357,Needs more Yoto Hime cosmetics ☹️☹️
11358,Good game
11359,"This game should be free to play. It's nothing more than apex legends in a samurai style combat setting. It still has the cash shops and season passes while also being poorly optimized. It will eat up resources on a lot of cards and when it doesnt, will still leave you wondering why its stuttering. The game runs worse than other similar games which cost less. It feels like they took the characters from another game and stuck them in this without any real polish. So while you can say it only cost 20 bucks, it doesnt really justify playing it."
11360,This is a different experience for me. I never thought i would enjoy such a game like this! keep up the good work
11361,it's pretty good
11362,if you're a degenerate waste of weeb life you'll probably end up enjoying this.
11363,Good game
11364,"Gameplay is great. You like melee sword-based combat, you will like this game. If For Honor was the West's take on a melee game, Naraka is the East's take on it. Tons of flashy combos, great character visuals, very fluid movement, the aerial/verticality aspect makes it amazing. Easy recommend"
11365,climb trees and hide simulator
11366,"So, It's finally out. Been waiting for this game for a long long time. Finally got to play it in the most recent beta and loved it. Some things to work on, especially optimization. 
That seems to be completely fixed, (at least for me) and the game runs incredibly.
Gameplay wise, god damn its incredible. The level of depth you can get into is crazy, with attack cancels (that the game doesnt teach you (which makes it even better of a skill ceiling)), chaining certain combos into another weapons combos mid fight etc. Its awesome.

Ive seen a lot of reviews of saying its ""too easy"" ""game is all bots"" etc. Yes, the game intentionally puts you against bots for the first 5 matches, depending on how you do the faster or slower it will ease you into players. And trust me, youll know when it swaps to players (besides the fact that bots are really dumb and run into walls etc) So ignore those comments unless you really cant play the game for an hour to get through the bot matches. Fortnite did the same thing.

Monetization is for sure interesting. Buy to play BR is a risky move when the big BRs are free nowadays. If they were gonna do buy to play I think it shouldve been 10 - 20 - 40 respectively for each version. 
Yes theres a battle pass. And yes theres a store. All of which are just cosmetics. I know that rubs people the wrong way for some reason. but for me, i really dont care as long as it doesnt give player power. And I dont see this game ever going that route.

Leaderboard and rankings is AWESOME. Theres a world ranking, Solo, trio, state, character based etc leaderboards. Its very cool seeing where you stand against every variant you want to see. love the state leaderboard. 

Imo, the game is incredible. Of course there are tiny things I think they could change, I think theres a few things that are too unforgiving for players that might not have the aim etc. But it isnt game breaking in the slightest. But thats cause Im a snob for elitism.

11367,sword go swoosh
11368,"The game is very pretty, and runs really well. There a few too many microtransactions for a paid game, including a BP and a rotating shop, but they are all cosmetic items. The combat is fun and diverse without too many things feeling gimmicky. I think its very much worth its price tag, even as a distraction from more intense BRs."
11369,sadadas
11370,"Having lots of fun. Monetization kinda sucks, but it's only cosmetic. Combat and movement feel great."
11371,Katana bad
11372,"Its good but this game has a huge problem with high ping players.
There should be a max ping for a lobby."
11373,"Great game with many different weapons and characters which absolutely changes the way battles can be played from brute forcing and ignoring attacks with one to teleporting and vanishing from enemys eyes to changing into giant monster and crushing them all into the ground. Visuals are great, map is at good level of balance in terms of drops and stuff.Theres really nothing  bad to say about this game other than glyphs than i think should have its own currency because they can be quite game changing and arent really that cheap.Many people would love to gets skins and other things from the treasures which only can be get for the same currency as the glyphs."
11374,Poor optimize freeze every game
11375,"PvP Sekiro. Game runs much smoother than the beta. There seems to be some p2w feature added but it isn't impacting my enjoyment at the game, and it won't save you if you don't git gud at parrying. 

For $20, this will definitely more than make up for its cost."
11376,Good good
11377,its feel fresh to play a different kind of battle royale with all new play style
11378,"This game is an optimization nightmare... I physically cannot run this game on the lowest settings without losing all of my frames anytime i see loot anywhere. I have a 1660ti and an i7-6700k there is absolutely no excuse for why i cant even  run this game, cant refund it either so ive wasted my money on an uncooked piece of garbage essentially. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
11379,Swarm go brr.
11380,Very Nice Battle Royale Game
11381,mantapp
11382,"If you love BR games, no doubt its gud"
11383,nice game
11384,"good game, BUY IT NOW!"
11385,first battle royale game i actually liked
11386,the game itself is good. Easy to learn but hard to master. If you reach master lvl it reminds me of the good old k-style days in Gunz but not so glitchy lol. The big Con about this game is the CS. Insane Prices for a CS and Battlepass too. Could be much cheaper and not so greedy. I hope this will change in the future if not...well then I go for a downvote
11387,"The combat is fun and enjoyable when dsync doesn't fuck you, and aside from the lame microtransactions it's a pretty good and fun game for 20 bucks.

Try it out if you please, and if you don't like it, just refund :)"
11388,Nice game
11389,"                The first mixed-review game that i really do enjoy. 
1. Amazing optimization, even though Naraka has an up-tempo combat style.
2. Cosmetics itself is very pleasant to the eyes.
3. Movement system is pretty enjoyable, except of one point- I wish dodge button(shift) and Fast run 
button(also shift) would  changed somehow. Frequently when you pressing it, instead of fast run he just wasting energy by dodging. Death awaits you, if skilled player chasing you.
 P.S. Don't be mad if you were killed by squikki, that guy is a monster!"
11390,Good charater desigh
11391,I bought this game for waifu (Yotohime) but stayed for the gameplay. Probably gonna play this along side Apex Legends
11392,Awesome way to spend time
11393,"stupid duplicate cosmetics system. i only have like 5 or 6 cosmetics, then i got 2 items duplicate"
11394,very nice game
11395,kung fu battle royal is best royal
11396,My favorite BR. Even when im not winning it all i have a lot of fun in every fight i get in and the world is nice to look at. favorite game right now
11397,"Easy to get into BR with a lot of depth in combat and movement.

A decent amount of skills per char. Can even customise it more with Glyphs to match your play style."
11398,"I honestly had high hopes for this game after seeing the trailers, I thought It would be a fun martial arts based battle royale. It's not, sure melee is there and it works all be it it's a very bland honestly kinda low skill system with most of the skill required being actually aiming your attacks at the enemy which is a lot harder than you think with how much your attacks make you move in melee. But the melee can't even compare to the range weapons most of the time. At one point I got a flamethrower ( which is weird as hell to be in this game to begin with) and easily over powered an entire trio by myself cause they were trying melee.

Not to mention the maps feel so unnecessarily big and which can make the game feel super slow which the characters strangely slow movement speed doesn't help with. Plus the grapple which not gonna lie was kinda a selling point for me is terrible. It has limited ammo and a very short range along with the fact that it takes two buttons to use (Q to switch to it then left click to use) makes it feel slow. The one saving grace for it is the fact it's actually decent in combat, if you hit someone with it it shoots you at them and staggers them which can be nice.

All in all this feels more like a early access game or a f2p game and not one worth paying even the $20 I paid for it"
11399,"If you like Swords buy
If you like BR buy
Last of all if you like katana go for it 
The combat is good you need to be mechanically good at the game but would love to have OCE server tho

Update after 78 hours they included OCE server point and its fire love the game the game is not dying and i can see this be played competetive"
11400,Just get it & kill them all~
11401,"Amazing battleroyale game, interesting to play and brutal as hell ! Highly recommended!"

11403,"Honestly, it's just a fun game. Battle Royale with great jiggle physics. No part of me is angry that I spent 20 dollars on it.

Update: still fun"
11404,"Don't buy this game. it's bullshit i don't have any gold from Pre-order bonus. Why pay to play game have BP i don't understand.
When play normally it's smooth but when you fighting to someone it's really lag."
11405,"I honestly couldn't tell you how this game plays because the 3 games I played were vs. ALL BOTS.

They run into walls until they die by the circle, and I'm not waiting until the refund period passes to find out how this game actually plays.

Right now, it's a scam. Do not buy."
11406,"Its a great game, I don't care about the reviews. Enjoy along with friends."
11407,"**WARNING, LONG AND UNPOPULAR OPINION BELOW**

I was so excited for this game after discovering it this Monday, that I bought the Ultimate Edition and downloaded it as soon as it was available on the 12th. I did not play the Beta, so I really didn't know what to expect going into it until having played through the tutorials and my first couple games. As others have mentioned on here, your first game will be so easy and there is a high possibility you'll find yourself winning 1st place out of 60 players your first match. ""Well I am pretty good at Fortnite/Apex/[Insert BR Title] so i'll get the hang of things pretty quick"" I told myself until I realized that it was indeed bots I was playing against to boost my ego and keep me playing past the initial 2 hours to make it harder to refund. Even for the players like myself who got the 10 free loot boxes with the ultimate edition purchase, at least for me, nothing of value was in said boxes, but the good news is the next box will have a guaranteed epic drop-rate! (more money).

Just going through the menus it is very obvious that the main goal of this game is to get you to spend money on cosmetics, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but past the menu screen and into the real game reveals that the graphics are not as good as advertised and those cosmetics you're spending that money on can't really be seen by other players to the extent of other popular games.

All in all the game does have it's cool perks and don't get me wrong, the menus and artwork are beautiful. My personal opinion is the game should be free, but if you are still planning on buying it please take my advice when I say that there is no reason to purchase any version past the standard one for $20.
"
11408,\ (￣▽￣)╭♡
11409,"Played a lot of beta, great game!
You face bots at the beginning, but only for a few matches. After a few games you are going to face ONLY players.

Game has a very unique combat system, fast movement and challenging
Insane amount of unique character customization
Able to obtain chest and cosmetic all for free(Requires grinding though)
Definitely worth the price!"
11410,"Graphics 10/10 - booba all over the place :P
Combat system 8/10 - very fast paced mixed with movement, could be a little better, maybe counter for grapple or smth.
Sound ?/10 - i dont care...
monetization 7/10 -  you can get decent skins from chests, battlepass doesnt earn enough currency on another BP...
gameplay 6-8/10 - Really depends on how many bots u encounter in the game, actual PVP is very fun, PVBots is boring...

OVERALL 7/10 - fix your sh1t and it could be 8-10/10

!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EDIT: 
if you dont have SSD or at least some newer hard drive you will have a lot of lags and loading problems. I have i7, gtx 1080ti, 16gb ram and i have xtreme lags, my friend with shitty pc but good ssd has no problems like that. ( i have 5 years old hard drive, 1TB)"
11411,"Lets see. Is the game fun? Yes. Extremely. Would I recommend the game to others? Well. What i'd recommend is do YOUR own research. Through steam reviews and other sources to see if YOU are okay with how the devs have handled things thus far. I am having a great time in game. However the devs dont' seem to listen to anything nor give any type of ""Timely"" response to bugs/issues/fixes. 

Is the game worth 20 dollars? Yes and no. It has a HEAVY monetization build once you get in. The devs polled the audience prior to launch on if the game should be F2P or B2P. It was hands down F2P voted on. Did the devs do that? No. So what was the point of the poll? Once you get in the game, you're welcomed to an in game store. Where skins are 15-20 dollars. There is also a BP that you can buy. That is not your standard 10 dollars. It costs slightly more. And it DOES NOT reward you with enough currency to buy the next one that comes around. Therefore making you always have to pay just a little more each time. 

Performance is OKAY. I was told with the setup I have (1080 with 32g ram) I could run 80-120 frames on High. That is wrong. Idk where this came from but I have to run on medium to get solid 60. Could just be me but that doesn't sound right. 

Other than all of this do I recommend the game? Yes. If you want a high paced, fast combat experience that will challenge you to out rock paper scissors your opponent. Spend the 20 if you don't plan on buying anything in game. If you can't justify it, by all means don't then. The devs need to make this F2P IMO for it to last.

I know this review is kind of back and forth. but I honestly do enjoy the game. I don't want the playerbase to die hence why I say it NEEDS to be F2P. But if you're only gonna support the purchase of the game and nothing in the in game store. Yes buy the game."
11412,My tci texas graphing calculator has better optimization than this shit
11413,Best BR for wuxia fan it like dream came true.
11414,Awesome character customization and game graphics. Smooth game play.
11415,definitely a breath of fresh air with a fairly steep learning curve but rewarding when you learn the characters and mechanics
11416,"Refreshing and technical, satisfying to play and punishing."
11417,"Honestly, the game is good. And fun. Some things need to be polished in order to make the game better but overall, the game is definitely worth the price, especially if you're bored and have nothing to play. And Jiggle. 10/10 =)"
11418,"stupid optimize. all cpu gpu ram disk load under 50% but still shake fps, lag. 1 star"
11419,Worth the money i spent on this game. Early games are full of bot but after that the real pain begin when you meet real players. Fun to play with or without friends. Free for all mode (Bloodbath) is my favorite mode.

Also a paid BR game which also asks for you to pay for a Battle Pass, and then pay for cosmetics. Greedy as fuck"
11429,Nice game !
11430,"Terrible and overhyped.

Not only the game feels clunky (both fighting and movement), but the inventory system is confusing and not friendly at all.

Plus... Their monetization scheme is outdated and antiquate... Loot Boxes only for cosmetics? Battle pass I have to buy on top of a game I purchased? Really?
Hell no. I'm out.

Got my refund, back to Hunter's Arena I go."
11431,nice
11432,Good game .
11433,Just Perfect !!
11434,"After playing this game for a while I gotta say, the game is great!

I'm an old school gamer, and have played literally thousands of games, I stopped playing a lot games in 2014 as nothing really special was out there, and the games I enjoyed just didn't trend with the majority of players from my country.

But now that the internet is bringing us closer, we get to see games that were once considered a niche market, such as Asian related content, that was usually closed to the Western market or just didn't appeal to Western players.

And it's great to see that they are tailoring their games to both Eastern and Western markets, something Chinese companies need to do more of, considering they have some of the most talented people in the world.

As for the game, it's using Unity Engine, which is amazing considering the level of fidelity they achieve. Would love to see a GDC talk regarding the development of the game.

But as far as gameplay goes, it is clear they have targeted their combat style towards a casual audience, but have added enough complexity with their Rock, Paper, Scissors formula, to give skilled players an edge, without totally cancelling out the average gamer.

The content and upgrades for this title are huge too, while everything is quite expensive, there still seems to be enough unlocks happening on the regular despite my skill level being on the lower side of the majority of players.

The planned and expected additions to the game, and regular content updates get me excited.

I just wish I could grind out long sessions of play like I did in my younger years.

So, if you're a casual or competitive player, your going to be entertained with this game, I'm sure of it.

So get it, I wouldn't think twice."

11455,It's p fun
11456,"At this point in time the vast majority of negative reviews are totally irrelevant to gameplay and are mostly about:

1. No servers in my region, we were promised servers ( OCE,  SA). They are launching those servers though.

2. Combat is boring, i can slaughter the whole lobby im the God of katanas. Until around MMR 1200 Bronze you are matched mostly with bots. I dont know why devs chose this, it was a heavily critisized move during beta but they still stuck with it. Solution is further down the line (like 1+ hour of games ) you will get matched with real people and this is where it gets interesting.

3. Monetinzation is bad. Yeah ok, monetization is fairly greedy for a buy to play game but its accessories. Doesnt affect your gameplay in the slightest. Also for some reason the chest rolls have a Gacha pity system. Still nothing that affects the game.

-----

With all the above random negative reviews people give and i provided answers, my opinion is the game does some things really well but sometimes the movement feels janky, ie you're trying to avoid an enemy but your character decides to hang from a roof while you were trying to jump or something.

I have yet to find all the nuances of combat as im quite low MMR atm 1280 at the time of writing but stun locking combos can be an issue. Might be a case of git gud. Either way we will see.

I reccomend the game because it's fun, looks good, animations are generally top notch and the jankiness will likely get fixed."
11457,"At least there is EU servers :P

Seriosuly though, the game is fun, it shouldn't have mixed reviews. Hope it gets OCE servers soon too"
11458,9/10
11459,"All the negative reviews are concerning purchasing the battle pass, loot box system, and cosmetics. The game itself is in no way pay2win and it is quite fun."
11460,"The game is amazing and refreshing to play, no longer will you get killed from behind or have some 13 y/o build a skyscraper. The combat is fairly simple yet complex, the movement is clean and to those who complain there are only bots, that's just in the beginning to get you used to the game which I think is a great way to dive in if you're new, after you played an hour or so you wont get any bots. Lots of cosmetics and progression system don't seem be too broken, all characters play a different role, customisation option is top notch.

Definitely give it a go and see whether you like it, it's less then £20, can't really complain."
11461,I find the game to be very enjoyable. Love the melee style to game. Its a very different kind of Battle Royale and i find it fun. Subscribe and join to watch on my live steam Bayonee @ Youtube. :)
11462,nice
11463,"95% of the players are bots. Played more than 25 games and encountered no more than 5 actual human players, I guess. No regional chat. Being matched with players from distant continents despite playing in EU server. This game isn't worth playing, nothing to see here move on."
11464,Player who put negative review on the game. are basicly suc in pvp games. this games movement and melee battle are top notch.
11465,"This game has exceeded my expectations. It's fantastic, the movement is incredibly satisfying and the combat is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Ignore the negative reviews saying the game should be free to play, it's just a bunch of broke fortnite kids. The progression system in this game is similar to Apex Legends but it feels better honestly. $20 isn't that steep of an entry fee for a game that has infinite playability and tons of cosmetics/gear to grind. I highly recommend Naraka."
11466,"chinese cheaters stopping me from looking at 
yoto hime crouching
>:("
11467,Thoroughly enjoy this game.
11468,"Much hate with no reason, this game is fun!"
11469,"The gameplay is great and the graphics are beautiful. Yes there is a battle pass and lootboxes with RNG cosmetics in a paid game, but it's only $20. I'm not sure why Overwatch got a free pass on that when it was $60 on release and it also had lootboxes for cosmetics. None of the paid items give an advantage and that's what matters the most. The core gameplay is great and the majority of the progression such as levels gives you lootboxes, just like how Overwatch gives you a box per level. I don't think the monetization is as bad as people make it out to be.

If you're looking for a fun melee combat game that looks and feels great, Naraka: Bladepoint serves its purpose well. It's not worth getting caught up in the monetization and completely ignoring an otherwise fun game because of that."
11470,"controls feel a bit floaty at times, and there are obvious issues with the input queing, but overall it's a fun game. definitely worth the money :) game isn't pay to win at all as far as i can see, just some paid cosmetic stuff but it seems a lot of cosmetics can be earned by completing in game challenges.

Update:
Ok i'm officially hooked on this game. The higher you go up the rankings the more you see how technical and skillful this game can be played, which makes it all the more interesting.
"
11471,"The gameplay itself is alright. It's refreshing to see a fighter battle royale in a sea of FPS battle royales. The character customization is very fun and has led to some hilarious creations. One picture I saw someone customized their character to look like sexy squidward. I also think the cultivation missions are very neat. Cultivation missions are missions that you can do to unlock the lore behind every playable hero. The talent system is also very unique and cool. You can add things like Rage generation, grapple speed, rift dealer discounts, etc. There's two different game modes. There is The Herald's Trial which is the battle royale mode of the game and Bloodbath which is non-stop fighting. Bloodbath can be very chaotic and exciting and is a great way to hone your combat skills. The Herald's Trial has two different ranked modes, trios and solo. I love the fact that there is a solo mode for people who don't like dealing with teammates that aren't very team-oriented.

I'm not a big fan of the fact they put you against bots until you reach a 1200 rating. It gives you a false sense of how good you are as a player. You get your face punched in when they take the bots away. I have an issue with the fact they added a parry that you can only use on focused attacks (character gets a blue outline) but there is no way to block or counter if you are getting common attack spammed. You can play a champion named Tianhai who has a talent that blocks all incoming physical attacks with his talent The Divine Bell. Another champion you can play, Tarka Ji, can also block physical attacks with his talent Inner Fire. He can even counter them if he blocks enough times with one of it's variations. But not every hero has a way to block common attacks like that. Yoto Hime has no defensive abilities. The grappling is also kind of janky. You can grapple somewhere but if you get caught on something midway it cancels the grapple. There have also been many times I successfully grapple someone only to immediately have it canceled because they grappled me as well. The auto targeting of players by the grapple was a terrible idea. I don't know what the devs were thinking with that one. People do nothing but spam grapple you. You can't escape from it. All you can do is take it. Terrible game design.

I have never in my life seen more mandarin names on an NA server in any game than this one. Ever. The game has been out in China since before global release so I guess they decided to abuse that? That's an issue. Especially when they can take you from 100 to zero without giving you an opportunity to lay a finger on them whether its due to experience or lag. Also, the fact there are no OCE and LATAM servers is a real spit in the eye to players in those regions.

Also, the cash shop + battle pass isn't that big of a deal since it's just cosmetics. But the cosmetics are definitely very cool. If you don't like it don't buy any of it. You still get Immortal Treasures from just playing the game albeit less frequently.

In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend it YET. There's definitely a lot of potential. I'll play it from time to time when I get the itch until they fix things. But the fact there are all these Chinese players abusing the fact the game has been out longer in China on NA and EU servers is very tiresome. The fact the game has a parry for focused attacks but no way to block or counter common attacks is very backwards and annoying. I do not like the fact that some heroes can block common attacks while others cannot. There being no OCE or LATAM servers is not great. But with time and some TLC from the devs, this can definitely be a great BR. It's just not there yet."
11472,best
11473,"Firstly,this game great than i though.

Mostly people said that this game should be free like apex legend.But this opinion i'm disagree cause of the hacking.This kind of problem in online RPG ,FPS games sure mainly question that the game producer need to considerate .When this type of game become free,there will increase the risk of hacking problem.Nobody willing to ensure the hacking typical game.

Otherwise,this game battle pass and some kind of equipment is expense problem.That surely, when we  compare with other kind of game.

Lastly,cause of the game strategy,i think we should give a chance to try and enjoy,that's all i want to say.

(Sorry,if i got any grammar misstake ,cause i'm learning this language and trying to type some kind i want to say.:3 )
"
11474,Feels like an early release. 120 ping in NA server makes it hard to precisely use combos game doesn't feel smooth but more like laggy choppy. Pass
11475,"I bought the collector's edition and after playing it refunded that purchased. This game over monetizes with it's loot boxes, cosmetics, and it's battle pass. It's structured like a free to play game but it's not. 

In terms of gameplay it's fine. The combat, the environment, the graphics are just average. The issue I had were that at times it did feel clunky when moving around in the world. The biggest problem I see is the is the leveling system. There is a leveling system where you get stats and more abilities as you level up your hero which might make it hard for new players to get into this game. Veterans won't just have an advantage in experience but also having their hero just be stronger overall which could hurt the future growth of the game. This system seems counter intuitive to the idea of the battle royal archetype where you are  suppose be equal footing when you first get into a match. On top of it having a base price as well as being over monetized."

11479,It's a fun game. People are crying about dumb stuff just to be crying. It's $20 and has loot crates that you can get if you want that just has cosmetic stuff and there's a battle pass that has mostly just cosmetic stuff. People complained about this and it's just a $20 game and you don't have to buy the extra stuff. There's so much stuff that you get for free just by playing and doing missions. I've been having a blast with it and I like the controls and design
11480,Game is fun and is souls-like but my ping is high
11481,FUN
11482,WOW!! AMAZING!!!
11483,"At first I was a bit bummed because at low rank you start off with a bunch of bots. But as you reach around a rating of 1200, you will start to see the games populated by players instead. So keep bullying those NPC's until then.

Good game after. Lots of fun, strangely relaxing unlike other games of it's genre."
11484,"Got Game
Expect disappointment
Won Game
Best Game Ever!


90ms ping on SEA  server in Australia."
11485,"Amazing Game, I love it!

Fast Paced 
High Skill Ceiling
Beautiful Graphics
A lot of Character Customization



Edit: 

Transparency with devs decreased, I'm big sad, but game is still fun"
11486,4te4
11487,good battleroyale
11488,"Combat seems fun.. Reminds me of Spellbreak, but with everything implemented :P"
11489,very good dont listen to the haters or the reviews about bots bc they get replaced after level 5
11490,Has jiggle physics 10/10
11491,After putting in 300 hours into this game. They have adjusted characters that did not need adjustments and made characters that where already super powerful even more powerful. They have a big problem with que times and allowing players from china with a VPN to play on NA and EU servers. They have 200 plus ping and in a fighting game this can be the difference in winning a fight. At this moment i cannot recommend this game.
11492,nice nioce
11493,Good game
11494,"The best battle royale game I've ever played 
"
11495,"I understand why people are upset about the lack of Oceania servers, that's messed up. I also understand why people would dislike the game's battle-pass and aggressively expensive skins. The business model is likely spurned on by corporate greed, plain and simple. That being said, i don't play competitive multiplayer games for dress-up. The core game-play is some of the most fun I've ever had with a battle-royale game. Melee combat is fast, satisfying, and very well balanced across the weapon types.

As for the complaints about bots being in the first 1-4 games (as determined by the mmr system,) this is a very strange complaint to me. Bots are (unfortunately) industry standard for battle-royale games during the introductory matches. The bots are easy and not-particularly engaging but they allow you to at least get to terms with how to attack appropriately. After the first couple ""bot games"" you will quickly encounter a real player, who will either be new and thus will fight strangely, or a good player who will likely crush you with a single parry. 

As for the reviews calling out that the game was made in china, so? American-made games haven't been known for their exceeding quality lately, interesting AA and Indie games from all around the world have been filling the niche gaps that have been neglected by developers intent on perfecting games about shooting dudes. Personally a niche I wanted filled was ""Melee-focused competitive multiplayer game with character-action styled combat, w/ included grappling hook."" Sekiro filled that niche for me as far as single-player games go, but Naraka allows me to be crushed by real people in a similar way. 

It's not perfect, as other reviewers have pointed out, but it would be a shame to miss out on it if you enjoy satisfying multiplayer sword-fights. Look up some guides and give it a shot, it's well worth the entry fee."
11496,"History:
The maker of this game made a game many years ago called ""Meteor Butterfly Sword"". A niche cult favorite that still had die hard fan to this day. This game is spiritual successor to it, the developer finally had the skill and funding to do everything they wanted so many years ago.

Combat:
It is a fighting game at its core, with combo, parry, dodge, no blocking tho. Very skill based. People say this is a competitor to PUBG because it is a Battle Royal but I say this is competitor to ""For Honor"". 

Depth:
The combat system have great depth once you get pass the button mashing phase. Faints, animation cancels, parry baiting, short combos. I am not great at fighting game but in those rare moment when I have a clear head space in a fight, it is very fun, you find your rhythm and anticipates your opponent with very satisfying payoff. But just like LOL, For Honor, and PUBG you will always find someone that ground stomp you when you start feeling you are getting gud.

Loot box and progress:
I think the loot box and battle passes are fair out of all the games with similar system.

At time of this review I player for 5 hour and about 15 matches. I have earned 11 loot boxes. and 3 character outfits and 2 weapon skin (<-- not from opening loot box, but from mission reward and battle pass rewards, 11 loot box means 11 skins, )

I think as an casual player, I feel this game's progress system feels more fair then not. (by progression I mean ability to unlock skins) It  makes me feel my time invested gives decent progress, but spending more money will accelerate that progress. Whereas a poorly implemented system will make me feel my time invested is being artificially slowed down until I spend money to get it back to normal pace. (which this is not)"
11497,"this game have free to play system, such as battle pass, loot box, and many thing. I won't pay anymore than the initial price.

Gameplay wise it's battle royale, with melee focused battle (you can shoot with ranged weapon). I tried but for now, it's not the best game battle royale game out there."
11498,"Please. For the Love of God.  Latency restrict regions.  Why are there 200ms+ Chinese players teleporting and lagging their ass off on the NA server?

Literally just got hit out of a fully charged blue focus attack by my opponent clicking white attacks.  Thanks client side hit stun."
11499,"Their customer service likes to pretend to be stupid repeating the same explanation you just gave them for a problem you are having and offer no solutions. I have had more luck reasoning with trolls. They also seem to have changed the currency/skin system toward leaving most of them locked behind the shop currency or loot box system unlike the videos that show them being sold for the currency you get playing in the game, which is fair but still seems to be done in a bad faith."
11500,"

"
11501,"You've probably seen 100 reviews on the fact that the gameplay is fun, so I won't touch on that. It's a pretty typical battle royale, but with a heavy emphasis on melee combat instead of ranged combat. It's fun, that's about it.

Let's talk on the more important thing though, and the thing 99% of these reviews have been talking about.

Microtransactions!

NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a $20 game, when you purchase the game you own every single character (currently released, I'm sure they'll make you purchase characters later down the line, but, I can't review something that isn't released yet). The game has various cosmetic microtransactions, a battlepass, lootboxes, weapon and character skins. The game allows you to make customizations to every character (like an MMO character creator) at absolutely no cost, allowing you to make some genuinely hilarious creations. 

Let's travel back to 2016, a simpler time. Overwatch had just released. It was a $40 game, and also contained various microtransactions. It provided all characters free on release, and... well, you see where I'm going with this. The monetization strategies have ZERO in game influence, aside from cosmetics.

If that's a complete turnoff for you, that's understandable, but make sure you're able to put this game in perspective when you look at it's price.

The final thing I wanna touch on is the optimization. I have a high-end PC, and this game does chug at certain moments (mostly when grappling), at the time of writing this, I haven't tried fucking with graphics settings, but that might fix it.

Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10. Aside from the less than stellar optimization, the monetization is no more aggressive than 99% of other video games these days. CS;GO started as a pay to play game with lootboxes, so did Overwatch. Worst case scenario, give it a shot, you can always refund it."
11502,haha. fun
11503,Not an FPS so i don't suck as much.
11504,Fun game
11505,"its an okay game, but would've been nice if it was a free to play game, also where's the 10 immortal boxes??????"
11506,cute fox ears and miko outfits very good dress up game fun time outside of that too
11507,"It's fun, try it out for longer than 10 minutes.  :)"
11508,Very fluid BR melee for the reason it caters all the pvpers from hack and slach mmos. Straight to the point fight to survive. loot your loadout. kill as many as you can be the victorious! bots are just for the 1st battle of the game the succeding BR runs are full of skilled warriors. Parry is the key. can't counter? practice it. fb.gg/fliprocka for more simple tips XD
11509,nice game
11510,"Very good and intresting game.
First few games you are paired with boots so you can get acustom to the game . 
Then you start to play with other players. There could be a little more items but the game is overall amazing
Its like Apex and Monster hunter had a baby"
11511,"its not pay to win, there is a lot of pros and cons. At the end of the day I am still having fun. Hope to see it grow even more!"

11514,"Coming from a player that actual plays it not try for a minute or so then come here to complain because it's not all free or exactly like their favorite game. 

With that said I love this game and I hate battle royale games but this got me hooked so to the devs I thank you for and actual good game. Can't wait to see what's in store for the future."
11515,"I didn't play the Beta so my comments here are based on playing for the last couple of days. 

This is a BR game that primarily revolves around melee combat. It plays a lot like tenchu or sekiro but in a pvp game.

I can play at 1440p medium settings with DLSS quality and usually hit 100+ frames on a 2080 super. The graphics honestly aren't anything super special but BR graphics usually aren't. There's apparently a lot of granularity to the character appearance customization too but I haven't played around with it much. 

A lot of people seem to be judging this game based on the monetizing methods used. The game is $20 to play with an endless real money pit of cosmetic options available. There's no P2W though, so if you can survive the excruciating anguish of playing a game where someone has a shiny sash on their kimono that you want but don't want to spend money on, then I think this game provides pretty good value for $20.

Early on, the game will pit you against a lot of bots with horrible AI. This is kinda shady, because it will cause newer players to think they're really good at the game and keep playing, until the period of time you have to return the game has expired. Once you complete about 10 rounds or so, you will probably start to see a lot less AI players in the lobbies."
11516,The game is fun till you run into a a guy whoring a spear in every single game and these Chinese players just lag across your screen and hits that would normally land don't .
11517,best BR
11518,"- Hard
- Needs faster matchmaking avg wait time for me is 6-7 min
- Should have a quick 1v1 option (it could be even better if you can match for the battle royale while you fight someone else or are in a custom match)
- Could use a mode like rebirth island in warzone, where if you get killed you respawn after 15 seconds as long as your team is alive, then as the match goes on the timer becomes longer until you can no longer respawn
- Needs a better way to introduce new players, because right now if you enter a match after 6 min of match making 100 seconds of waiting lobby plus at least two minutes to get geared just to get absolutely destroyed in 30 seconds by someone playing since release. I know bloodbath exists but no one introduces you to it and the new player might be only interested in battle royale."
11519,The best game ever!!
11520,"Clunky, jank, two adjectives I despise in gaming."
11521,"Horrible game! Don't have respect for South Americans. We don't have a server. 
They spent all the money with the influencers there instead deploy a server to us.

Please don't buy the game, you cannot play a fast paced game with 170ms ping at NA server.
For us at the South America, the game is garbage."

11526,perfect
11527,good
11528,"Everyone knows what they’re getting into when they dive into a BR type of game. There’s always a battle pass, there is always the option to buy/earn skins, characters, you name it.

What makes this game worth the 20 bucks for the base game is how much more there is to the customization, stunning world, and tailoring of abilities/upgrades.

People writing these reviews are complaining about the fact that it’s not F2P plus other options to spend money. But it is your choice to spend that money in game or not. They tell you everything you get with the different editions as well.

All in all this game has fun mechanics and is a unique take on a BR game with an insane amount of customization and incredible graphics!
Plus bewb physics is a nice bonus"
11529,"I pre-ordered the $50 version. Came in. Played two bot matches. Left. Refunded.

After some consideration and after watching videos + seeing this in comparison to other games: You’re paying for novelty. $20 is honestly fine for a brand new title. It’s actually desirable.


Being a NieR: Automata fan, I should’ve expected to do movement but when I played at first, I only thought it was LeftClick + LeftClick + LeftClick to win. It’s none of that. There’s dodge mechanics and tech in this game for damn sure. Before you write off this game as being too easy-to-play or a scam, play it. Really take in what this game is trying to present.



It’s not trying to be the next Fortnite, Warzone, or Apex. It has created a sub genre of BR gaming that we all never expected, and since it’s new, we are quick to call it bad. That whole it’s different so it doesn’t fit in mindset.


Cheers, 
Bass"
11530,"I haven't played enough just yet to see how balanced things are, but with every weapon featuring their own combos the combat does seem to punish simply hack/slashing your way through a fight.

The movement of the characters do bare some getting used to and it may seem clunky at first, but if you watch carefully what your character is doing as they move you might actually be surprised at the flexibility of movement, especially when scaling buildings and certainly during fights.

I played a solid 5 hour session and had a blast, but I do tend to enjoy Battle Royale games. This review is solely based on a first impression but I will 100% return to the game."
11531,This game has good pvp for a br game although there's a lot of microtransactions considering it's a $20 game.
11532,i like this game
11533,fire
11534,"I don't recommend this game in it's current state at all. I actually refunded. My matches felt like they were against a bunch of bots, and the world felt lifeless despite all the beautiful scenery.
The combat and all the customization are all very good, but it felt like an unfinished game. Might consider repurchasing in the future because I'm sure a lot of updates are to come, the game has such good potential. But, for now it definitely wasn't worth it for me. I think it should be free to play in its current state."
11535,"Ignore the loot boxes (with pity rate), the battle pass, and cash shop to get a battle royale with immersive combat, diverse characters, weapons and skills, and hours of fun."
11536,"Great game, took the time to give it a positive review.
   One thing i do think, is that the Devs should go easy on the micro-transactions and be more generous with things we can earn by playing, since there is a price tag on this one."
11537,"great game, a new battle royale for a change! Hoping buy backs will be introduced to trios also looking forward for duo's and squads!"
11538,"Fun game, a tad clunky. Very reminiscent of Gunz The Duel.  Getting out of combos can be hard.

$30 buy in sucks when theres also a battlepass/loot boxes but I don't think its the worst thing."
11539,awesome
11540,usa #1
11541,"Good game. Awful monetization. It looks ok in the BETA, but the retail version is just scummy as hell. The cosmetics are super overpriced, given time they would lower down their pricing and change the mechanics of the character progression if people complain hard enough. The game itself is still good so it's not fair to rate it a failure, just the monetization needs tweaking. 
"
11542,"Only a couple hours in, but I am very much enjoying it. I recommend!"
11543,"It's got the waifu's 
the husbando's
decent face customization
you stop fighting bots after 1200 rating 
at some point you feel like you're a god and no one can touch you 
moments later you feel like the worst player in naraka
10/10 solid game for the price"
11544,"LIKE BIG BOOBIES? LIKE BIG BOOBIES THAT JIGGLE?? IF YOU THINK BOOBIES ARE GOOD, GAME HAS BOOBIES. THAT JIGGLE THERE FOR GAME IS GOOD, I LOVE BOOBIES, THERE FOR I LOVE GAME.






For real though i like the game, its fun, more than one way to play it, the looting system is good, you are almost always granted a weapon at the start of a match. you might think the price is a bit much but for the lack of lag and solid game play i think it was well spent. now i am not saying it has no lag, there are issues from time to time, but i think its mostly on my end when they happen. I am giving a review without to many hours logged into the game because i played the beta. so i have more than what it shows. if you like skilled game play i would give the game a shot. and then buy all the DLC if you like it."
11545,Heh :>
11546,Love this game !!!
11547,Has potential!! But I think adding cross platform would make the player base bigger.
11548,Really enjoy the co-op part of this game. I generally play casting in other games but this one forces me to learn to play melee combat.
11549,"NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a 60-player action Battle Royale which combines Eastern myth, grappling hooks, and brutal sword fights,you play as a high-flying ninja with grappling hooks and katanas.The game is highly playable and can be addicted to it,Just one catch:your first game of Naraka will definitely be against an army of AI muppets, and that's even if you queue up with a party of other humans."
11550,"fun game reminds me of tenchu, also like that each melee weapon has its own move set/combos to learn. character customization is good you can even do the face thing with a picture of yourself,  pvp is ok. BLOOD BATH IS A CRAZY MODE (free for fall)"
11551,amazing game just all around fun and competitive.
11552,"payed for it but cant even play it because no oc servers then i change my regen to one that has servers still cant play
"
11553,"Not that much fun you have to play with bot around 4-5 times before against with other players
Balance weapon new-player against player who had more talents than newer has to facing player who has character or talents more than you it ll be disadvantage sometimes

6.5/10"
11554,A Very engaging combat system and a pretty easy to learn Battle Royale system that i think has potential. I think its fun and once i downloaded it to my SSD I pretty much had no gameplay issues at all.
11555,"If you like fighting games with a battle royal feel, PLAY THIS!!!"
11556,very skill much wow
11557,"Yeet, Super fun and enjoyable,"

11566,great melee action
11567,if u mad about pc not getting ghost of toshima on PC then this is the 2.O enjoy :)
11568,good game looks great feels good but i don't think it should be a battle royal however there is a death match bounty mode which is alr i just want them to adds different more fun modes that compliment the game better

i dont give a fuck if the review is Mixed as long as i enjoy it"
11571,gitgud guy =))))
11572,Good game
11573,This battle royale is a unique from battle royales currently available and while I feel that the $20 price tag will hurt its growth the game is a fun time solo or with friends. Fights can get very tense and there are many ways to express skill through combos or movement etc. Definitely a fun time with friends.
11574,"Now is very good, keep developing."
11575,physics good
11576,"I would say this is a breathe of fresh air in the BR genre. I have over 1500 hours in PUBG, 500 hours in Apex and 1000 hours in warzone.

The combat mechanics are super interesting and different. you play against bots in the first 2 or 3 games and then you never see them again.

Worth playing imo at least for 20 dollars no f2p cheater accounts."
11577,good
11578,"Great game, I love the characters and the feel of the game. The cosmetics are a bit expensive though, but good game regardless. Oh and, I learned I can cook eggs with my GPU while playing this game, so free food is a plus as well."
11579,8/10 from an uncompetitive pov
11580,cool graphics
11581,this game has some fun stuff but I wouldn't recommend this game due to some things within the game. One example is the full combo spear killing me with full purple armor and health without anything I could do against it. Buy at your own peril.
11582,at first was good game. then the stun locks till death happend. no way to stop stun locks. unless changed would not recomend. as well as high ping players makeing it impossable to play mainly from overseas china in na servers
11583,"Pro:
Good Combat System

Con:
More Characters
Less Paid Cosmetics
More Game Modes
Events
1V1 Mode
More Maps,

Update after 20+ hrs,  

Defult gear versus Golden Gear guess who wins in a combat, Defult

Worth game ever just dont bother"
11584,"Easy to play, hard to master"
11585,"if you win, you like this game. if you lose, you don't"
11586,This game is a fighter-esque BR. Its fluid fast paced gameplay is amazing. High skill cap. Short Games. People complain about bots... its for beginning to not force new people to get shit on.... seems like a good feature to me? Not sure why so many people are negative. Definitely worth the money.
11587,at least season 1 battle pass should be free since we paid for the game !
11588,Game can be fun but if you're NA West you will literally ONLY be playing against Asian players with 150-250 ping. Recommend not playing until they add a region lock.
11589,"I really wanted to enjoy this game and recommend it to others but it is so unenjoyable to play and experience I can’t. 

This is very early days so things I say may be fixed or changed later and I may just be complete trash at this game, which is probably more likely but this is my experience with the game. 

First let’s talk about the pros.
Cool concept and game looks pretty. 
Movement is fairly enjoyable but I found myself getting stuck on things a lot.

Cons 
The biggest problem is this feels and plays like a crappy mobile game which is expected as this was published by Netease who are known for shovelling out crappy mobile battle royale games to make a quick buck and this game is no difference.

The main selling point of this game is the thing I think is done the most poorly and that is the combat itself. The combat comes down to who ever lands their attack first and who ever can mash attack faster. When I was being shit on or shitting on other people it was so unsatisfying because you/they are just stun locked and you can chase them down with grapple to finish them off. You can parry attacks which I was rarely able to do because I was already in a stun lock from being pummelled or the input wouldn't even register and the animation would come out a second or two later. 

The game is currently unbalanced which can and will most likely be fixed soon in a balance patch. Not massively unbalanced that it’s not worth playing but there are some overpowered strategies that dominate the rest. For a game focused on melee combat some of the ranged weapon are super strong. There is a repeater crossbow which functions exactly the same as an assault rifle and a swarm gun which functions exactly the same as a missile barrage. This kinda takes away from the aesthetic of a historical melee fighter. The new hero, Yoto Hime, is one of the best (maybe even the best) hero/s in the game right now in my opinion and the great sword is very easy to abuse as the charged attack comes out on the second swing instead of the third like other weapons making it harder to parry.

This one is my personal problem with the game which I haven’t seen anyone else mention. The map is boring. Ever part of the map looks and feels the same with the loot being in most parts, even the hot drops quite mediocre. I struggled to find anything most of the time above blue unless you get them from the airdrop which doesn’t have much worth going for in it. I went to three airdrops in a game and the most I got out of it was a purple armour. 

This can be ignored if you don't care for cosmetics but I think I should still address it as it’s so aggressive. This is a buy to play battle royale that should be free (Even in my opinion it is fairly priced) on how aggressive they try and get you to spend money. You first buy the game and then when you get to the main menu and its laid out exactly like a mobile game with a whole load of different stuff you need to click on to get anywhere. There are 3 different currencies in this game: gold, coins and thread which can each be used to buy things. Mostly cosmetics and to upgrade your skill tree. The cosmetic system works on a loot box model which also has a pity system which gives you an epic every 10 and extreme every 100 but you can get duplicate items which you turn into silk to buy even more cosmetics which are nowhere near as good as the already bad cosmetics which are in the loot box. Some cosmetics are cool but the rest are just recolours of those cool cosmetics. The most aggressive is the battle pass. I think the battle pass actually has a decent amount of content but you can’t actually buy it for the price its being sold at. The battle pass costs 1360 coins but you can’t buy coins at that specific amount. You can buy coins at 240, 1200 or 3000 so you need to buy more than one lot of coins. The battle pass offers in game premium currency similar to apex but you don’t get enough to buy it again so you’ll need to spend even more money on the game. 

If this game was free to play I would say pick it up and sink at least 10 or so hours in to it to get comfortable with everything but this game isn’t free to play. The price is fair but for me it wasn’t an enjoyable experience. The combat is too simple, relying heavily on spamming to win, and the monetisation is too in your face when I’ve already brought the game.
"
11590,Good game
11591,"Good game. To avoid bad experience like all negative cmt:
- Install game to ssd or it is not run property game being lagging even your CPU or GPU not 100%
- First few game u will be match making with bot so u can practice how to play. If u don't want that, u can party with player who already play it for a while. Game will give u less bot with more player but your teamate will receive less point to avoid boosting rank"
11592,"This game is way too bot heavy. Its geared towards making you stick around for 2 hours to not get your refund. While the idea is great and potential is there, take a step back and you can see how money hungry this game is."
11593,"MONETIZATION IS STUPID:

Let me know when this game is free to play and the monetization system isn't as anti consumer and the cosmetic system isn't as confusing as it is right now.

If you can look past the shitty monetization system, it is a fun game to play tho."
11594,"I really enjoy this game. The combat and the movement is fun and the customization is so extensive that you can make any character you use look unique. Each of the weapons have unique combos and fight styles. The combat takes a bit to adjust to but once you have a basic understanding of how each weapon works, combat gets better. After the betas, they've made changes and have made each character a lot more balanced. It'd be nice if the ping was lower on the NA servers though. 

A lot of the bad reviews are about the fact that the battlepass is expensive and the drop rates for good stuff from the lootboxes are low. The battlepass is purely for cosmetics and doesnt affect gameplay what-so-ever. Leaving a bad review for a game because you can't afford the pretty skins is kinda ridiculous. If you enjoy playing the game and think the gameplay is worth it, leave a good review."
11595,10/10 love to get grabbed by a Tianhai's ultimate from halfway across the map then get smashed into the ground :)

11597,Expect upgrading
11598,"Low rank is all bots, movement is nice when it's not being clunky. Combat seems interesting but becomes repetitive. Everything is monetized."
11599,great game
11600,"great game
"
11601,"I bought the copyright
Buy NARAKA: BLADEPOINT - Asura Edition
But now I'm not getting 10 item chests as advertised"
11602,Great game.
11603,"plays like any other BR. you do all the work and someone gets you off guard and spams attacks or arrows, do alot of damage to someone and they try desperately to grapple away and if they run out they spam ults. definitely shouldnt have been a BR and the genre shouldve been left to die. sucks too cause you think youre doing good but then you play against bots the first 5 matches then youre just back to square one and in that time you cant even request a refund for the game. waste of $20

revised:
they add oceania servers yet they still join NA with no penalties and can just boost top 500 cause no one can hit or parry them. imagine playing NA and top 500 is just asian players lmfao this game is gonna die real quick if nothing changes. also imagine a fighting game where theres no block button, yeah that means you sit there for a full combo if the opponent knows how to cancel properly"
11604,Very Nice :D
11605,"the combat is fun, and graphics are great. Please let us customize Yoto Hime more!!"
11606,"very nice game, but battle pass is not included"
11607,"SO most of the people reviewing this game saying the combat is bad most likely don't understand how it works and spam left click.

This games combat system revolves around 5 types of moves, Light attacks, Focus attacks, Parries, skills and ultimates. it is a rock paper scissors system where Parry beats Focus, Focus Beats Light, Light beats parry. Like I said before most people spam light attacks with their 3rd strike being a focus on every weapon except greatsword and the ranged weapons. There are also combos based on  chaining the two types of swings, vertical and horizontal, which is also something most people miss. 

There is some jank, but if your a fighter fan, this is seriously a fun BR. Especially if you like a challenge. The first few mathes will be against bots, but once you start playing ranked, you will soon realise this game has a massive skill ceiling and you will get dunked on until you improve.

Take reviews with a grain of salt, personally, I like this game a lot.

9/10"
11608,good !
11609,ดีกว่าที่คิดครับ
11610,"Eh I mean, it's not too bad. Needs some polish but if you wanna be an anime hero in BR format then this is your game"
11611,"Game is lackluster in terms of overall combat and movement. The ping issue is MASSIVE and makes the game unplayable. Highly recommend to not buy this game.

Update: Matchmaking is still utter dogshit. You will get bots on your team. It is insane. Devs are brain damaged."
11612,"两次内测都有的南美服务器呢？没了？对得起我们吗？日你妈！退钱！
What about the South American servers that are available in the two closed betas? Gone? Worthy of us? Your mother! Refund!
¿Qué pasa con los servidores sudamericanos que están disponibles en ambas betas cerradas? ¿Desaparecido? Digno de nosotros? ¡Tu madre! ¡Reembolso!"
11613,"The amount of negative reviews towards the amount of additional DLCS as well as it being a paid game with a paid battle pass are honestly quite pathetic excuses to put this game down. You can tell a lot of work went into the development of this game, and even with global servers there is absolutely 0 latency issues whatsoever. I have experienced 0 desync which is extremely rare these days for any game launch let alone the game's continued life span years on in the future. The game is 20 dollars, with all the dlcs and the pass being for cosmetics. The only ""pay to win"" feature you could potentially try to get a brainwashed angle on would be the hero Yoto Hime, which is simply a different play style with different abilities that are just as strong as any other character's. A good game doesn't make it's self. The game's people beg for now a days simply cannot make themselves with the amount of money the developers list them as as well as the shops that are within them. Simply put, it costs a big budget to make a big game, and if they land every single other checkbox, which this game definitely does for making a good game, than I do not care to invest some money into what I'd enjoy as a game I'm sure we've all dreamed of."
11614,Getting clapped by spears and cc by grapple 24/7. still gud gayme :D
11615,"Even though there are bots I like the foundation of the game, some combat may feel little unfair but I feel like it just needs balancing."
11616,bad asssssss
11617,"As a long time Warzone player, the fact that this came out with anti-cheat on day one makes it worth recommending."
11618,Im trash at this game but its good.

11620,One of the best BR's already and it just dropped.
11621,"BEST GAME EVER!!!
I am amazed by the Chinese traditional culture in this game."
11622,"I love this game, the combat is pretty fun"
11623,Fun to just relax and enjoy with anyone
11624,"have oce server now, n1ce"
11625,fun time wit da buns
11626,"I'll update once i have more hours. This is my first impressions.

It's a fun BR game. I've wanted to play something in this style for awhile, and it's enjoyable. It could use some improvements, but so far it's good."
11627,this game could have potential it lacks players due to a price point and not enough social media blast to get it players into it. what they need to do is make this game F2P or online demo trial to see if people would like it. if they don't do that this game probably won't have any life after a month or so.
11628,Temulch go hard.
11629,"Quite a fun and enjoyable game. Could use optimization, but overall enjoyable."
11630,sekiro and apex legends had a baby with jiggle physics
11631,"this game is so fun and i highly reccomend this game to anyone, i fell in love with it instantly. its easy to understand and i see this game having a lot of potential against other BR games:) 10/10"
11632,"Global launch without SA and OCE servers and the staff say it is a ""server issue"". How can a game big launch day can have server issues? Delay the game as New World, but respect your players!"
11633,Game should be F2P. It is pretty bugged and full of bots already and doesn't really feel like a launch but rather an Early Access title. They need to balance and debug as well as fix the translation errors.
11634,"Gambling is insane, i got only 1 purple skin after open 18 boxes, king of gaccha"
11635,"This has to be the worst game I've ever played.
For $20 you get:
Garbage combat system: either you stunlock them or you get stunlocked.
Terrible balancing among characters
The longer you play the more of an advantage you have with skills
Sound design is atrocious, even with 7.1 it feels like playing on mono trying to figure out where the other players are. 
Footsteps are so god damn loud you can't hear anything besides your character.
Loot system is annoying, so much shit to loot and you have to find 3 different items to unlock 3 different slots in your backpack multiple times.
Grappling hook is broken, literally just spam it on the person you're fighting and they cannot win.
Controls feel unresponsive so often where I am spamming F to use my ability and my character just won't do it.
Only thing this game is good for is a quick way into the ER for an aneurysm"
11636,Amazing Fighting
11637,"No LATAM/SA without any official announcement after the beta!
I cant stop thinking that was in bad faith"
11638,"The people who are writing bad reviews are a bunch of sad boy weenies. This game is great, I will say that it can get quite expensive is some aspects which we can obviously fix. The devs are good listeners and as it has just came out officially, they will listen to the player base to make it more better for everyone."
11639,"Overall I think the combat in this game is great and fun, parrying can be the only gripe. The Graphics are great and I love being able to customize my waifu.

Yes I understand and agree with some people who don't like this game uses bots in some matches, but it's only for the lower levels like bronze 4 and lower and it's really just to help not feel like you're utter trash and get decimated on by smurfs. I do agree the game should be free to play with how heavy the micro transaction store is (very similar to apex) but I am the type of person to proudly put money into game developers that put in their time and hard work.
Lastly the servers, I don't experience any latency issues (noticeably) but I do see other teammates who have the poor signal icon so I know some people might have bad latency (I am on west coast and if I don't have bad latency I'm surprised others do).

I think it's a great game for what it is and reviews are either a thumbs up if it's perfect and thumbs down if there's one thing someone doesn't like. So I feel the current reviews don't justify this game very well and I recommend just playing and learning the game yourself."
11640,"Despite all of its current shortfalls, I still think is game brings an exiting new experience to the Battle Royale genre. Its melee combat system is the first of its kind and employs the philosophy of simple to learn but hard to master. It started with the simplest format of ""rocks scissors paper"", where Common Attach, Focus Strikes and Counterstrikes would form the zero-sum combat system. If you are good at predicting your opponent's moves and intentions, you will have an easy upper hand. Yet, there was also a lot of depth to this game as I clocks in more game time. You can customise characters, skills and talents to complement you or your team's unique play style.

I must admit that I am one of those new players who are getting owned by some of the more experienced players who previously played in the China region (since they had a month of lead). But, the frustration ends pretty soon once I was able to get a good grasp of the game, and grow my skills as I observe how some of the good players play. As you rank up, the number of bots will eventually disappear, and by that point, every fight is as exciting as the previous one. Sometimes you have to fight through herds of other players in the span of 10 minutes, and by the end of it you would feel like you have indeed achieved something great.

The only thing I feel like it's missing right now, is a server in Oceania that takes care of players like me in the Southern Hemisphere. I don't really like the fact that I have to play against players with sub 20ms pings with 120ms pings."
11641,lag
11642,"game came out yesterday and I'm already 13 hours in, very good BR."
11643,"Fun game, hitstun needs to not be so intense"
11644,good game
11645,"This game definitely surprised me. I went in expecting a stereotypical cheap western game because of the mixed reviews but was genuinely surprised that this was a good game.

First let me debunk two things I've been seeing because the reviews are not giving it the justice it needs.

1. Every person who wrote a review saying that they're getting bot lobbies just didn't get past their 3rd or 
    4th game. Its normal for a game to throw you in with bots on your first few games. After level 6-7 I started 
    seeing actual players. 

2. ""The skins are expensive/gold costs too much"" Gold is literately a currency only used for skins, it literately 
    does not affect game play at all. If you're making reviews based on skins instead of the content you 
    should rethink your reviews. The currency that does effect game play (through talents or that other thing) 
    is only able to be gained through quests, achievements, or just playing the game. This game is not p2w at 
    all.

With both of those things out of the way, I'll talk about the game itself

Pros:
-  Nice and unique arsenal of characters
-  Really deep facial customization of your characters
-  Combat is tactical, spamming left click will not get you anywhere in player lobbies
-  You can literately be spider-man (Movement is really versatile) 
-  Customization of characters goes beyond cosmetics and actually let you choose variations of their abilities
-  Game looks really really nice.

Cons: 
-  Game can drop frames when there's a lot of entities (items, players, loot)
-  The game looks nice but you realistically need to decrease the quality to get a reasonable frame rate
-  Game can get repetitive as it only has 3 modes 
-  The servers are targeted towards the west which is expected but would be nice for the east to see some 
    more attention

Overall this is definitely a buy, the reviews on steam don't give it justice. The combat is fluid and characters are super fun to play around with. This game is definitely better with friends and the only thing I would like to see added is some more modes."
11646,"It's like if you removed all the fortnite bs like building, mixed Assassin's Creed climbing when it was good, dynasty warriors, sekiro, and just cause 3 for a battle royale that is really fun. It really allows you to play in many ways, stealthy, strong, quick. Great game!"
11647,Very unique Melee Battle Royal that has a lot of complexity in the combos and characters.
11648,pog
11649,"A game that I have been waiting for a long time, I have tried both the closed beta and the Open beta and I can say that as a game it is really worth it because it is not the usual Battle Royal shoots all boring and repetitive as many, but a battle royal where the player's skills stand out with hard and satisfying melee fights. Many negative reviews start from the fact that there are no servers and the ping is high but it is not a good reason to judge this game, at launch, a bad game .. indeed I would recommend it to anyone. I hope that the developers can fix these small gaps and that the game grows big and thrives with people playing it <3"
11650,"very cool game glad i added it to my collection. been playing it each day since launch, i have become addicted. this game for me has been the best surprise hit game of the year so far, it is superb. and i know its only going to get better and better."
11651,it is pretty fun
11652,"Ignore the haters, this game is super fun and easily worth the purchase.
There is no pay to win. Store is purely cosmetic.
Game Modes: BR Solo, BR Team, and Bloothbath (FFA)
Leveling with Talents too."
11653,The game is a lot of fun. I started playing today and just haven't been able to stop playing. It's different from all the shooter battle royale and is a breath of fresh air within the genre.
11654,"First let’s talk about the issues, the combat is kind of janky I would like to see it get tuned up a bit and focus on transitions and smoother interactions when in a scrapping heated battle for my dear life but on the other hand it feels great when the clunky jerk in motion doesn’t happen.I’m having a blast with this game and believe that it has potential also the devs need to make sure that they listen to community feedback on this one.People crying about micro transactions in battle passes understand me When I say I feel you. Period.These practices aren’t going to go away anytime soon because you keep buying into them. Change starts with the change in your whale sized pockets fam.Pros to this game would be that we get a healthy dose of crouching Tiger hidden Dragon with a twist of pubg and BDO graphics…The game has soulless demon husks aka bots that are dumber than the reason we buy car Insurance and that mabe a problem for some right now but I doubt that will be a problem later if the game continues to grow and dev listen hopefully. Decent game I’ll give it a strong 7.5 out of 10 just because the launch was smooth and the marital artist in my heart loves the thrill I get from running into actual players thinking I’m some husk when really I’m one of many heroes looking for that bounty on your head. Anyone who read this whole review I hope and wish you good fortune and a long healthy life.Peace."
11655,"can you play this game if you are not Chinese?????

Answer: ok I hav to go eat now thankyfou forr ereAD review."
11656,una maravilla filo da puta
11657,so much fun! if you can get past the initial skill gap or certain techniques you can take the combat to places no other BR games has taken it
11658,I like this game.
11659,"Fun game, try it before you knock on it if you like brawling combat."
11660,I'm not good but I'm having a good time.
11661,"lets put my review on this game, 
after reading some other reviews, 
the stuff in this game paid is honestly optional, so no idea why ppl against it, 
bots at beginning is always good,, to learn even very basic and confidence
next i like how ppl review games not managing even 1 hour or 2 hour mark of game, 
the game needs lots of improvement but having fun so far,
the paid to play will reduce the amount of people, so in future the f2p might be implemented, still even without it 20 usd aint much to begin with ::D"
11662,"Very fun game, high skill cap. The gameplay can feel clunky at the start but after a few hours you learn how to combo and outplay people. Many of the people giving negative reviews just have not spent the required amount of time to learn the combat and movement system properly.  The game also has much more potential beyond being a battle royale game."
11663,"A breath of fresh air to the BR genre, absolute fun time"
11664,nice
11665,GOOD GAME
11666,hard
11667,Great game but i never got my currency from the ultimate edition ....
11668,"The first few matches are bot filled and you will feel really good about yourself. Not to worry after a few of those you will be brought back to reality and put in your place on where your combat skills really stand. 

-Fast paced action combat
-Stunning graphics
-Smooth animations
-Character creator
-Loads of skins
-Quick to earn loot boxes (seriously I have like 4 hours and have earned at least 10 of them and got an epic skin)
-Match queue is fast
-Cool items to find in matches
-Optional Battle Pass w/ free basic tier and paid premium tier (just like every single other battle royale)

Giving this one a yes! Love it. It's going in my main rotation of games I play.
"
11669,"Played it during every Beta Test and played it again with the same mates today for nearly 9hours!

I can understand our Oceanic Naraka Fans and their frustration that there is no Server for them to play on with a good Ping....

But back to the review:

Pros: 
-Great Movement and Combatsystem
-Good Mapdesign with a lot of verticality to use that great Movement
-7 Heroes to choose from - each with their unique abilities
-good amount of melee and ranged Weapons to choose from with a very good balance (that whats all the Beta pain was good for!!)
-amazing Devteam that is very vocal about their ideas and communicates a lot with the playerbase
-absolutely amazing Community with great Content Creators!
-Intense Character Customization
-being abtle to share your Custom Character with the whole community via QR Code

Cons:
-performance issues for some users, can render the game unplayable. has been improved since beta, but it can still ruin the fun.
-you can spend a lot of money on all those great looking skins if you are not careful!

neutral: 
-Battelpass from Day 1
-free part of the BP has a lot of stuff to get simply by playing the game without spending a dime
-normal Pass will set you back a little bit over 9€ and will return the entire real money currency when you reach its maxlevel of 110.
-it goes on afterwards infinitely until the season ends, rewarding you with ressources to get some good cosmetics.


All in all, Naraka: Bladepoint gets a 9/10 from me. I love it and i enjoy it even more with some good friends!
I hope they fix the issues some people are having and i ""pray"" for all the oceanic Users out there, that they will add Oceanic Servers!

Give it a try - there is a 50% chance that you won´t regret / refund it! ;)"
11670,I played a lot in beta and I still enjoy it even now. My deciding factor for refunding is the battle pass. The fact that I still need to top up to unlock the next battle pass assuming I completed it after spending so many hours on it is so infuriating.
11671,yes
11672,"Nice
"
11673,No OCE servers as of playing yesterday so pings sit around 100 for Aussies and Kiwis. In a fighting game where reaction times matter that can be a bit of a pain.
11674,"It is not worthy to buy it. Hot garbage as some might say.
Game is a melee oriented battle-royale, set in Chinese culture. Just because combat is mostly focused on melee weapons, you still have a few ranged options to chose from as well. If you die, you die because you can't play melee (you won't get sniped by Hanzo or Widowmaker from 300m just because someone plays sniper rifles for 9000h in FPS). Game is not easy, and somewhat foggy about ""what should i do, to not die to some Korean player with spear?"". There are a few tutorials in-game, but they are pretty...basic. Enough to play against bots, but not enough to play against players. All weapons have their own combos; every character have their own skills (some are straight useless in most cases but generally everything is playabe).

[list][b]I'll try to summarize pros and cons in easy form:[/b]
[*]There are quite a lot of people on every server, so it shouldn't be a problem to find ranked game (unless you play when gamers amount is decreasing, then queue time is getting noticeably longer);
[*]Game has nice but repetative vibe - graphics, sounds, multi-language dubbing lines, animations;
[*]Games are not that long - i think they end at around 25th minute at most;
[*]There are some waifu and rule34 materials *wink*;
[*]There is build-in voice chat in-game (on top of normal text chat);
[*]You can play with up to 2 friends (since lobby is capped at 3 players);
[*]There are few game modes on top of ""normal"" game.
[*]You should use SSD drive to play, HDD will make your game freeze quite often and it is crucial to be freeze-less to stay alive;
[*]Battle pass costs almost as much as base game. It offers both free and paid tiers of course, but you probably experienced in other games that difference between free and paid is visible (but free to play games like Narka has to make money too, right?);
[*]There are quite a lot of quests. Daily/weekly/seasonal/character specific (not like this is bad by itself, but you almost exclusively gain in-game currency from quests, you can't grind them by just playing (this is to slow progress of gaining skins and push you to paying with real money for them));
[*]You'll open chests rather rarely. This is bad because your customization progress will be slow if you won't invest real money in gambling boxes and feeling of ""expanding wardrobe"" is non-existant (comparing to Overwatch where you get chest every account level or after doing some quests. Here you get chests from battlepass, character quests (so like 2-3 per character) and you can buy them with hard cap 4/week.
[*]Game is made on Unity Engine, and has its own anti-cheat (that is kinda garbage, game is flooded with cheaters & script/macro users);
[*]Game is [u]not[/u] pay-to-win, you can upgrade weapons ONLY in-match with lootable glyphs (everybody can do that and it is part of gameplay);
[*]There is no crafting system but it does have lootboxes with skins (a bit like Overwatch);
[*]Skins are quite expensive for ""free to play"" players (the most expensive costs 98000 silk and i have like 30k after 70h in-game) so your best bet is to get them from chest (not every skin is ""chestable"", some are exclusive to battle pass or promo codes (#gambling));
[*]To change nickname in-game, you need to pay with paid or grindable currency.
[*]Game is absolutely the purest form of tryharding that exists. Recommended only for players that enjoy sweatin' to the limits. It is fun when you are good, but it will take time to get to that level if you don't have background in frame-perfect games like Tekken.[/list]

[i]*note* Battlepass costs either 1360 or 4360 gold. All premium tiers (if you unlock them) will give you only 1280 gold back. So here goes your money - you either buy more to sustain battle pass for few seasons, or be forced to buy some gold every 3 months.[/i]
[list]Gold packages available in store:
[*]240G - $1,85
[*]1200G - $9,25
[*]3000G - $23,15 (+1 lootbox)
[*]6000G - $46,25 (+3 lootbox)
[*]12000G - $92,5 (+10 lootbox)[/list]

Only thing that hurts me personally about this game is cashgrabs and gambling taken straight from mobile games on top of paying $20 for game (that is far from perfect). Battle pass, gambling boxes, paid exclusive skins and maybe more in the future.

Don't buy it - it is a hot garbage, and Twitch audience is already dying in EU/NA. I doubt this game will bloom but might wither for few years being populated by pros who can't play other games, and cheaters. Don't make same mistake as i did.
But if you think this is suitable enviroment for you, you can use my reference code in-game: chdkdkxqhr"
11675,"i got it for the extra stuff they give then i refunded it so in the future when it will be free i will get free deluxe stuff and more so ya see ya in 8 month when it will be free to play
"
11676,"UPDATE: While I still feel that the core gameplay is fun and exciting, this game, in its current state, is effectively dead.- You may notice that the average player base for this game is around 50k to 150k according to steam, but don't let those numbers fool you. The majority of people who are still playing this game are all Mainland Chinese players using a VPN.

It can take minutes to find a proper match, and when you do, the lobby is filled with Chinese players. It's difficult to play with them simply due to a language barrier, and difficult to play against them because they either have an advantage due to ping differences or using hacks to cheat, or both.

This game could have been a huge contender as a Twitch.TV eSport and as a battle royale, but devs dropped the ball by not listening to their English-speaking players. Look at the viewership on Twitch. Look at the views on recent videos on the official YouTube channel. They're absolutely abysmal. 

At this point, the English localization team is just wasting time and money on English translations and having a social media presence for no reason.

It has so much potential and the devs squandered it. I didn't listen to all the naysayers back then but this game ended up being just a cash grab for 24 Entertainment/Netease after all.  What a damn shame.

---
Original review: This game is a very unique take on a battle royale. The martial-arts fantasy theme is very much appreciated here, and while I do have gripes with some of the design choices they went with, such as the whole ""Blood Ripper"" weapon type that seems a bit too extreme for the game's theme, everything else looks visually appealing.

The actual gameplay, in my opinion, feels excellent as it feels like a mix between Sekiro and God of War (The PS4 reboot). While it starts off as a simple rock-paper-scissors style of balance, I quickly learned that there was many different ways to play your opponent, from using unique weapon styles or attacking from different angles using the grappling hook. While there are some combos and abilities that are hard to deal with, there's always some gap in between attacks and combos that give you some room to escape or counter-attack (unless you're going up against players that have the Blood Ripper weapon, then you're pretty much just screwed.)

The biggest issue with the game is the early game bots that are used to fill many of the early matches of the game. I understand why the devs have included bots for new players to get used to the gameplay instead of being throw towards players that are more experienced, but westerners aren't used to having to deal with so many bots and it feels a bit misleading to not disclose this detail to new players so as not to subvert their expectations. I would personally prefer that the bots be removed or at least heavily reduced instead, because I believe that experience is the best way to learn the combat of Naraka. Sure, some players might get frustrated against experienced players or even quit, but that just separates the strong from the weak.

Overall, I think Naraka is a pretty good game and I can't wait to see where it will go from here."
11677,"Its okay, most of the time I just find myself grappling around the damn map, My Ping keeps dropping for some reason, not sure if its me or the servers. The fighting is a bit janky, everything just feels forced."
11678,"If you hesitate, you will lose, decisively, you will give it in vain.
犹豫就会败北 果断就会白给

Can only beat Bot
- 只能打人机"
11679,"Naraka is a very hard-core battle royale game, its full of of bugs, hackers, technical issues, ping abusers and so much more bull that I despise with great intensity. I get my ass handed to me on a daily by good players and ping abusers, broken jades that make it impossible to fight and ultimate (like stupid giant baby man) that flip any fight you might have won on its head. I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy 

Yet I love this game so much

10/10 would recommend"
11680,This can be the best BR game i have ever played so far. Martial arts and far east environment+musics and character design+BR= Perfection. for me at least. There are some flaws but they can be patch easily.
11681,VERY FUN GAME. ADDICTED TO IT
11682,fun mobility and a variety of weapons
11683,perfect its dream Kung fu china movie !
11684,"It may be chinese spyware but hey, big titty anime girls"
11685,Attack on Titan meets Martial Arts Fortnite.
11686,"Played nearly 5 hrs at time of writing.
Game is a lot of fun, playing from NA hasn't had much issue with server lag, it has been a rarity.
Combat is fun and fluid,each weapon feels different.

Definitely worth the mere $20 you pay.
Unlocks are done a variety of ways,from lootboxes to in game currency both.
Lootboxes are given to you fairly often for different milestones, and its all cosmetic anyway.

Glyph system lets you unlock and build a bit more your way and is a nice touch.

For a 20 dollar game, its a ton of fun and I don't really see why ppl are throwing such a fit."
11687,i would recommend this game i love it just needs Oceanic Servers without them this games ping is at 120-200 dependant on the time of day need server upgrades for player capacity cause i think we are overloading the servers making connection worse put more money into servers please otherwise this game might die

11689,"Yessir I'm having fun, been a minute since the last BR i really enjoyed. Keep going!!"
11690,DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE DOPE
11691,"Poorly optimized
Crashes and stuttering are frequent"
11692,"Massive EDIT: After throwing myself into playing, learning the tips and tricks, and moving up a little in ranks, I've found great joy in my 100 and something hours playing the game. 

Disagreements:      I'll have to say, some people say the movement is bad, clunky, that it's too hard to play or learn, or there is not enough payout in general. I stand on the other side of the fence to say that is incorrect. Once you get things down, fights are exciting. lol. I haven't been excited in a game for a long time, like, heated excited when massive fights break out and people are flying everyone. XD 

Agreements:     Chinese (I apologize in advance, though the truth) need to stay on their server. The high ping is a disruption to NA players and can ultimately turn away a lot of players. Not due to the game being too hard or can't learn, but really the issue in lag where you can even parry on time, and the other person saw nothing and was able to rock your world. It's a situation that I believe will be the downfall for Naraka if they do not fix this asap since it has turned away some of the audience for NA already.

Final Thoughts : The game is great, I love it and will continue to get better and be a Chinese player killer. lol.  A few things to note though, are there is ranking, quickplay, and a Bloodbath mode when you reach level 10.
DO. NOT. SLEEP. ON. Bloodbath mode, nor training. 
Bloodbath is a 8 man fight to the death with fast raises so you are in and out of the fight and get solid practice.
Training is a EXCELLENT way to learn the items in game, use them and get a understanding of them, and even have a advanced bot you can fight that will do a few tricks players will use so you can adapt better in situations. 

P.S. Don't button mash....You will get parried. XD

"
11693,This game is super fun. You'll fight a lot of bots at the start while you're learning how to play. I'd like to see less bots but its not game breaking. Most of the negative reviews have little to do with the game itself and more to do with servers/business decisions. Its a $20 game with loot boxes and a cosmetic cash shop. If that bothers you then this game isn't for you.
11694,"Ive only had the time to play some casual and a round of Ranked, but wow im impressed. Ive had an eye on this game for a few months and im glad I pulled the trigger on buying it. Ive drifted from BR's but this is almost so different than others. Id say if youve enjoyed games like For Honor or Mortal Kombat then id just about say you wont regret picking this game up. I see myself continuing with this for a long while, heres to hoping it gets the credit it deserves and is continually updated and cared for!"
11695,Alteast one BR that gives you solo queue.
11696,"I believe this should be a free to play game. My experience was enjoyable for the 45 minutes i spent playing, as i got accustomed to the movement and combat system in my first match. The combat feels like it has weight behind each hit. The range weapons are creative and fun to use. However, I did not enjoy my first and only SOLO match due to the server being filled with mostly unintelligent bots that would just stand there meaningless doing nothing as I hit them. I think I only ran across 4 other human players before ending the match with a win with 10 kills. I felt cheated from my experience especially when there was 60k players online playing this game at that time. It should have been full with other human players.

Another issue I have with the game is the DLC and micro-transactions on launch day as others have pointed out. The premium battle pass version costing $10 more than the base game. Then on top of that all the skins are ridiculously expensive and the fact that you can't afford the next battle pass premium from the 16x80 Gold earned from the current battle pass.

If this were to go free to play i would revisit and recommend playing. Otherwise please avoid spending the $19.99"
11697,"If the game was $60, I feel like it should be slightly more polished. But for $20?! Best money I've ever spent!!!"
11698,its lagging so bad i have nvidia 1070 8 gb all drivers set still lagging ..
11699,"Played the beta, Love this game so far cant wait to see its future!"
11700,"Liked the beta, even better on release. Outside of trios where you get 0 to death, perma ccd. Most games top 3 are always chinese names even on local rankings which feels pretty odd.
"
11701,"It's pretty fun even I'm playing alone, no friends. Recommended for who likes this type of games, but if it have like more dash for follow the enemy would be more cool."
11702,very janky animations
11703,Fun ninja game try it out now
11704,"Pretty good BR and there is a deathmatch mode. I like the melee combat mixed with the parkour skills. It doesn't seem to difficult either even though the combat can be wild. There are infinite unlocks so if you like the carrot on the stick, this will keep you busy for a while."
11705,*will review later* All the haters can suck a fuck
11706,"I'll say this: I love this game. I genuinely do. It's got fairly agreeable production values, nice graphics with lots of settings (DLSS!), a really cool map with tons of verticality and a plethora of movement options built around double jumps, slides, evades and grappling hooks.

There's a great tutorial that makes it seem almost campaign'esque, a battle royale mode, and a deathmatch mode (which I hate because I suck at).

What Naraka is trying to do is make a Battle Royale out of a Nioh-like game. You have a main ability, a sort of ultimate and 2 weapons (i.e. a katana and a bow) which are your main tools of dispatching enemies. 

There are 7 characters as of this writing with a plethora of upgrade and customization options. You can make these characters look and to a certain extent play like just about anything. You'll be surprised what you can do. That said, this is where I have to put a big fat BUT:

The monetization in this game is almost 1:1 a copy of Apex: Legends. You have a season pass and pay-for loot boxes that will randomly give you skins for your weapons and character. If you are cool with that in a game that costs the equivalent of 20 bucks, you should get it.
If that's a deal breaker for you -- and rightfully so! -- you should stay away.

Also, while not Early Access, it's still [i]early[/i], so there's some jank. Nothing too wild, but don't expect the triple A polish we've come to expect from these types of games in recent years. 

I think if you can look past that, it's going to be great daily grind, as the game is almost desperate to keep you busy with quests and bounties."
11707,"I originally gave it a positive review but since have changed to negative. I will still play the game for couple more weeks to see if anything will change.

- NA and EU have only 1 server each which leads to high ping for a lot of people. My ping is 80ms which is  really bad.
- Playerbase in NA and EU is extremely low. Most people are from CN region, and few English names there are, are always the same since like I said, low playerbase.
- Movement is a chore since you have to keep pushing multiple buttons to travel efficiently, rather than just sprinting and grappling.
- Animation cancels are a chore.
- While the first few days it feels like you are getting a lot of goodies, then you will stop receiving anything pretty much. Devs keep adding mostly the cash loot boxes gacha style.
- Updates are really small and slow for a new game.

POSITIVES:
- gameplay has potential
- graphics are nice
- has multiple game modes
- has ranked system from release
- characters look nice"
11708,The game is amazing and the combat and theCustomizations of the game as well u can level up your perks if u love fast combat this game is for u

11716,You are forced to play this game for 2-4 hours against Bots before you play against actual players. It is beyond boring.
11717,"Yes, It is a Battle Royale.

BUT...
 
unique feeling, unique mechanics and i just love the gameplay in general.
There are some long loading times (a few seconds to load all textures, etc.) when you get to the Main menu or load into a game at the start but its no that big of a deal.

If you like Battle Royales, fast paced combat, quick thinking, and comboing opponents into oblivion this is the right game for you."
11718,So first of all it is not your average BR. Yes there is guns but it is the melee combat that is the heart of Naraka: Bladepoint.  You could try and just use guns but with the speed of characters and the grappling hook they will just rush you can kill you. I have played since the first NA playtest and feel in love instantly. It takes some time to learn but is rewarding if you take the time to do it. Different combos and when to use your skills. Another thing is that the character customization is amazing. You wanna make it look like you go for it....want to make it look like Jason Momoa do it.  You don't have time to get to indetailed with the creator. Well they have a smart editor where you can use a picture and let the computer do most the work for you.  The con is some players from other regions kinda delete you because of input lag of some kind.
11719,"I've played the beta for over 80 hours, It's a fun and polished game! I've been very excited for the official release,  and was prepared to pay for the battle pass despite already paying $20 which is already a blow to my faith, but one I was willing to forgive just this once. HOWEVER! To buy the battle pass you need to make 2 separate purchases just to get enough Gold for it. On top of that, if you were to unlock all the rewards in the battle pass, it doesn't even earn you enough gold to afford the next battle pass! Making you spend money every couple of months if you don't want to miss out on all the cool content behind a paywall. 

It all just feels too greedy to me. If they don't change something by the next week I'll have to get a refund. Which I really really don't want to do! I want to play this game for years to come! But it reeks too much of greed in its current state!"
11720,"This game was very disappointing, I do not recommend this for anyone, but if you like a lot of lags, bugs and freezes then hop in,  also there is very good Boobs physics so that's a plus... ... .. .. but save your money.. 
thank you hope it helps"
11721,xd
11722,"The game runs very Laggy. The player models don't load in at times and plus sometimes you would spawn in a tree and would not be able to move the whole match. the U.I. is very buggy with items would be gone out of no-where. I would spawn in a tree many times and would not be able to move the whole game. I would have to leave many times to get into this game at all. I would have times where I couldn't even be able to pick a player for the match. what is this game at all? I played the beta test they did back then and even that was way better then this full game. THE BETA WAS IN A BETTER STATE THEN THIS FULL GAME WTF???!!! I want to love this game, I really do. I played the Beta and i really liked it, but if this is the end product then i wouldn't tell people buy this at all. My hopes are that they fix this game ASAP or this game will be dead in in less then a year."

Avoid if you have any sanity"
11727,The game is awesome
11728,"-I love it, I played the beta and didn't know it was going to be so fun! You can die just as fast as any battle royale but I love all of the RPG elements of it too. 
-Each character has a few different skills and each of those can be slightly altered to fit your play style. Example: My favorite character can go invisible, well if you want her to, her skill can also make your party go invisible I believe for a shorter period of time.
-Lots of different weapon sets with their own speed/damage/move sets and you can level up each one to unlock new things.
-Parrying is fun but difficult to always get the timing for, for me at the moment anyways because I haven't practiced enough
-Plenty of microtransactions for skins and to unlock glyphs for your skills? But you can also earn those pretty easily."
11729,"This game has been built up to be a free to play game and has been riddled with the money grabbing tacts the F2P use these days.
Wait until this game inevitably becomes F2P, then it'll be fine."
11730,"Very rarely do i write a review, but this game is worth it. So refreshing to not have to play the same tired gun based BR games over and over again!"
11731,"Great game. Do not listen to people all screaming about how it should be free. Free comes with problems. 

Most of the negative reviews are undeserved and just misinformation. 

Solid combat. Solid game flow. Great cosmetics and character customization.  

Game has a smart character customization feature that lets you upload your facial features from a picture."

They offered servers in beta that were shut down after launch, they didn't had the balls to announce that.
We had to discover when logging in.

And the storm is a dragon... and apparently there's a small chance you get to fight and kill the PvE dragon boss if your team wins, for specific dragon unlocks... so far its pretty amazing. No complaints."
11739,"This is a really greedy game that I just cannot recommend.
But before getting into the bad I will give you the good stuff!

The good!
1. the gameplay!
They have done the fighting system quite well. I still enjoy combat when everything works fine!!
aaaaaaaaand thats it

The bad!!!

1. this game functions as a free to play (F2P) but you have to buy it. What I mean with this is the fact that this game wants you to spend money on things like a battle pass or in game money so you can get all that ""good stuff"" like skins and customization options. Oh and it also have loot boxes, which is only there to entize you to the gamblingmechanic that it is.

2. connectoin issues... I normally don't have any problems when it comes to online games e.g apex legends works fine. however when I do have lag in apex legends I know I have generall conection issues but in this game it's a godsend when the game actually decides to work perfectly fine, Alot of times I have spawned at towns to get loot just to be absolutely slammed before the buildings even rendered properly (which could easily be fixed if they just had a countdown after spawning everyone instead of just sending everyone into a frenzy).

3. AI opponents, these are only here to make you feel like a god the first hours (I got 16 kills my first game which is almost a third of the players.....) so that you will overscride the return policy time and be stuck with the game. which would be fine if everything worked properly but as it is now when you face real players you can easily be decimated after playing against the worthless bots.

4. The game also insists on throwing commercial for the game every time I try to close it, this is something you can turn off... but only for the day. So I hope you won't get comfy because it will be back tomorrow and every day after that.

If this game becomes a free 2 play I will recommend it, but for even a dollar it would be too much concidering they want you to spend more money in the game. 
"
11740,Nice game
11741,"Sometimes dull and unexciting gameplay. First games goes with 15 kills and 1st place enemies feels like they are bots and they actually are. Right now it is lacking of something. Maybe I don't like the combat design. It could be something more similar like Nioh. You don't want to start another game. Sad, I was expecting much more. Should be free to play"
11742,Super.
11743,"Really fun, unique battle royale."
11744,If ur not playing competitive it is pretty fun but when it comes to competitive it is pretty unbalanced because of new hero and spear combo.
11745,game is shit
11746,"[b]7/10[/b] 
[b][i]""Features as many different monetization-systems as characters.""[/i][/b]
Naraka: Bladepoint mixes martial arts á la Tiger & Dragon with Battle Royale. Looks good ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/weeddrunken/screenshots/?appid=1203220&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall]screens[/url]), is very optimized, also features DLSS, delivers a pretty fluid and solid gameplay experience in general, besides the fact of the poor ai you encounter in the beginning. And the only downside of Naraka is simply the totally unnecessary monetization model, for really lots of very expensive cosmetics you might will want. So Naraka features only one map, [i]but[/i] has three different buy options, payable DLCs as well as an additional ingame store with three currencies, two additional battlepass price options, and last but least yes there'S also a loot box system on top. So people think twice before you give 'em another dime! And instead simply play the game, you hopefully paid the lowest amount possible. Because for that, it's a really really fun arcade fighting hack'n'slash BR title. 
[b][i] [u]Verdict:[/u] Buy only the standard edition and you'll be fine.[/i][/b]"
11747,Had a lot of fun playing this in beta with my friends.  Only one day into the launch and we can't stay away.  A really cool take on the battle royale genre.  Hoping people are willing to take a chance on it.  Well worth the price.
11748,gank banged
11749,"General speaking, the gameplay and the game itself is very fun.
But what bothers me about dev's and games they make, is that they sell their game for 20+ bucks and still charge players for loot boxes, battle passes and skins overall. Another thing making me kinda suspicious is, that you pay 15 more bucks for the deluxe edition of this game to get skins and 10 lootboxes - only to let the game tell you, you can't open these lootboxes you just bought if you played 2 or more hours, which is the time threshhold to refund games on steam. So, smart but a really, really bad move by the dev's. People pay almost double price for some content they cant obtain, unless they decide to keep their game. 

Furthermore, the servers could use some serious work and the weak bots are annoying, there are enough players that play the game, why add bots?

Hoping for some change in the microtransactions, make them easier to obtain or let the game be Free to Play. Win - Win. Otherwise the playerbase will drop.

PLUS: Theres a missing option to change the beard color of your characters, which also bothers me a lot. You can change the hair color, but not the beard color to the same one. Please change that little detail, its really weird."
11750,"Beautiful game, fun to play with friends. Lots of customization for your characters.

-edit-

Still playing, love the game. Nothing beats the movement. It's not perfect, I think balance could be better. I think non-china events/PR/communication could be better. Netcode and latency and 'optimizations' could be better. But I'm addicted to the grapples, movement, and rich combat. Love the game, love the community.

-edit- 2022

Yeah, player base dwindling and it seems the only effort in NA/EU is to sponsor streamers to play the game. I got scammed when I redeemed items I purchased for what was basically 4 event lootboxes, got nothing in return, when I reached out to customer support the first response was a poorly translated sentence telling me to look at the odds for drops on their website. 2nd time I got a better more thought out customer service response telling me that the issue was forwarded to a technical team. Some time later the ticket was simply closed with no explanation.

Game's combat is incredibly unique but every 'optimization' patch seems to bring issues, reporting teamers and hackers is difficult, Game had strong community at launch but there wasn't much effort or at least attention to any market that isn't CN."
11751,"The actual gameplay is really good, would prefer region locking though."
11752,Hard game after you get past the bot games. Feels good when you outplay someone 1v1 or 1vX
11753,"Too easy.
New player difficulty gets boosted incredibly high to give you a better experience as a new player.

11759,"[h1] An Ultimately 'Okay' Experience [/h1]

[b] Quick review: [/b] Melee Fortnite is fun but lacks the depth and polish for extended play. Combat feels good at first but you can tell there in not a depth there to keep it exciting. Animations and movement can feel unpolished, though character models and pieces of the animations do look nice..

[b] Combat [/b]: The key component of the game is this and it's okay. You can use a grappling hook to fly at enemies and vary up your combat options. Basic attacks and charge attacks feel decent and look okay. You can get items that also give you special abilities for weapons like lifesteal or special attacks. You can counter. You can 'clash' by both attacking at the same time. This sounds like there is a lot of depth but in practice parry doesn't work too well if the enemy simply continues to attack. They can just hit you after you parry many times. Different weapon types are fun but ultimately you just take your best ranked drop and use it. Ranged weapons are there and have some use but melee is clearly the focus. Using special character skills and more is fairly fun..but ultimately combat can feel like you either dominate or get dominated by a bunch of juggling/skills/ getting dog piled. It is fun! but I feel the meta will be found out quickly and that there is not enough counterplay to give this the depth it needs if it wants to be as melee focused as it is. 

[b] The Fortnite appeal [/b]: This tries to have that whole run around and collect things deal that Fornite does. It's sort of cool to grapple hook around. It's sort of cool to find things like passive buffs, weapons and armor. Yet without the construction aspect that Fortnite has, the roaming starts to get boring. You end up with very little to collect and there are not many events to really draw your attention elsewhere. Bonus quests are very odd. Requiring you to do odd things like hiding in a bush for 20 seconds or using an emote twice. Basically the combat is fun, the fornite aspect of running about and waiting for your area to shrink is not so much so. I think this game would be better if you could choose a basic loadout and fight it out. 

[b] Lootboxes, currencies and yeah: [/b]  So there are multiple currencies, skins, and such. I do not think there is pay to win stuff. Though there is a glyph system which basically gives you little bonuses like +5% less energy consumed on dodge. I am unsure how big such things can get. I do not know if money can translate into these. Otherwise the rewards are cosmetics but many of the cosmetics are lousy palette swaps. You can get accessories to strap onto your character, like cat ears. You can get weapon cosmetics and emotes. Very much like overwatch/fortnite. However there are not many appealing things to get and the limited, though customization for them is possible which is neat, heroes don't really make me want to spend money here. There is also a battlepass. For a game I had to buy it is a bit annoying to see it throw so many ways for me to put money in already. Maybe with more heroes and modes it would be more appealing.

[b] Jank [/b]: There is that feeling of jank to this game that needs some polish. Some animations are a bit stiff. Combat feels like it could be cleaner. There is a general 'early access' feel throughout the game. One which should not be taking your money yet. If this was a beta i'd say there is a lot of potential in the idea. 

[b] Longevity...[/b]: This is my biggest concern. I do not see a lot of reasons to come back. I had fun but I uninstalled and requested a refund because it just doesn't seem like a game that will keep hooking players in. It feels like it needs more style, heroes, cleaner animations, more general polish, and such. As such I can not recommend it for the current price. 

[b] Conclusion [/b]: This should be free to get players in. Make the battlepass and other options more exciting to draw players in. With more heroes, skins, and fun things to earn this could become something good. The fornite stuff feels a bit tacked on and the least interesting piece of the game. Animations and general gameplay feels like it needs more time in the oven."
11760,"feels like an F2P game, and it should be."
11761,"The devs in the discord, and a mod ''bren'' are very quick to call any talk about region lock is racist, when all the chinese players are either 900 ping and cant be hit or are straight up hacking flying around one shotting whole lobbys in 3 mins or less, 

The community is the most toxic thing ever they encourage cheating and openly stream cheats in the discord with no recourse , I believe the cheating is a exit plan they plan on killing the game and taking the money and running, id expect this to last less time then the culling.  One of the mods is selling cheats on the side for 29 euros what ever that is , If they wont fix the game , and keep policing comments that are not positive the community will die , they seem to not care about chinese cheaters 5-10 per game and just simply dont look dont see policy"

11768,"This game is great idk why all the hate. 

Main menu looks just like fortnite tbh with ads for skins/loot crates.

What this game does different then most BR, you get a talent tree and each hero has different abilities. It does take some thought and skill if you want to get good, this game ranking system starts you off in bronze, so you can spam click and win easy, but once you go up just a little bit players who figured out the fundamentals and their character will probably slap you around real hard. 

This game also has parkour and wall running and Sekiro hook shotting which is rad. 

Lot of fun with friends.

The bots people are crying about are for PVE objectives you do during the BR, you will be able to tell who is a bot (NPC) and who is a real genuine player."
11769,"Good game overall.
A little clunky.
Bots in the first few matches (can tell the difference if you go into bloodbath mode)

11790,People are che@ting like crazy in this game. Would be fun otherwise. In probably the last match i'll play I saw someone who had 18 kills just run through the last 5 players. They had zero chance. Then I was the last to die. They auto parry and never miss. You'd think they would hide it a little better. I've seen for sure cheating about 11 times now.
11791,"A game with excellent combat system that reward skill. And amazing art and animations.
And it only costs 20$. Battlepass true but you get free rewards from it aswell. It is entirely optional to buy.
It had optimization issues in beta, but they are completely fixed on release. The game runs smooth 100+ FPS on max graphics."
11792,gg
11793,recommend to you whoever like battle royale ;)  but in oriental art style
11794,"no SA server and no explanation of any kind from the company.
not worth to buy it until SA server"
11795,This game is phenomenal and I'm looking forward to more from the Devs! Its rare to see something this great produced by a company so small
11796,more like NARAKA: BOTPOINT
11797,very fun with friends
11798,i knew i was bad but damn
11799,if you like Action games and Battle Royale games then you will love this!
11800,"Nice game , very promise"
11801,"So far a very fun experience. If you liked the beta you will like the final product. They added I think two new weapons (Dagger and Spear) which are both fun to play. Yes the first 2 or 3 matches are against bots but shortly after you get to play against other players so I don't get the problem some reviewers have. Monetization, well theres a battlepass and cosmetics, big deal, doesn't kill my fun with the game"
11802,I love this game physic. I mean boobs physic ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
11803,Nice game. Fun
11804,"it is good but so hard 
"
11805,Very fun!
11806,"As a big fan of combat-focused games such as Ninja Gaiden, God Hand and Virtua Fighter, I thought the pre-release footage and gameplay for Naraka: Bladepoint seemed promising. What I expected was something in the vein of character action or fighting games thrown into the battle royale formula; a weird mix, but I was willing to give it a try. Upon gaining hands-on experience with Naraka: Bladepoint, my preconceived notions fell flat on their face. 

This game feels like a mishmash of systems from other games, done in a far below par fashion. The ""Unchained Combat Experience"" feels as if the team behind Jake of the 99 Dragons tried their hand at making the next Devil May Cry. The grappling hook is just a gimped version of the grappling mechanic from the Tenchu series. The combat doesn't feel visceral or have much weight to it at all. The attack animations are extremely awkward, and the overall experience with Naraka's combat system will more than likely leave you feeling bleh, regardless of if you win or lose. If you are used to FPS inspired battle royale games, Naraka may seem like a change of pace with deep combat to you, but if you are a fan of melee combat games, such as those listed in the first sentence of this review, stay far away from this game, it will disappoint you. 

As for the in-game transactions, I am not opposed to cosmetic purchases when done in a sensible fashion. I think that your costume of choice can help add a level of expression to your gameplay. Where Naraka takes this into absurdity is the fact that these cosmetic purchases are tied to a mobile gacha game-like system. Couple that with the fact that players have spent anywhere from $20-50 just to get into the game, and you have a recipe for a business model that can only be described as silliness. 

So, do I recommend this game, with all of its noodle-y, unsatisfying combat, bland world that looks like just about every other Wuxia-inspired movie/novel/game ever made and absurdist take on sustaining profitability? No I do not, simple as that."
11807,"The people complaining mostly have under 1.5 hours and are upset because the first few matches are mostly bots but this changes as you level up. The ping right now is also very high and causes a bit of frame rate drops but I am pretty sure this will change and get smoothed out soon. 

Overall the game is fun solo and especially with friends. Worth 20$"
11808,"Fantastic game, not P2W.  Could it be F2P because of the other revenue streams?  Yes, and it probably will be in a couple months.  OCE deserves a server.

Otherwise, it's an incredible BR game."
11809,"After falling in love with the game there came a point i couldnt overlook the issues anymore. Coming back to it again after 2 month and none of the issues have been solved. I actually cant understand what the publishers are thinking.

Edit: Again i tried to come back to the game around 7 month after its release. My rank is silver and i still cant find a game in less than 10 minutes unless i am really lucky. It jsut really sucks cause i want to play this game but i dont have the time to spend 10 minutes each to get into a game where if i play aggro i will most likely die in the first 10 minutes and then wait another 10 minutes to play another game. Please just make it free to play and let us get into matches faster its a BR so make it f2p."
11810,Will come back when dev fix it
11811,pretty good combat :)
11812,OCE nodes 👍
11813,Though still very early the fighting is simple but provides a level of complexity when it comes down to a Rochambeau and depending on skill and preparation. still have to dig deeper and play more but for not at the time I've played I am satisfied
11814,"I cant stop
"
11815,"Laggy as shit
With all those ingame purchases this game should go F2P tbh"
11816,"This game draws you in and is fun for the first few rounds against bots but the combat otherwise is just spam fest. The MTX within a paid game is an extreme red flag. Buy the game, paid battlepass, premium currency systems. Just make it free to play at that point. The game also tries to stall the actual game experience with bots for the first few rounds to get you past the 2 hour refund window. Not gonna make a huge case but the huge tipping point for me was after I closed the game it refused to actually close within steam and the executable was not in the task manager whatsoever and the only way to close it was to close steam entirely which inflated play time. 


https://youtu.be/6OrzmSAB8HA"
11817,"Overall great game. If you are looking for a sick new mostly melee focused battle royale. This game is it.
The combat is unique, maybe a bit difficult to understand but once you get the hang of it it's really fun. It's kinda like a rock paper siccors mechanism where one type of attack beats the other so you'll have to adapt to how your enemy is playing which is cool.

Using ranged weapons is very difficult in my opinion since there's no aim assist and targets are moving very fast with a really small hitbox. I don't find this a big problem however since I like the melee combat the most anyways.

Parkouring in this game is sick, reminds me of parkour in games like dying light. You can use every single log or beam to your advantage and in combination with the grapple hook, this can make for some really sick and fast paced gameplay while escaping or running for the fog for instance.

The one con for me atm:
One hero ability seems super unbalanced to me, once I run into her it's game over. But at the time of me writing this review the game hasn't even been out a day, so I'm hoping and assuming they'll nerf and buff abilities wherever necesary along the way

Also, I strongly recommend you download this game on SSD instead of HDD, since HDD will give you some extreme stutters especially in trios."
11818,"Played three games, won all three. Filled to the brim with bots and the victory does not feel earned one bit... I like the game, but give me a lobby filled with players not bots. I want to be challenged, not treated like I am disabled."
11819,.
11820,"Pretty good game only major problem is servers and for your firs two or three matches youll have bots
"
11821,Fun game. Something new and fresh for Battle Royale. Clunky feeling but outweighed by the fun
11822,Amazing!
11823,"8.5/10. Really enjoy the mechanics, like using c to cancel ur charged attack and instantly parry when enemy is charging to catch them offguard. Has a lot of depth to it. Played in beta and will continue to play now."
11824,"A lot of great ideas executed poorly. Maybe someone can make a melee fighting BR work, but it ain't these guys."
11825,"TL;DR Action game with learning curve, take an hour and a half to play it and see if you like it 

I'm not particularly sure why there is so much hate. This is the kind of game I used to play as a teen, the action-pack PvP things reminiscient of S4 League and Gunz the Duel. While Netease does make me a little uneasy, the game itself is fun. Yes, they will fill the games with bots to make you think you're good. Does it mean you won't be playing with real players who will woop you silly? Nope, not at all! 

+Scenery is beautiful, and environmentally things will respond to you with your grappling hook or if you're charging into a wooden door that just gets destroyed 
+The action that a lot of BR games try to mimic but don't do very well. Its a learning curve, you have to expect to learn to adapt to something new. 
+Handful of waifu-material characters

? I'm somewhat neutral on global servers, lag can be a worry

-If you don't have an SSD you might be in for a bad time. I reinstalled the game to an SSD for better performance as the game kept suggesting me, and graphics might be too intense for the casual person. 
-The males need some work, I think only Tarka Ji is the only decent looking male character
-Small base of characters at the start, but I'm sure over time it will grow"
11826,Good
11827,Just play like an hour but really enjoy it
11828,"Its a good game, but there's already people running around with cheats using auto block which makes them almost impossible to kill and makes your weapon drop everytime you attack them.
"
11829,weeb royale goes brrrr
11830,"This is the game that everyone line battle royale,Open world should play .Better than Pubg by miles.way smoother ."
11831,"A fresh take on an extremely boring and overdone genre. 

I've played the open beta and had an enjoyable time only bogged down by some performance issues. Thankfully it seems they've ironed most of the them (while you may need to add a launch command here on steam), the performance increase and stability is very noticeable even on my old system.

Yes there are bots for the first few games to ease you into the mechanics. If you want to get your teeth kicked in real quick, just queue ranked and only ranked. The faster you climb, the faster you'll get destroyed :^)

I only play trios with randos and I've been having a lot of fun even as someone that really dislikes BRs.

If you think not being able to cancel every single move is ""clunky"", you might not like this, even if it isn't slow.
Movement system is very good and weapons have a nice feel to each of them, the animations are flashy and the fights get tense.

Using a mix of medium(majority) and low settings(volumetric fog, post processing etc), at native 1080p. I get a very smooth experience and the visuals are still decent.  (anti-aliasing SMAA on high)

no regrets, definitely worth the small price for entry."
11832,18/08/21 Thank you for OCE servers. I change it to a thumbs up LOL
11833,"Good but frustrating at the same time. I feel like i'm going to have a strong love/hate relastionship with this game, The stunlock can be very frustrating espcially with an auto aim grapple that you can spam on players to stunlock them.

I am still enjoying the game but i'm not sure how long my enjoyment will last. So far it's a 7/10 . But i can foresee a lot of balance issue going ahead.

Update 1 : So far so good . Having competent teamates really helps in this game . I mean i know it's the same in most games  but in this game where you can get stunlocked to death by multiples enemies having allies  that can read the situation and react accordingnly really helps . Defending your allies that are in trouble is worth much more than chasing after 1 guy running away especially if he's not from the same team . Keep each other alive ftw . Raising score to 7.5 with my still limited playtime."
11834,"Dont even really like BRs these days, but this one is good.

Some things are a little imba or a bit weird to control, but otherwise, great game imo."
11835,"It's a very boring Battle Royale game I ever played, the movements might be amazing, the gripping hooks and everything, but when you're fighting, there's basically no technique into it and it makes it very hard for you to aim and everything to control your movement, if you played PUBG and compared this game with that. The mechanics are dog water in this game. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who played PUBG or wants a skilled match up. I already refunded this game."
11836,good game
11837,Its a very fun game. The game is smooth. Pretty and all. Im also one the beta tester that played it before. Indeed they make it most of the glaring problem. It is less buggy now. Mm maybe almost to none. Which is cool!
11838,Still need development.
11839,Love it till now :)
11840,"Very good game, combat style is nice, gameplay superb, Ping very good 70-90 , movement is so nice, and also characters are so beautiful. but need some improve performance . need some optimize patch."
11841,Great game so far no issues with it just weird to see so many chinese players in EU servers lol
11842,Not a fan of a paid battle pass when I already paid for the game. Also not a fan of loot boxes and I have connection issues on the NA server.
11843,Best battle royale game 2021
11844,"[h1] Don't Even Bother [/h1]

Was looking forward to this game but in its current state its pretty much unplayable. [b]Imagine playing a game on a 2GB RAM laptop from the early 2000s while using Mcdonalds wifi thats run through multiple VPNs[/b]. If the game doesnt become f2p it will die within 6 months. The number one issue I have with the game is the weapon and armor tiers. If your enemy has better tiers then you then you pretty much lose the fight. Parrying doesnt work at all in the games current state so everyone just spams attacks. Also Yoto is broken af and pretty much wins every single fight if she has her ultimate. Wait for the game to become f2p because its not worth the $20."
11845,"First 5 games were bot games. Fairly easy to get into but I do recommend doing the advanced tutorial as well after doing the normal one before hopping into your first match.

Fighting feels great, abilities feels great, and booba physics is great. :)

Only negative thing so far is alot of microtransactions, but what game doesn't have that at this point amirite?

Game: 9/10
Yoto Hime booba: 10/10"
11846,"I have played both the beta and the actual game. First, dont let the comments on the servers prevent you from playing this. the vast majority of folks complaining are usually from weird regions. i live in middle america, the game runs great for me. 

 Naraka is a very fun game that, in my opinion, is a very robust character based brawler battle royale. the game also manages to make the BR formula feel fairly natural in the game world too which was surprising. the pace of play is also balanced to the point where you need to utilize a decent amount of the game systems to be successful. additionally solo, trio, and deathmatch all surprisingly seem like distinct modes with different ways to play. the characters seem distinct, and have a massive amount of customization options. combat is flowy and can be fun for both the incapable and mastery seeking pc gamer.

the biggest downside to the game is that it incorporates a lot of f2p elements for a 20 dollar game. although this entry fee seems to be standard for smaller mp games like this. there is a battle pass, its very generous on the free tier providing the currency to upgrade your runes as well as a hefty amount of customization options. i don't feel like im struggling to tier up and i dont feel too sad about not getting the paid version.  there are lootboxes, these are more frustrating as all the customization is locked behind them. no one likes loot boxes. this is actually a strike against naraka in my book. however given the generosity in other places like events, weapon progression, character progression, quests, etc. im not too worried about the loot boxes. 

over all i think the game play carries the game. its fast, fun, and there is always something to do when you drop in. the biggest drawback is the cost of entry, bad servers for some, and the f2p elements. considering this game is fairly popular overseas i am interested to see what comes next. probably a 78.5/100 for me but i could see how others would rate it lower."
11847,This game is simply BORING.透尼马个烂匹无缘无故封我号
11848,"Played a lot of beta and the game is great!
Yes you face bots at the beginning,but only for a few matches. The lobbies are mixed. After that you are going to face ONLY players.

Game has a very unique combat system
Clean and fast movement
Insane amount of character customization (even if you dont want to spend any money on it)
Definitely worth the price!

I recommend :)"
11849,Fun asf
11850,"liked
"
11851,"Much hate with no reason, this game is fun af!"
11852,"Real clunky. Should take a lesson out of similar games made over a decade ago. Gunz comes to mind. Even the original AC game had more fluid movement. Sly devs fill the first several games with bots, ensuring you don't get frustrated as you play past the refund mark. Overload of cosmetics. 90% of the menus feels like customisation options or it's giving you fractional  amounts of the varying types of 'currency' in the game. It's a chinese rip off product disguised in westernised packaging, similar to the rip off items that have 'official' looking storefronts on places like Amazon etc. The game has a ton of potential it seems but as usual, weird decision making or just plain incompetent dev team will likely spell the death of the game soon. In it's current state I would not recommend it. It's worth half the price they are putting it up for."
11853,"i think its great, combats great movement is great, theres even a mode if you need a break from getting killed first in the BR game modes. all the characters play different and have a few skills that you unlock through playing to mix up your play style a bit. nice mix of weapons and rewards to keep you going. the one thing i will say is that ive yet to play a match without a few bots in hopefully the bots come out and the game goes to full pvp."

11857,Please READ this: First few matches are strictly bots. This is intended. After a few matches you will then be matched with players and a lot of them and as you play the bots will continue to be replaced by players to the point there are none. This is how it was in the BETA's so don't stress out. Ignore the negative reviews on this topic as it's just an unfortunate first impression that is sadly not stated anywhere so I can sympathize with them as I thought the same thing in the beta and was initially really bummed. Game's a gem and i'm in love! <3
11858,seems like ppl complaining because they encounter bots too much. well that because started rank are too low. solution? http://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCLReWij1hs/maxresdefault.jpg

11862,"Best Battle Royal game every played, crisp combat and feels well polished. Though there are still a lot of rooms for improvement. But since it was published yesterday, I’d say it’s worth a try. I think most of the negative comment are complaining about lag issues. But I live in NA and I have 14 ping so there shouldn’t be any issue about lags if you live in NA"
11863,"Game will be dead in a month.

Aggressive marketing model, monetize loot-box with lots of `premium currency`, skins more expensive than fortnite. Balance team has their heads up theirs, because there are some serious balancing issues that anyone with a brain would have caught in playtesting.

Also, game runs in admin mode (for anti-cheat I assume)? Typical bad-coding from Asia-region developers and they fail to recognize the security concerns that come with having an application naturally in admin mode.

The game also runs into the same issue PUBG had early-development, where even STARTER weapons are RARE and hard to find.

Also wouldn't be surprised if cheating is already rampant with how so many people just magically run at you at the start with epic-rarity armor/weapons right off the bat when you've just barely found gray weapons and no armor.

Also, there is a gigantic amount of bots put into the game, regardless of how much you play. Barely even a PvP game, at that point.

Combat is clunky spam with very little thought."
11864,"Dis Fun, nuf sid"
11865,"good combat system, you get matched with bots the first few matches in ranked but after that it's fun and intense"

11869,GG
11870,"the game itself is good, good gameplay, good character customization but they have no respect for the players in terms of making money!
this game should be free to play, the game costs $20 but if you want premium battlepass you have to pay $10 more.
funny part of the game is gold amount and pricing, premium battlepass costs 1360 golds and in case you may want to purchase it you have to buy a $10 ( with 1200 golds) and almost $2 for (240 golds) that makes no sense.
and even if you purchase it, the battlepass golds isn't enough to get next battlepass!
they force us to buy more golds!!!
poor server quality, a lot of players have this problem (200ms ping? hello???)"

11873,"Best BR at the Moment :) 10/10 Naruto Simulator
P.S Only Low ranks you fight bots . Took me 2 games to get into the real action!"
11874,"It's a BR so you know what you're getting into. However, the melee combat is fun, lots of weapon combo options, character options, the map is fun to explore around.

Also you can climb trees. 
Like pretty much all of them.
Also spooky snek in the sky.
So, 10/10."
11875,"This game is terrible.
It's setup as a storefront with a vestigial game attached, and it shows in that little attention has been paid to creating an engaging gameplay experience. The game itself is almost entirely rng driven, with little room for intervention by the players skill or lack thereof, and the servers are global so you will be playing almost exclusively with a chinese playerbase who seems VERY unhappy to see you in their game. Combat mechanics are painfully simplistic, and they've done everything in their power to keep the characters from feeling unique or distinctive.  
There might be a fun experience in here somewhere, but I sure as hell can't find it."
11876,"For some reason another battle royale where the first few matches you play are against bots with no mention of it in game. Now, if this was a free game (which it absolutely should be considering that's practically the standard for BRs now, especially with this many microtransactions) I actually wouldn't have minded this system much. However, the main reason I'm refunding this now and why I think this bot system is aids is because I feel like once I get through the bot matches and get a chance to experience the actual game against real people, I'll be over the 2 hour limit for refunding it. 

Other than that the game in general just seems kind of all over the place with its design and flow. The combat feels more like it was designed for an action MMMORPG rather than a pvp game. The parkour is there and works pretty good but it's uses are pretty limited and it doesn't really feel like it adds anything to the game.

Lastly I'd just like to say if you still think you wanna give this a shot but you have a low-mid end system, don't let the ""recommended"" specs fool you, the game's optimization kinda blows. According to the store page, they literally recommend a 1060 for running 1080p60fps but I'm on a 1660ti, with the game on an ssd like it recommends, and I struggle to keep even a constant 45-50 fps with almost everything set to the lowest setting, so do with that what you will."
11877,"One of the better Battle Royale style games I've played, and one that instantly clicked with me.

The only negative thing I can point out is that it's buy-to-play with a battle pass AND loot boxes, but even that I'm not losing sleep over when it's all cosmetic unlocks (with plenty of loot boxes and standalone goodies to earn/buy via in-game means and free currency too!)

The positives though?

- Just enough ""skill based"" mechanics and strategies without punishing a new/lower skilled player with convoluted systems. Plenty of melee weapons to balance out the aim-based ranged ones, simple countering and easy combos. 

- A lot of the skill seems to come down to tactical positioning and movement than constantly having perfect inputs in a fight, which is a nice and relatively fresh take in such a game. More forgiving to an ""older"" (see - near 30,) more casual gamer like myself.

- Amazing customization. Characters are hero based (like Apex and the like,) but even with pre-defined characters they give you sliders and color customizations for skin/hair, on top of the usual skins and accessory/emote cosmetics.

- Varied playstyles. With both melee and ranged weapons in the game (on top of hero skills) there's lots of builds to try and experiment with.

- Weapon mastery system. Earn exp/prestige when using weapons and getting kills with them to earn unique skins, currency, and other cosmetic goodies, encouraging you to try new things and rewarding you with unique items.

- In-game quests/objectives. Sometimes you'll receive a bounty to kill a specific player in your match, go smack a bell in a tower, pray at a shrine, or other side objectives. This will give you some currency or some gear for the current match and helps to push players in directions they might not otherwise have chosen to explore and further breaking up normal playstyles/routes.

- Great optimization. Game has been running buttery smooth at nearly 200 FPS for me on an old 1080 Founders Edition.

Tl;dr - Probably the best Battle Royale I've (personally) tried with room for some improvement in the monetization aspects, but still enough in-game earnable rewards to make it feel alright as is. Excited to see how this game (hopefully) grows and improves over time as what we have so far is insanely fun."

11884,"Upon a first run BladePOINT immediately rubbed me the wrong way as it launched ""GAME.EXE"" Now I already hate China and Chinese/Korean companies in general but this game solidified that view for me if it wasn't already solid. Aside from the potential security risks this game may offer the game feels pretty clunky and cheaply made when you compare it to other popular BR releases that don't COST MONEY UPFRONT. On top of the game putting you against incognito bots for your first several matches in a shameless attempt to make you feel good about yourself so you'll play past the refund timer but it almost worked CHINA too bad it didn't though. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on HENTAI FEMDOM SIM: FEMDOM UNIVERSITY"
11885,เซิร์ฟควย
11886,"Literally do not waste your money on this game. This game will be F2P within a year, bet 20$ on that rather than spend it on the game now. If you really want spyware on your pc, go ahead and launch StartGame.exe and watch Windows Defender freak out at you... Its business model is absolutely ludicrous by the way and is almost too much to write tbh, check other negative reviews that provide the numbers. The gameplay itself is nothing special, and frankly pretty clunky and monotonous. It falls into the same old anime game trap: where everything is a cancerous blur of people spamming their crazy anime looking attacks that the game can't possibly track well so you end up glitching around until someone finally dies... It seriously needs work mechanically and in their shop - I mean the ENTIRE game feels like a casino advertisement. Don't waste your money."

11892,"The game is a lot of fun don't get irritated by the mixed reviews with people complaining that played the game like not even 2 hours so why shouldn't they just refund. At this moment I have 7.4 hours play time and I don't understand the problems some people have like for example the bots which are there to provide a more easy way to get into the game without getting slaughtered by pro players especially later on in the games life cycle because then there will be players with like a 1000 hours who want to start of by playing a quick round everyday before they play ranked. 

End result try out the game for yourself if it isn't your kind of game you can just refund it."

11896,"Delivers on what is promised in the trailers.
Didn't know much about this before the launch,  just saw it pop on steam a couple of hours before release,  looked up some early gameplay.
Server launch was very smooth, one of the best launches I've ever seen.

Gameplay: very good movement,  fighting is well designed. 
I owned those bots in the first round(s)

It's very skill based. I already got ganked by a good team of 3 when I was alone a few times
Resurrection is a nice way to stay in it a bit longer indeed.
You recieve a lot of customization items, even without paying."

11898,"[B][U] THE BEST TAKE ON MELEE ACTION BATTLE ROYALE [/u][/b]

[i][b]ATTENTION:[/b] Before you get swayed by the negative reviews, most of it are server related, wherein they don't have specific servers for their specific regions. Another one is regarding BOTS, yes there are bots but for the first few games ONLY. When you get past the first 2-3 games you play with players. It's just there with the intention to show players the ropes and general gameplay loop. 

I do think this game is extremely well-designed and it's definitely worth your time. I'd say one of the most unique Action Battle Royale of it's kind and worth playing. IF the game piqued your interest, give it a try yourself! Trust me it's worth. Now onto my review. [/i]

Naraka Bladepoint is an Action Based Battle Royale with a relatively high skill ceiling. It offers players insane mobility powered by parkour and grappling hook, a vast arsenal of melee and ranged weapons, and a roster of characters with powerful abilities.

[olist]
 [*]Mechanics:
    [list]
    [*]Melee Combat 
 - This is Primarily the focus of the game, with a variety of weapons to choose from such as the LongSword, Katana, Greatsword, Spear, and Dagger. 
- High Skill Ceiling melee fights, that works like rock paper scissors in sense. Meaning there's different counter plays to every option in the game. Common attacks beats Counters, Focus Attacks beats Common Attacks, Counters beats Focus Attack.
- Obtainable ""SoulJades"" in-game to alter your melee combos and the way you fight.
    [*]Ranged Combat
        - The secondary focus of the game, where the players are given an array of different ranged weapons to choose from such as the Bow and Arrow, Repeater Crossbow, Pistol, Musket, Cannon
    [*]Character Abilities
         - Characters are given a wide range of different unique and flashy looking abilities to spice up the game even more. One of such abilities is turning into a Huge Demon and changing the way your hero plays. They're all extremely unique and gives you that ""Powerful"" feel when you pop them
    [*]Grappling Hook
         - One of the main selling point of the game for me. You're given a vast amount of grappling hooks in the game, allowing quick vertical movement around the map. It makes you feel like spiderman grappling around tree to tree! It's a very cool mechanic!
    [/list]
 [*]Lore:
         - I dont know about you but I do love a good bit of lore on my characters, and this game delivers. The story revolves around an Ancient Mask that our different heroes set out to obtain. This mask obtains power through slaughter, and each of our heroes has their own agenda why they want this mask. Very interesting premise for a lore-heavy story!

 [*]Soundtrack:
          - Soundtrack imo could be better, this is one of the things I'm not fond of in the game. I feel like it's missing the good bit of ""oooomph"" from an epic music. Definitely, imo, soundtrack could be improved upon. Fingers crossed and hopefully they can make it happen!
[/olist]

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b]

    ~ I think this game has huge potential. Considering it's already mechanically heavy and the intense melee fights require quick thinking and decision making to come out on top. Again, if you're someone who gets swayed HEAVILY by negative reviews, dont be. As I said, a lot of those reviews are server based and the info regarding bots, are from people who haven't played enough yet to get matched with players. If you like action heavy melee fights, and BR then look no further. Have fun out there and be [b]UNCHAINED![/b]"
11899,pretty fun game
11900,What can I say? Best game of the month! Probably best game of the year. Let's see what's coming in the late half of 2021.
11901,"Fresh take on a battle royale that completely revived my interest the genre. Naraka has incredible character customization, smooth and highly skill based combat, and fast three dimensional movement, making fights both intense and beautiful. Highly recommended."
11902,"Combat will likely make most individuals upset. I played in the alpha/beta and then again in the June beta access.

I had hopes the combat would be improved and fleshed out for a more balanced/fair playing field but like many other fighting games it suffers from offering very little counter-play to a lot of its mechanics.

grapple hooks are auto locking and will stagger players offering free hits and have no counter-play. Anything more than a 1v1 you are dead because of juggle and stun-locking with the only means of defense being certain character abilities, which like many other games is also a balance issue with many being much stronger and reliable abilities. All attacks are auto aiming/locking when enemies are within range making dodge feel very useless in most scenarios.

Focus attacks have a parry system to counter them but work on a charge system making it very rng/lucky (without input/server lag) to try and guess the timing to parry. Light attacks can be countered with another light attack to interrupt/collide which costs health(I've died doing so).

The movement is nice but has so many options it trips on itself often getting stuck on ledges and other objects because of the amount of options for traversing it ends up being clunky most of the time when indoors/around buildings making you use the grapple hook most times.

Its a cool game with a neat concept but just ultimately falls flat on its face with the lack of polish and balance."
11903,NICE GAMES
11904,Fun When Fighting Against Real Players
11905,"It may be a little clunky and suffer from the same things online fighter games have always suffered from (network latency, wonky collision in combat), but it really doesn't get in the way of the pure fun of this game. It's a really great time."
11906,"The most interesting BR for me until date. 
Tho you have predefined characters, the face customization lets you make a completely custom looking character which is a very important point for loads of folks. 
Skill customization is nothing out of this world but let's you alter your abilities to a decent enough point.
Combat feels great
Visually it's pretty 
Normally not a huge BR fan but this game will keep me occupied for a decent amount of time I feel :)
They also did a good job improving performance and optimization since the last beta.
Would recommend this game. Fun with friends and solo alike"
11907,i keep getting wrecked hopefully others aswell hahaha
11908,This game is really good
11909,t jh  ghjgds kjfhgdhjgdhjfg hjdsf
11910,"Probably the only BR game in the world I'll ever like, at least so far. It feels fantastic to play and is well optimized (the people complaining about how it runs HAVE to be doing something wrong because I don't have an amazing rig and I can run it smoothly on high settings). Combat feels good without being overly complex, though it can be chaotic at times when too many people are involved - this may be because we're all pretty new and don't know how to play, or it could just be a fault with how the combat is. I can't really judge right now.

You can customize just about everything about every character which is insane and greatly welcomed imo. There's basically a character creator for each hero, so it can make everyone look unique. Your first few matches are filled with bots and I agree that they should disclose this beforehand and that it should only last a match or two vs. 4-5.

Battle Pass is $10 which is super reasonable and while there are loot boxes, it is COSMETICS ONLY. I do not understand why people whine so hard when they see loot boxes even if there is zero p2w in them. As of writing this review there is no p2w content in the game. The cost of non-loot box cosmetics is fairly standard, typically $10~$20 a piece, the same as any other BR or MMO. I do feel that there should be more accessibility for cosmetics with in-game currency, and that's hopefully a change we can see eventually.

The scummiest aspect of the game so far is the fact that people who purchase the Deluxe or Ultimate editions are put on a 2 hour timer for receiving their goodies, which is conveniently the same amount of time you're given to refund the game. Definitely left a pretty bad taste in my mouth but has been my only real complaint otherwise."
11911,Such a good game.
11912,GIT GUD
11913,"Fun game, unique mechanics."
11914,very good
11915,"Where's my Taes and Golds bonus in Ultimate edition?
They show it in first time and delete it recently. What a scam."
11916,"EDIT: They changed the 2nd battle pass and it gives you the full 1360, which made me buy the pass and the other cosmetics in the shop.  Great game, developers, and publishers.



Great game, but the major problem (for cosmetics) is that the battle pass costs 1360, yet it only gives you 1280 for completing it.  They should give us the full amount, while releasing their own shop (seperate from bp) or event exclusive skins as a way to create revenue.  Instead of buying $2 worth of gold every 80 days, events exclusives could cost $20-$100 every 40-80 days (similar to Apex or DBD)."
11917,"It's a good game. People really giving bad reviews cuz they don't get every costume for free? 🤣😂😂🤣
""BUT IT COSTS 20EURO SO EVERY COSMETIC SHOULD BE FREE!!!"" yall rarted 🤣😂🤣💋🙊"
11918,"The scenery is beutiful , the assasins creed'esque movement is smooth and fun , but the combat... The combat is abysmal at best."
11919,"The game is really good, fluid / fun movement mechanics and unique melee / ranged combat. I wouldn't pay much attention to the people claiming it's filled with Bots as that's not the case. U play with bots in like your first 3 matches as i assume the Devs want u to get used to the movement / weapon mechanics. I haven't seen any bots since my earlier matches, trust me you'll know when u get past that point lol.

I also haven't ran into any optimization issues on a 1080ti with the latest game ready Nvidia drivers installed"
11920,good
11921,BIG NINJA BOOBA
11922,Good game!
11923,This game have a great visual graphics and have a different type of combat system which makes the gameplay far more better then other games.
11924,♥
11925,"No SA servers. Unplayable on 200ms
Edit: After community backlash they are impleenting both SA and OCE servers so Im updating my review. Good job!"
11926,"I spent almost 4 hours last night playing this game when it first came out so here's what I have to say about it.

First, when I entered a match the game would take forever to load in and I would be left with barely 5 seconds to choose where to land.  This continued for a couple of matches in until it finally stopped.  Maybe it was first day server jitters or maybe it's something more.

Second, the game had huge frame drops throughout the matches every now and then.  The drops didn't last relatively long, only about 3-5 seconds, but it was slightly annoying.  I'm personally running a high end computer which means yet again it's either first day server jitters or just poor optimization.  

Third, the play style needed to win.  This is going to be a long one so hear me out.  The battles are extremely chaotic when fighting other players; you have people flinging things left and right.  Stun lock is a thing of course, especially when you are getting attacked by a group by yourself.  So keep in mind that if you are by yourself, either because you left your teammates behind or they died, and you get caught by another team then you are dead.  There are no counter play options to pull a clutch off.  Getting hit once spells your doom and they all will proceed to pile on you and stun lock you to your death.  When it comes to group battles, he who strikes first wins.  Coordinated teams will jump one person, stun lock to death, then jump the remaining two players.  If they catch you off guard... Well, I haven't figured out any counter play to that but just running away.  The play style you will need to adopt if you want a chance is to be an ambush predator.  Climb on walls, hide behind walls, become the wall and so on, if you want to win you need to hide first.  So, this is pretty normal for a battle royal game; ambush, focus one guy, clean the rest up.  However, my next point is what makes this game in my opinion worse for it.

Fourth, speed.  Me and a friend who also had the game ready to go around launch played a couple of trios together before we unlocked Custom Matches.  We proceeded to make a custom match to learn about the combat system and what could be done.  We didn't get very far in it but here is what we learned.

Everything is fast.  You want to dodge an attack out of reflex?  Too bad.  You have to predict and rely completely on RNJesus to protect you.  There are very few attacks that I was able to dodge out of reflex.  In short, prepare to start spamming and predicting your dodges.  My friend and I focused on what melee weapon's horizontal attack you can dodge by crouching with pure reflex during our custom match and this is the result.  Nonduckable: Spear, Dagger.  Both Spear and Dagger can still hit someone who is crouching.  Predicting Required: Katana.  Predicting Required means that you can't duck by reflex; the attack comes too fast so you must predict it. Reflex Possible:  Great Sword and Long Sword.  Among the Reflex Possible, the Great Sword is the easier of the two, but is still hard to duck under, and becomes insanely hard to duck under in the midst of the chaos of a real game.  There is a small windup time for the horizontal that gives you around half a second to duck under.   Meanwhile, the Long Sword, though it is possible to duck on reflex, is practically impossible to do so, and me and my friend only did it once.  In fact, the time frame to duck is practically frame perfect.  On the other hand, away from crouching we have jumping.  And the results are not stellar because you cant reflexively jump a horizontal attack from any weapon we tried.  The jump animation takes slightly too long and the weapon still catches you on your foot.  The only weapon you have a real chance at accurately predicting and jumping over its horizontal is the Great Sword and that's simply because it is the slowest.  

So what does this lead too?  It leads to a game that actively rewards people that spam attacks because there is little to no counter plays available.  Which is of course the opposite of what this game intended to do.  This game wanted to bring in a skilled combat system to a battle royal, a system where if you are skilled enough then you can reach the top of the leader boards, but instead it created a system that helped people mindlessly spam attacks too fast to reliably dodge on reflex and allowed those people to start climbing the leader board.  

However, the game got big mommy milkers so it gets my recommendation."
11927,"Not worth the 20 bucks for a battle royal game where most the players are bots. Who cares if it takes 5 seconds to get in a match when they are all bots. Increase the matchmaking time or remove bots that act like loot pinatas, and are easily defeated while they run in circles or jump in a building and get stuck in a corner."
11928,GOOD GAME
11929,"very good
"
11930,Physics are nice.
11931,"This game makes alot of Fun for me, i really love the way the combat works aswell the Looting and Quests, Battlepass seems to be great aswell."
11932,"I hardly do any reviews unless I believe it is necessary to get the truth across and believe the game is great to give a try for yourself.

The game has astonishing environmental views, movement, parkour, battles, all work extremely well compared to other games at launch. The NBP price is a steal in my opinion, as I have paid triple for a game that is unplayable (of course not knowing it was that bad).
This is the first game I have played in years that was nearly perfect at launch. The character customization is a masterpiece, not too much to make your head explode, but enough to make the character...well.. you, also the feature to upload a picture to basically scan it and place it onto your character is jaw-dropping, to say the least. 
As of right now, I am able to play at 90 FPS. I'll post my PC specs in order to help you gauge your rig's capability. My current playtime is a little under 7 hours but will provide a more detailed update once I have put in a solid 40 hours, which as of right now should be fairly soon lol.

**UPDATE AS PROMISED**
Nothing has changed, game is still amazing, cant talk/write need to get my rank up, see you there, kthxbai!"
11933,"Awful monetization, but excellent game play with high skill ceiling, many characters and weapons to fit many play styles."
11934,Fun game
11935,"Great game, but they need to remove all the bots or make it interesting and make the bots skeletons. Also let people customize Yuto Hime because 50% of the player base mains her."
11936,good game playing on 2k high graphs 90fps and ping is good. combat feels great i just hope they reduce the bots a bit
11937,naissssssssssssssss
11938,"The gameplay is generally decent. The mobility in this game is awesome, while combat tends to feel sluggish. 

You're spending around $20 USD for what is essentially a Call of Duty Mobile-type Battle Royale game with different combat. Shares a lot in common with it. Lots of microtransactions, can't really earn the paid-for currency, and it is pretty much implied that if you want even some barebones cosmetics you're gonna have to drop some money. Making this game F2P would justify this game being a fun, enjoyable experience but having a F2P-Style game behind a $20 paywall is going to 1) limit playerbase 2) stale the game 3) have a bunch of reviews like this one that complain about all the IAP on a paid game.

Even though this game is enjoyable, I think it's shortsightedness and cash-grab nature will sadly be its downfall. 

UPDATE: I played a few rounds of COD: Mobile and OH MY GOD after having done that you realize how much of a re-skin this game is with the exception of combat. It's sort of ridiculous that they charge $20 for this one and not the other."
11939,This game is cool and fun to play. It also fun to play with your friends too. :D
11940,Don't play on HDD. You will have a bad time
11941,noice gg
11942,^_^
11943,"Played Monk and used the broken Longsword + Spear meta. Yet another terribly designed combat system that punishes you, not based on mistakes you made, but because the opponent happened to do something right which is the fundamental reason why For Honor failed so hard too because no one likes to lose for playing the game the way it was designed. If you get parried, rather than it being ""it's my turn to attack now"" it turns into ""I win"". You lose your weapon from a parry so you end up running around with your barehands as you get stunlocked to death. So the safest thing is to just use a spear and light spam because for some reason spear gets 4 light attack chain whilst other weapons get 1-2 before going into the most predictable parriable heavy attack I've ever seen in a melee game, so to be safe everyone just plays a braindead game of who can hit who first with light spam spear to stunlock them to death. 

Before people think I ""just need to get gud"" I'm ranked 83 worldwide as I write this review. Yes I am salty as I was hoping we would finally get a decent Melee based BR game but apparently dev's think stunlocking people to death while they can't do anything is fun and deep."

11948,Yes
11949,"Beautiful Art Style, Beautiful Graphic, Great Action Combat"
11950,gameplay its ok i played two games and won both it seems way to easy for it to be players i am guess there bots that and the graphics are really werid looking if you play to buy this game i say wait a little and see what happens with updates beacuse so fair its not looking so good that and sever have more then 50% bots in them making it really easy so you feel good then when you relisze its too late to refund 4/10
11951,"Gameplay and core game are fun and unique. However no sea severs….you are forced to play with people with over the 200 ping :/  You have 0 options to escape from infinite stun locks.I also have to mention the extremely aggressive business model. It’s buy to play with mobile style micro transactions. This game will die with the combo.


Once you start playing ranked its full of Chinese players using vpns to have a advantage over you. They team in the end, and attacks barely register on them. Do not buy this."
11952,"Gameplay is smooth af, it feels like you are in complete control of your character and you have many options. Movement feels great. When you parry your enemy drops their weapon, overall an amazing game with a few minor issues like bots in low elo games but the gameplay is way worth it!"
11953,"I refunded. They expect a base price for the game while every cosmetic is through a toxic cash shop. You can't earn anything to ""look cool"" you must spend money. I noped right out of there at 70 minutes. Played 3 matches, all bots except for my teammates. Won all 3, did not feel good about it. The gameplay itself could possibly have potential but it's got some of the most redundant floor loot for a battle royale i've ever seen. The weapons break comically fast but it's ok because you've probably found 8 of the same exact weapon in blue or purple by the end. 

The game somehow feels ""polished"" and clunky at the same time and I can't really explain it further.

It literally felt like I paid for a free to play game."
11954,Can we have the option to buy gold from the steam store please?
11955,"good game with high skill capped. fast paced. need more heroes, maps and customize the new champs plez!"
11956,"I think i played enough time for a review

First of all, i would like to address the people thinking it should be f2p, sure it may mean in a larger player base but it also means its an invitation to hackers, they can just make another account if they ever get banned. At least by buying the game they are less inclined to cheat or let alone even buy the game. Especially with this price. Quite frankly i'm kind of tired of hackers using aimbots or walls like in warzone or apex.

Secondly, the game design is somewhat refreshing, it reminds me of that battle royale game ""shadow arena"" but more refined in a sense. The character design and customisation are what amazed me, i expected only skins and such but not stuff like hairstyle or even skin colour or even the face. It was as if i was playing an mmorpg. The graphics are somewhat beautiful, i tried it in very high for like a second or two but i had to go back down because my gpu reached 100% way too quickly.

Thirdly, lets talk about gameplay, the idea of bots being there for you first couple of games is quite decent, i wouldve loved to play against real players for my first time but obviously lets look at this from a different point of view. If you dont get used to it then how are you going to enjoy it? Ive seen several people quit time to time becuase they got dominated by players that are good espcially when they just started. In other words, its almost like a starter, gotta ease them in before they get the main course.

Finally, just like nearly every game out there, some of the community is toxic, but i understand if they get angry over negative reviews because some of it is just about not having a server rather than the details of the game itself. But then again i understand why it is a bad thing too, i wouldnt want to play a in a server with high ping too.

The game itself is actually wonderful, from character design, to gameplay, to graphics. Only problem i would want fixed is the frame drops even when my graphics is at medium."
11957,SUPER NICE GAME........ its good bc its battle royal with melee focused wich means you must have a good skill to play it....just give it a chance and im sure you love it.......
11958,exelente jogo recomendo!
11959,"i like
"
11960,"Very well rounded experience so far. There is the issue of it being B2P and having additional cosmetics to buy with real money ingame but it doesn't really bother me. Didn't expect otherwise since the server costs have to be paid either way. Server performance is good in EU. The bots can definitely need some improvements but at least this way you recognize a real player in an instant.
It seems very skill based from the bit of experience I got with Solo matches. This way you can even win with very low health if you use the right attacks/counters at the right time. As always with Battle Royales it's about the timing of your engagements too. But I feel in this game you can get easier out of nasty situations compared to other BRs.
I do hope the devs stay on the path of a balanced game - at the moment it feels like every weapon and character has its right to exist. Don't know about the skill variations so far but it's awesome you can customize so many details of your character (from the skillset to the optics) - even without putting additional money down the line.

[b]TL:DR:[/b] Try it out for yourself since it's a good entry in the BR-genre with a wide variety of gameplay/cosmetics. Server performance is solid. Australians beware: there are no servers for you (atm)."
11961,"The game is FUN if you are looking for something new to play.

The game need work but it better then it was in the alpha and beta.

I play game like COD and PUBG if you are looking for a game like them then don't bother with this.

11972,"Read the negative reviews, its a good game people bitch about dumb shit."
11973,"No servers in Australia, like I expected. I was somewhat hopeful we wouldn't get cucked but whatever. Maybe I'll come back if I can play at under 50 ping and not on 150+. 
Aside from that, here is a list of my current gripes:

-Some, if not all character abilities need to be revised and carefully looked at. They seem to be packing a lot of unnecessary punch. This may be related with lag and DOT; I don't think the Devs wanted to have abilities that one shot.
-Kick players instead of having them wait 5 minutes in game trying to reconnect. This shouldn't be a thing.
-This is another issue that might be exaggerated by lag, but the parry/disarm mechanic shouldn't be spammable.
-Input delay shouldn't be a thing. I am trying to alternate attacks, not constantly stop mid combo to parry a non-existent attack. This might also be due to lag.
-Waiting area shouldn't have an auto-loading spawn location map + optional quest tab. The ping is bad enough as it is, I don't need to get lagged out while joining a waiting zone.

There would undoubtedly be more but I can't be bothered playing anymore. I was looking forward to this."

11986,"Spam longsword. No skill required. Boring noob game.

it's so trash

nerf longsword. it's been op for years. stop being stupid, devs. so annoying."
11987,"The best battle royale out there. Period. If you don't like this game, you're a stereotypical whiteboy gamer. Go play COD and FIFA."
11988,"first of all i dont write reviews normaly but this game deserves it.
i like it because it is actualy unique to other br games.
the combat is interresting and the graphics are pretty nice.
if you like BR games and chinese culture this is a game for you.
loot,slash and have fun and maybe at some point i meet you in this nice chinese br game.
Now i go back and play more."

11994,"This game have an unbalance weapon system:
Melee is just aim assist grapple and spamming mouse.
Range weapon is relatively strong but really hard to hit if ur enemies just gonna stick on you with their grapple.
In summary give grapple a cooldown for 10-15 secs"
11995,傻逼才会给差评？
11996,"This is a great game with a fairly interesting take of high mobility, melee oriented BR.

Overall easy to learn and has a good in game tutorial. First 2-3 ranked games seem to have many AI players to garantee the new player a top 5 finish but the difficulty ramps up afterwards as you pair against more skilled players. 

Good depth of gameplay and you have to learn to predict, combo and counter to rank up beyond silver/gold.

Graphics are good and well optimised for my mid tier gaming laptop (graphic 1060 mobile) set-up. No lag and loading times are fast when installed on a SSD.

The heroes have interesting designs and detailed background stories.

My only gripe is the amount of micro transactions. They are all purely cosmetic and give no in game advantage but some you can't unlock via gameplay alone.

Overall it's quite addictive and would definitely recommend."
11997,good
11998,โดยรวยสนุกดี ถึงแม่ไม่เคยเล่นเกมนี้มาก่อน
11999,"Naraka is a fun game with a bit of jank and no real clear progression path for rewards. You get coins but you can only buy loot creates with them so thats gross. There is a battle pass which is 10 dollars US and that seems reasonable.

In terms in of balance some tuning is really needed. There is one character call Yoto Hime (my new main) that is a bit too good, with all her abilities. Her ult can deal damage, interrupt and knockback enemies and it has 3 charges, YIKES. Also the monk character's ult is basically grab city. He can grab you from a distance (like a magic hand flies at you, then pulls you to him), smash you against the ground dealing almost a full health bar of damage and if you cant break free in time he can do it again. Meanwhile, other character ults like the girl with the blind fold has a long channeling stun that can be avoided pretty easily or some dude calls a sand storm that pushes back people and stops bullets... useful, but I'd rather just burst down a dude in 1 combo.

Some thing that I never expected was character creation. Mostly all the characters can be completely changed with a robust amount of options. As someone who can spend over an hour in character creators this was a neat feature, unnecessary, but neat.

Overall I like this game, its not perfect, its has some issues, but grappling around, chain comboing fools in a really nice looking world was not a bad way to spend 8 hours. 6/10"
12000,so high to play
12001,This game is full of chinese cheaters. Weapons are totally unbalanced specially spears. Broken game.
12002,So far so good
12003,"Don't trust the reviews about no Aus servers and 130 ping. Game has SEA servers that state 130 ping, but is in fact  70 ping when playing."
12004,"if you like martial arts and battle royals this game is for you i give it a A+++
works flawless with xbox controller didn't try my ps4 im sure it works with it to
game is a real gem,i picked up ultimate edition for grappling hook!
My favorite game
"
12005,.
12006,nice game
12007,updates making the game worse
12008,"Honestly I hate BRs, but I love this game. Takes some time to understand the combat and its rock/paper/scissors mechanics but it definitely requires skill rather just spamming. People call it cashgrab but it only puts the cosmetics behind a paywall, and you get free boxes as you play. Company has to make money too. Not p2w at all.
Played through the betas as well and the devs listen to feedback and seem like they actually care about the product.
Gonna spam this game for a long time."
12009,"People mad because they are the clowns who think they can play every multiplayer game solo and run off and get wombo comboed 1v2 or 1v3 and cry the game isn't fair because they got stun locked, and or only played bot matches and think they are the best lmao."
12010,so much fun give it a blast nice price and not f2p/p2w servers run nice aswell
12011,"Normally I dislike Battle Royale games, but this one stands out so much I can't help but love it already and am looking forward to many more games put in."
12012,"UM ITS A REALLY GOOD BR, good for all skill levels, fluid controls and a character creator, what not to love"

+Sekiro Vibes 
+Combat & skills are simple 
+Beautiful Map locations 
+Climb any surface 
+Loot ,inventory & loadout design 
+Unique Ultimate & Skills for each character

[b] Cons [/b]
-BattlePass in full price game really !
-Lack of Characters only 7 ! Hoping there are more
-All Cosmetics locked behind paywall & long grind to unlock them
-Edit character is so basic ( body parts changes none )
-All Editions are a joke unlocking only cosmetics so new characters I have to take wild guess through paywall again !
-Poor optimization (RAM)
-Lack of Servers
-Game launch up is slow 

Really disappointed becuz I thought its going to be free by default
most battle royale games are free to gain more players & build up communities for feedback

Edit: As Expected New characters costs money in Full price game ! if it was free game I wouldn't mind grinding to unlock it but this I have lost interest and regret buying the game in the first place"
12023,"A game that I really anticipate of playing.  BR game with stylish combat. If you like playing samurai game but in BR, I definitely recommended this game. The customization is pretty great because you can choose hero that you like to customize."

12025,"nice

12026,A song call Kung Fu Fighting describe my experience in this game.
12027,"Graphics are awesome! 

but the game overall is trash... no cooldown on grapple.. you can stick to the enemy all the time.. 

fightin system is nice but its not recommended for casuals... sweaty as hell XD

these days its just makein money and not deliverin a good gameplay game... sadge.. 

im gona play it but with mixed feelings.. 

grapple needs cooldown if u hooked an enemy for like 10-15sec then it would be a little bit beTtEr"
12028,good game
12029,"You can scan a pic of yourself and literally be in the game. It did a very decent job on me, just fucked up my eyes. Tweaked it a bit, and it's perfect now. They don't save your picture (or so they say at least lol Chyna) but it's really cool.

You can also be Tom Cruise and say his catch phrases like ""Vagina Poop"" and ""I'm not gay.""

Other than that, game can feel a lil clunky as a newb but you'll get the hang of it. Especially since there's an FFA Deathmatch mode to git gud in. Weapons might need a rebalance (greatsword and spear absolutely shred) but I'm a noob so who knows. 

Not a fan of the global server. They should fuggin change that asap.

But with a price cheaper than a night of kbbq, I'm having a lotta fun. Buy it."
12030,:)
12031,Dayum this is a game. Keep building it
12032,"This game is just amazing, I love it! I played beta as well, been in such Hype for it's release and it's finally here.."
12033,Massive mummy milkers
12034,boob physics
12035,booba
12036,yeeesssss
12037,"i would say its a fairly decent game and the character designs are unique as well, however the start of the game feels too easy because its filled with bots and will only get better once you rank up higher"
12038,"A lot of negative reviews about the pricetag of the game(which is mostly there to combat hackers, but I guess its also a good income for the company) so first of all, say you play Apex Legends a f2p battle royale game that has a 20$ skin in the shop. What would you rather get? One skin or a whole new game that brings a fresh breath to battle royale?

Now that we got that out of the way, the free movement is extremelly fun allowing you to climb almost anything and go everywhere u want to go. 

Ranged weapons are balanced by having slower projectiles and not being hitscan requiring actual skill to use to them unless the enemy is somehow stunned.

Melee combat is fun, the input for counter however is quite difficult to master so it will give you troubles at start, but youll get there dont worry!

The game has a lot of potential for new weapons and characters and the design is great so Im quite excited for what the future will bring, the devs drop balance patches quite frequently too so Im pretty optimistic.

Whilst it does have a battlepass even though its buy 2 play you receive a ton of rewards from this battlepass including the money that you paid for it back so in my eyes its definitely worth it especially if you like the game.

Overall Im having a great time, and hopefully you will consider trying it out cause I really think you will enjoy it aswell. (you can always refund if you didnt play more than 2 hours).

Edit: If you have questions write down below :P"
12039,beautiful graphics and realistic kungfu moves packed into a fast-paced BR
12040,"The Rock-Paper-Scissors combat style is pretty flashy and easy to learn but feels rewarding when you land that counter at the right time and stunlock someone to death. Parkour feels good, not as solid as Titanfall but good none-the-less.

Excited to play more of this game!"
12041,balance game
12042,"I have played a similar game before, but unfortunately not many people are playing that game anymore. The modeling, scenery, and music in this game are all good. I like the face pinching system in the game, which allows players to pinch the character they want as much as possible. Just pinching the character will feel like you can play for a long time. However, the optimization and balance in this game, as well as the money recharge aspect, need to be improved a little more. The game has a good look, but the content should be more substantial, so that it can exist longer.
"
12043,It's fun just give it some time to learn
12044,Very Nice Game
12045,Top
12046,"ABSOLUTELY BEST BATTLE ROYALE I'VE EVER PLAYED! Honestly kinda surprised coz it's got mixed reviews, but makes sense coz of no OCE servers as of now and a battlepass in a B2P game... But as for a game, this game's fucking sick! Absolutely my favorite thing to play RN. Except for trios, trios are BS!
Any 1vX  where X > 1 is just a terrible experience...
.
(Yes I've 4 hrs while writing this but I've sunk in 24 hrs during the june beta testing).
.
Edit: It saddens me to see how much potential got waste. I stopped playing this game because of the really terrible frame issues with pretty much every update, plus the characters just weren't balanced. Played this game again in 6 months... still the same situation if not worse. Don't spend a dime on this game. It's coming on game pass anyways. I'd still recommend giving it a try if you have the game pass and see if you like it."
12047,Fun gameplay.
12048,"very much hacker and admin do not active,"
12049,Being addicted !!!
12050,有奶子就給讚
12051,One of the best games to spend your time on. A refreshing take on the battle royale genre
12052,"Gameplay is fluid and intuitive and has much more depth than I had originally thought. For $20 I highly recommend this game especially if you're a fan of this art/play-style. Honestly the negative reviews have been far too harsh and some blatantly racist/anti-china.

There is huge counter-play and a fairly high skill cap so i can see why some people are getting discouraged (they're bad). Cosmetics are beautiful and my weak spot.. but take it or leave it because you have complete access to everything you need and no pay to win.

As for bots.. yes it is pretty obvious that some are bots but I have noticed and have been told by others that the more matches you play the less you will see and more players will pop up. I actually enjoyed this gradual build up because it allowed me to get used to all the map had to offer at a casual pace and by the time I was seeing players I had a confident grasp on the gameplay. All in all i have been loving it and can't wait for more."

12054,"Good community, tons of new stuff to try out, fun to play"
12055,game very good
12056,yo
12057,"The gameplay itself is quite fun. After 100 hours played and as solo top 40 EU, these are my thoughts:

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

- awesome idea and flair to the game
- core mechanics are well though of (climbing, combat system, differences in weapons, combos, fast paced)
- graphics are nice

Sadly this is overshadowed by the bad implementation. The combat system would be good if it worked properly. 

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

- Bad netcode makes combat inconsistent, punishing you for things you can't change, incredibly frustrating
- Parrying as a core mechanic of the game doesn't work half of the time. Succesfully parrying depends on your ping and the enemy's
    --> the parry window doesn't start when the animation starts (on your screen you parried in time but the attack goes through)
   --> Even if you parry with perfect timing, if the enemy's ping is too high, it will not count as parried
- Bots in ranked queues up until gold elo and in deathmatch
- Chinese Ping abusers everywhere
- No real progression felt apart from rank
- Buggy environment interaction
- Devs don't care too much about issues voiced:  
     . No adjustments made to trios (Eg.: You will be perma stunned in 3v1 by grapple hook spam and spear spam), this is simple to fix but there has been no change since beta   
     . Complaints in their discord about the inconsistency of parries and other issues are answered with 'get good'  
     . Instead of fixing issues they just release more cash shop skins  

- Aggressive microtransactions on top of 20 box price  
    . 15 bucks for a skin
    . 15 bucks paid battlepass that doesn't repay itself and honestly isn't worth it
    . lootboxes
    . free costumes look like shit, urging you into paying real money

[h3]This could be an awesome game if the devs actually did something about the issues mentioned above. But they probably wont. The game is handled in a way to get the most money possible without doing anything.[/h3]"
12058,Good Game
12059,booba.
12060,"Finally, Sydney server."
12061,"this game is a scam, you get into the match and wait for a year for everything to load in. every combat get your fps drop down to 0 because the game need to load more of the combat area, the idiots who code this game clearly dont know what is optimization. Not to mention the micro transaction heavily. 
for 20$, this is garbage"
12062,nice
12063,"I played almost 20 hours in the beta and it was so much fun.
Idk why but for some reason its not fun now.
Got lots of other games to play, so i dont need this right now.
Also this game being pay 2 play with battle pass is kinda dumb in my 
opinion. Should be free 2 play with battle pass"

- Too big price for BR game. (Hope, it won't cause a little playerbase) although it has paid battle pass and a lot of skins to buy.

12069,"This game takes a lot of skills, so it takes time to learn. Me and my Chinese friends had been played at Chinese server for a months and people are still learning. I just can't believe people at steam say it's a bad game after 1.5 hrs play because they want their $20 refund in time. I know it's reasonable but why not watch some stream first? I feel sad about people who missed the game because of some haters' comments. It's also sad to see people can't leave 'China' alone at a video game community. It is a really well made game, I'd suggest everyone watch some streams before passing this game."

12076,"the graphics are like ""Black Desert Online"" and it's quite fun playing survival with melee weapons

12080,"refunded and uninstalled, nothing original to see here, poor attempt at refreshing a stale genre with stale mechanics and slapping a $20 price tag on it - to then immediately start shovelling microtransactions down your throat

video games are dead"
12081,"I can play this game for hours without getting tired. 10/10 
As compared to launch the game is 10x more optimized and enjoyable now. Devs are doing a great job by listening to the community's feedback."
12082,"good game, just don't buy the ultimate version since it's not worth it"
12083,"It is worth to play, nice game and graphic, the main reason someone don't like because they blocked the Chinese region, Chinese player can not play international server anymore, sad, but wont affect the people who are in international."
12084,"I want to enjoy this game but being an Aussie connecting to South East Asia as my closest server it's practically unplayable.
I play games on SEA servers all the time and a 100-120 ping is generally completely playable. Not in a Naraka it seems. 
The input lag is scary.
I could loot something in one village and Naruto run to another village 200m away before it registers me having picked up the loot. Want to swap weapons? That'll take you roughly 10 seconds to do. Rubber-banding enemies all over the shop as well turns what could be interesting fights into a hilarious spamming match. If I wasn't generally facing bots I'd have no chance.

Negative for now. If they can pull their fingers out and improve net code or add a closer server I'll revisit.
"
12085,"its just a casual battle royale, but you're weeb"
12086,This game is great !!! Much more enjoyable than PUBG !! PUBG usually you got killed in secs. But this game you can survive much longer !! and much easier to play !! Fully customize face. I love it !! Just need more skin and cheaper price.
12087,"The combat and movement are great, offering so many options! The game opens up and becomes competitive above 1200 rank points, with higher skill requirements involved. I really recommend this for 20$. I can't understand the negative reviews. For me it is fun, dynamic and represents a breath of fresh air in the genre."
12088,"Yes, the first games are with Bots, but that doesn't mean Humans are unkillable...
And yes, after the Bot games you will notice a difficulty increase instantly..."
12089,Great battle royale in melee.
12090,"This game is a huge disappointment. Lootbox trash nonsense didn't help it either. The SSD requirement is a sign of the game going downhill for sure. I have a theory as to why they included that requirement. Just so they can add it on PS5 due to it have SSD. Problem is MOST people do not have PS5 due to pitiful creatures scalping for it since launch. I would not consider them humans. They are lower than insects. Anyway this game also have a clunky controls that makes the game read you inputs half a second late. It is really infuriating me. Now as for the new melee weapon they add for the Morus Blessing crap Bloodripper, they should had made it a regular weapon. Could have easily been my main weapon but instead we only get it through that stupid Morus Blessing if the RNG allows it to spawn for you. Also you guys need to add a blocking mechanic. That alone will improved the gameplay way more. Add a better melee weapon like a Great Halberd. The only hope for this game is new modes and more guest characters (preferably Dynasty Warriors characters). That's all I have for this game."

12093,"i will recommend the game to everyone who have played melee pvp before or likes battle royale games.
as someone who played the game since beta, the game got way lot optimized and the gameplay got so much balanced and i know its not a free to play BR but its not made by a AAA company either who can afford to publish one of their first games as free to play.."
12094,cool game
12095,"Before my thoughts on the game, here are some non-game related issues that you need to be aware of before buying.
1. Game is region locked. If you live in EU, you can't play with US and so on. 
2. The game has several language options. If you happen to live in China, you're bound to play in the Chinese server (See above), but for whatever reason playing the chinese Server locks you into playing the game ONLY in chinese. They completely remove the language options from the menu. It's the only server that does this. Why? There are a million foreigners in China + The game is already in english, why take away the option to play in english? Even Chinese Version Genshin doesn't do this.
3.  It's a paid game, yet it has a battle-pass, lootboxes, pre-order bonus exclusive character (It already has very few characters) and ""Gold"", all of which requires you to spend real money. Don't expect to get any gold or goodies for buying the game either, you get nothing. It's basically Free to Play mechanics on a paid game. 
4. The first 3-5 games you play are mostly full of bots to make you feel like a pro. Then you get absolutely destroyed by real players or you git gud. You may find the game unbalanced but by now it's too late to get your refund. 

On these issues alone, I already can't reccomend the game. It's like selling your soul.

The game however is pretty alright, and I don't usually like Battle Royale. 
Instead of camping like other BR, you spend your time finding better equipment like in an RPG. 
It's quite fun and you can even hide on grass (the game will actually turn you invisible, so you can't just play on low settings and turn off the grass) or you can hide in the trees. 
Fighting consists mostly of parrying at the right time, and misleading your enemy on when you'll use a charged attack.
It's not terribly balanced, the healer hero and the pre-order hero are pretty OP. The healer is basically invincible if she uses her ultimate, and she can heal and teleport to teammates. Pre-order hero has a devastating ultimate that can wipe entire teams. Some weapons are clearly better than others."
12096,"This is the either the laggiest game at 23 ms or hit detection doesn't exsist. parry is unreliable due to shit servers have fun getting blasted through attacks that should have been parried and basically just guessing when you should parry because if you see the attack coming its already too late. Game would have flourished with more game modes. only has 2 and they're meh Battle royale filled with bots and Deathmatch also filled with bots and people from different regions with ping that shades a new color of red because what the f***.

Camera/FOV is absolutely aweful i'm basically looking at my neck the whole time guess what wall in the way? enjoy every pixel that makes up a blade of grass or the person murdering you. this was brought up multiple times in play tests, not addressed 10/10

When it works game is great combat is still terrible because terrain is aweful but its fun feel like for honor but less complicated. great game, don't recommend."

12103,"No Australian servers.   Closest servers are S.E. Asia with over 100 ping, too much lag to play."
12104,"This game is extremely good and promising, don't believe those typical anti-Chinese reviews, these were quite expected. The game has bots in the first 2-3 matches (perhaps 5, if you are not good), because the game wants you to get used to the mechanics and all before playing against normal players. League of Legends did the same for many years, nobody cried. 

The graphics are phenomenal, the fighting system is also quite good but I still have to get used to it. The game is packed with tons of (mainly) ancient Chinese cultural and taoist phenomena, I really dig it. I can only recommend this game, I'm happy to support this company with this easy-peasy 20 bucks."
12105,god
12106,The game is really fun 2 play!
12107,NARAKA: BOTPOINT
12108,"All micro-transaction aside.... after all its just cosmetics, should be happy they didn't made it pay to win....
This is a really good BR game i have played so far, after like pubg ERBS etcs... 
Pro-
awesome graphics
very interesting close range combat mechanics(very similar to rock paper scissor game)
neither range or close range is meta, you need both
you have different character to play
you can customize your character (even the face structure)
you can parkour, grapple get into anywhere your heart desire(inside the zone)
them tits

Con-
character balance might be a issue later
you will face bots in your first few games (to be honest i don't mind, kinda makes sure people start off by liking the game first)
micro-transactions?

here is the thing with micro-transaction, the skins you can only buy with money most likely have a another color version of the same set that you can unlock by chest or in game currency. (except the otome) and after all you ain't staring at your own character bare-chest and tit physics when dueling with someone right? i feel like the combat is REALLLY enjoyable, i currently regret nothing about buying the game"
12109,"ok ok ok..... i'm having FUN now lol
took some messing with some games and now i'm unstoppable"
12110,New refreshing battle royal!
12111,"matchmaking suck wait 15 minutes still not found any match, game is great but nobody play it, fix matchmaking"
12112,MEHHHHHH
12113,买了就是为了看黑丝！！！
12114,bugs?normal 1st day release.so fun to play only 1 game melee battle royale.bravo dev :)
12115,"fun, fast, beautiful game"
12116,"A fighting battle Royale game
Reminds me a bit of Sekiro with wuxia, pvp and it's different

Came for the fighting, Stayed for the booaatle royale!"
12117,شبش
12118,"Good game concept, nerf Yoto Hime pls"
12119,"Great core mechanics with free flow combat. Ranged is important but melee is still the main focus of the game. Grappling feels like a good distance closer although i don't know if it should stun since there is auto-aim on it. The weapons feel great and rewarding. The first 2 games are bots but I won both games and the third was all players. The only issue with the game at the moment is there can feel like a ton of stun locking, but there are ways to get around it, I think it just takes time to get used to. Servers are a little rough, I get around 60 ping in NA."
12120,"Great game, wuxia and battle royale.... the character design is awesome"
12121,is fun
12122,flaming hot shovelware
12123,"First of all game based on ping so it's not working at all (if u have better ping u win). Second optimization is trash even on good pc (my config 2070s i7 9700K still lagging +SSD....) Q  time 100000 years + (we dont have imortal war ""competitive mod"" mode but we have million fun modes like fall guys mode) splitting low amount of players between million modes so smart. Media dead at all (twitch youtube 1k average viewers). Game where ppl alow to team up and nobody gonna punish them even on tournaments. I played this game at competitive level even qual for first LAN but (publisher's or ppl who work with paper's not gonna move a finger to find a way to get u on LAN ((because tourist visa it's chipper then buisness visa )) 👍 so fuck the people who took first place in the qualifier let's take 6th place because they have media personalities and we won't even ask for your opinion. At all this game have perspective but only if devs be smarter than monkeys (not possible). Funny moment, let's buy ads from streamers who don't give a fuck about the game and they dont care about game mechanics, it's better to spam the left mouse button and stand afk (100% will help attract new players.) Oh we only devs we don't have permissions to give streamers accounts with all unlocked characters and content better let them play with bots first 20 matches 👍 don't waste your time in this trash."
12124,"edit

I have finally played against players and its definitely much more enjoyable, however bots in ranked really shouldn't exist, I'll thumbs up until further notice."
12125,taik idong masin
12126,fun game i enjoy play this game a lot i am not a bot i am real person
12127,"A game with a ton of potential and room for improvement. Solid grab for 20 bucks, sword play is fun and the ability to disarm M1 spammers with a well timed parry can turn a fight in your favor within an instant."
12128,Good game
12129,So i decided that i would train and learn a bit with my available characters before stepping into an actual game. So after 3 hrs i am now going to go set it off shogun style. The movement with the grappling hook is fluid and crazy effective. Lots to learn though...I am going to roll with Naraka Bladepoint and have some fun killing my enemies with pointy objects
12130,Don't bother if you live in Australia . No local servers & the high ping destroys it being fun. perhaps ill play again later when there is better servers.
12131,Fck Spear
12132,So I had my eye on this game for a while and didn't get to play the beta but saw gameplay and was pretty hyped. Got the game and had fun with a friend. The only thing i can down this game for is the connection issues and stutters which can be fixed pretty easily. The movement feels nice and the combat is a bit clunky at times but very fun.
12133,Jiggle jiggle.
12134,Good game

   Conclusion
╰─━━─╯

Naraka is a fantastic battle royale, and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy many games of this genre. It's super competitive which I love, and having good movement is crucial to the progression of the game which widens the skill gap. The game looks beautiful, and I can appreciate the many different heroes and weapons implemented. There isn't many things I can say that are negative about the game besides it is VERY hard for new players to get used to the mechanics and the difficulty. This game is most definitely competitive, and it shows whenever you begin to play against real players. To reiterate on my previous point, you will begin the game playing against bots (which is pretty normal for pretty much most BR's nowadays) but the game is quick to put you against real people to introduce a challenge. The beginning portion is somewhat boring due to the excess of bots, but once you being climbing rank it gets increasingly more difficult which is when the game is fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys fast, mechanic based competitive BR's.

Review Template Made By: 「o7」 Art"
12136,"Overall a Good Game Graphics are nice

Dont go for the ""Bad"" reviews Just a bunch of aussies that play with a 130 ping just giving it a bad review 

Also Jiggely Mommy Milkies"
12137,this is actually a really fun time alone or with friends the character customizing is sooo good like hello other games? catch up tbh worth the money and the time put in it!
12138,no OCE server... and bots make u play dumb.
12139,"Not recommended.
If compare with another BR > 3/10 Selection spawn point like CSGO BR. Ping advantage is make you can't even do anything just take a damage and die.
If compare with weapon combat like game > For honor and Chivalry is another level.

This game is not sell the system of game noting is new. Too many of fashion like F2P game that only open to get a profit and drop the update."
12140,why
12141,"This game should be free to play. 

The game itself it quite enjoyable, I've only sunk 50 minutes in but the movement system was fun and I had a decent time with the combat. I did think they would be a little more depth to the melee side of things but it's got enough meat to enjoy. 

The main issue with this game is the amount of additional DLC and microtransactions on launch day. There is already a battlepass with the premium version costing $10 more than the base game. I'm refunding this game even though it's reasonably enjoyable as I cannot stand by such disrespect for players. 

People may say that it's only cosmetic microtransactions so why care but if it's this bad the day the game releases, how bad is it going to get?
"
12142,Pretty cool and fun game but definitely needs polished and optimized.
12143,"Let me rename the game:


""Weeb - The Blade of Culture"""
12144,"This game is the best battle royal i could have asked for. I don't like the aspect of spamming builds or just shooting. This game gives a lot of choices in the melee department and it is a lot of fun because of that. I recommend this game to everyone and for anyone who wants to play and get some free stuff you can use my friend code "" ch7mrehj83 ""."
12145,"Its P*B-G Martial Arts version.
It's 3rd person view
It's Fun
It's lot of fun if you like Martial Arts and Hack and Slash game
Its has a many things to improve but still fun btw."
12146,best game <3
12147,Great game to play with friends!
12148,"This has got to be the most aggressive business model I have ever seen in a game.

So if you purchase the battle pass, you get 16x80 gold, that is 1280.
The Battle pass cost 1360 Gold...

Even if you buy the battle pass, and only want to use the gold from the battle pass to purchase next seasons battle pass, you can't. You HAVE to spend money on the game.

Skins on sale are 1700 gold, that's roughly 15$ for a skin on sale, its 2400g not on sale which is roughly 20$. That is insane.

Then they have a lootbox system that doesn't contain every skin or item in the game...?

Purchasing the Deluxe (60) gives 0 gold, and 0 silver??

That's an extremely aggressive business model if I say so myself...

The game is fun, the combat is fun, everything is B2P, just the added cosmetics on top of B2P on top of lootboxs on top Torchbearer on top everything else. Like they have so many ways to make money yet they charge 60 for the deluxe that barely comes with extras.... I recommend the game for playing and content. I do not recommend due to the in your face buy our premium currency model."
12149,"The Combat against Real Players is a slugish hell, there is no fun in Combat like this and on top of that is the disgusting Monetization, I need 1300 Gold for the Battle Pass but there is no Gold Pack to get this Amount."
12150,"good but where is the FOV slider, my eyes are dying"
12151,"I think the game is great, it gives me Sekiro vibes while also being a Battle Royale. 

The combat is good, there's areas for one to out perform the opponent and the aesthetics of the game are really nice to look at... everything from the outfits to the environment. Tons of cosmetic weapons to collect. In some battle royales the looting can feel overwhelming or cluttered.. but this one that's not the case. Only took me a couple matches to get a feel for it and it's really easy to use.

The game is not pay to win by ANY means.. which is great. Not sure why people are complaining about the price.. they basically want a free game with zero transactions which is a delusional expectation to have out of a developer. Also I see many people complaining about bot matches but those are early on and designed to help you get a feel for the game. In later stages you might run into a bot or two to fill the match fully, which is also fine."
12152,"A unique battle royal game, combined with an rpg and shooter genre, the gameplay is fast and you don't get bored, the characters are balanced and each has a unique power which makes it much more interesting and enjoyable. Recommend.

10/10 power."
12153,"Leaving a positive review, even though we don't have Oceanic servers yet (please provide them, Devs). The game itself plays great, i've had zero performance issues (will leave specs down below for reference) and overall it has great potential. How do I feel about the monetization? It needs a bit of work to be honest, prices are a bit steep for an already Buy-To-Play game for sure.

Giving this a blind thumbs down after 2 hours of play but zero research on the game is how potential game-changers to a genre die very, very quickly. For the reviews that complain about bots in a game; the first few matches you do are mostly bots to ease you into mechanics and gameplay. For the people complaining about performance issues? If your specs are equal or above to the following, then it's on your end, and it's not the game at fault;

- Playing on 3440x1440 Ultrawide, all highest settings.
- Ryzen 3700X @ 4.2
- 16GB DDR4 @ 3600
- RTX 2080 Ti
- Samsung NVMe M.2 970 (1TB)

I get being against poor monetization, but have a conversation for once instead of just review bombing the fuck out of anything new that comes along."
12154,fix your game i cant initialize steam for it but any other game works. DOG first impression
12155,Tiddies.
12156,"Waifus... Waifus Everywhere ! ^ o^
The combat plays smoothly, the character designs are amazing and the map is gorgeous. If you can look past the fact that there aren't servers for your region and instead get around 130ms (which is only like a second ish delay), this game is a must buy ! Who knows they may add better servers down the line :3"
12157,dope
12158,"I love the gameplay but they got a lot to fix
I found less bugs in the demo than the final game, and i know that might just be an instance of trying to fix other things and lead up to new bugs, but that is why they should have tested it before releasing instead of letting us pay for a buggy product. And i know its normal in today's time for games to have minor bugs on release but that doesn't justify anything, and the bugs i found are not minor at all, as well as others who exprienced BSODs,  anti-virus flagging the game, and having to set up virtual memory just for it to not lag, is mediorce in my book"
12159,"Non-stop combat, best fight gameplay!"
12160,Tbh i thought i wouldnt like it. kinda like apex but 3rd person... the parkour and the grapplping is something new to what im use to.
12161,BOOBA = Pog
12162,"I would recommend this game if it was optimised better. When I first started playing the game it was with bots and a few players mixed in. I was playing on 1080p with medium graphic setting and the render scaled to 100 at a solid 140fps 

Now that it is only player matches I constantly freeze and lag even with the settings on lowest with resolution at 720p and render scaled to 25. I get constant ping spikes and a ridiculous amount of FPS drops. The game is constantly showing the latency bars beside my character. 

Maybe it's there servers I don't know but, I do know this game runs and plays perfectly in the training modes and in-game the cpu and gpu utilization never goes above 55%

I will recommend this game once it gets those game breaking issues out of the way."
12163,Feels more fluid than Hunter Legends
12164,"By Far one of the best Battle Royal Games I have ever played.
The first Hour or so you fight alot of bots but that is only because the game skill matches and it doesnt put you with killers right away. After that hour about 50 - 75% of the Opponents will be players so you better buckle up and be ready!"
12165,"I don't often write reviews but I felt really compelled to after playing Naraka. God dang this game is fun. The level of depth it has with it's glyph system is seriously impressive and makes playing the game so much more enjoyable knowing that you're working towards some badass progression. The cosmetics are absolutely out of this world too. One of the deepest cosmetic/customizable character systems I've seen in a battle royale yet. 

The combat is not perfect, but it still makes for some incredibly rewarding and awesome moments. The hero ultimates are diverse and unique, looting is a breeze and doesn't feel like a drag or the focus of the game, and overall, it just seems like this game is such a bargain for $20. I'm really having a blast so far and can't wait to see what new characters, maps, cosmetics, shit, EVERYTHING this game has to offer in its lifetime. 

Also wow yoto has a fat rack."
12166,♥
12167,"Don't pay attention to most of the negative reviews here.

[strike] No OCE Or SA Servers: The Devs have stated that the game won't have these servers on launch, but it may be possible later in the games lifespan. [/strike] They have nodes currently as a solution. I don't know if thats good or bad, but thats that.

Bots: There will be 2 - 3 bot matches when you first play, but after that it is all real players. The bot matches are to ease you into the gameplay.

My experience with the game so far has been great! The combat is simplistic but hard to master. Many other modes like 3 v 3 arena will come soon, and a new hero is coming next season. I really encourage you to consider watching a video of this game, and if you enjoy it, please pick it up."
12168,Game is fire idc what others are bitching about. Finally a new take on a battle royal game that isn't recycled trash. Highly recommend if you are into Black Desert Online combat or Monster Hunter combat.  Plus its got an insane amount of customization's and skins. Overall I'd rate this a solid 9/10
12169,unplayable for oceanic
12170,"I've never taken the time to leave a review, in all my of my 17 years of steam service... 

BUT
THIS 
GAME

IS INCREDIBLE. 

yes, it has flaws and some bugs but the core concepts are absolutely locked in, 

drop that 20 and come knuckle of with Nefio"
12171,"Bloody good fun. Something a little different for a change. Different weapons and skills to try out and there's a few modes to play as well. Fun characters to play as and you can customise them, from the outfits and accessories they wear to the face and hair they have. There's also plenty to look at too, if that's your sort of thing."
12172,As someone who really doesn't care for most Battle Royale's this game is actually a fun time. I really hope it gets the support it deserves because it fills a niche that I haven't felt since For Honor first launched. Definitely recommend it.
12173,i brought it game 2 weeks before it relesase...  but they promise the dlc for it but when.. it release the game i cant find it anyway
12174,"(4th day)Early days... but so far so good the intensity is there. But it has that same old feeling of leaving you incomplete - like most Battle Royale's unless you come out on top of course... as I said early days. I am looking forward to improvements. But I will need to get good at the game... :)

(12th day)Finished all the quests on the 12th day of Journey's dawn but I have not reached Gold or Platinum ranking... the game is challenging - to say the least. A true manifestation of PVP from the old MMO genre reborn into the world of Battle-Royale. Heck it even inspired me to produce a few Youtube videos...

(13th day)t will be amazing to see what content lies ahead for this game and if monetization by the developers will hamper its progress or expand its imprint on the market. It will also be curious to see if they can adopt a WvW strategy as right now they are limited to Solos and Trios... I am anxious for it's future."
12175,"I'm struggling with this game because there is no ""block"" mechanic. there's only a counter mechanic. so you have a minuscule window to actually outplay someone. So basically if the other person knows what they're doing they'll cancel the third chain and you're screwed. I really want to like this game I do. but until the devs give people another mechanic so you don't die I can't recommend this game."
12176,worth the 20$. If you've found yourself bored with nothing to play lately and sick of everything else try this. quick play is full of bots both a.i and players so you can chill with casuals and ranked has no minimum level to jump in so you can get sweaty right away
12177,"Great game, really fun. Overall visuals are beautiful. Definitely recommend!"
12178,"Very fun game!  Hack and slash battle royale style. 

Yes you will play with 50% bots for first 1-3 game but its just the way of the developer getting you familiar with the game. After that its all humans and it starts to get more challenging with more teamwork involved.

Battle Pass and Lootboxes, if you don't like it don't buy it. Its purely aesthetic afaik. CSGO, PUBG is the same.

Those complaining about clunky movements/bad FPS probably has a potato PC."
12179,"This game heavily reminds me of Blade & Soul. Stellar combat, OST, and cosmetics are on point! I didn't even know that you can customize the looks and appearances on each character.

If you're a weeb, into eastern asian aesthetics, and mommy milkers. I highly recommend playing this game! 

[spoiler]I ain't gonna lie this game got some r34 potential. it's time for me to hit the studio and make some art![/spoiler]"
12180,"The fact is that the game itself is very poorly optimized, which leads to very stuttering and delays. In the case of stuttering and serious delays, it is impossible for players to freely play their operating skills. So this also proves that those players who can play well and operate well are definitely Cheating is adopted, because only cheating software will not be affected by the game's lag and delay.

I have played this game with both a high-end computer and a low-end computer, and I have also used various so-called methods that can eliminate delays and freezes. However, when both high-end and low-end computers have lowered the picture quality of the game, the stalls and delays of the high-end and low-end computers are equally serious. This fact is enough to prove that the lag and delay of this game are only caused by the optimization of the game itself or server problems. It’s safe to say that anyone who has played NARAKA will be very clear that what I said is the truth. The game is indeed very lagging and delayed.

And combined with the facts mentioned above, I can say with certainty that the masters of this game will definitely not dare to play face-to-face with you in life, because there is no way to use cheating software when playing face-to-face, so the manufacturer of this game absolutely It is impossible to hold a face-to-face competition below the line, because once face-to-face cannot use cheating software, then the master's operating skills will not be able to show. This also proves that this game is full of deception. Perhaps the official secretly allowing some players to cheat is to confuse the public. This part of the cheating players will spread the information that the game is not stuck, and use the excellent personal operation caused by the cheating software to confuse the public. , Let the public mistakenly believe that the game itself has no lag and delay, or make the public mistakenly believe that even if the lag and delay are serious, they can play their operating skills freely. Simply put, the facts have fully proved that the quality of this game is very poor and the game manufacturers are resorting to deception to seek benefits. I also won’t bother with those who disagree with facts and cannot refute me on the basis of definite facts, because there is no essential difference between the statements that cannot be proved on the basis of clear facts and the nonsense of lunatics.








The most common despicable method used by China's bad businesses is to hire others to spread lies to mislead and deceive the public in order to achieve the goal of profit. For example, NARAKA is indeed full of cheating. In order to maintain NARAKA’s reputation and avoid loss of popularity, game manufacturers will hire others to spread lies on the Internet. These hired people lie that they have played NARAKA for a long time but have never encountered cheating. The purpose of this kind of lies is to mislead and deceive the public to make players mistakenly believe that there are very few cheating in the NARAKA game, creating the illusion that the NARAKA game environment is very good. So don’t believe in other people’s claims that lack evidence of facts, and the facts of your own experience are credible, and only believe that things with facts are correct. 






The Chinese people's concept is that what they say should be regarded as true by others, and there is no need for facts to prove that what they say is true or false. That’s why many Chinese people think that they only need to say that their account was stolen by others for cheating and then the account was blocked, or that the game official banned their account indiscriminately, then the game official should take what they said seriously. , And then lift the ban for the banned account. These Chinese believe that there is no need for factual evidence to prove that what they have said is true, and that they only need oral statements to be regarded as definite evidence. The Chinese believe that proving the true nature of things does not require a clear factual basis to prove it. Therefore, many Chinese believe that taking out their own account remote login records, which does not clearly prove that their account has been stolen, can deceive game manufacturers to unblock their accounts. Because as long as you use the game network accelerator VPN, the login area of ​​your account will change with the VPN node area, so as long as the account that has used the VPN, the account will be logged in from another place, so as long as the account that has used the VPN to log in from another place will be It is possible to create the illusion of being stolen, so the fact is that logging in from another location does not clearly prove that your account was indeed stolen. The facts that can clearly prove that your account has been stolen are based on, for example, the confession of the criminal who stolen the account of another person, or the traces of information that had been stolen from your account by hacking software before the account was blocked. To be precise, the hacking software stealing the trace information of your account does not fully prove that your account is really stolen, because you can use the hacking software to steal your account, and then forge the evidence of the stolen fake, and then you can use it. Fake evidence to deceive game manufacturers to lift the ban on the account that was blocked for cheating. Unless you can come up with factual evidence to prove that the hacking software stolen your account has nothing to do with you, only in this way can you fully prove that your account is really stolen. The point is that all three-year-olds know that there is no essential difference between the statement that cannot be proved by facts and the nonsense of the lunatics on the street, so they are completely unreliable.



任何说永劫卡顿不严重可以正常玩或说什么可以流畅不卡顿玩的说法都只是水军孝子为了忽悠人而编造的谎言所以永远不敢面对事实性验证 ，水军孝子的说法就和街上疯子没事实性的胡言乱语没有任何本质区别 ，这就像街上疯子随口来句明天就是末日所以大家应该把自己财产全部花光才对，然后你让疯子用事实性证明自己说的是真是假，疯子就各种东扯西拉逃避事实性验证 ，比如疯子说他可以证明只是不想证明 ，在比如疯子为了逃避验证反问你怎么证明明天就不会是末日呢 ，在比如疯子为了迫使你不在要求他验证 ，就说如果自己用事实性验证了那你就必须把自己全部财产都给他你敢答应吗 ，然后没脑子不懂得根据事实性明辨是非真假的憨憨听到疯子那样说就会因疯子的那句明天是末日这句话而感到忧虑困扰，不断考虑明天到底是末日还是不是末日呢 ，到底该不该把自己钱花光呢 ，疯子虽然没有用事实验证自己说的是真是假 ，但疯子让别人拿出事实性证明不会是末日别人也拿不出确切证据那不就证明了明天也还是有可能是末日 ，所以没脑子的憨憨就会不断忧虑明天到底是末日还是不是末日到底该怎么办啊不断的被疯子的一句明天是末日这句话给困扰烦恼这不就是纯粹的愚昧吗 ，所以说但凡有脑子的都该清楚任何没事实性验证的说法和事物，都和街上疯子的胡言乱语没有任何本质性差别，所以根本不可信。聪明人都只信经得起事实性验证的事物或说法 ，而疯子的那句明天会是末日这话本身只属于是没能被事实性验证的说法那么聪明人就只会当作是完全不可信的屁话所以根本就不会被这句话影响更不可能因这句屁话而困扰烦恼





这就像水军孝子们随口编造的我可以流畅不卡顿玩永劫是同样的道理 ，既然任何说永劫流畅不卡顿水军孝子们不能用开直播玩永劫这种没有造假可能明确可信的办法证明自己说法的真假 ，那么任何说永劫流畅不卡顿的说法都只是和疯子胡言乱语一样没事实性验证的不可信屁话而已 ，而没脑子的憨憨就会因为没事实性验证的屁话去折腾自己的电脑花费冤枉钱换配置结果被水军孝子嘲笑死 ，而聪明人在永劫可流畅不卡顿玩这句话没被事实性验证前根本就不会信只会当作是屁话所以就不可能被水军孝子给忽悠欺骗 ，就像我之前说的 ，大家可以自己去永劫直播间把观看清晰度调最高开个全屏自己去观察主播玩永劫的流畅卡顿度 ，看自己是否能接受会不会影响到自己的正常游玩自己用亲身体会事实性去验证才靠谱 ，自己观察后发现卡顿严重发现游戏品质差那就说明永劫垃圾是事实 ，而对于水军孝子为了忽悠人而撒谎说的什么我看主播玩很流畅我自己玩很流畅等等任何没事实性验证的说法都只属于不可信的屁话 ，除非能拿出事实依据证明自己的说法才可信 ，比如明确指出哪个主播不卡顿然后你自己去观察发现真的不卡顿才可信 ，比如说可以流畅玩的除非能开个现场直播玩永劫用事实性演示出自己真的可以流畅玩才可信 ，至于什么图片或视频事实是都包含了造假可能所以根本不可信 ，比如图片完全可以打人机帧数高时进行截图所以根本不能证明永劫是否真的可以流畅玩 ，还有视频也可以在人少服务器压力小或者永劫最流畅的时候拍个视频造假 ，因为玩过永劫的都该清楚永劫有时候会相对流畅很多有时候又突然变得非常卡顿 ，所以视频和截图显然充满了造假伪证不可信因素所以不能当作证据 ，有脑子的都清楚只有开个直播玩永劫才是没有造假可能值得相信的验证办法





还有但凡玩过游戏有脑子的都清楚如果永劫卡顿是玩家电脑问题就应该是一直玩起来都是同样的卡顿程度才对 ，不可能是今天玩流畅而明天却突然卡顿变严重，或者变得越来越卡顿也就是游玩卡顿流畅度在不断变化 ，因为有谁玩单机游戏会是今天玩卡顿明天玩又突然流畅吗都只会是第一次玩是什么效果那么之后玩都会是同样的效果 ，除非电脑换配置或更新出异常才会玩起来卡顿流畅度发生变化 ，也就是只要自己电脑没有发生变动那么玩单机游戏的游玩效果就始终都只会是相同的效果感受 ，所以这个事实性就足以证明永劫有时玩流畅有时变的突然卡顿严重就说明永劫的卡顿问题只是游戏本身的变化导致的绝对不可能是玩家电脑导致的 ，简单说各方面的事实性都已经完全证明了永劫的卡顿严重只是因为游戏本身的品质差而导致和什么玩家电脑等等其他因素都没有关系 ，而任何间接或直接说永劫可流畅不卡顿运行的说法或什么图片视频也都只是些经不起事实性验证不可信的造假和谎言 ，所以但凡有脑子的都只会非常肯定永劫就是个品质垃圾纯粹靠水军孝子们用各种手段谎言去带节奏忽悠别人骗人购买入坑的渣游 ，不需多说不必争辩我已经说得很详细很透彻了所以三岁孩子都该懂 ，而任何没脑子憨憨或水军孝子们没事实性验证的说法或造假伪证也只等于是街上疯子没事实性的胡言乱语所以根本不必理会 ，因为正常人是不会搭理疯子乱叫的"

12185,greatest game e ver
12186,"Its a good game, Sekiro + For Honor + Battle Royal

still needs some performance optimization but gameplay wise, its very fun specially with friends. They also added new weapons and characters making it more fun to try different combo"
12187,"I bought this hoping it would be a large-scale battle grounds game, like pubg but with swords, and bows and ninja stuff, but it's just another japanese mmorpg with an options menu reminiscent of cheap mobile games with the Daily Gifts, Sale of the day and what not.

The game started and it Lagged to Shit and was unbearable, and the ""Character Customization"" Is just editing the face, Not what I think of when I hear those words."
12188,The only things they have to fix is match matching problems so I don't have to play with high rank players.
12189,Booba
12190,"tl;dr It's a good game, with a rather intricate combat system that is otherwise ruined by bad performance. 

get hit? stutter
hit the enemy? stutter
enemy doing something across the map, just inside render range? stutter.

it's endless, whether you play on the lowest or highest settings, whether DLSS is on or off, the game just doesn't stop stuttering. They gotta do something because I know i'm not the only one experiencing this. 

RTX 2060
i5-10600 
16gb ram
and the game is installed on an SSD

I know it's not the best system, but this should 110% be able to run this game nigh flawlessly. Especially given what the game's recommended specifications are.

Just for reference, remember the days when PUBG just released? the absolute state of that game? performance wise, the current feeling of this game is similar.

Oh and these aren't micro-stutters either, these are full on system seizure stutters, taking anywhere between 1-5 seconds for the game to start rolling again."
12191,This is a great game. never  seen so much customization for character's face. A battle royale with parkour. What else could I need.
12192,"Conclusion: Good game, bad servers ."
12193,This game is really good if you like PvP
12194,( In my opinion ) it deserves the best game of the year <3
12195,SOOOOOO WORTH
12196,"So bad!  it seems like a game that specially designed for the Chinese people.    But as far as I know, It's not even a good game in China.     I mean , Chinese are good at making mobile game  and some moba games.        But this?  I won't sacrifice my freedom of speech to play this game which is not as good as a shootout, nor is it as cool as an RPG for sure!"
12197,its good i like it. like a dmc battle royale with bodacious anime womxn
12198,"Waited a month and a half, its way more refined and fluid.

Forget all the bs battle royals vs 14 year olds who only know shooting. This is about outplaying and outskilling others. This is probally the go to game for me after years of trying to find something actually fun."
12199,feels like a mobile game
12200,"I get it AU has a tiny player base comparing with other regions, so you guys didn't tend to make a Oce server
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE, they DON'T spamming wrong messages in your official discord "" there will be an Australian server at official launch"" 
like WTF? Wasting people's time for what?  OR your guys just too stupid to realize OCE is not part of SEA?
REFUND IMMEDIATELY."
12201,"cant play properly, glitch"
12202,"The  game has great design, animations and eye candy, it runs smoothly and the combat is fun and very interesting."
12203,"Good game overall, possible some balance issues between different weapon types but thats to be expected on day 1 from any game like this. Anyone complaining that the first few games are bot matches obviously didnt read anything about the beta tests. Then they want a refund for being bad at the game which isn't a good reason but whatever floats your sinking boat. Only thing i wish is that the battle pass actually gave you some gold in the free version as this isnt a f2p game and other games like this which are free do.

Putting this seperately as i really do enjoy the in depth character customization that you can do for each character, which alongside skins make each character you play as personalized for each player"
12204,it's not ok
12205,"Pls support Vietnamese language
Also Pls let player bind button to easy way to control skill,thank you
At least this is a nice game"
12206,So far so good. will give a full review after more hours of play time but wanted to put my positive review in for the moment.
12207,"I don't know why i'm block 40FPS ,"
12208,"   Gameplay is fluid and intuitive and has much more depth than I had originally thought. For $20 I highly recommend this game especially if you're a fan of this art/play-style. Honestly the negative reviews have been far too harsh and some blatantly racist/anti-china.

  There is huge counter-play and a fairly high skill cap so i can see why some people are getting discouraged (they're bad). Cosmetics are beautiful and my weak spot.. but take it or leave it because you have complete access to everything you need and no pay to win. As far as the ""It should be free-to-play"" i disagree. The amount of times a BR stayed free to play and gets riddled with hackers because they can remake an endless amount of accounts is far too many.. i am happy to have a pay wall to discourage such things.
   
   As for bots.. yes it is pretty obvious that some are bots but I have noticed and have been told by others that the more matches you play the less you will see and more players will pop up. I actually enjoyed this gradual build up because it allowed me to get used to all the map had to offer at a casual pace and by the time I was seeing players I had a confident grasp on the gameplay. All in all i have been loving it and can't wait for more."
12209,"NO Play
dog is no play"
12210,"Pretty good so far, haven't had any trouble playing or laggy servers."
12211,played  the beta and it wasnt that good at all bought it and it still isnt that good plus i dont really see a difference between how it played in the beta and the release now i have 2.1hours and cant refund its not worth the price wait for it to go on sale
12212,.
12213,The movements gave me a headache very jolty and choppy
12214,"A paid game with a bad hard/soft-currency system and Battle Pass and Lootboxes, The game is deliberately designed to allow players to recharge to get a complete experience, such designers should be sent to prison.
一个付费游戏不仅有糟糕的软/硬货币系统（古币/金块）甚至还有战斗通行证和付费开箱，该游戏故意设计成玩家充值才能获得完整体验，这样的设计师应该被送进监狱。"
12215,"Day one - This game is sick. It feels like the old Prince of Persia game but a battle royale. Abilities are intuitive and each weapon has it's own skill combos / abilities.

The glyph system seems really in depth with a lot to unlock. I'm really looking forward to a point where people have invested time to git gud and start maxing out glyph pages.

I feel like this game is getting a lot of hate just for being Chinese, and several I've seen that have less than an hour playing... but you don't even unlock talents and alternate abilities until you've gotten through several rounds and the first few are only against bots.

It's pretty clear that we've been fighting players after going through a few rounds now and when people start countering and evading attacks it really gets fun.

Going back in for more but wanted to help balance out the reviews. Do recommend, especially for $20!"

12217,"Very nice very smooth, nice visuals. Approachable but also may have a good enough skill ceiling. I heard there aren't OCE servers so yeah. Otherwise 9/10 so far"
12218,i got 4 hours in and i feel like i only play with/against bots what are the odds of your team for random que and NOBODY TALKS
12219,The best melee battle royale with actual though put behind its mechanics and gameplay. Map design is amazing. Gameplay is now more balanced than on the launch. Technical issues with fps were resolved. The only downside is that this game just needs more players.
12220,epic game
12221,"bad optimisation, bots, cash shop with a bunch of different currencies.
Yep, it's definitely Chinese, confirmed by yours truly."
12222,nice game
12223,Lots of fun with endless melee battles!
12224,GREAT GRAPHIC WOULD YOU LIKE !
12225,it's so poorly optimized and this game should be free with all the in game add on..

12227,Nice
12228,"Pretty good so far, just have to go through the 3ish bot games at the beginning first."
12229,"Awesome game, don't mind the haters."
12230,"well given my laptop having 8 gb ram and 2gb vram having a hard time staying at 60fps in lowest setting is no wonder. so but game seen quite good.i endup here ty to yoto being in this game, ya just bought this game cos i see yoto and i am like i must get it. i will just wait and see a bit how it turn out.

pre order. refund. buy it  refund. now buy again like it or not i am gonna stick with this game now.

edit. after first 2 game of playing with both start meeting a lot of pvp there are still few bots in each match match but like 50 to 10 or 55 to 5 or 45 to 15 so it ok. although i want them to completely remove bots . but i am enjoying my time playing this. at other than a bit lag strike sometime. it is really grate game,"
12231,"Melee centric battle royale with a touch of gunplay all centered around the medieval era. Absolutely bonkers. The gameplay mechanics are remarkably fluid, huge skill ceiling, tons of skins and unlockables(paid and otherwise). 8/10 and for just $20, very worthwhile."

12237,"- Great Performance (do not install on an HDD)
- Don't listen to steam reviews regarding balance. (Every Character/Weapon is used in top 100) 
- Bots until 1200 pretty much extended tutorial .

12241,"This game is absolutely worth playing! Super fun, great easy to follow tutorial that hammered out the basics and was fun.

THEN????

You jump right into your first quick match. Get ready because this game is unlike any other. Classic battle royal but done right! Great map design, beautiful, bloody, each character has insane moves that still seem to be balanced reasonably. 

Each weapon feels and acts differently with different combos you can just kind of pick up by spamming until you get something that feels right. The control system as a whole is INSANELY INTUITIVE.

Well done.... 5-STAR <<< MUST PLAY WITH SOME BUDDIES AND ENJOY!!!! >>>

"
12242,"Good Game, but does need a few optimization patches that should be easy fixes."
12243,amazing game for its price. Something fresh in the market. AT LAST
12244,"The Game is great, such a unique playstyle, artstyle and addition the the over saturated and stale battle royale genre. The game has a great foundation and a promising future. The devs seems to really be looking for good feedback to move the game in the right direction. To all the people crying about playing against bots in their first hour or 2, its only for the beginning to get players acclimated to the game. It blows my mind that people are shitting on the game over bots when a game like fortnite is flooded with bots at all levels of play. And for the people crying about optimization the game literally says upon opening that you need to have it installed on an ssd to run correctly. I have it on my ssd at max settings and it runs like butter. 9/10 game, I'm all for the future of it and cant wait to see what changes and additions they add. Don't let the negative nancies turn you off from trying it, it's 100% worth the 20 bucks."
12245,"Good game, should be play more than 5 hrs. 1-5 first round, you usually fight bot :))"
12246,This game is extremely fun.
12247,"This game has the deepest combat system I've EVER seen in a battle royale. I could play it for years, but it has a fighting game's level of depth ""problem"" that will turn casual gamers away if the devs don't upgrade the tutorial and make training mode available. 
It's combat is built around high-level, hype play, where the devs considered so much in advance. For example, a player will figure out that you can use your grappling hook, not just to traverse, but to cancel combos into it as an extender. Thankfully, because of the hook doesn't track, you don't end up with broken, Naruto Storm dash-cancel, combo loops, and there's a way for the opponent to get out and retaliate into mind games. 
However, a casual gamer is nowhere near considering these types of situations, so, to them, an ""AoT""-hook that doesn't track just seems like dumb game design and they'll stop playing before they even know that there's so much they don't know.
The devs will have to find a way to introduce the game's depth to ALL players, if they don't want this game to just become one where only high-level people stick around and enjoy it."
12248,"It's a battle royale, the game isn't free, it has a paid battle pass, it has premium currency, it has outfit skins, weapon skins, emotes, poses, etc. All the reviews criticizing the game simply for including all of the aforementioned features can literally be ignored. What game doesn't have these this day and age? I swear some people buy the game simply because it's on the front page and then complain when it's not what they were expecting. And whether or not it's chinese spyware, I guarantee there's also american spyware running when you simply boot up your computer.

The character creation is unheathily deep. I wouldn't have expected the game to even have this feature let alone as in-depth. The game is actually fun to play, because it's different. There's firearms in the game but they aren't something you can rely on to win a fight. You wouldn't bring a flintlock rifle to a greatsword fight, I can guarantee you. Once the fight gets personal, guns don't help, save for the shotgunny pistol.

It has a bit of a combo system, it's fairly simple but each weapon type has its own combos, so it takes a lot of getting used to especially when you're picking stuff up and trying them out. Each ""Hero"" has their own special abilities, and those abilities can also be altered to slightly change the behavior of the skills, which does actually change how you approach a fight. There also seems to be a ""Glyph"" system or a type of loadout that lets you equip different stat-bolstering passives. Each Hero has a set of challenges unique to themselves called ""Cultivations"" which require your to do certain challenges using said hero, and level their cultivation up, unlocking some unique items like skins and also loot crates. 

It's a really fun game so far. I can tell immediately if a new game that I play is something that I'll want to play again the next day, and this definitely is one of them. It has deathmatch modes and solos, and the team mode is up to 3 players on a team (60 in a match, 20 squds total)."
12249,لعبه جميله
12250,"There aren't OCE servers, but OCE and AUS have shit internet to begin with in kangarooland. Good game, great milkers. GG

EDIT: OCE and SEA server coming soon."
12251,"Pretty fun, combat and connection is really smooth not sure how people are lagging."
12252,"Edit: Added a blurb about the chaotic nature of the game being due to server connectivity issues, rather than gameplay design flaws. 

For this I feel like I have to write more than just a score. 
I personally, enjoyed the combat. I don't think it's anything too high brow, nor do I think it's bad. I like the idea of a melee focused Battle Royale, but there are some issues that I have with it that I want to talk about.

Cons:
-A battle royale that costs money feels pretty...outdated. On top of this, they still have loot boxes and battle passes, which is not a good thing.
-The bots. Dear God, the bots...I played about 5 matches or so, and every single one of them, I came in first place, and had double digit kills. During this, I only had my armor broken a single time. It's blatant how stacked with bots the game is.
-While the gameplay mechanics are fun, it's a chaotic mess DUE TO SERVER CONNECTION ISSUES. You're all over the place, swinging and flying all around, barely being able to see where you got hit from, or how. The game doesn't telegraph these things well enough, so fights quickly turn into who has the better armor and weapons, and who can click faster. 

Pros:
-Game is actually quite beautiful. It's nothing to write home about, but the game definetly has some good looks-- contrasting against most BR games, that aim to have a stylistic approach that way the game is accessible by the majority of people, this game is nice to look at.
-The freedom of movement is nice, and it feels good to climb and jump around in a Sekiro-esque style. 
-The combat is fun, when it's not a chaotic mess.

Overall, I think the fact that this game has a price tag, whilst still having micro transactions is scummy, and it doesn't feel refined enough, not even remotely. Plus the fact that bots make up 95% of each lobby, is pretty scummy. 

2/5 for now, maybe in the future it could be better."
12253,it nice for me
12254,"Improved a lot from the beta, included performance/gameplay mechanic and weapons"
12255,BR with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon flavors
12256,ye
12257,Overall well designed game. Never been a fan of games similar to Final Fantasy but this game is awesome!
12258,"If Sekiro had a battle royale option, this would be it."
12259,chill game
12260,"game go brr.
the bad reviews saying you only fight bots are like 20% true. you fight bots for you first 2-3 games (till level 5)
but that's only when you're new, so...

Edit: lol there's an item that causes undogable giant lasers to fall out of the skill in a huge area.(well, you CAN dodge, but there is zero indication the attack is coming so getting a dodge is pure luck) 

Said lasers auto kill through full purple armor and full health with a tier 2 health upgrade.
this alone automatically makes the game fucking awful, as late game fights become ""who has the most charms to spam lasers?""


Edit 2: Go play Spellbreak instead. A few other Naraka reviews mentioned Spellbreak, which made me try it, and it's 100x better. There is no melee, but it's still a fantasy setting. You use magic and skills instead of guns, so it's still a refreshing non-shooter. It's superior to Naraka in absolute every category, except maybe visual, as Spellbreak's art style is similar to Fortnite. (Looks a lot better than Fortnite though.)

Spellbreak has amazing reviews, but not enough people playing it. Let's change that, instead of wasting more time on Naraka."
12261,like
12262,"Use my code:

12263,Bad game. Refund before its too late.
12264,No waifu no laifu
12265,"TLDR: Its a fun Wuxia action game that's a hero BR with some annoying micro transactions (not pay to win just skins). 

Note: I did play the Beta.
They Ease you in into the game with bots but if you get past that and start playing against other users fights can be difficult. Seems like you can get pretty deep with combat as you can change up hero abilities as you unlock them, glad to see you seem to unlock them now as you level instead of buying them. A little peeved about the battle pass and crates after paying a entry fee but its not too different from similar games like PUBG. As for performance it runs fine, though i do have a beefy PC so not sure how it goes on lower spec machines. Overall nothing really throws me off and I enjoy playing it give it a try if your a fan of BRs or action games in general."
12266,A battle royale for fighting game fans
12267,"Naraka Bladepoint is one of the/ if not the best battle royale I've ever played! The Combat is super fun, smooth, and addicting. The character customization goes beyond what i ever thought it would, and The cosmetics you get from the Mythical Crates are super sick :D a plus side to this is it doesn't seem to impossible to get either without spending money because after only 3 crates i got a purple Katana sword skin!! (there are better rarity skins) but still the one i got is super cool! The characters have their own special abilities and it all seems pretty fair and balanced. I haven't yet noticed a character that seems way to Over Powered which is definitely nice to see in a game like this. I've been waiting for this game for 6 months and i can honestly say I'm proud with the turnout and i WILL be playing ALOT more of this AMAZING game 10/10 would recommend and i already have recommended it to 4 of my friends who all have it and love it just as much :) i hope this review helped you decide to buy this game because its worth every penny. <3"
12268,Very fun take on a battle royale. would reccomend
12269,good.
12270,No OCE server. The combat needs good ping to feel smooth.
12271,DO NOT BUY I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH IT IS A CASH GRAB DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12272,A lot more fun than I expected. The combat is addicting.
12273,"Gameplay is overall fun.
Definitely more enjoyable too me than the same re-named BR shooters being recycled.
A Demo that allowed you to play for a few hours would be nice so that people can try the game more without relying on steam refunds would be nice. The game will live or die based on just community and not many Paid BR's are in the market currently."
12274,"You play with bot for the first 2 hours 
the blocking system and parkour is chunky 
but graphics is pretty nice
standard battle royale Items system
The skin system is like Overwatch where you open boxes
but there is somethings like runes which gives stats 
If this game is F2P I will recommend but maybe just wait for sales"
12275,"I thought I bought a ""multiplayer"" game

Edit: Devs have now been more transparent about bots"
12276,"Pros:
Great Movement
Tiddies Jiggle When You Move
Variety of Weapons and Loot
Hit Reg is good even on 100 ms (OCE)
60 Players is the Perfect Player Limit 
IT'S A GOD DAMN SAMURAI BATTLE ROYALE LIKE WHAAAA!

Cons:
Literally my only con so far is the Lag so please add Australian Servers
"
12277,"Other than some bugs, the 20 different menu screens and microtransactions being shoved into your face,  and fighting bots for most of the first matches, it's a good game with great character customization, weapons, and decent combat. A fun time with friends."
12278,Lengkeng !!
12279,not bad
12280,The community is toxic AF. The game itself is just 'okay' for the price. LOTS micro-transactions for cosmetics that require premium currency. Still needs more polish as combat and parkour animations are janky and don't really flow into each other causing weird stutters coupled with horrible lag.
12281,yes
12282,"So far on my 3hrs of gameplay I have enjoy the system level of the character and the cosmetic as far as the level of character customization on the champions to make them unique from others, Another thing I forgot to mention the leveling of the runes of this game. As for the graphics and level of details on models and environment are a pleasing plus to my eyes. I have come to really enjoy the game even to the point of almost buying its ""battle pass"" feature. I give a 10/10 of satisfaction with this product."
12283,"PROS:
-new style of battle royale
-great graphics
-fast paced gameplay
-great character customization

CONS:
-add in depth lore to the characters
-streamline ranking system per region / server

12290,"after a couple hours, I am rewriting this review. The game looks good. If they fix their ping issues on usa servers, would be a dope game. I can see it being good game later down the line."
12291,fUN
12292,This game is awful. Take your 20$ somewhere else.
12293,"Runs way better then the beta did, bots seems to be lessened after the first few matches, overall a fun game when your fighting other players from your own region, cross region servers gotta go though bro. Going up against 陰戶殺手 and his posse of 1000 ping warriors lagging all over the place ain't it bro. That being said I'm still enjoying it just like I did the beta. 9/10"
12294,"I thought the extremely buggy UI and hard freezes when joining games would've been fixed after the beta, but I guess not. Once you actually get in game, it's pretty addicting.
Any reviewers saying the game is easy or complaining that they only fought bots and they have only an hour or less playtime, never made it past the tutorial.
Yes, rating 1000 to 1200 is the tutorial, why do you think queues take 3 seconds. Once you're past that, you better start learning how and when to counter and parry or you're gonna get fucked."
12295,poor optimization
12296,the best game ever
12297,Skinner box trash.
12298,Cannot recommend until there are OCE servers.
12299,FUNN FUN FUUNNN!
12300,"Boob Physics, Chinese Spyware, pairs you with bots to ease you in the game and dominating them only to find out you actually suck when fighting other players.

Unoptimized and has expensive graphical effects you can't turn off like Subsurface Scattering, TAA is really blurry and I suggest just sticking to MXAA. Lags during combat which was not present during beta. Boob Physics.

Great gameplay, steep learning curve, actually requires you to be stealthy accompanied by great sound design and Boob Physics.

Launch has been rocky, but if these issues will be addressed, you'll have a blast."
12301,picked this up on a whim and became addicted 9/10 so far for me
12302,"Go in practice mode and train the counter mechanic ! The game is actually pretty good if you can manage to defend yourself.
"
12303,awesome game
12304,"Terrible game, don't buy please"
12305,"All the bad reviews are just complaining about the game giving you bots to fill up your games early on, so that you can learn the game. If you're already an absolute god at battle royales and action games, then this problem only persists for like the first hour, and if not, it isn't a problem, it'll help you."
12306,good
12307,"The game is much more optimized now, than back in beta test. Back in the beta test, when the Dragon came out from the sky, the FPS drops like hell xDD (now it's much more stable and playable). My potato laptop only be able to play at 720p back then in the beta test and only got 30 FPS or so, now I can play it at 1080p and average above 60 FPS.

I think the only thing that the Dev must fix is the server, quiet laggy."
12308,I first gave the game a thumbs down due to poor fps and server connections. I uninstalled and reinstall almost a year later and it runs much better. The game is definitely one of my favorites so changing to a thumbs up.
12309,Great BR will play more
12310,"game is very buggy and clunky, feels like it shouldnt have been released for another year at least"
12311,Oof I like dis game
12312,"Get matched against 2000 ping China #1 players The Game.

The gameplay is very nice for a BR.
However that's pretty much the only good thing. Gameplay and combat. Everything else is pathetic.
And even then, the game matches you with Chinese players. So get ready for desyncs.

The game will match me and my friends (All in Canada) against Chinese players who have clearly played the game for 100s of hours already.
But even worst is the greed of this Chinese company. It is a paid game with lootboxes AND battle passes.
The game itself is fine. But this kind of greedy BS is pathetic and the broken matchmaking just makes everything worst.

Also, your COUNTER INPUT becomes BASIC ATTACKS while attacked/staggered.
This has been an issue since beta. 4 Months +. This is pathetic devs."
12313,"Game is amazing. Great combat, great movement, awesome art and style! Definitely worth the money!"
12314,Good!

12319,"I really love the way they put Hack and slash into the battle royal, but it could be more way better if they add  1st-view :3 I think <3"
12320,No Australian server thats unplayable
12321,"The game feels mediocre in many ways but I'm giving it a positive review for the gameplay itself. 

It has a good base idea of a battle royale which emphasises movement and melee range combat, which it could build upon, but I feel this'll be a case of bad management and business practices burying an otherwise interesting idea.

Some caveats, things to consider before you buy:
- English translation is pretty bad but clear enough to not be too much of an issue. 
- First matches are against bots which are stupid but give you experience on how the game works before you get mauled by other players. 
- Glyph system will make  higher level players more powerful than lower level ones as they get more passive bonuses from the glyphs. The glyphs can only be opened by leveling up your account aka playing for long enough.

Monetisation and business practices:
- The more expensive versions of the game have their bonus items unlocked only after 2 hours of play so you cannot refund at that point.
- The existence of a cash shop is troubling. Considering that this is a paid game, there should not be such a system implemented at all.

Feel free to keep an eye on the average player count through SteamCharts to see if this game is still alive a few months later and then make your purchase - or get in now. 

It's not a bad game just feels like it won't stay alive for long as it is. For now (1st week) it has been gaining more players daily so maybe it DOES have legs to stand on."
12322,"I found this by surprise on my Store feed this evening and have not been disappointed.

So to give a breakdown:
You start off with one of seven Heroes that you can fully customize to your liking, adding Hair, facial features, etc. Each Hero has their unique set of Skills/Ultimate they can choose form as you level them through regular play. In addition to this, you can also equip glyphs you either obtain via levels/achievements or buy in the Pay store. These glyphs further enhance your Hero for things like Health, Grapple Distance and even Luck to improve loot drops.

Now like many other Battle Royale Games, the meat of the customization comes from Weapon/Character skins which you can either manually unlock by buying the skins directly, or by opening Loot Crates you earn through regular play and Dailies. Every Hero has skins ranging from Common to Elite with one Special skin per Hero.

The weapon system has both Ranged and Melee, with each Weapon having its strengths and Weaknesses. You also have a grappling hook fro map traversal and for closing the distance between you and players. Reloading/Repairing uses Weapon crates found throughout each map. During a match, you have a enclosing Wall called the Shadow that gets smaller over time (Ala PUBG) and deals damage if you sit in it. As it gets smaller the interval between shrinks gets smaller too. Lastly, you have random Epic Shop Chests that spawn at random intervals during the match that contain Legendary gear for free from the Loot Goblin inside.

Overall, its been an interesting play, though Ranked and Normal modes seem mostly bot filled atm. Bloodbath is, as the name implies, absolutely brutal though."
12323,"I have made a purchase of the Ultimate DLC, however I have yet to receive my treasures yet. the Immortal treasure."
12324,"The game is pretty fun, the movement is a little clunky but aside from that the combat is pretty fun, def a learning curb tho"
12325,"A Honest review from a casual Gamer.

Short Review: DO NOT BUY AND PLAY THE GAME FOR NOW!

Detailed review:

Pros:
- Fun mechanics to learn and master
- A refreshing Battle Royal game mixed with Fighting Game
- Great Graphics

Cons:
- Low Quality of life
- Season quest are un-accessible when I bought the game
- Unrewarding quest unless you bought a Season pass
- Long Queue time (I have 11 hours of play time on steam and only 1 hour of actual Match time and 4+ hours of Practice)
- Matchmaking is broken, after playing 2 solo games I am always match-up with a 100+ games players, one time I played with someone on leaderboard."
12326,Nice Boobs Royale
12327,yes
12328,"--- 
Cash grab, gold is a currency you can't earn playing the game.
If you want to buy the (around) 12 dollars battle pass you have to buy way more gold (20 dollars worth of) because the other option isn't enough (10 dollars), quite shady.      

The game is clumsy. Your character is always moving and doing unnecessary movements.
1st games are against bots only, you will win
next games are filled with players, you will get destroyed if you didn't play during the beta

Stutters all the time if you don't have the game installed on a SSD and the game is constantly reminding you to use a SSD.
You want to quit the game? There is aaaalways a screen asking you to follow their social accounts, and you can only click on ""stop remind it to me for today""... TODAY? F***** leave me alone.      

The roster is really poor.

However came with the idea of weapon durability needs to be fired. You'll fight 3 min and then your weapon will break... if you can't repair it with a kit you found, you are screwed. 

I really dislike the runes system (similar to League of Legends)
I reallllly dislike the ""disarmed"" system...

The game yells ""I'm a Chinese game"" all the time = Made in China quality.
There are multiples spelling mistakes.

Why does it want to access my ""location data"" ? WTF, what to do for???

Game isn't region lock so you will play against chineses that own the game for months. Yes, even outside of the Asian servers, with their awful ping.

Hackers are here, and when you talk about it on Steam forums : 
""You have been ban from the NARAKA: BLADEPOINT community for your post in: « There are hackers in game already :( » :""


Overall if you are looking for a BR, Spellbreak is way better than Bladepoint, and I dislike Spellbreak...


+++

The customization is nice.
The characters are cool.

I unfortunately played more than 2 hours, I'm an idiot because I spent more than 1h checking the customization options, and my refund has been denied..."
12329,So far I like it. Can definitely tell the first few games are bots. I feel like they should really tell the player they are playing bots for a few games and they would avoid some of the reviews I've read where people think they only play bots. Overall the combat is fun and I'll keep playing it casually.
12330,Im on fire :D
12331,"this game doesn't have oce servers so its a no go for me, played with 100 ping and is sucked. 

oce players like this comment and lets get the attention we need."
12332,Here for the Booba
12333,"I spent two hours just creating my character,so there is no in-depth experience of the game content yet,I look forward to the game part being very fun that i can enjoyed this.

If the game is not worth the price, maybe I will change my recommendation in the future."
12334,"movement clunky, no sidestrafe options
third person camera is a bit too close for my liking
customizations are limited, you cannot edit the pre-ordered hero
combat is no fun at all
music is annoying, the first thing you will disable

not worth the 20 bucks for me, its no better than other free BRs."
12335,"Great combat system and the grappling hook is such a fun design! Definitely the best melee battle royale experience! Hope this game strive!

Update after 20hrs:
1. Please find some ways to support HDD better, a lot of players don't have SSD. It doesn't affect the moment to moment gameplay, but it may scare off people.

2. Please polish the network connection code or enable region restrictions. A lot of time there are other region players in the game. It's fine for the most part. But it can cause frustrations when parrying.

3. Please optimize the sensitivity of Left + Right Click parry, it triggers way too often as accidents (want to do horizontal attack then vertical but perform parry). Not sure if it's because of Network lag. And why can't parry interrupt normal attacks? It's frustrating that the reliable way to parry is always Crouch + Parry (to cancel animations) instead of just press the parry button. Parry feels like the top priority action, yet it feels not as responsive as expected.

4. If possible please optimize the UI. Right now it clusters with so many news/events/quests on the Lobby screen. Maybe collect them into one expandable section. 

5. If possible please optimize the UX of Cultivation. It's pretty deep in the UI layers.

6. Maybe do a free weekend early for this game? People are used to free to play BR, but I'm sure they will be willing to buy Naraka after the free trail (for the gameplay). It may sound like that this could trigger players who pay for the game at launch, but BR needs popularity to be sustainable and attractive. We all want this game to get the population it deserves. Maybe it's a good time to do a free weekend the next time a new hero releases."
12336,"Loved the character design, easy menus, loot box opening animation and the game play.

Didn't love the first few rounds being with bots (false sense of ""I am awesome!""). Once actual players came into the mix it became a lot more fun.

Overall would recommend and totally worth the $20 once you get past the bot intro rounds."
12337,its like dark souls PVP
12338,"Clunky, clunky, clunky"
12339,"Pretty sure the game is filled with bots, even in ranked. Makes it extremely boring, and you never can predict when you will encounter an actual good player"
12340,"Yoto Hime Supremacy. Yes.

Cool skins aswell, aesthetically pleasing to my eyes atleast. Rekomend"
12341,"With all of these micro-transaction,this better be a Free-To-Play game than a Buy Then Pay More Game!
DLCs do not worth its cost!"
12342,I really like the combat. Its a nice change of pace for a BR game...Its not perfect but nice and simple enough to get into.
12343,Lots of ridiculous criticism at the moment. I'm enjoying this as a change of pace for BR games.
12344,"I played this game during beta and enjoy it currently on release also. Early on, it has the issue of having bots populate lobbies. It feels spammy to the naked eye, but has a high learning curve in terms of movement + timing. Its an incredible combat system in a game with a lot of potential. 

Highly recommend if you can get past the bot games early on.
"
12345,Really enjoy the game so far. Don't let the mix reviews put you away since most of them are just trolls xd
12346,"After 2-3 matches there will be no bots
Fun game, just dont buy the ultimate pack"
12347,"was actually hyped for this game cause it looked really cool. 
the graphics are nice and the character design for all the chars look pretty dope, you also have a lot of customization options for each char, like outfit, hair, headwear etc. 
-now the real part-
the game itself is really bad optimized so you will get a lot of lag spikes and bad fps. (im running it on a pretty good machine)
there is no region lock as far as i know, so you will get lags from the connection part as well.(high ping)
- if you purchased the dlc with those 10 chests, you wont be able to open more than one since you need gold (pay2win currency) in order to open those, except the first one apparently. (what a joke)
- the combat itself felt really slow responsive,clunky and wasnt fun at all, maybe that was partly because of the high ping tho
gonna refund now, good luck and have fun to everyone who is still gonna play this game."
12348,"from first impressions this game is just a bit unplayable. my network speed is 500mbps down and up, low ping and jitter, yet the games networking is all over the place. quick melee combat is just useless when you either cant register a hit or get stuck in a lag screen for 90% of the time. i was even in the top two earlier, then lagged into the storm and died. i wont refund because its not burning a hole in my pocket, and i see that the game has a bit of potential. for now though, i would not suggest purchasing this game. if you are interested by its combat, look at reviews over the next few days and see if the problems are fixed."
12349,Feels like a mobile game
12350,"No SA and OCE servers, instead we're given a """"""node"""""" system that fixes aboslutely nothing. Refunded

Still no SA servers almost a year later."
12351,These bots had no chance against my Dark Souls skills. I am a Xbox One Dark Souls 3 PvE legend so i knew this would be easy work.
12352,This is probably the most entertaining and fun game I've ever played.
12353,"MILKY MILKY WARM AND TASTY!
MOMMY! MILKY! PLEASE BE HASTY!
REFRESHING DRINK FROM MOMMY'S UDDERS!
I WANT MOMMY'S AND NO OTHER'S!
GIVE IT! GIVE IT! GIVE IT NOW!

UNTIL YOU DO I'LL SCREAM I'LL SHOUT!
I'M CRY I'LL WHINE AND STOMP ABOUT!
UNTIL MY BELLY IS FULL AND HAPPY!
I REFUSE TO TAKE A NAPPY!"
12354,High Quality BR with all the smooth combat and great looting system
12355,This Game is great..   And to be real... Little BIG secret... First match is bots... Check all the reviews of people thinking they Dr. Mercs Respect because they put up some big time numbers... HAHAHA I LOVE IT
12356,"seriously wtf....why is this in chinese? My steam is english,, all downloads is in english..,.how the hell it turned out chinese? And there's no mention of this on the disclaimer that its chinese.,...."
12357,"Pro tip. If you look anywhere in the community, you'll find out that below 1200 rating, you are mostly paired up against bots in your lobby to ease you into the game. If you think the game takes no skill and you're dominating everyone on the face of the earth like this is your hidden calling, please keep this in mind. 

Otherwise, great game so far. Good variety of weapons, improved optimisation since beta, nice breath of fresh air."
12358,"So fun so far. Gameplay is fluid, pretty graphics. Played my first game and won. Got 7 kills and last guy died in the shadow realm."
12359,Remove the ranged weapons you cowards.
12360,"2 matches 
2 wins
35 Kills 
All BOTS"
12361,Worth.
12362,the beta are better than this global release. its so lag when on fighting. i didn't experience the lag on the beta before.
12363,dadwa
12364,牛逼游戏
12365,？？？？？
12366,this game has ultra mega huge boobas that bounce and jiggle everytime you swing a sword. i approve!
12367,its fun for 2 hours and then thats it.
12368,"Only got bot matches, not a battle royal game."
12369,optimization isnt good
12370,"This is my all time favorite battle royale! I played in the beta and have been waiting for its release ever since. There are swords, pistols, cool abilities....what more could you ask for? The mobility of the characters is amazing too. 10/10 would recommend. Super fun game to play with two other friends too in trios."
12371,After 2 hours of gameplay i won 2/2 battle royale and it started to bored me because the game play looks really snappy but on the other hand really spammy as well. I don't feel like it would a game to play for a long period of time.
12372,"Nice Wuxia action game with great atmosphere and environment. Quick and easy play. 

One match so far, 1st place against clearly a bunch of bots. Art direction is amazing. Playing on SEA server with ping of around 100 - not great. Not sure on the actual game mechanics yet, kinda figured out most stuff to do and the GUI. The tutorial did a good job. Combat seems pretty non complex, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as long as it's easy to use but hard to master - wait and see I guess, but it was a bit hack/slashy. There's a lot of stuff for sale - all cosmetic as far as I can tell. Lots of customization options and good looking characters, if you feel the need to spend your real life dollars. Longevity of this game (outside China) ? is hard to say at this point but I do think another 60 player BR is kinda optimistic. At this stage I'm on the fence regarding refund and whether I'll commit to the game, the 100+ ping and bot filled match bothers me a tad. But I need more time practicing combat.

Ran perfectly fine on my RTX 3070 with settings jacked to high @2560 x 1440. I experienced no bugs or glitches except a crash when I exited the game to windows."
12373,"Fantastic BR, one of the only good ones to play right now. Super refreshing, super skill based, lots of unlockables and customization. Such a fun fighting game"
12374,would recommend if it was just the character creator
12375,"The price of season pass is ridiculous, it's 1350 for the standard but u can only paid for 1200 or 3000.
"
12376,"Unique battle royale, finally"
12377,"It is a very nice game--probably the best PUBG-like game I have played in this year.It has the style of wuxia,and uses the battle pattern of spears,swords and bows instead of the guns in PUBG.I hope the game will go well."
12378,lol every part of this game is CLUNKY
12379,"This game has the potential to be great, so far it's a lot of fun. I have no issues with lag, the settings menus are nice and fleshed out."
12380,"Fair warning to those who only play with a HDD, this game stutters on a HDD and there is no way around it unless you have an SSD. There is a huge number of bots in your games. I had bots spawn in front of me at times whilst playing. The game is also filled to the brim with microtransactions, it almost feels like I'm looking at the menu of a mobile game. The idea of a melee-focused battle royale sounds fun as hell but I feel that they couldn't pull it off with this game. however, the one thing that I really liked about this game was the parkour and grapple hooks, it feels very much like Monster Hunter: Rise."
12381,"Wow Deluxe edition X10 treasure box need players to online 2 hours to obtain, which void your right to refund with steam policy"
12382,"It seems to have a lot of potential. The combat could be a little better but the movement is great and the game feels more about smart navigation and exploration than it does precision combat, which I think works in its favor."
12383,"I've held off on reviewing the game until a month after release. Here are my thoughts

+ Movement system is amazing
+ Combat is fun
+ Varied weapons
+ Great art design

- The devs refuse to ping-lock CN players, so they come to NA/EU servers to take advantage of their high ping (Dark Souls 3 flashbacks intensify)
- A quickly dying playerbase due to this ping-lock issue

If you plan to check this game out, make sure to wait a month or so for the devs to implement a ping lock. If they don't implement ping-lock, do not bother. I will update this review when ping lock is introduced

UPDATED: Game is dying, and has seen no improvements on these (and many other) issues.Uninstalled after 179 hours. It was worth the money at launch, but do not buy until the devs address the key issues mentioned by the community."
12384,"no australian servers, 130 ping and above unplayable"
12385,"Clunky ass mechanics, 0 skill needed"
12386,"Terrible monetization
excelent gameplay
really feels like a f2p game in terms of monetization"
12387,"Reached 2 hours, tutorials/UI tweaking etc and then 5 games of straight bots where you're just slaughtering the entire lobby. Even ranked mode matches you with bots. I understand the first match being filled with bots to familiarize yourself with the controls, but over an hour of grinding mind numbing bots that teach you nothing, please devs, know your audience. People aren't picking up BR's for the intense PvE.

Would have loved to of seen if the combat is actually decent vs other players, as is just felt super clunky against the bots with the counter system seeming very wonky, though that could be attributed to the bots spending most of their screentime jumping into the wall. Poorly optimized, running at 1440p with 110ish fps absolutely cranked my GPU up to insane temps, dropping the settings literally did nothing but make the game look worse, didn't take any load off. Really sad to not even be able to test the combat properly, but from what the game felt like it just doesn't feel worth the risk of passing refund window, which is a shame because a decent melee BR would've been great."
12388,"The game actually isn't bad at all. In fact, it's a lot of fun. You get to literally grapple hook around like you're in Attack on Titan. You have dark souls/Sekiro like combat. You have badass and interesting characters with their own unique abilities. The two handed sword is a little overpowered right now, but it's not anything that can't be nerfed later if deemed necessary. No idea where the hate is coming from. The first game you play with is supposed to be with bots to help you learn. The games after that will pair you with real players. This game is ultra unique and I love the concept already."
12389,mOnkAs!!!!
12390,游戏方面非常满意，充值方面我觉得稍微有一点点贵，随着以后种植内容变多玩家会不买账
12391,Keep your $20.
12392,There is a katana.
12393,Great combat experience!
12394,"This review was once positive, but i had to change it

NARAKA is probably the most unique BR game out there and its really, really great but... 
Its not a free to play game and it doesnt have a region lock = that means the player base is really small. 

I would say the game is definitely worth 20 bucks considering how good and well made it is, but thats just not how it works. Although NARAKA is very unique and different compared to all BR games out there, it just cant compete with games like COD Warzone, Apex Legends and Fortnite which are all free to play.
BR games are just meant to be F2P and people are used to it. 

Now about not having region lock and the player base ...
This is the biggest issue with the game. I am pretty sure that at least 70-75% of the player base are people from asian countries that do mostly play on EU/NA servers. 
Why is this a problem? In NARAKA having a bad connection/high ping actually gives you advantage, because you are being unpredictable and hard to get hit. Game is a lot about doing combos and using your parry but vs those people just nothing works. Its not fun when you spend so much time in queue and then the lobby is 90% of this. 

Its really unfortunate, because other than that the game is really great. I loved everything about it besides the things i just mentioned and balancing issues (i am looking at you Matari abusers)

Pretty sure this game could be really big if it was F2P and had a region lock but sadly that is never going to happen. 
Another great game with a lot of potentional ruined by a poor decision making... 
:("
12395,One of the best action games ever!
12396,really fun just bad servers
12397,So far pretty dam fun with quick thinking and good teamwork. What is with all the racists reviews so far?
12398,This game is unplayable. The lobbies are SUPER laggy.  Everyone is teleportings and maps doesnt load all the way in.
12399,"A refresher for Battle Royale! Who would imagine you can slash your way to the glory?

Pro: New type of BR focus on martial arts and weapon mastery.
Con: Need further optimization. Some of my slash doesn't register.

7.5/10 from me. I'll edit my review from time to time after I put more hours into the game."
12400,"First couple of hours and my impression is great!!!!!! The graphics are good, game play seems smooth so far. I have been looking for a game to play to off set my time on League, this is fun and refreshing as a pose to other BR's. Combat is fun and great when you get into a duel with someone same skill. Will come back to edit if needed."
12401,"Combat surrounds over a long ass stun, what a letdown when you have to rely on a overpowered stun to beat other people. Even the countering stun is so dam long, stun= dead. dumb concept"
12402,"Honestly I'm enjoying it more than I thought I would, and the game looks great visually if your PC can run everything on high. I get a steady 60 FPS+ and zero lag in the matches, so maybe people just have bad internet? Anyway I suppose some low points right off the bat is the game only has SEVEN characters, granted it just came out but that doesn't offer a lot of versatility. There is only one support/healer in the game, and some of the characters skill set seems weak or underpowered compared to others. Every character excels at something I suppose, but it's obvious some are better at killing than others as well. I had two people on my team playing Yoto Hime and she does seem incredibly broken, but I played Tarka Ji and got 11 kills, and enjoyed his skill set, so it really depends on how you want to play. One character is more stealth oriented and one is more CC oriented. 

As for the bots complaint? Well I don't know if I'm fighting bots or not, usually I don't play BR games because I suck at them, but I won my first match so either nobody knows how to play or the game is just full of bots. It doesn't really matter because I'm still having fun regardless. The game has your standard battle royale features, there is a battlepass. There is also a PREMIUM battlepass that you can buy for like $10 or $11. As far as I can tell everything in the game that you can earn is purely cosmetic. There are weapon skins, outfits, accessories, etc. Each weapon has it's own profiency tree that earns you weapon skins and if you max it out you get a cool avatar showing you've mastered that weapon, so that's kind of neat. Just small incentives to keep using a weapon or if you have a favorite weapon. 

I can't say which weapons are superior over others. I mostly use a katana and it's fun, also greatsword feels strong. I'm worried ranged weapons might be really busted and people will just run around and spam them from a distance. You have cannons, bow and arrows, pistols, repeating crossbows, etc. One person on my team had a repeating crossbow (I think) and it fired like a machine gun, just ate through people's healthbars, didn't really seem balanced at all. Overall though I like the eastern oriental aesthetics of the game, and while there are only 2-3 characters I care to play, the game itself is fun and looks great. I'm sure they'll introduce more heroes and hopefully patches will take care of any balancing issues."
12403,I know.
12404,"BOTS, YIKES."
12405,battle pass sim on top of mediocre BR gameplay
12406,"I'm so glad quick match is only against bots, until you're a high level. I bought this game just so I could dominate the A.I and feel like a Beast, mission accomplished. Playing against other people is overrated anyways. Money well spent, please add more modes with bots. Damn, it feels good to be a gangster!"
12407,"Very pleasing, great skins. Enjoying the graphics and gameplay."
12408,Best game ever just needs a Duos mode.
12409,"Looks pretty, but the combat really feels similiar to For Honor.. with 3 modes of attacking but Lock on system is poop and ultimate edition doesn't even bring anything good. Just two skins and 10 boxes you can't use until 2 hrs of gameplay aka when you can't refund :/"
12410,"it's jank as fuck  but full of soul (the worse coded it is the more soul it has, or so I've been taught)
there's a lot of complexity in both the gameplay systems and the cosmetic earning systems
maybe wait for free to play?"
12411,they spent all the money designing the boobies than the game
12412,"From my experience on playing this game. The gameplay is quite unique each battle feels fun, people can parry and unexpectedly ambush from out of no where. I can't speak for everyone but the gameplay is easy to learn and quite simple to play. The game is like a mixture of Black Desert and usual battle royale. In it's current state the game is definitely be fun for at least a couple of weeks or months but the content is quite less. Each game will allow players to spawn in a location within the zone. I would say if you want a new game to play try NARAKA out."
12413,Its a fun game
12414,WE THE BEST MUSIC DJ KHALED
12415,"**WARNING: HOT TAKES AHEAD**
It's not inherently a badly designed game as far as gameplay's concerned, but the developers probably bent over and let NetEase force a lot of the obvious Eastern market standards onto the eventual release. That or the Montreal studio is a literal front.

Global server, you'll be playing with Chinese players most of the time.

Early games are filled with bots to, essentially, fabricate false first impressions of the game and make you feel like you're good, thus selling you passed the refundable time period. I played about 3 games, won the first and last but lost the second. Honestly I should have lost all 3 I'm terrible at BR games in general. Winning those 2 games with over a fourth of the lobby's members really rubbed me the wrong way, false positives and all.

For a paid game, it's got:
- A Battle Pass
- A hard-currency/soft-currency system 
- Lootboxes(with a pity system)
- Pre-order bonus character that's normally locked behind progression. The character's pretty good tbh, probably the best kit in the game. Make of that what you will as skill is obviously a factor
- An Overwatch-like cosmetic system with arguably the same level of launch quality Overwatch skins (recolors and some frills here and there) - save for the pre-order character who arguably looks the best, further milking the horny.

I had trouble closing the program itself after attempting to close it, not sure if it's running, if you encounter that you'll probably want to go check your task manager for the only task running in Chinese, or at least, incomprehensible enough looking exe name.

Lastly, I think this game should be F2P, it's pretty and all but man does it feel forced. I'd recommend trying Spellbreak if you want to fill that non-FPS Battle Royale itch. I don't really recommend this game's community/socials either, lots of people willing to lose their cool over your negative review on the game."
12416,The people that are rating the game bad are the ones that are used to apex or other shooter battle royal. That need schooling how to play a fighting game. Git Gud
12417,down bad for Matari
12418,"First few games are bots. This is very annoying, let people choose to play against bots if they want. Dont force it.

I know it is just to get playtime over 2 hours before they rage quit. But I would like to actually play the game before my 2 hours are up.

What is most annoying about this is... THE GAME IS GOOD. Like really good. Very fun Ninja battle royale with high skill ceiling.

Get rid of the bots in ranked games and youll have an even better game."
12419,"So I was in two different Beta tests for this game, and after those two tests and the hour and a half I've gotten so far, I can still say that the game does need work.

 It's still early on, so you'll find a lot of bots in lobbies at first, and that's how it was in beta too. The game just needs time to hopefully grow a following. Also it could use some optimization on the graphics side. 
I love seeing that the devs are active with the community via their Discord server and all, so hopefully some things can be ironed out with players giving feedback.

I would recommend the game in a heartbeat, however it is not going to be an instant hit for everybody.
See how the game grows before jumping into it if you are skeptical. But the core gameplay is a ton of fun, even moreso if you're playing it with some friends.

Edit: I definitely didn't stick with the game like I planned to. Other games kinda came in and stole my attention, but it seems the game is keeping a growing community, enough to the point where I believe they held a championship?"
12420,"I pre order the game 2 weeks ago and got Yoto Hime. nice. 
A friend don't and he still got Yoto Hime. 
i feel ripped.

12421,good
12422,Great graphics and absolutely interesting experience in Battle Royale. Really enjoyed the fun.
12423,a battle royal that its pay to play ? okay okay its okay  but dude pay to play with a battle pass that cost 12$+ and u cant get back the coins from it to rebuy the next battle pass ? srsly ?  okay okay  wait the other skins cost gold too ?  WHAT THE FUCK  refunding
12424,a clunky mess littered with bots
12425,Terribly optimized. Missing sound effects. Probably the clunkiest game I've ever played in my life. Feels like your piloting a spastic tank engine. Also every single match is just you and 2 humans vs bots.
12426,The battle royale is all BOTS..... super boring until they replace AI with other players.
12427,Naraka Botpoint
12428,China is based and redpilled and so is this game.
12429,Feels very clunky. BR hype is already oversaturated.

12431,Seems good to me.
12432," a battle royale for fighting game fans and specially if youre a fan  of swordfighting  
 great graphics fun fighting mechanics some bugs here and there  but overall made a good impression for me"
12433,Too much laggy chinese players and overall players from other regions coming to NA server with big lag advantage.
12434,"Combat and movement feels clunky man, could be due to server, I play on 122ms from Australia to SEA server. I dunno, just feels 'unpolished'. My audio was missing too, friends' footstep is louder than enemies. Just feels unsatisfying to play overall."
12435,"This is a game that got me hyped since the first Beta I played on April/2021. It is a great game and I love it.

The only reason I am giving a negative review is due to the lack of South America servers, which they had on the two betas I played. Me and many players bought the game assuming we would get SA servers just like we got on the beta tests.

Almost feels like we got scammed. I hope they will get the SA servers online soon.

PS: for those complaining about bots, the first 1 to 3 matches you play have a majority of bots for you to get used to the game. From that on, you will start to be matched with more human players and less bots. But bots are a constant, I would say that out of the 60 players on every match, around 20 will usually be bots."
12436,characters hot af
12437,No SA server insta refund
12438,"First game and only bots? No thanks

12439,I turn big and stomp Asian women. Finally a game made for me.

12441,"Seeking a new flavor in the battle royale genre, Naraka Bladepoint seemed to promise a brand new way to play. I really like the idea of a BR game focusing on incorporating melee weapons and firearms. Additionally, the Chinese mythology theme allows for so much creativity in both its storytelling and future season passes. This is where the good content seems to end...

I felt like the balance between melee and primary weapons would require a higher level of skill in both strategy and execution. When I fought on the battlefield, I felt like it was extraordinarily easy rather than difficult to kill my opponents. All I had to do was button smash them until they either become disorientated or cornered into a wall. It took little mental effort to plan my attacks and I felt like I barely needed my teammates to help me. In a battle royale game, teamwork is part of the equation and in this game, it seems completely forgotten. 

Speaking of working together, the communication system is rough. When pinging an item, the character doesn't speak aloud what the item is. She or he just says ""Hey! This wonderful item is here"" which is incredibly vague when you are in the middle of a fight. Specifying where the enemy is or given out more specific commands is also difficult to do when you are in a tough spot.

The map is creative by giving the player places to hide and ambush their enemies. However, the map is too large for its movement mechanics to be of much worth. From the grappling hooks to climbing up trees, you are moving quite quickly across the map yet its hard to find enemies. There are long pauses in between fights where I, personally, get rather bored. I think they should have either reduced the map size or increased the player count to combat this issue. In regards to the movement mechanics itself, I quite enjoy it. I feel like a ninja when I hide in the trees or jump between rooftops. Rarely do people look up, and that is where I want to be. BUT...you don't need to use these mechanics to win or have the upper hand in most scenarios. 

Finally, the graphics. So close...but yet so far. The character customization and overall looks are unique. However, on the home screen there tends to be resolution issues and poor frame drops. The whole thing seems to be out of focus, it wants to be crisp and clear but it comes across blurry. It becomes annoying on how close it is to being sharp to the eye. 

As someone who has played over 600+ of Apex Legends (and I know these games are different in their own right), I am disappointed by the lack of challenge and skill this game requires to win. When I play a battle royale game, I want to be pushed to my limit and have to think outside the box. Apex Legends takes both skill and strategy to be a formidable opponent but, in Naraka Bladepoint, I feel like neither is required to be successful. Perhaps with a bit more work and a growing player base, it could start to separate the wheat from the chaff. 

Naraka Bladepoint is below average on my grading scale of BR games and so, I am requesting a refund. Maybe in the future it can work at its weaknesses and become a game that deserves to be noticed. I really do hope it improves.

12442,I saw Thanos twice in my lobby
12443,do not get this game its just bots and you cant block its so bad dont buy it does not take skill
12444,Naraka : Botpoint
12445,This game is complete ass.
12446,"The parry mechanic is pretty horrible (it's actually a disarm, not a parry), and often times the stunlock can be a bit much.

Tthe rest of the game is pretty solid though, and is like a battle royale version of Sekiro."
12447,"[My review before and after playing demo beta version as well as released version]

The combat feels slick and stylish, movement is augmented by a cool parkour system and a grappling hook, and the team balancing, and character customization all mix together to allow you to make a playstyle of your own that’ll keep you coming back for more. 
You can even make your own private battle royale matches, and there are a few other modes to play as well. Put simply, I’m excited to see what Naraka - Bladepoint can do, and I think it’s going to become one of my regular games once it’s out in the wild properly. It’s about time all the energy I spent studying the blade paid off, and having wiped out over a third of the combatants with my teammate in a match earlier, I’m starting to feel like this could be my forever battle royale."
12448,Glory to the People's Republic of China
12449,i have not enjoy the game to be honest the game need to much improved  and the game really poring
12450,"This game is incredibly clunky and unfun. We played two games and got two high kill wins. Enemies were just spawning infront of us, the abilities are boring, the looting is boring. It's just a left click simulator. The game costs 20 bucks and still the first battle pass costs money alongside a bunch of other paid cosmetics. There are plenty of free battle royales and free games in general on the market that are much more fun than this game."
12451,VERY GOOD YES
12452,wtf？30000金块呢？
12453,bot simulator
12454,"It was very clunky, and I'm pretty sure 95% of the players were bots in the match I played and so are the people giving it good reviews I assume"
12455,"No OCE servers, refunded.

EDIT: Bought back, playing on SEA, got addicted, OCE servers came out, addicted even more. 10/10"
12456,Rank match with bots dont waste your money!
12457,"Fisrt Match I'm easy to kill , this is a bot ? I don't think so"
12458,"God I wanted to like this but I just can't. 

NARAKA does everything right in its core systems - free movement, easy to use UI, cool core gameplay loop, great graphics and sound design, lots of combat depth and diversity in the combat, but it just feels jank. The movement feels imprecise, the combat feels off somehow. It's obviously taken some inspiration from Sekiro, but unlike in Sekiro where when my character does something cool it's because I told my character to do something cool, in NARAKA it feels like my character is doing something cool in spite of my inputs. I was feeling it from the tutorial even, and once I got into a real game I noticed it even more. 

It reminds me a lot of Ring of Elysium - lots of cool, core, interesting mechanics, decently good looking game, but there's just this inherent jank to the game that I can't get over. If you can, great, you'll have a lot of fun, if you can't, you'll probably be like me, wishing that Hunter's Arena had an actual player base."
12459,"I feel like the negatives outweigh the positives in this game.

I don't want to confuse anyone, so I will just write a list of positives and negatives that I considered before deciding not to recommend Naraka right now. I won't mention everything, so I don't make this review any more boring (AND LONG) that it already is :)

[b] * Positives * [/b]
[list]
    [*] The combat in Naraka is a lot of fun, like it is fun enough to make me want to wait another 15 minutes to get into another match (more on that soon :p).  

    [*] Moving around is really fast and enjoyable, like when using the grappling hook, climbing, and sliding to make your way around.

    [*] Each hero has a set of abilities (different skills and ultimates), and I think mooosst of them are pretty balanced and fun to play with.

    [*] The heroes themselves are a little cookie-cutter, and lack much meaningful background, but I mean this is a battle royale not Red Dead Redemption. They're still nice and interesting.

    [*] Naraka's graphics are nice, including the character/hero models

    [*] Wowe the character/hero customisation is really cool! (Making a face using AI is very fun)

    [*] Paid cosmetics like hero skins and weapon skins look really creative (i'll come back to these later).

    [*] Though many parts about Naraka feel similar to other battle royale's like Apex Legends, I would say Naraka has it's own individuality.
[/list]

[b] * Negatives * [/b] 
[list]
    [*] Why does the anti-cheat in this game want to disable windows security settings? Um okay??

    [*] Just continuing from the last point, I could (sort of?) understand if disabling a specific windows security setting is what makes Naraka's anti-cheat the greatest anti-cheat ever. But it isn't the greatest anti-cheat ever.

    [*] Naraka is client-based which means that what you are seeing on your screen will always look like you have 0 latency. So no rubber banding for example, even if you have 200 ping. 

While it looks like everything is fine on your screen, by the time your data goes all the way to the server (with high ping), your parry would not have worked on your enemy. Because even if it looked like you timed it perfect on your screen, on your enemy's screen, you didn't parry at all, so they attack you while you're open and you take damage.

Sorry for the pretty confusing explanation but I hope that makes sense! 

Anyway, client-based netcode is not exactly a negative, I just wanted to explain what happens if you have bad latency in Naraka specifically, so I can talk about the servers.

South America had their own server during the beta, though Naraka decided that they didn't deserve one when the game launched, and removed it :( .

Oceania servers don't actually exist either, but Naraka's reason for not adding official servers in both South America and Oceania is lack of players. So instead, players from South America will be dragged to the lovely North America server and players like me in Oceania will be dragged to the equally as lovely South East Asia (SEA) server. 

In my experience with the SEA server, I have around 140 ping most of the time, which looks fine on my screen (which I boringly spoke about before). Howeeeever, you will soon come to the realisation that it isn't as smooth as you believe, like when trying to counter an attack and finding that other players zip around like an untouchable mosquito.

With the billions of dollars that NetEase have made, I don't see how adding two more servers will decrease profits in the long term. Like i'm sure there are many players in those regions willing to spend ALOT of money on this game, but won't buy it because there is no official server for them.

    [*] Okay so, let me make something reeaally clear. I am Australian, so I understand that my country is diverse and I love it very much. Though, I find it a little hard to believe that 90% of the top players in all the cities in my country are all Chinese... I am really sorry if that sounds rude!! 

Though, apparently many people seem to be complaining about Chinese players that use VPNs to swap regions for some easy prey (like me). Basically the majority of games are filled with Chinese players no matter what region you are in.

So while people like me don't enjoy getting stepped on by very experienced players from the start, some people enjoy that sort of thing, so go crazy I guess? 

    [*] Please don't let the Steam Charts trick you into thinking that there are many players to match against. To enter a game, it takes me around 8-15 minutes, depending on the game-mode (Remember my experience is on the SEA server!). 

If Naraka only wants servers with large amounts of players, then soon they will have to remove every other server region other than China, because there are no players anywhere else.

    [*] I actually don't have any reeeaal problems with the optimisation of Naraka. I lied, I do :) , but seriously it really isn't that bad. I mean, if you can suffer through the horrible on-and-off 15-20 second freezes for two whole games, while Naraka tries to cache textures, then after that, it is smooth like butter~ (This is with a hdd btw).

When you start NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, the game politely demands you install the game on a ssd if you want to play it without awful stutters. 

- So did I reinstall the game on a ssd to remove the dreadful stutters?

- No, because it should actually be playable on a hdd like every other game on the planet.

So I apologise y'all, but I can't tell you whether or not installing it on a ssd helps, because I am too stubborn :) .

    [*] Naraka is a paid game with a paid battle pass. I think that deserves one point by itself.

    [*] While there are some lovely cosmetics for your heroes and weapons (like I mentioned before), please let me play my game in peace without having mobile game looking advertisements pop up after every match, to try reel me in to buy the battle pass and/or skins (this tactic seemed to work because I ended up buying the battle pass lol).

    [*] On the topic of paid cosmetics, the menus are littered with them, like my goodness, we paid for your game, and you won't stop trying to make more money by shoving this really really cool looking skin for Matari in my face which I will definitely buy because it makes her look even cooler and why not.

    [*] And lastly, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, please, please I beg you. Stop telling me to look at your socials when I want to stop playing your video game... Please have some restraint U-U.

The game is epic.

super fun with friends.

Update after 40+ hours. 
Server is great for the amount of players. 
UI is flawless.
Graphics are satisfying.
It's a Ninja BR! 
Objectives and Parkour are so good.
The 1 free revive during the first 10 min of the game is what makes it good, the fact that you can respawn with weapons and armor and some of your runes is what makes it balanced for those early game disadvantage. 
I have absolutely no complaints. 
It's a skill-based Game. You can't just spam one combo because you can easily get parried.
I highly recommend this game!"

12481,"I have no idea why anyone would rate this clunky unreal engine prototype mess positively. The combat feels like that of Naruto Shinobi Striker but even worse. You're literally slashing/dashing through a bunch of jpegs. Your character just spasms everywhere, the animation jumps several frames when doing interrupting it.

This is your average Chinese game. A small team of interns who ejaculate whatever they learned in the last year of their CS degree in a piece of garbage software, only to serve as a vehicle to the CCP's spyware. In China they call it ""anti-cheat"" or something.

I wish I could get a refund for having watched the trailer too."
12482,"It's a fun competitive PvP game. Many people don't understand or didn't care to find the information but if you play the game past 1200 rank you are no longer grouped with bots.
