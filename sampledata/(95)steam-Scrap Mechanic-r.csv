3,i like it
4,"Great Game!

I wouldn't recommend this game if you are looking for something realistic though. The game has a broken physics engine and  Fine optimization but in more than makes up for that with the excellent game-play.

Please note: this game is NOT a pick-up-and-play or casual game, It takes a load of effort to complete even a single build in creative (+even more time to mess around around with the workings of it) but in the end this is what gives the insanely rewarding feeling when you finally finish a build."
5,Nice game
6,eeeee
7,Absolutely love this game and can't wait for what lies for the future of it.
8,physics go brrrrrrr
9,its fun and requires alot of creativity to play but that is what i was looking for
10,Awesome game!  Really recommend.
11,good

13,Very good game. Haven't found a warehouse yet but still very good.
14,pretty good game over all the food meter goes down kind of quike but it manage able
15,"Very good game. Be careful with downloading things from the workshop, as some of them may require mods, which can sometimes be annoying to find."
16,epic sandbox game
17,"This is a pretty good survival game.

I have been looking for something to play since Just Survive when down and this is the one for me! Hoping it doesn't meet the same end though ... always scared with Early Access games that they wont get finished.

If you are looking for play multiplayer, there are some things that need to be fixed (elastic banding, major frame rate drop when 2 creations get close together - like if you both build cars) .. but all in all a pretty good download if you are looking for a fairly easy survival game."

19,VERY GOOD GAME
20,things go clang clang and I go big happy
21,i liked game
22,"Good Game, Only problem is, I dont realy understand the final goal of survival, its not like mine craft where you defeat the ender dragon, or terraria where you defeat the moon lord, You just kinda stay alive in this, even though there isn't realy a true ending the many inventions you can make are insane, as with this game you can do so much, even the steam web store can prove that with the many mods and creations made by other players to the game."

30,very entertaining
31,yes
32,"This is going off the survival gameplay.

For how long it's been in early access, the game just isn't there. Badly missing focus and far too grindy. There first car you make is terrible and far worse than walking. No toggle to run, which feels like an artificial barrier. The quality of life just isn't there and makes the game a chore."
33,recomend :)
34,Yeki az behtarin survivalast ;)
35,i built a minigun
36,its just so fun but also grindy and challenging atleast for me and i ussally lose interest in the game but its still fun
37,Great game. Loads of potential. Almost no updates or progress in TWO YEARS. Amazing example of how NOT to do early access.
38,its a great game it has great building and good graphics.
39,engineer gaming
40,GOOD FUCKING GAME
41,"I think that the game can only be enjoyed by the people who can learn how to use connections and logic, the people who don't or cant will find it boring or frustrated. I like MANY other really enjoy this game."

59,"The Sandbox aspect of the game is great and really fun, especially with friends and there are tons of great mods that can easily be added from the workshop, my main gripe though with this game is the survival- which is just NOT fun, its slow, grindy and just feels unfinished. I think it has a lot of promise but for me, it sucks."

102,This is a charming tale of dwarf crashes spaceship on to farming planet with crazed robots whose only goal is to fertilize the ground with their carcass.

119,"Love the game, but it definitely is in DESPERATE need of additional content"
120,it good
121,"For Creative:
NEVER set ""physics quality"" to zero. Just never do it.
For Survival:
Going around the map, killing some small bots. Some human trading (i guess its america). Getting gun. Metting big red guy and trying to stay alive.

131,if you like survival or creative games or both.than this is the game for you!!!. i love this game i have 30.6 hours of game time and LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
132,pretty good ngl
133,"Ive only played solo but its still fun,
only complaint is that its a bit grindy"
134,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the 35 hours I've spent in this game...however, it is very light on content and variability of weapons/enemies.  The best part of this game is building things.  It's relatively easy to acquire materials, and it was an absolute blast building vehicles.  The world itself is pretty cool but it feels very empty.  This would be a game where you need npc's and quests to make you travel outside your base.  This game needs more enemies and more weapons to kill those enemies."

153,Its kinda of good I guess
154,I really enjoy the open world rpg aspect of this game mixed with a creative mechanical side. I cant wait to see what they bring with more updates.

160,"I saw this game from YouTubers. I thought it looked cool and a great way to test my mind. It's vary complex with just about everything but it also brings the freedom of a sandbox game where you can craft whatever you want and make whatever you want. I would honestly give this a mixed review tho. I stream this game and had to get help from some viewers in order to know what to do sometimes, or what would happen when the red timer hits zero. I literally said on stream, ""If all this soil and all my crops get deleted after this timer runs out. I'm just going to stick to creative mode and build cool builds."" The game is fun and all but there does seem to be a lack of hud, as well as a lack of direction. This next part is mainly an idea for the dev, from a dev of other games. Add maybe a few more tutorial stages, as in ""visit a run down facility (that has minimal enemies) and retrieve _____"" then maybe add a tutorial where it has you build a craft bot, just to get the player going, and even right after they build that craft bot, have a few more or just simply have a ""tutorial"" message that says something along the line of ""Craft, Build, Explore, SURVIVE"" to tell the player that they have completed the tutorial and to experiment with their surroundings and providing a better sense for them to do all of that. However overall I think it is a good game, and I think this could go far, its just missing a few elements. Heck maybe in the future, add a few more enemies, or variants of the existing enemies."
161,Fun game with tons of content but it can be improved a lot.
162,very good game game good yes very good indeed yes
163,"Epic Game


nuff said"
164,"a great game, i love the waves of bots"
165,nice
166,It's a very creative like game.
167,your a mechanic and theirs scrap. so yeah good combo
168,good game
169,"I've played survival for bout 5 hours and I still have no idea what the point of the game is or what I'm supposed to be doing. The game looks great and it feels like there's something there, but there's no direction or clarity on what you're supposed to be doing. The crafting has little to no explanation on what the items purposes are. I just keep running around fighting the same enemies, surviving off milk, and trying to understand what the actual point of the game is.

The tutorial provides no direction or idea of what my purpose is in the game. I built a car, which was slower than walking speed, so i built a faster one. Cool. I drive around the island and fight, loot, craft, but it all comes back to the same thing. What am I working towards? Want to start a garden? It will be attacked every time you plant. Build a defense? Nope. Cool. I drink milk to survive.

The combat system is basic. The enemies are the same. Gathering items is tedious and feels pointless.

There's something here, but it's just not enjoyable in it's current state. It feels like a beta for Trailmakers."
170,Its a good game and i would recommend it for any building people that like sandbox games.
171,"its really fun and you can be so creative you can make cars,boats,planes,ect if you want to spend time being
creative i recommend:)"

187,yes
188,"If you're unsure about the purchase, check out ScrapMan on youtube.

Personally, I've spent about almost all of my playtime so far just making a custom little hidden duck hunt for a friend, after watching his ""I Built 20 Hidden Treasures Into This Bathroom For My Friends To Find!"". Had a great time making the course and even better time watching my friend complete it. Planning to go back and make a 2.0 or something and improve on a lot of the things I learned as I was making it."
189,"yes

190,very good game can get a jump scare here and there but other from that good all way round for this game play it if you can
191,hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo is so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
192,"Building is clunky and not very intuitive. Your first car is a clunky POS that isn't worth driving as it bounces everywhere and rolls constantly, literally running is faster. Farming is a waste of time because 8 or more crops triggers a raid on your base every single day, and gets worse with more crops.

Gathering materials takes forever, and you have to farm shitloads of crops to trade for your first gun, which means you have to fight shitload of bots every night.

It's not scrap mechanic, it's farming raid simulator. I should have refunded before 2 hours, but I didn't even figure out how to build my car by then...."
193,"This game is so fun that when I was like hey friend, join me, my friend bought it without hesitation and played with me epic

199,its a good game
200,"Great game for youngsters wanting to understand how things work and move around with each other. I recommend this game to anyone looking to have a good time while learning a little in the process. I am not saying that the physics in this game are in any way realistic or that this game teaches you anything much, I am just saying that kids could understand the basics to making a car for example and the different ways it works in a much simpler way."

202,BEST GAEM
203,"very moddalble` game

204,This game allowes you to be very creative! I suggest this game for a lot of people.
205,A really fun concept and pretty solidly put together. The build system definitely has some quirks and it takes some time to get used to Scrap Mechanic brand physics but it's plain simple fun. Excited to see more content come out!
206,"This is a truly amazing game. No other game comes close in its nature, really a special game."

217,"It's a really good game with only one downside, how hard it is. Scrap mechanic is a great sandbox game where you can play challenges, make creations or survive against bots. I love how you can create basically anything with items. This game also provides great mod support. My only problem with this game is the challenge. In survival mode, I always fail my farm raids and die. That's the end of my review, thanks for reading!"

261,pretty fun not the best
262,Very good
263,"Really enjoying how this is progressing.  Your basic survival elements (The Forest) combined with making vehicles (Trailmakers) and some very light automation activities (Satisfactory... although much simpler.)

There's quite a few updates to go before this sees full release, but I'm very excited to see it through to the end."

280,ITS SUPER FUN best stuff about it:there is a creative mode with multiplayer you can install mods and you can build almost anything! worst stuff about it:it doesnt have that good physics you cant fly and it doesnt have aerodynamics. well apart from that its the best game ever you should really try it!
281,Im Like This game im play this game 6 year ago Nostalgie.
282,"I love sandbox games.
"
283,it is best game to ever be
284,"It's a pretty good game, honestly. The physics engine is prone to quirks if you make something complex, and the robots definitely don't like it if you make farms, but plenty of reason to pick up a spudgun and turn them into parts. To me, the best part is the sheer creativity the game allows for."

292,Very fun
293,Yes
294,"I loved scrap mechanic however there were a few bugs, it was very laggy and when i played it for a while it got a bit repetitive, though I loved the game and i still do so i recommend it. :)"
295,love it cant wait for chapter 2
296,great game literally no complaints
297,fun game with friends
298,yes good gaEM POW pow
299,Good game would recomand i am bad at building tho
300,"it is a game that i would recommend to people who have a good pc, because mine sometimes crashes but otherwise and amazing game."
301,fun game
302,"good game, mods can be epic"
303,"Addictive, relaxing (most of the time), all round fun if you like the craftin, building, base defending shenanegans !"
304,"compliments:
[list]
    [*] the game can be really fun and addicting, as there's always this hint of creating something new.
    [*] great for people who are creative, have an open mind and like engineering, mechanics and logic.
    [*] creations can be shared very easily through the workshop.
    [*] mods can immensely expand the functionality of the game, from simple blocks'n'parts mods to mods that add entire new systems of logic.
    [*] the graphics tend to be great. the models and textures have inherently high detail, and for the most part the shading is done perfectly.
[/list]

complaints:
[list]
    [*] but the graphics sometimes are outright terrible. the water really could use some surface deformation (TCS + TES stage perhaps?) with light reflection and refraction, and that could be just called a day while looking much better. the underwater graphics are still a joke. there are also technical rendering issues, e.g. the perspective far plane not being far enough (even at max render distance).
    [*] the development progress on the game is incredibly slow, it has been like 6 years and all we have is creative mode, challenge mode and survival mode where there is no endgame (yet), there's only the so-called ""chapter 1"" where the story is almost non-existent.
    [*] the game is terribly optimised. it can struggle with framerates even on the highest of the highest shelf pc components. tons of moving parts or few creations colliding and you're already down to ‚™Ü 300+ ms per a single frame, not to mention most of the physics stuff runs only on 1 cpu thread.
    [*] in survival mode, the death system is a joke, and farming is a huge neutronium ball to schlep. it takes ages to farm all the components for something one would call a medium-sized build.
    [*] bearings, pistons and suspensions are incredibly flimsy, and that became worse with recent updates.
    [*] the multiplayer netcode is extremely susceptible to rubberbanding, creating an unpleasant experience.
[/list]

overall: if you are creative, open-minded, and you like mechanics, logic and engineering; if you don't mind the large count of technical and gameplay issues, this game is for you. otherwise i'd recommend you wait till the game comes out of early access."
305,It is realy fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

337,"If you want to buy this to play creative or challenge mode, then go for it, those are both excellent modes.
If you want to buy this to play survival, save your money. The world is uninteresting, the combat sucks, and you have to grind for hours to get anything done. Even the farming system, you know, the system the entire mode is pretty much based around, is unpolished and unfun. If you want to build a base, have fun spending hours just chopping down trees, mining rocks, and killing hundreds of farmbots just to get enough component kits to upgrade everything in your base. The only time survival is fun is when you've fully progressed and have everything you need, which is basically worse creative."
338,creative great game
339,It's pretty cool but I'm too stupid to figure out how to make anything interesting but still pretty fun lol

342,fun
343,Great Logic game and the mods only make it better!
344,scrap mechanic is a pretty fun game if you have a lot of stuff to build in your imagination or maybe play survival if you have the time grind for materials make bases raid warehouses and even make bot killers the only thing is scrap mechanic is boring for me without friends or when i dont have something to build
345,Very good
346,"Very cool and very amazing sandbox game. 10/10 would suggest to others. If you love engineering, then this is the game for you."

354,"This is an alpha version of a game that could be good in the future. If the developers had not abandoned this project.
But this is half the trouble.
The developers wished for more money and added a ""beautiful agreement"".
""We do not sell the Game to you"" is an item from the ""what you can do"" section.
Collection of personal data, etc. Classic malware"
355,this game was good for the first 150 hours and then it got pretty dry
356,is fun
357,better with friends
358,"Truly a great game. Creative mode has provided endless entertainment for several years, making this one of my most played games. Challenge mode provides another layer of complexity, with the steam workshop being capable of shaping the game even more for the player. Survival mode is decent. Great potential in all three modes, but even with a few bugs and design issues, the game is excellent. Updates are somewhat regular. Favorite glitch is suspension infinite stability, I hope it never gets removed, or if it does, make a stability block."
359,it's almost as good as my moms egg sandwitches
360,i like the game
361,"It's a fun game, Silly physics, and amazing survival, but it's up to you! Read some other reviews, and see if you want to get it!"

368,its a very good game but you need to be smart to play it
369,goofy mods and goofy game are fun to play
370,This game 68 sold to me worthÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
371,"I'd been looking at this one one the store page for a while. It looked really interesting to me, the aesthetic style was cool and i was hankering for more survival stuff after long runs in Conan Exiles and Valheim over the past few years. I'd seen there was a dedicated survival update, reviews seemed positive, and some big name people were playing but i'd been burned enough by early access that i wanted to wait for some polish. On the other hand, i've played a number of early access titles Deep Rock Galactic, Valheim, etc that were highly polished despite that tag and this game's been in development for so long that i bit the bullet and went for it.

And i feel kinda ripped off.

Let's get some good stuff out of the way. The aesthetic is absolutely killer, the world looks nice and so do the models for characters and enemies. The game FEELS pretty good to play, movement is generally pretty satisfying and the building is solid. However, overall i feel like i was sold on a game that doesn't really exist. Here's a few of the marketing descriptors that made me feel this way:

""Tool up and enter the creative paradise of Scrap Mechanic! Build fantastic machines, go on adventures with your friends and defend against evil Farmerbots in this imaginative multiplayer survival sandbox. With Scrap Mechanic‚Äôs powerful creation tools you can engineer your own adventures!""

""Enter the creative paradise of Scrap Mechanic! Build fantastic machines, go on adventures with your friends and defend against waves of evil Farmbots in this imaginative multiplayer survival sandbox. With Scrap Mechanic‚Äôs powerful creation tools you can engineer your own adventures!""

""Survival Mode!
In Survival Mode mechanics explore a dynamically generated open-world environment filled with enemies, treasure and dangerous robots! Team up with friends and build bases to protect yourself and your valuables. The most creative will survive!""

So, naturally, what i expected was a game more akin to Minecraft, Terraria, Conan Exiles, Valheim etc whereby i'd load in and start gathering resources to build a base while fending off ""waves of evil Farmbots,"" yadda yadda. What i got instead was bargain bin Rust with a terrible tutorial, an empty world, and zero direction. ""B-but Foostini,"" you cry out, ""you don't have the same playtime i do, your opinion is invalid."" Yeah i suppose so, but first impressions are very important and if the first impression is poor, why would i want to trudge on miserably until i find the good stuff, y'know? Valheim drops you in the middle of a stone circle and a bird tells you to tool up and kill those dudes. Conan Exiles starts you in the middle of a desert and says find some water or die idiot. Minecraft and Terraria load you in and says best start mining and crafting, it'll be dark soon.

Scrap Mechanic loads you in, has you lego together a car that's literally worse than running, then drops you off at a mechanic station in what feels like the middle of the tutorial and then shrugs. I'm sure there's a lot of fun to be had but let's face it, development is painfully slow and is more focused on secondary modes than the one that usually brings people into these games. The community is vocally unhappy about it, the playerbase is a fraction of any other major survival game on Steam currently, and in my search for content on YouTube i find the vast majority of content is centered around the initial Survival update two years ago and there's barely anything else. ""But Foostini,"" you cry out again, ""it's made by like 12 people of course it's slow."" Stardew Valley was made by one person, Re-Logic (Terraria) has 12, Ghost Ship Games (Deep Rock Galactic) started with 6, Supergiant (Hades, Bastion, Transistor) has 20, Edmund McMillen is himself (Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac), I could go on. Size of the team is irrelevant, passion for what you're making is and i don't see it here.  I don't wanna be one of those people to say ""lol ded gaem"" and move on buuuut i'm really hovering over the refund button, it's been six years and this is where it's at.

But hey, at least Challenge Mode has 10 new challenges, right? You can play Golf too, that's what you wanted, yeah? Anyway."

385,"real fun game, worth playing if engineering is an interest.

real fun game, worth playing if engineering is an interest.

would really like to see survival explored further, mainly base building and more story. this is all being worked on very slowly. 

game is really fun as long as you don't mind waiting 3 plus years between updates. game came out in 2016...
my only suggestion for updates would be for them to be more spread out and maybe not as needed high quality, spacing out the updates lets the community react to them more naturally instead of every 3 years the game is completely different. 

final note - kill the shitty suspension glitch, people complaining about the use for flying creations can either wait till some variation of the already existing plane mod becomes added into the game. This game is about solving issues through creativity having the suspension glitch leaves less ability for suspension combinations as well as people not finding a way to stabilize their builds, gyros exist people. A possible item could be added to held with flight satiation but I don‚Äôt think there should ever be any block to fill the role the glitch does int current iteration of the game.

-ok final final note, with the addition of the turret seat to be added it would be cool to see some kind of easier way to have working robotic legs, though for this I have no idea what that could be, - would be cool if there‚Äôs a way for legs to be more reactive and less pose to pose animated. - maybe a flex modifier for controllers and their bearings.
"
386,"Although I haven't gotten around to playing the new Survival mode, I have always liked screwing around in Creative, just passing time of which that time would have been me being bored. I have done that since almost when the game came out. I havent played since 2019, and have just downloaded it about 3 weeks ago, and looking at my old creations was just... let's say interesting."
387,......
388,it is ok i guess
389,A really fun game. Definatly worth the price. Get it!

391,its pre good
392,Good game yes very good But like yea
393,"great game, the updates are rare and chapter two has taken 2 years and still no news on a release date for it, the community has been very consistent with workshop builds and have supported the game greatly, unfortunatly, although the base game can keep you satisfied for a decent amount of time it eventually gets boring and slow, i love it but the devs need to give us more content in consistent updates instead of one huge update which will only give 30-40 hours MAX"

451,why?
452,Very cool game and comunity
453,I love the building aspect of the game. I finally have a game that gives me access to limitless building and functionality.
454,"I'm just really surprised this game has so many positive reviews. I only played PvE with a couple friends so that might be where others had more fun.

Lots of repetitive parts of this game such as clearing and looting the same locations, fighting the exact same enemies, using the same weapon for most of the game. I mean late late game you get to encounter a third enemy and use more than just a hammer, but by then you're just grinding the same old stuff repeatedly. Lacks variety."
455,"Creative Sandbox game with barebones survival gameplay. Development is very slow due to a small dev team.

Creative mode allows you to let your mind roam free, creating whatever mechanism floats your boat. Unless it's a plane. Scrap Mechanic has mod support and as such allows more creativity on that front as well. The learning curve for making good vehicles and creations is a rather steep curve I find, but if you stick with it it should get easier.

Survival mode allows you to get a basic feel for the game with an added survival mechanic and progression system. Farming plants and animals provides you with the food you need to survive, some of the materials you need to craft, along with plants to trade for useful tools. A challenging world enemy also exists that grants you access to a dungeon like area where you can receive the highest tier plants currently in game. Creativity is somewhat limited in this mode as you are limited by the resources required to create your vehicles/farms and upgrade the technological components within, such as your engine, or pistons. More is planned for the survival mode however, and in time things like a story and more progression will be added"
456,Yea
457,"amazing game easy to get going easy to get in to simple controls i like it

462,You can build almost anything you can imagine in this game.
463,"This game is a sandbox/survival game with so many different blocks and items to build with, there is also a wide variety of creation other creators like you have made. This game also includes a map creator for creative mode that also includes other buildings for the map that other creators made. lastly, this game also has a really, really good map design. !TO THE CREATORS! The creative map is a little small so could you size it up in your next update?"

498,icant find update option? where ican get update scrap mechanic game
499,"Scrap Mechanic is an engaging game based on engineering, where you have to design machines to help you survive! You're not the survival type? Don't worry! There is a creative mode where you can create designs with unlimited materials. There is also a challenge mode which I haven't really explored so I can't give you a good description. Scrap Mechanic is just so much FUN, I've enjoyed the puzzles that my designs have presented and have made many awesome creations to share with my family and friends.

100% recommend this!!"
500,"This game is challenge at the beginning, it does not hold your hand getting started which i like. Learn by mistakes. Slowly you'll build the equipment you need to survive and then go out exploring. Totally addicted so far and finding a farmer locked up and had to roll his cage all the way to turned into a token was absolutely hilarious. Can't wait to to see what they add going forward."
501,"it is very funny and has pretty good gameplay, multiplayer is a bit glitchy but thats alright"
502,beeo
503,"Do I even have to start on this game, I mean, look at my playtime. This game is fantastic. The physics are great but it has its quirks, the cool thing about that is that some of those are pretty useful. Even the compatibility is great, I tried this game on a potato and it ran 76 Hz.

10/10 game, every should have this game"

537,"This game is my absolute FAVORITE game! It is so amazing and is getting better and better. As soon as I got this PC I bought Scrap Mechanic and have NEVER regretted it and you won't either. There is so much you can do and it is so well made, and it's not even finished. I 100000000% recommend this game. And now that raft is finished, Axolot has more time to work on this game, and it will get better and better. 

Things I would like Axolot to add:

- Advanced controller: basically a controller but you can edit how much time the controlled bearing will stay in place until the next step or how fast or slow each step takes

- Auto-steering: I'm sure you know the steering glitch. Take that and make it a function for a block that you can also control speed of steering.

- Tank treads: movement parts that you can add next to each other to make it longer and can turn without moving forward. Would resemble tank treads in real life. 

- Hover thrusters: Attach them to your build like wheels and it can hover off the ground. It can turn without moving forward and move directly to the side. you can edit how high it goes off the ground, the more upgraded the more high it can go 

- Boat propellers: Basically the boat propellers in raft mechanic but smaller

- unrelated to adding to the game but, please add the music in the survival trailer to spotify it is so good!

These are the things that I most want to be added to this amazing game and I hope this game grows big."

540,I built a dildo. Recommend 100%!
541,is fun and sometimes a little hard
542,this is a very good game to use your creativity and imaginations and with survival
543,"This game looks nice but please be warned. It gets boring quite fast.
If someone is looking for a game with a Storyline or anything similar to Subnautica, Astroneer etc. please be warned that there is simply No story at all.
You start at a crashed ship and of you go with hitting a few minions, which by the way respawn and building things.
I can confirm we enjoyed playing it in 2 for a few hours but after we realized that the game has 2!!! missions only (Tutorial pretty much). The game was over for us.
We switched to creative mode to build whatever we wanted and then left the game for good.
I am honestly dissapointed in a lot of the Early Access games which lately flodd the market."

554,"Good game but heres a Ratatouille recipe

Ingredients
for 8 servings

VEGGIES

2 eggplants
6 roma tomatoes
2 yellow squashes
2 zucchinis
SAUCE

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
salt, to taste
pepper, to taste
28 oz can of crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves
HERB SEASONING

2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
2 tablespoons Chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
salt, to taste
pepper, to taste
4 tablespoons olive oil


Preparation
Preheat the oven for 375ÀöF (190ÀöC).
Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ-inch (1-mm) rounds, then set aside.
Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Saut√© the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.
Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.
Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.
Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.
Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day--cover with foil and reheat in a 350ÀöF (180ÀöC) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature."

568,"fun, creative, and a blast when played with friends"
569,"Best game I've played in years
"
570,"Scrap mechanic is a very fun game, and, it has a ton of content, there are only two main downsides, first off, the more obvious one is, performance, the performance is not bad, especially for a game all about physics, but it certainly isn't great either, the nice thing is the developers are putting in some effort to optimize it further! The other downside is not too major, in fact it probably wouldn't affect many people if the performance was better, this issue is, the texture size consistency, the sunshake machine is a good example of this, with low texture quality and even just medium texture quality the logo becomes completely blurry, while other things- such as the craft bot, still have decent looking textures, blocks on the other hand, don't have that issue. Maybe there's no texture batching for the non-block objects and this is to prevent extreme lag? either way though, if the performance gets good enough so that textures can be on high quality, this won't be a big issue.

Overall I definitely recommend Scrap Mechanic! 9/10"
571,GG
572,ywas
573,This game is so amazing you can build literally anything
574,"I played survival for 7 hours.  Spent the last two wondering around trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing.

I was hooked at the beginning of the game. You've crashlanded, bit of light combat, some farming of resources, go to some waypoints, get to make a vehicle, unlock a better crafting station... and then it's just over.  Nothing to do unless you want to grind resources or deliberately get enemies to attack your base.

I feel somewhat conflicted leaving this thing a negative review because the vehicle part is really cool, and it's pretty, and there's a lot of neat things you can do, but this is not a ""survival sandbox"" at all.  There is no survival involved. It's a sandbox with a trivially easy hunger and thirst meter that you have to fill occasionally. Few enemy types that only attack when you want them to.

Not sure what I am missing."

612,"at first you're fooled by the lack of interaction with solid objects and the dwarf like people are pretty lame with the character creation being fairly limited unless you include the band wagon ability to select both genders appearance... lame, which gives you more choice supposedly.
But then you see the crafting menu in the Mechanic building and the possibilities start flooding into your mind and you're hooked

629,"I was really looking forward to it and sadly I didn't enjoy it at all.
There is no guide of any sort on how to procceed. 
There is one quest, you build a shitty car that can't go forward without flipping over , and that's where that ends/ 
I expected a lot better by far. I was sadly disappointed."
630,"I'm not even sure how this game dropped on to my radar, but as a fan of 7 Days to Die and Raft, I found a lot to love about this game. The crafting and survival elements stand out as unique and offer a deep well of possibilities I can't wait to discover."
631,"great game, I had this as a kid and with the new survival update its given a minecrafty feel to  the game and a reason to come back and beat it once in a while (i played on my sisters account when i was young)"
632,8ib um
633,"I bought the game after me and some Friends did not know what to play.
After good 30 Hours in a row i have some mixed Feelings about the game.

Sandbox:
Its Fun you have to learn the mechanics of the diffrent blocks and you have to find a way to use them together. 
i think its fun because you have to try the build over and over again and find why it dosent work.


Survival:

i played the survival mode with some friends and after like 5 hours i started to lose intrest the proggres you where making was rly slow. 
i also spend like 2 hours building a bike expermenting how i can make it work fix bugs in it and make it perfect after those 2 hours i went on a test ride and i got attacked by some robots they broke my drivers seat and the bike drove off into a stronger enemy that i couldnt beat at that time. In the end the bike broke.

it also dosent rly have a story line you follow 
first it takes ages to grow stuff and you deal with a lot of food problems
after you finaly grow some shit you trade it for a gun and you can go into a warehouse.
we expected a little more then what was in there....
the loot is okey but after your done with the ware house you dont rly have a reason to keep going.


but in total i said like 15 times that i wont play again and i came back everytime because for some reason its still fun and chatching but there is still space for improvement.

it also looks cool i love the character/enemy  desings and the Map.



in the end i would give the game a 6/10
i recomend it"
634,was not as fun as i thot
635,very fun
636,"This game sucks. I started a survival mode world and here's what I can tell you about it:

-Food/water drain too quickly, you're constantly searching for consumables
-Crafting requires mostly metal, which requires getting into costly battles and ranging far afield, contributing to the food/water problem
-The results of crafting are so jacked up at first, they are useless. If you end up getting this game, just try to make your first car useful. Warty donuts don't make for good wheels.
-The ""tutorial"" tries to get you to range as far as an entirely different island/biome too soon, taking you away from the only source of water/food you have at the beginning of the game.

There's a few more things, but those are good examples of how poorly balanced and thought out the game is. Maybe something for the creative/casual crowd, but not a good survival game."
637,"This game is just plain bad, this is on early access so it may change in the future but I just wish I could refund but took 7 hours to realize there is nothing in here, you can build cars and boats and that's it there is nothing here to do plus I just found out if you store things in a chest and the chest gets destroyed you lose it all, no bag on the ground to get it back nothing just gone.
Space Engineers has way more content and is way better than this."
638,gg
639,don't buy this if you plan on co-oping because the input delay for non-hosts makes it unenjoyable and I don't think the devs plan on fixing this anytime soon.
640,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

If you want to play multiplayer with your friends and they're not in the same region as you, game has significant input lag and no dedicated servers. Player movement isn't clientside, which is completely pathetic for a game made in 2016.
This is never going to change btw even if the game is early access, fundamental coding flaw"
641,e
642,"Fun and enjoyable, but multiplayer gets really laggy. cant really recommend if your planing multiplayer."
643,"this game is amazing the fact that you can go from 1st person to 3rd is good enough but the amount of parts and the infinite possibilities for machines is amazing 
creativity is key in this game
"
644,your gonna need a good computer or laptop but other than that a great game i really greatly reccommend it

646,geed
647,Too much grind.
648,"boring af, i regret buying this so much"
649,"super fun survival, not too rough on the survival end and SO many possibilities on the building side. Some players might get a bit overwhelmed with how to make complicated machines/vehicles but the running around and adventuring is really fun and you can make really basic simple things to help you progress if you are not looking to make the complicated things.

Would like to see the devs concentrate more on adding to the main survival game before branching out to other modes of play.

Game is pretty stable for multiplayer although I do experience some rubber banding and the occasional d/c but other than that it is great for playing with friends (and helps to get past some of the grind as well).

If you are into games like Raft/satisfactory where the survival and combat are a little toned down then you will like this game."
650,"This game has three modes of play: Challenge (design a machine to complete a task, usually a type of car), Survival (what I'm going to focus on in this review), and Creative (just build stuff for fun).  Challenge is a great way to ease you into the game play mechanics of connecting engines to bearings which turn wheels which makes the ""car"" move forward.

Survival is incredibly shallow.  You'll initially struggle to keep your hunger/thirst meters full but once I successfully harvested (farming initiates the ""Enemy Attack in 20 minutes"" mechanic) 3-4 times with only 10 soil plots, I had enough food to keep me going for many hours.  This was trivialized even further when you unlock cooking, which fills health/hunger/thirst to 100%.

Resource gathering presents a challenge in that you need to use components attached to machines you build in order to harvest them.  So you immediately think attaching a drill to your car would be effective in harvesting stone/metal and discover the physics of the game constantly get in your way.  In fact, what I've found to be most effective way to harvest rocks/metal is extremely low tech: stick a wooden post into the ground, add an ""arm"" that swivels parallel to the ground and attach a drill to that arm.  Repeat as necessary.

At which point, Survival just because Creative mode but with an unsatisfying grind that remains unchanged from Hour 3 to Hour 300.  You keep grinding for materials that don't make you more powerful in regards to resource gathering or combative ability.  Your only progression comes in the form of adding more collection space and engines to your car which slowly becomes an 18-wheeler, just so you can continue stockpiling more and more materials that are used to achieve no tangible goals, besides one day getting to use a potato gun instead of a hammer in order to fight the same two enemies over and over again.

This isn't ""Minecraft for engineers"". It's ""Minecraft with cars"".  I haven't looked into mods too closely which may be this game's saving grace but overall (nevermind -- most ""mods"" are just blueprints for a random car/tank/plane that you cut 'n paste into your game file), I am disappointed."
651,awsome simply awsome.  salvage farm gather build fight drive  fly wow amazing
652,"Created a black man avatar. I started working in the oil fields and cotton fields with occasional honey farming. When my salary came, I made myself a nice car. Drove it around, had fun.

662,"""We do not sell the Game to you""

This shit needs to stop."
663,Cool game but needs polishment due to high ping on multiplayer sessions
664,"[h1] Scrapped together [/h1] 

This game was released originally in 2016. It's now 2022 and it's still in Early Access. When I first bought the game, nothing was fleshed out. It was barren and buggy. 

Few years have passed and I can finally say that Scrap Mechanic is worth investing in. Updates can be slow due to the amount of content being added but regardless it's a fun game if you like building, problem solving and generally are of, an inventor's mindset. 

Be warned though. The game requires patience and lots of research in form of tutorials or youtube. Once you know how things work, it's off to a good part. Designing machines, vehicles, houses and even airplanes. I wish only that there was a BLUEPRINT functionality to save or quickly build my creations, 

There are mods available and people can even design their own LEVELS with in game map editor! It's much more fun however to explore minigames with friends. 

Currently there are 3 game modes. Challenges, Survival and Creative ( Plus tons of community made maps, modes and creations ). 

I'm not sure what is the vision for the future for the game but even in the current state it's worth a try. It can only get better.

For those of you who enjoy combat and shooting.... the game is quite shallow in that department. Only few guns, no dodge mechanic.... so being creative and inventing traps or vehicles helps a ton. 

Currently it's on -30% sale and I would totally recommend it at that price.

690,"I just recently got it, Scrap Mechanic is good for a creative mind. There is so many parts and multiplayer! It is really fun with friends. All I would ask for is maybe in the steam workshop you could put up suitcases for your own build. Like in survival you get the suitcase thing and put it on the lift and it shows you how to make a car. I think it would be cool to have this for your own builds so your not just spawning others builds you can create them."
691,Great game if you love sandbox/building. Also has mod support and online co-op

697,"I can tell after only 22 minutes that this game is not for me.

On the survival, you run around to put a fire out first thing.  then you have to go down a road (following the leads) and get attacked.  Then you have to figure out what the heck the flash thing means.

I don't like being thrown into a fire, attacked and stuck in just a few minutes.   I like relaxing games where I can find out why my point of view changed when I accidentally hit c  and how do i get back to first person person view back. 

Seriously. I do not need to be looking on the internet for help after the first 10 minutes of a game."
698,"Great game if you like building and engineering. The ""plot"" if there is one is thin but doesn't really matter since it's mostly a creative game.
The base game is fun but that is not why I gave it a thumbs up - since without a mod or two the base game feels ""unfinished"". Like half of a game. 
What you'll probably want to do to really enjoy it is download the world mod by 00Fant. 
It adds more items and tweaks a few of the suboptimal settings. Overall it feels like a more completed game with more tools and objects and a variety of ways to enjoy building. 

A couple of examples:
Base game - you have to forage underwater. Items or building materials that can actually be fun to make and assist with this : 0 (zero, nill, nada)
00Fant Mod - at least 5. Water paddles, thrusters, air generators, exoskeletons, ballast tanks, etc... 

But if you love building games this one is definitely worth getting."

709,"Severely disappointed. Good LORD is this game grindy. Trailer makes it look awesome but you're going to be spending about 4 hours of your life getting the resources to build a car that travels slightly faster than you can run with no suspension. The whole game is just padding; if you were hoping to use your engineering skills to create automation, have fun because you're going to have to basically do EVERYTHING ELSE to get the resources to create automated systems and at that point there's literally no reason to automate anything. Just go play Minecraft with the Create mod, it's what this game should've been minus the cars."
710,"Man, I love this game. It's trying to fill several different niches at once, and admittedly not excelling at most of them. It tries to be a looter-shooter, tower defense, survival, farming, and engineering sandbox all at once. Out of all those, ""engineering sandbox"" is the only one it really excels at. 

That being said, how many other games offer all that at once? If I *just* want to play a looter shooter then borderlands is probably a better pick, but the main focus is on the engineering and the other mechanics mostly serve to break things up or give a *reason* to build something. Truth is, it does a tremendous job of balancing all it's different mechanics and getting each one to feed off the others. 

Farming is annoying, but is the driving force behind the tower defense elements. Building better vehicles is the best part of the game, but requires doing the looter-shooter bit get the materials for fancy parts. To increase your effectiveness at looterering-shootering you need to farm, which means you need to build defenses for the farm, which means you need to loot the materials necessary, which means you need to drive all over the map, which means you need a better car, it's all very cyclical. 

If all that sounds like a pain in the ass (and it is, admittedly), there's creative mode. Total freedom, zero motivation. Or challenge mode, which is all motivation and very little creative freedom. 

I'm rambling at this point. What I'm saying is, this game is great. It's a pain in the ass in all the best ways, finely balances it's many mechanics/gameplay elements, and has a lot to offer. If you like the mechanical/building stuff, give this game a whirl. Just spend some time in challenge mode before playing survival, you'll learn the mechanics best that way."
711,"I've tried repeatedly to find fun in this game but it neither made me feel engaged enough to want to play it nor entertained enough to be patient with it until ""the game"" happened.  It's a game that gives you a big toolset to build stuff which is fun in itself but leaves you to figure most of it out on your own without goals to achieve.  The same thing that is a strength in other games makes this game frustrating to play because things are happening without you understanding why or giving a decent motivation for you to get involved.

If you like building things, this game is for you, but if you want a reason to build things, this game doesn't provide it.

Good graphics, decent physics, a real lack of ""writing"""
712,thought it would be more complicated than it is
713,Scrap Mechanic would be a delightfully fun game if the core game play weren't such a buggy dysfunctional mess that makes it just about unplayable in its current state. It also doesn't help that the game receives updates at such a glacial pace that the word stagnant would adiquitly describe it.
714,"Scrap mechanic is a bit like minecraft, but with a lot more features. Like minecraft, Scrap mechanic is a sandbox game where you can build whatever you want, also with a survival mode, but in Scrap mechanic, the game's blocks are much smaller, and affected by gravity. In Scrap mechanic, you can build vehicles, buildings, and then freely move your creations around a fully customizable map, and then upload those creations into the steam workshop, and then download other people's creations from there. Want a realistic tank? It's already on the workshop! How about a wacky transforming octopus? It's all probably already on the workshop! And if you think of something that's not on the workshop, you can build it yourself! Also on the workshop, mods! missing that one thing you desperately want in the game? Someone's probably included it in a mod on the workshop! And with a new update to the survival mode which already has quite a bit of meat on it's bones, now is the time to get the game to experience new content with the rest of the community! Struggling a bit with building? Try out the challenge mode for inspiration, it's like a tutorial!. Although the multiplayer is a bit jank, it's still really fun to grab a couple friends and just mess around for a bit. Some complex creations smashing into each other can cause some severe frame drops though. This game is easily a 4.5 stars!"
715,"Great game,great mechanics
I believe is the best sandbox at the moment
I love the survival update 
Overall great experience with the game,the mods and the community
Thumbs up"
716,it is very fun pretty much like goofy minecraft
717,its a really cool game with a lot of things you can do. there are a lot of mods to play with.
718,very good funny game for making funnies
719,"This game fun let me be creative and also survival is fun and creative and challenge you should play it, it was worth the money."
720,i played this game thinking it would be like the others but no i build sad things when im sad and happy things when im happy i wish i had to to play it with.
721,actually FUN
722,t
723,needs more ducks
724,good graphics and playability
725,"Overall, Scrap Mechanic is a really fun game with super fun survival mode. While the game does lag a bit when two or more builds touch it is not that big of a deal. If anyone is looking for a fun building game Scrap Mechanic is the game for you."
726,fptkyjp
727,Great Game  i played for 277 hours!  I loved it Best Game
728,thiiiiiiccccc

734,Perfect Game for me may not be for others though.
735,very guud very nice
736,Im addicted
737,Buy Game Is Awesome Play And Embrace Your True Mechanic Skills
738,I enjoy playing Scrap Mechanic with my 13 year old son. It is interesting and amazing to watch him figure out how to build things to protect our farm from raids by marauding robots. Good times and memories for both of us!
739,"The funnest part of the game is building vehicles. The building is really easy and simple and you can make some pretty cool stuff. The game does not feel balanced however, I've had to adjust a lot of values in the lua files to make farming more bearable. For me personally you have to do too much monotonous work/farming before you can build something interesting."
740,why no sex
741,Good?
742,"This game sucks. It's another ""In theory it could be a good game"". 
-In Theory you build a vehicle and do..something. Problem is that the physics are off. To get a vehicle to drive in a straight line it must go so slow it's pointless to have a vehicle.
-It's advertised like sandbox. It's not. Your only option is to build gigantic suvs. the parts are so big there's no such thing as compact sports cars and there's no gear boxes or anything to make motorcycles so you cant make a away to turn any vehicle besides cars, suvs. etc.  assuming you are used to games like these, even once you figure out how to make fast little compact vehicles the game is soft coded so the vehicle will not stick to the ground regardless.
          -I can see games being difficult, maybe kind of annoying but this one is broken. It's another in theory game."
743,"Good mechanics
Bad survival

Maybe wait for a discount"
744,requires brain usage but is fun
745,A awesome game.
746,">Stand around for 10 minutes wondering wtf do I do.
>Drive to nowhere for an hour in a slow sh*tty car. 
>Get zerg rushed by several pitchfork wielding mobs with infinite aggro.
>Get p*ssed at the lack of block mechanic.
>Die.
>Rage quit.
>Uninstall."
747,Very good game! 10/10
748,very good game
749,"wow

750,nice
751,fun
752,"you can't play in offline
so you can't play it when you have no internet"
753,it is good i am forsed to make this commet to make the bar go away
754,amazing!
755,"Gamedevs has this weird oppinion that everything beyond 2m from the camera should be rendered att 240p.

No idea if the game itself is good or not because i couldn't stand the game looking like barf with jaggies on a 1440p screen if stuff was beyond 2m away.

Had to return it."
756,very fun car go brum brum
757,yes
758,minecraft but with small blocks and potatoe guns
759,Addictive and fun. I play it with my 9 year old kid. He likes it a lot. I preffer him playing this than other crap.
760,i kinda dont like the game because i wish they had a tool where you can scale stuff
761,I could trap cows inside my 1 bedroom house 10/10
762,The boy Wocs make better milk than the girls
763,game is super fun and there is always neat stuff to do and create. I'm 150+ hours and i still don't understand some of the stuff you can use and do. definitely recommend it
764,only played game for 6 hours. for somebody that works and doesnt have very much free time this is not a game for you. the game doesnt offer a very good mission line or story. neither a way to look at what each material does or where to find it. dont enjoy a game that you have to research youtube videos to understand. i requested a refund but was denied because they only allow you 2 hours of playing time which is rediculous. very upset that i was not refund for a game i only played 6 hours and probably will never play again.
765,Yes
766,scrappy balls mechanic
767,very good
768,good.
769,The flying bugged things make this game even better u just see some shit fly in the air.

772,Loading...
773,ths is good for you
774,Epic
775,Great Game.
776,It is very fun
777,THIS GAME HAS KNOWLADGE ABOUT BEING A MECHANIC
778,amazing game so addictive with active updates its my favourite game by a large margin I 100% recommend this game if you like survival like things.
779,"Great game! Very fun and open ended, made lots of cool stuff on here!"
780,"its the best building game with the best mechanics ive ever seen.. the best game i would rate, other than stray, i rate 9-10 for mechanic and graphics."

796,"I recommend this game, I don't know if it's worth it solo personally for me, and also they need to optimize it a hell of a lot more, but it's early access. overall this game is good, I say if you like building games, get it, but also the refund system on steam is really nice too!"
797,l

800,pretty cool
801,physics go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
802,"4 types of enemies is a joke

809,this game blows cock
810,amazing game!
811,decent game so far only played a bit tho
812,it cool with the creativity but lags when to much is placed
813,I crashed in to the twin towers and then bouth this game and did the same
814,its really fun. I highly recommend this for creative people.

818,"I'll also give the review:

""Very good game, sadly refunded it because I'm not very creative.""

"
819,"yeah nah, nah yeah"
820,lots of corn
821,Great game
822,"I do recommend this game to all as this game has game play scaling from easy small builds to the hardest of logic. Many different people could enjoy with its easy to learn controls with this game the world border is the limit. This game has let me sprout my ideas of automated cars to flying machines, there is nothing you cant do in this amazing game."
823,this is DEFINITELY ONE OF the games ever made

Great fun with friends!"

828,"Good game, lots of creativity. Good memories. Let me release my inner engineer."
829,mad fun
830,so fun. my kid loves this game. he watches hours of youtube videos then goes to recreate them. its a wonderful sandbox
831,"One of my favourite games of all time, quickly became my most played game. The game has a sandbox mode which i sunk hundreds of hours into and a survival mode that can be very fun with friends but a bit boring on your own."
832,Goood gammmmme
833,good. You can never get mad in this game. Even i can't get annoyed and that's saying something.
834,the creative is good but the survival is bad... very confusing and not enjoyable.... idk its not my type of game
835,very good
836,very fun game
837, very nice relaxing inventive creative game :)
838,"This game is good for young, creative minds hoping to learn about mechanics or just have a fun time."

850,Hello. Very interesting game ever i hear. I played a lot in creative mod and survival gamemods for a long time. I have 730 Hours played in this game. Butttt... The optimization it's kinda bad everytime when you make a mutiplayer gamemode and somebody join everytime lags on mutiplayer and everytime the game lags when you put a big creation or the game has to much parts in a creation. But still a interesting game i hear. I recommended who like making creations and survive into a world with robots.

852,"Scrap Mechanic is a game that has something for everyone. You can build whatever the hell you can imagine the only limitations are your imagination and lag. But even my computer, that isn't built for gaming, runs Scrap Mechanic very well. Be sure to download some mods from the Steam Workshop though. Vanilla game, at least for me, has a bit too little variety of interactive parts (controllers, thrusters etc.)

But by all means, If you like sandbox building games, go for it. You won't be dissappointed."
853,Fantastic Game
854,i dont even remember playing this game
855,"Very Fun Game, It Has A Good Storyline, Its Fun To Build And Play, I Love It."
856,very fun
857,One of the best games I've ever played
858,"buil;ing i fun

859,100%
860,best game ever does not get updates very often tho
861,"A Great Game to begin with an awesome Developer team working hard to make it better each day, The game play awesome as well as the building simple an easy ""chefs kiss"" i'd say 5 stars out of 5."
862,"One of my favorite games of all time. The amount of things to do, its charm and the creativity it breathes into you is amazing."
863,this is the most fun game i own i highly recommend
864,its a fun game

8/10 Pretty good game much lag tho"
880,It's a fun game where you have to use your brain to figure out what will work and what won't. there's farming aspects and survival aspects. it's a challenge yet not so hard you get frustrated.
881,you can build a car and run over cows
882,"One of the most creative games, I have ever played in my life. This is without a doubt 10/10."
883,god tier game

885,Best game:D good for creative gamers :))
886,"Apparently development basically stopped in favor of supporting Raft?
Think it has been about 2 years since i last played and survival mode hasn't changed at all."
887,"Epic game, just that my pc isn't powerful enough to run it smoothly üò≠"
888,great fun
889,Always online is such crap. I haven't played the main game yet so maybe there is a reason but I am starting on the challenges and that for sure doesn't need multiplayer so why is it a requirement to launch this paid for game. Sorry weather hasn't been great locally. Fine game but thumbs down for that oversite. I don't even think they are doing anything malicious but still isn't great if it is a bug.
890,"great game, lots of fun

great for creative outlet"
891,its osome

893,great Game
894,great fun
895,"While currently still in early access, the recently implemented tutorial works well and helped me figure out why my starting vehicle didn't work very well, would be nice if the next major update expanded on the story, or added an intro for lore
All in all, I look forward to what Axalot has in store, as I am hard to disappoint"
896,"i have spent over 200 hours creating machines and for what? what is the purpose of this? have i wasted 200 fucking hours on  nothing? no. i have not, for my machines are glorious. join the machines. join us."
897,k
898,poggers
899,"The game has a lot of good qualities. The building mechanics are interesting because they seem simple but can become incredibly complicated. The movement and camera is smooth and there does not seem to be too many major game breaking issues. The reason I do not recommend this title yet is that the game has no direction, the world is bland and boring, and play is genuinely boring. This was the same problem with Raft, except Raft has an air of exploration that made it superior to this title. It has been over two years since purchasing and little has been done to improve the game. I do not foresee any major new content, and what is currently here is not fun, so I do not perceive my review changing."
900,It is the best game EVER! and i am super suprised that it is still in develement
901,LOL my pc exploded
902,NOTE:this game is worth to buy if u creativ enought to play this game. this game need creativity to play. i recommended not buy this if u not creativity or hard to learn
903,its really fun you should try it i have 1062 hours in this game and so can you
904,By far one of the best games I have ever played. I love that you have to get creative with what you build. 10/10
905,good game
906,good game
907,Fun to play with my wife! Don't really suggest if your living that solo life. But playing solo is possible - just more boring as a lot of the content is just screwing around.
908,tastes like chicken
909,great sandbox biiig learning curve tho
910,Scrap Mechanic has fairly realistic-ish physics and has a few bugs but it's still a fun game and it's also easy to mod so you can find building blocks the base game doesn't have and even make the game more realistic.
911,"Very great survival game, I enjoy the part where you can build pretty much anything and that you can mod it but the best thing about it is survival anyway game 4.5 star rating because I think more stuff can be added."
912,I think this game
913,Its very good and can let you plan IRL stuff.
914,"LOVE the game, absolute favourite game on steam. All the new updates including new features and mods, just show how much effort the developers put into the game. 4.8 stars.

-unbeatable0nyt"
915,good game
916,"This is a gem hidden amongst other games, although not having an ending it can provide hours of enjoyable and engaging content, would recommend to anyone who likes a good challenge, robots, and trail makers and other physic based games. 9/10"
917,"Haven't played it much, but seems like a pretty neat game so far."

It's great to build random creation creations too see what happens!


Survival can be laggy at times and updates take a long time.
When the updates do hit they're pretty solid...
Honestly if you're a engineering geek this game is a 10/10

935,este foarte fain

945,its its its its YOUR MOM
946,i only bought this game thanks to the Neebs Gaming YT channel and honestly i love playing it
947,Its a creative game
948,"Some may say that i have spent an unhealthy amount of time in this game, and i agree. I really have had an unhealthy amount of fun!"
949,game
950,Very good! Never gets boring.
951,"I have been playing this game for a lot of time... But now I have finally hit one of my goals!

1,337.0 (Haha funni number) hrs on Scrap Mechanic so I can safely write my review about this game

This game has absolutely the best build mechanics which allow you to make electronics I've ever seen.
But the survival mode to me was a little bit... Ehh, the survival mode is fine but it gets me boring really quickly.
The creative is literally amazing because it has the smallest amounts of parts to make something cool.
But those parts are enough to create an entire computer!

This game is for everyone who is creative!
Want to build a computer? Here you go! Enough electric parts to make something nice!
Want to build a nice art? Easy! Just take those blocks and the paint tool!
Want to build a challenge that people will have to complete? Here you go! An entire gamemode just for creating challenges!

This game could not get any better!
Or can it?

Anyways I said everything about the good parts of the game! But what about the bad parts?

So me and my friends love glitching the game to do something interesting. And here are some examples!
Me and my friends literally loved making underground building! Patched... But still usable.
Freezing objects mid air and launching them with hammers! Patched... And no workaround for this one :(

I know that bugs are bad and they have to be fixed. But not the fun ones!

Next problem that I want to tell about is... Performance!
No... I'm not going to say that ""Wow my PC is so fast that this game flies""
I'm going to say things that are way worse than this.

So the game is very slow on portable devices or old PCs. It is so slow that I have to choose between.
Low graphics and full resolution or high graphics and low resolution

At least the most recent update (0.6) finally brought better optimization and better multiplayer sync...

OH! How could I forget!
The multiplayer problem...
So multiplayer sync is pretty nice... My friends have been reporting to me a lot of time a very annoying problem...
The problem is... Sometimes some objects would just get flown up in the air and then go back to their places...
And repeat that... Yeah people wont get that. We need an example

So lets imagine a car that stands in one place and does nothing.
Host sees it as... Normal car!
But some friends see it as...

Le back wheel gets flown in the air, freezes midair for few seconds,
Flies back to its respective place, few seconds and then it just repeats.

Anyways would I recommend this game...
Drum roll...

YES! This game is amazing and it was one of the games that me and my friends were really enjoying playing!
Should you play it? Its your choice! Are you creative? If yes then play this game!
All your creativity would become real with this game!

Anyways, thanks for reading.
I hope you will have a lot of fun in this game."

955,"Fun, buggy but fun"

957,yes haybot go brrrrr

Don't forget to try out some of the custom games included, especially Raft Mechanic."
961,Great Game 10/10
962,:] is nice.
963,"The FitnessGram‚Ñ¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."
964,good game but i mist the 666h mark for this post or the 669h
965,it was fun
966,It's a very enjoyable creative game that open up a lot of possibilities and expand the building limitation and if you are a adventurous guy more than a builder it has survival mode too with hundreds of mods to be add to both types of worlds and also have challenge that test how much a creative builder you are.With tens of customization for your character to choose between scrap mechanic is an awesome game.
967,"very good
"
968,yes
969,"good i guess
"
970,ITS GUD play it right NOW!
971,pretty good game and i love the challenges of farming
972,great game controls a bit weird but its worth it

975,two maniacs who called them selves mechaniers create a house made out of radios. if you see them run away as they will hit you with a metal tool until they can carry you
976,"Very cool creative mode, I haven't played much since Survival came out and I only played Survival once so i don't have an opinion. But creative mode is lit."
977,fun
978,"it is a game that will help people understand how to design and build cars, also how u must work to get supplies"
979,awesome!
980,"Way too hard solo in some areas, my bodys surrounded by 6 bots and i cant build guns, i can run there and kill them but that takes forever and the first car you can make is by my dead body and slower than running.  Survival needs an overhaul, guns need to be the first thing you make considering you can't dodge or run faster than the robots..."
981,I really liked this game it was really good but hard to build in I would say to just make it easier to build because I spent hours trying to make a bugati
982,Awesome game where creativity is the key to solving your problems!
983,"It's a fun game but right now building is horrible, there is barely any content, and getting materials is way too hard also it lags like crazy if you use too many pistons which is about 5+"
984,great game
985,"This is my favorite game. I play and watch hours of this game. I own three copies of the game so I can play with my family. 

and yet they refuse to play

BECAUSE THERE IS NOT AN UNDO!

At this exact moment I would give it 2 stars, because the clunk don't unFUBAR! Hours of work can be FUBAR in 1 missed click. Ask me what just happened go ahead ask...
"
986,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" ‚Äì on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."
987,It may be a little complex with wiring the builds you make. But it is mostly a very fun and challenging game can't wait for more updates!!
988,i love the creativeness of this amazing game i had for a long time p.s. plz finish the turret seat.
989,amazing game
990,Best game!
991,best game ever imagination is the only limit (like a few other games)

1002,fun with freinds
1003,It's not crappy it's scrappy.
1004,sooo fuuuuuuuun!!!
1005,"fun
"
1006,"Worth it. You can do pretty much anything.
"
1007,"As i am writing this review, game is at Verison 0.6, and i've had @48 hours playtime.

A fun survival sandbox builder where your imagination is the limit.
Tutorial missions in survival mode are very basic and teaches you the bare minimum for making a vehicle. (I didn't play the challenges yet, but from my understanding they might teach you more advanced techniques)

I've played (in my opinion) a fair time of Raft, and Scrap Mechanic has a similar vibe to it (they have same dev./publisher afterall). Highly recomended to play with friends, it increases the fun x10 to have a common goal, creative buildoffs or just fooling around. 
"
1008,It fun
1009,I have 248 hours in the game and I have never gotten bored!
1010,GOOD GAME MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING

1046,"This game is great, and I like the mods that can be selected. This game is great for only those who desire to build and create. Would recommend it to young engineers and anyone who enjoys building!"

1077,good bulding game
1078,"The reason why I find this game so addicting is because of the amazing things you ca build. Sure, it takes a long time to gather the resources to build the stuff, but even gathering the resources is way more enjoyable then other ""grindy"" games. It's the best game on the market for a survival-tech game."
1079,Best game in my opinion
1080,Spent years making challenge mode. Survival mode still lags for anyone that isn't the host when pistons are introduced into the game. I actually liked this game...it's just that I expected the devs to fix a known bug that is this detrimental after TWO years. I can't in good conscience give a thumbs up to lazy asses that can't get the basics right.
1081,Its been over 2 years and they put out an update for some challenge mode and still the memory leak issue for having to many pistons or water pumps in the game in multiplayer mode is still not fixed. They claim they fixed bugs but have yet to fix the most important bug that makes the game unplayable in survival mode with friends. I doubt they will fix this since its already been over 2 years and even though the game is very fun and unique its unplayable if you wish to play with friends. You're wasting your money if you're looking for a multiplayer experience. Don't purchase!
1082,Lol yes
1083,"super fun
"
1084,e
1085,It is very glitchy  and the graphics are good

1089,epic game !!
1090,.
1091,FTY
1092,game is good
1093,"This game for many years has been on my personal wishlists of engineering games I wanted to try. I've played for barely half a dozen hours, frankly was upmostly disappointed and was expecting a little bit more from a game that's hasn't changed much through with 6 years of early access. There's a lot of things you'd naturally expect from a engineering-building game that isn't offered in this one, as in many similar others that did in fact had said key components. Overall it has a very fun potential going to wastes, for the present, atleast, and apparently six entire years prior of absurd progress. Altough not as bad as to go out of my way to get a refund, I do not think that this game is worth any close to 25 canadian dollars at its current state of development."
1094,"Scrap Mechanic is really fun! This game has a creative mode, a challenges mode, and the newest, survival mode! Creative is for the ones who like to build things, Challenges is for the ones who like to, well y'know, have a challenge, and survival for the ones who like building, having a challenge, and those who like survival games! So, yeah, read this review, and see if the game is for you! (I just now realized that rhymes) Thanks for reading this! Bye!"
1095,"Very great game, super fun to play, you can create some awesome things. Experiment with all that is available for this game (which is almost endless), have fun playing with your friends with their fast connection speed multiplayer servers and go against huge robots in survival mode. I personally find creative mode more fun, as you have more things to use, but i'd say give survival a try as well. Challenge mode also opens up loads of opertunities for fun collaborative puzzle solving and solo expeditions through the many challenging puzzles. I rate this game a 9.3 out of 10! I would like to see  non modded wings and some sort of wind physics, as well as the long awaited gimbal/turret seat (mouse controlled which is very good for dogfighting planes!)."
1096,yea I mean uhhh....
1097,"some minor issues are there that can be rooted off.

1. Map is needed
2. Some rare key components like component kit should be a craft item and not a collectors item"
1098,people who have played this more then a hour are not okay in there head
1099,"GOOD

1100,Scrap Machenig
1101,  very cool !
1102,e
1103,very fun game nice to play good for kids because its not bad like no blood no swears just try it its a great game for creativity
1104,"Im leaving a thumbs down, although its a fun game its very confusing to build big and cool stuff
This game is not for the people who don't wanna invest hours to learn how to do things
BUT if you do decide to do so i would recommenced
also the survival is kinda a joke to me"
1105,crap mechanic
1106,it has sooooooo manny posabilitys.
1107,poo
1108,"Maybe add a couple of new enemies, 20-40 items to the list plus some new weapons and actual progression instead of just, ""go to werehouse, get cool skin item and then you're done"". The rest is just creative, you buy this game to your 5 year old so he can learn basic shapes and maybe he'll get the message that veggies are good. So dont waste the 20 on Tonka Creative mode For WiiU, wait for a sale.  Needs so much more to be considered a good survival crafting game. Super far from that 1.0."
1109,cool gaem
1110,"this game so far so good. But, WE NEED THE SURVIVAL STORY!!! ASAP."

1123,Build car go fun
1124,poggies moment
1125,good game reminds me of minecraft
1126,"Good price for an awesome endless creative game where you can create almost anything you think of. I've wanted this game for a long while, and i am not disappointed. My only nags are that the survival mode is repetitive and can get boring, but other than that its an amazing game."
1127,"Got started in survival mode for a little bit.  I tried planting then all of a sudden robots destroys your crops, kills you several times, and I can't find that machanical what ever place.  Tripped the entire island, got 12 components still having a hard time figuring it out. No Map or general position even if it has fog of war, I be ok with it.  But none.  I figure I give it some time but still it is completely lacking in the tutorial department and not allow you start space.  So no."
1128,"I love this game. It's the ultimate mechanical creative engine. The sandbox mode is more fun than I've had in a long time. The Survival mode can put off some people, due to it's ridiculous grindyness, but the sandbox mode alone is worth it."
1129,"game banga

1132,"Unleash your infinite creativity in this mechanical sandbox! Make contraptions, vehicles and t-posing bears. Or whatever you else could imagine. Simple components complete complicated products. With the buildt-in steam workshop you can share your creations with the world, or download others! Easily download community-made mods through the workshop."
1133,"A pretty good game. I love the bright, colorful, kind of cutesy world as a breath of fresh air from gritty looking survival games. The vehicle crafting is pretty great. It felt incredibly rewarding to continually improve upon a vehicle design that functioned better and better each time. It tickled my brain to add adjustable pistons at the press of a button to give my mining car more floor clearance so it stopped getting stuck on things and forcing me to manually pick it up and move it so often. To add more adjustable, increasingly complex parts using simple logic paths was a sometimes frustrating but ultimately rewarding experience.

The progression is a little bit slow in the survival mode, however. It took a while to get to the point everything starts some level of automation and by then I needed a break. It also struggles to really present its goals in that mode. I had learned the world was actually somewhat bereft of unique locations to explore (the world is randomly generated at start and will re-use assets and loot locations to fill it out), and felt that most of what I had left to do was build for the sake of building. Make a mining car to get more materials, get more materials to make a better mining car, repeat until it's time to make a bunch of defenses for the wave defense that happens when farming, then mine to build more defenses, repeat, etc. -- which is fine, I enjoyed my time perfectly fine, but there's just a noteworthy lack of depth."
1134,it was fun good game
1135,"I love it!!! Need game to play ""LEGO"" with your friends? This game is for You.
Only thing i will change is add more story."
1136,"Creative building mode is probably the best in the business at this point. Marketplace is full of inspired designs. Physics simulation is well done, optimization is good. Online multiplayer works really well. This game is one of our go-to's for just hanging out and building stuff, which is probably the best sort of game possible in my humble opinion."
1137,"This is one of the best games I've ever played. Although there is no finish to survival, it's still super fun. You can do some very stupid things, and yet you can do extremely impressive and hard things. I got this game while i was on sale but I still recommend it for full price."
1138,This game (while having some physics glitches) provides a excellent simulation of machines and vehicles. The game does not limit your creativity by letting you build to the extent of your computer's power. The workshop has a constantly expanding wide range of creations that you can play with or take inspiration from for your own creations. I've never played multiplayer so I don't know what it's like. The game can have some lag issues with buildings but if you weld the creation to the world it should be fine.

1151,very good. funny too.
1152,Fun to play online or offline there is some many thing to explore and so many creations to create i think YOU would love it
1153,23
1154,Fun
1155,"I personally have spent over 250 hours on this game, pretty sure I started in 2016-2017 era when only creative was in the game, without challenge mode or survival, despite those game modes being in the game nowadays, I spent most of my time in creative before they were out, this proves at least to me the game can be fun even if there is no clear goal, for me it was just about trying to build the best and most crazy contraption yet, the main focus of the game is to build, and in that it is strongest, you don't have to be good at building (though it does help, a lot) to have fun in this game, building in this game is entirely up to you, with in depth mechanics that I have yet to master, the graphics are nice if you have a computer with a strong CPU and GPU, it is very intensive on those parts with the physics mechanics, though there is a slider to lower them if needed, I even managed to get it running on a 2012 Lenovo Thinkpad T420s, which shows how well optimised the game is nowadays, it's a fun game that is good for everyone with mechanics for every person (that being shooting, building,farming,survival etc)  and I would recommend you buy this if it looks like the kind of game you would play. Can be a bit buggy sometimes though this was never a big problem for me. Overall, would definitely recommend you play this

1156,"Hi, i like this game for a few houres but it became boring because i don't have any friends to play with. My respond on this game is that it would be fun if you can play with friends and not alone. I'm pretty sad that i needed to ask a refund because it got boring on my own. But the first few houres is played was a lot of fun. I only wish my friends had this game."
1157, very nice game one of my fav nice to play with friends and alone ... building in the game is very awesome graphics are cool etc
1158,good game
1159,flying crack house go brrrr....
1160,"Thank you Kanye, very cool"
1161,my small brain cant handle this game
1162,yes
1163,AMAZING GAME
1164,"Fun physics sandbox, with making machines to survive"
1165,"its scrap mechanic, I got what is want :)"
1166,if you ever wanted to create something like lets say a robot so for this game you can build a lot of creations. this game is for people that  want to have fun creating anything they want.
1167,"fun and great for physics fun with some combat. i wish the farm attacks were a little less frequent though, as playing alone means guarding crops if you are trying to grow food."
1168,bots... too many bots... im shitting my pants
1169,Only game where you can do... (you will need to get the game to find out)
1170,gut
1171,it is awsome
1172,"Scrap Mechanic...the game where I almost passed out just trying to find out what logic gate i'm supposed to connect, anyways, the game is super fun, thousands of mods available, but I prefer vanilla, but you do you, i'm not here to judge. In this amazing game, both survival and creative are INSANELY time consuming, I have almost 900 hours in this game, in which I have only made 12 decent creations, and the rest are just pretty dumb things I made. I'm not saying you have to know what you are doing to enjoy this game, there are plenty of ways to play, but yes, this game is amazing! I hope you find my way to long review useful enough to make you consider purchasing this game, unless you already purchased it and are just looking at reviews, because why not. Anyways, overall, I recommend this game to any person who likes sandbox games, but also likes a nice mechanical and technological feel to it.


P.S- Check out my content in my workshop! (It has a lot of trains, pretty nice trucks from snowrunner and a few dumb things I made when I was bored.)"

1224,I love this game for all the things that you can do.
1225,you can bidd enetin
1226,I like scrap mechanic but it seems like im at the end of the content . I feel im just repeating  things over and over for no grand purpose. Its like im at the top of the content waiting on more. Fun game though
1227,Good game but I think only specific people would play it because It has a bit of a learning curve
1228,"Fantastic game, near infinite replayability and and brilliant sandbox mechanics, basically anything is possible to build with very few restrictions as to what the game and parts are capable of in terms of what you can make. Surprisingly pretty graphics and simple yet effective aesthetic make creative mode feel vibrant and survival very atmospheric.
However the physics engine can sometimes struggle with certain things, and multiplayer can be rough however with recent and future updates this is getting better. Sadly major content updates are fairly infrequent as per the small dev team, but with any luck we'll have a huge new update coming later this year.

All in all, 9/10, perfect for anyone who likes sandboxes."
1229,cum in me zaddy
1230,"Very good game, sadly refunded it because im not very creative"
1231,195 hours

1240,"Honestly amazing game especially in sandbox when u discover mods and the workshop where u can now spawn fatboy bombs.
The Survival mode was a great addition to the game. Where they added blocks that could float so you could make boats.

1250,"Online multiplayer is the buggiest, laggiest thing going right now. As the game currently stands if you intend to play this with friends just wait, most of the time is spent teleporting and rubberbanding from A-B whilst the rest of the time is spent running into a wall because you're completely frozen in place. The game has promise, the freedom to build is great as well as character customisation and it all seems like a lot of fun but right now playing the game online MP with one other person is like watching a slideshow presentation no matter who hosts. I hope my review can change in the future but for right now you're better off waiting."

Currently as of writing this review, Survival mode is [b]nothing[/b] like the video depicts. [b][i]Not even remotely close to the actual in game experience.[/i][/b]

The video for the Survival mode is all hype and [i]very misleading.[/i]"

1302,"I'm returning the game, even though I think it has promise, but holy crap... what a buggy mess. I've been stuck under things multiple times and had to crawl around and jam on the directional buttons to get unstuck. Had to restart once because I opened the 'help' menu then every time I pressed the left mouse button the 'help' menu would open. Had to restart another time because my character was stuck in bed after respawn, like she had sleep paralysis. For a game that has been in early access for 6 years, it sure doesn't play like squashing bugs has been a priority. It's a shame."
1303,"survival feels like a miss for me from lack of objective and general focus

but challenge mode is really fun"

1328,Amazing game when played with friends and some single player. I find that single player can get a bit boring sometimes but its fun with friends!
1329,tHIS IS A FUN GAME!

1333,"The game felt very bland. It did not feel like there was much to do other than gather resources and build, and fight a few robots here and there."
1334,game good
1335,"it got aerodinamic mod innit, already one of the best games"
1336,This the best game ever!

1341,cool
1342,just love having fun make cool car and other builds
1343,"The fun car building stuff is overshadowed by the dogshit survival aspect, I've played more than enough survival games to know what works for players. The game discourages you to make a base because of some dumb mechanic station that forces you to stay in one spot to progress. There is no map, just waypoints so have fun getting lost. those 2 things are crucial to the survival game experience, picking a spot on the map and making a home for yourself. I hope the devs take the time to add in these 2 minute things that almost every other survival game on the planet has."

1351,bruh no cap
1352,big pp game
1353,I think that it's a great game!
1354,funn
1355,Just Waiting for full release
1356,This game is beyond terrible tedious do do anything on it and multiplayer is virtually impossible with the amount of lag you will get
1357,"Can't say it's a SOLID game, there are a plethora of things to be sad about, but I recommend this game nonetheless. The game offers something I haven't felt since my days as a child playing Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts; the creative freedom to build. Albeit, Nuts & Bolts was extremely limited, this game is very much less so. Barring the annoying graphical drops with more complicated contraptions and logic, the game offers creative freedom that I haven't seen while also being packaged in a 'cutesy' world of dwarfs and farming equipment gone awry. I am excited to see a full release with better physics, graphical processing, and a larger array of components to build from."
1358,fun
1359,"This game is amazing. I can't imagine anything else to recommend to players who want a sandbox building experience, or who want a survival experience. After a proud 535 hours, I can definitely say that this is going to be staying in my top 3 games for as long as I have steam."
1360,totally play it its super fun when you get the hang of it but the ad thing is there are robots trying to raid your base the green totebots take 3 hits to kill with the hammer the yellow haybot takes 5 gits to kill the farm bot he red big dude takes a lot of hits theres more bots i just said the normal ones
1361,Neat!
1362,"SCRAP MECHANIC IS A GAME THAT HAS BEEN EVOLVING OVER MANY YEARS AND HAS COME TO SUPPORT IT'S USERS CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY LIKE NO OTHER SAND BOX EVER HAS. 
LES PUT IT THIS WAY THE SCRAP MECHANIC COMMUNITY CAN MAKE ALL ASPECTS OF ANY OTHER GAME BESIDES GRAPHICS INSIDE SCRAP MECHANIC."
1363,i think this game is super fun even with out mods! you survive and kill bot and go to the trader

1366,"This game is not friendly to left handed players. 

Simply the effort of trying to remap controls was more frustrating then any other game I've remapped so I can enjoy it with my keyboard. Without controller support I didn't have my standard backup when remapping doesn't work. 

My first person game controls often use the keypad as wasd, replacing them with 8456 for movement and other buttons for other controlls. For instance 9 is often my reload button for guns, the right arrow button on my arrow keys as jump, zero is sprint and more. Howver for some reason this game frustratingly considers buttons like right oh my arrow keys as the same as pressing 6. its just one example but it happened alot and ruined my normal control set up and made what set ups I tried to use very uncomfortable and quickly unbearable after the frustrating of dealing with this issue. 

It might be my keyboard but after playing a ton of first person games this is the only time I have ever had this issue. 

A smaller gripe is the delay when playing in a multiplayer game. If you're not the host your inputs are delayed but I can forgive this if it was an issue considering I was playing with someone from poland while i'm in the western US."
1367,There is a lot you can do in the normal game with no mods.
1368,"i would recommend highly to this game and to all of its features, BUT it does has many bugs which can affect your game play quite drastically, so i would give this some more time to improve."
1369,It gud
1370,this game is minecraft with physics and the chisel mod
1371,Big brain stuff
1372,"its great if you like to be able to build/create whatever you want, although the update cycle for this game is quite long, for it taking 1 year for large updates, and about 3 months-ish for small updates"
1373,"good game
"
1374,gamer
1375,"The game itself offers tons of possibilities on what creativity means. Having challenges to help you learn and understand its mechanics is quite fun and really makes you figure out how to engineer solutions to different problems. Then you jump in creative mode to come up with the craziest ideas (if you are one curious person like me) and the amount of mods made for it makes worth trying the game.

Survival mode although fun and cool still needs improvement and structure to its end. It seems like it still lacks a big objective to reach, but it's understandable if you think it's still in development.

The only downside for me is optimization. It can always be better."
1376,good

1386,"This game is everything I thought it would be and more!

I bought this game a long time ago when all the top streamers on twitch were playing it but never had a really good pc or the time to play it. However, I have just finished my first little play through and need to go eat my dinner now but I thought I best leave an instant review to express how I felt in the moment.

10/10"
1387,I enjoy this very much.  creativity gone wild and with some intro to logic programming wrapped up in a package my Kiddo can tear into.
1388,"The only mode I and my friends somewhat enjoy is survival mode where all the engineering creativity ultimately has a purpose. My hopes for survival mode may have been (and still are) too high, just like my hopes for Axolot's focus when expanding the game. 

Scrap Mechanic has a plethora of content, but nothing is complete. Axolot has incredible potential in developing the game, but would rather make up new content than making any content complete.       

I hope that I am wrong and would love to come back to fully enjoy any of the game's aspects."

1398,"I loaded into creative mode with excitement in my eyes and hope in my heart. 
I have heard so much about this game, from neebs, from my friends and now finally from myself. 

as I popped into existence I looked around, the environment was nice and ran smooth on my laptop, I made my first car and drove it, it flipped and gave me a bad headache when I decided to improve my car craftsmen ship, I browsed deep into the block catalog until a stumbled upon a block I desired most 

the mountable spud launcher

for the next several hours I worked on various turret and anti-air site designs, before installing mods and strapping actual missles to the daim thing


8/10- good game"
1399,Great game still after 5 years
1400,Brilliant <3
1401,"This game is amazing. At first I thought it was just a survival crafting game, but then, after the first 5 hours playing, I realized that it is actually an in depth engineering game. Most of the game you're trying to figure out what contraption you need to make to solve a problem you have, that and the tower defence like mini game that you play when farming made this game a 10 / 10 game for me."
1402,"I'm going to give this game an 9/10 right now. I just love it! It's so fun to play, especially with a friend. It just feels a little empty without a story to follow. A lot of games like this do well with a set story to learn without an endgame. It's hard to tell if this game will have a real story or not. There are some tidbits that feel like a story that you can pick up here and there. Despite not having a story-story, it is very fun and there is a LOT to do!  :)   I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a new game, enjoy building things or engineering in general, and sandbox style games."
1403,This is a really good sandbox/surival game you can build structes/vecihles.
1404,"Like Minecraft with respect to gameplay.

Pros: Really cool mechanics for building creations and making functional machines for whatever you want (vehicles, doors, weapons, even games and computers if you're good with logic); relatively realistic physics; practically infinite amount of awesome creations to see from the workshop

Cons: Laggy when using too many joints or having a massive creation; annoying bugs when pushing the physics too far (the physics engine is outdated and won't change any time soon); janky multiplayer; Axolot doesn't really seem to want to fix some of the worst bugs

Overall extremely good, but there's potential for it to be even more extremely good if the devs had their priorities straight. Despite some of the major cons, this is possibly my favorite game of all time, right up there with Minecraft."
1405,how good is this game? yes
1406,.
1407,so you slap some wheels on a box and pray that it works well. it probably will lose traction and roll over. gud game. Even better with friends.
1408,Engineer Gaming 9/10
1409,"this is an amazing game
"
1410,"best sandbox game on steam. so confusing, yet so simple to make incredible machines. survival is not my favorite though. I have had this game since a little over 1 and a half years after the first steam release. Best steam purchase i have ever made. its like minecraft redstone, but 10x more complex and not as boring"
1411,Recycle simulator
1412,"A very very fun creative game, you can build a lot of things and have a lot of freedom to make things as complex or simple as you want them to be."

1421,this game is very beautiful
1422,"I like it
"
1423,yes
1424,you get to build whatever your heart desires
1425,"At nearly 1,000 hours as of time of writing this, Survival is interesting, and I see potential, but holy damn the shit you can do in Creative (and more with mods)
I've built everything from Tanks, cars, Stealth fighters/bombers, aircraft carriers, cargo ships, guided/smart bombs. Nearly anything is possible, tho the physics is real funky, especially in Survival (your vehicle despawning and respawning at speeds of excess of 500 km/h) and this game is a whole different beast with friends, as all games are.

but seriously, if you have any amount of creativity, but this game. *You do not have a choice*"
1426,"A good game, challenge your mind to build something good if you want complex or simple. The problem is there are some glitches that I experience. when I went to the edge of the tile, My vehicle always disappear and will appear for a minute or second. I hope this concern will be notice. Thank you."

1443,Good game
1444,It is overall just amazing.
1445,is nice
1446,"Very shreky and hot, multiplayer kinda laggy but otherwise better than you expect from a demo game"
1447,YOUR MUM
1448,"it is very good
"
1449,I still haven't been able to download or play this game. I need help !!!
1450,Very epic game
1451,good
1452,"great game, love the gameplay"
1453,best game for train
1454,this is the game to get you addicted if you love building fricking anything
1455,"This game fine physics (play on advanced settings or else your basically just a joke), Going around exploring is cool but with the fact you can make creations in creative or make spacific things in challage mode is just a fun experience! also with mods, creations and custom gamemodes add so much! (Get this when you can!)"
1456,"Great game spent years playing it and still enjoy it car go vroom bomb go boom spiny berang go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"
1457,"Great game, lots of fun, lots of mods. 10/10."
1458,"its so good i built a plane, shot a rocket and crashed my fookin game"
1459,fun its easy to build stuff
1460,s
1461,"The game is decent so far. The ""mechanic"" part of the game is pretty good if you're in creative because all the parts are available. So there's a lot of building and experimenting you can do. 

The problem for me is survival. I feel like the progression in the beginning is waaaaaaaay too slow and some things I have to look up because they're so hard to find. 

They really should take a page from BOTW because the progression is so natural in that game even without much explanation.

Fighting is a chore and clunky but absolutely necessary for progression. And, AFAIK, there is no way to upgrade your weapons to be more efficient in fighting. Baddies come after your crops every few minutes with no real explanation.

The creative part of the game is fun but in survival the progression is so slow that you won't be making anything decent for hours.

Hopefully, they work on the progression and make fighting a better experience because I don't feel like the fighting mechanic feels good or is fun."
1462,badass Robo Genocide
1463,suser amoguser
1464,Good game I love the updates I like the creative mode better then survival tho.
1465,its a really good building game
1466,gud
1467,If you want to do something creative (or just stupid) this is probably the best game for that. Although the dev's are somewhat slow in releasing new updates the Comunity behind this game is absolutly amazing and pumps out tons of new and creative stuff!
1468,It's just a great game. Play it and you will love it.
1469,Its a very fun game to play alone or with friends. if you like survival games and building you will probably like the game. i have had alot of fun playing with friends and building vehicles trying them out to see if they work the way we want. oh also i done alittle bit of the challenge mode which is fun also. Also i forgot about the have mods support so if you like to mess around with that you can.
1470,"its cool
"
1471,"it is an amazing game with lots of fun builds you can make
"
1472,very fun and you can do whatever
1473,Good game

"
1480,veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy nice game
1481,the game is really good and is fun and really creative. you can also make you own vehicles or robots so play it. and i have also 187 hours of game time.
1482,"Its amazing, but it is pretty hard on survival. It is harder on multiplayer survival because everybody refuses to have our own farms, and me and the people i play with always eat the food.
I would love to do some really cool stuff, but I am not very good.
Amazing for people who like dedication and learning."
1483,this game is perfect!
1484,"Awesome game, creative is fun and survival is fun plus with more features in development im sure sm will get the attention and recognition it deserves.  right now its kinda unpopular but ive been following the games progress since before the weld tool was added and trust me when i say it has improved so much since then. im  sure things can only get better"
1485,Good game
1486,"This game is GREAT, with 923.5 hours on it, i can say its great.  Very Cog-champs of Axolot to make this."
1487,"The physics are, to say the least, i n t e r e s t i n g. but over all it is a great game."
1488,would recommend to others good game and a lot to do
1489,"I absolutely love this game, you can pretty much do whatever comes to mind. There are TONS of mods, items, building blocks, and interactables that you can have fun with. Your imagination can run wild in this game with little to no restrictions. 11/10 Would Recommend"
1490,"Very fun very good game 
Very easy"
1491,I really enjoy building in this game. Best in genre for building and engineering. Can not wait until it's finish... its going to be great

1510,no
1511,its a great game
1512,"I love this game and all its wacky ways of doing things. Its extremely fun to play solo and even more fun to play with friends. 

One thing bothers me though. We've waited like 2 entire years for some new fresh content on the survival branch of the game. I don't consider this to be abandonware but it seems like things go quite slow with this one.

Overall I'd play this anyways because of the amount of content if you are looking for something new."

1515,it fun to play i have 450 h

1532,ever since survival mode came out its been the best game ever
1533,great
1534,"Great content and fun to play!
But way shallow experience and all the tasks and main stuff that you need to get turns more into chores than actually fun parts of the game."
1535,"i love this game its help for the brain to develop
"
1536,"Game good, story bad, game devs working, game small, big price, sandbox good, game is good."
1537,very good
1538,"good
"
1539,"Best game ever, this is not a children's game it is a very good game if you are looking for: exploration, creativity, sandbox, multiplayer, and open world, you can have fun building cars and even planes if you are good enough at the game, you can build turrets, fight bots, you can farm, loot warehouses, and the mods are amazing (if you want a good mod for your survival experience check out the Fant Mod) the game runs on Lua so its easy to mod (if you know how to mod Lua) try out the game 10/10 my opinion!"

1560,great game
1561,I recommend this game because you are very free to build whatever you'd like. The freedom and yet nicely set boundaries and you can add any mod you've made or other people. overall i think this is one of my favorites games on steam.
1562,great fun lots of things to do and alot of the stuff seems challenging until you try and tackle it like controllers they seemed impossible to learn but they were quite easy to use once i learned how to use them
1563,I recomend this game

1600,"This is great game to play when board, or with friends."
1601,"It is very time comsuming and super fun game to explore with others and take some effort, but very fun! And you have many mods to help create and build want you desire. And if you want friend me and I can help you with scrap mechanic or just play with me."
1602,A fantastic development of the genre that manages to combine open world survival with fun and engaging design mechanics. Plus all the neat bonus modes help provide a change of pace from fending off robots in the middle of the night.
1603,"This game is pretty scrappy and it really does have good dice physics the toilets are good but my 5 year old son needs to go to the eye doctor for his terminal cancer he has and I dont have the money to pay for my bills, this game is a scrap out of 10"
1604,"IS A GOOD GAME i play 100 hours
"
1605,bra och roligt men creative
1606,"Truly one of the best games I have played, near endless hours of gameplay and infinite inventions to build. This is one of the few games I wholeheartedly enjoyed and recommend"
1607,I love this game because you can build farm and fight waves of bots
1608,v fun. much build. evil robots. wood play again
1609,This is an awesome game. I think that it is great because friends can work together in an epic adventure or mess around in creative mode. There are so many possibilities with this game. It is a must-have game for survival type gamers and sandboxe gamers alike.
1610,"Fun to learn and fun once ya get the hang of it its also good just to download stuff off the workshop
"
1611,"Yeah ,yes, sure, i think the same"
1612,scrap mechanic is an amazing game if you want to build a car or look at the workshop for ideas and to check out other players creations.
1613,I love this mostly survival
1614,It is wonderful. It's a lot like Minecraft and the Create Mod but on a much smaller scale. I highly recommend it.
1615,This is a great game for friends and a little more mechanical than games like TerraTech

1637,"honestly id love to enjoy this game but truthfully i cant, i got it for survival and honestly the begining needs A LOT OF WORK! come on like first off not enough food to start with, secondly once you actually get to the mechanic shop your nearly starving  and unless you know what your doing its really easy to soft lock your self, die in combat > respawn, run over starve to death right as you get there > rinse. i got this when survival first came out and it had no tutorial i heard they added one so i figured alright ill give it a shot, and that was my experience, hey maybe im just bad at the game but truth be told soft locking is something game devs should make it to where players can at least avoid it early on"
1638,"To be honest.... I was expecting more than this. But, it's good as all the other games I played > Signed - Soviet Bear >"
1639,"This is in my opinion the best survival game I ever played. You can build anything (and if you are good with logic gates program anything) [b]The sky is the limit, literally.[/b] Mods are supported too. Only thing I wish for is more regular updates.
Thanks to devs for making this game and anyone who supported it in any way."

1641,Iv'e been saving up for this game since i saw my nephew watching some videos of scrap man play it and now that i have it i'm really enjoying it. i'm really looking forward for new updates in the future and i love the new ideas for bots. good game and i'll recommend it to some friends!
1642,nuke go boom
1643,Controllers Don't Work According To Tutorial Book.
1644,Great game.
1645,good game
1646,mmmmmmmmm component kits
1647,This game sucked when i first got it but dude ever since survival hit i loved it. But it got boring and i did not play. but this new custom gamemode thing is DOPE like dude its the best. Try out Raft Mechanic its dope!
1648,"Excelent game to use your imagination and your crafting skills.
It is fun to play with your friends but it isnt that optmized to play, sometimes due some stuff your FPS can drop to 1 even if your PC is good enough to handle any kind of game available.
You can build anything you can imagine!
Only problem is that the updates are REEEEEEEEEALLY slow. It takes too long to release a new update."
1649,hahah bomb go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
1650,awsome
1651,Me likey the glowbs and wocs cool to
1652,yes
1653,"Thank you axolot, very cool"
1654, I highly recommend it its rlly creative and fun!!!
1655,there aren't any controls for tilting blocks
1656,"I loved how creative you can be in this game, not only can you build anything, you can DO whatever you want!"
1657,V R O O M  V R O O M
1658,game is really fun
1659,VERY GOOD GAME BUT CAN BE VERY VERY BUGGY
1660,"You build, you test, it doesn't work and then you call it art."
1661,"This game is a wet dream for those who want their imagination go boom boom
i strongly recommend this game, it's obviously underrated and has alot of potential
Let your dreams become a reality."
1662,this games boring as shit just watch scrap man
1663,great alone better with mods (which there are plenty)
1664,100%
1665,"I have played this game for a good while and love E V E R Y T H I N G. I love how expansive the entire game is, especially survival. There are so many things you can create, have fun with friends. I'm literally building an entire RACING LEAGUE in Scrap Mechanic right now! I recommend!"
1666,i love this game it makes my soul complete
1667,great game you should definitely get it. with its fun creativity it look like it might be hard but its not but its not easy to play you can make and build vehicles the survival mode is great fighting against farm bot great game would give it 4 out of five because the graphics are a little low.
1668,It Crashes alot so if you like that buy this but if you dont dont even consider buying it
1669,DA BABY
1670,it was good
1671,very good for making penis statue
1672,this game you can get free mods free custom games and it's so cool
1673,crap mechanic
1674,its fun lie mc but dif
1675,Yes.
1676,good
1677,"I Love the open creativity along with the the survival gamemode which, although I admit I don't play as much of, is still a wonderful way to bring out creativity with building defenses, defeating bots, looting Warehouses, and many other fun activities. And you can't forget about Challenge Mode it's perfect for problem-solvers and for whoever gets a little board of creative."
1678,ghvghvvhv
1679,all around good game
1680,good game once you learn
1681,cheese borger
1682,very well made and runs fairly well for what they are trying to achive
1683,This game is bad now with all of the new shit. The game was better before. Don't get
1684,cool
1685,DAA
1686,"The game is amazing itself, the only problem is the grind, you have to dedicate alot of time and effort if you want to progress in Survival but if you like to just create stuff and have fun with random creations then Creative is also a thing and Challenge Mode is also a thing if you want to go play some puzzles with creations. Custom Gamemodes are also a thing and as the recent update says, Raft Mechanic is a good mode to start with if you want to play survival that is a bit easy.

Overall i recommend the game"
1687,"I have literally purchased 4 copies  of the game for me and 3 of my kids, Lots of fun together"
1688,Building and making machines with friends is fun!
1689,This game has limited play-ability. You should not be able to complete the game in 8 hours. Steam told me I could not get my money back so here is a salty review. I would have rather set my money on fire. If you like building things and thats it then this is the game for you. I also dont understand how baby cows would get milk. 2/10
1690,pretty good
1691,fun
1692,my onion is ded game
1693,"FUN TO LEARN
"
1694,if you dont play ur bad
1695,Very good game
1696,"great game lots to do in creative, survival and challenge mode"
1697,it fuhn
1698,"great game! may not seem like a lot but theirs actually a lot you can do, and by the looks of it more amazing stuff is coming"
1699,love the game you shod get it
1700,Its is a very fun game and the updates are always good
1701,"its.... fine, like its not bad but you need so many things just to build a crafting bot
"
1702,yes
1703,"its fun
"
1704,yes
1705,"Great Game, Can't wait for Chapter 2 tho ;)"
1706,"Very funky and fresh, they roll in updates after updates and the workshop never let's you run out of content :D

1708,cool
1709,idk what to do lol
1710,wait this isnt fortnite
1711,shhhhhh
1712,yes
1713,"I have 750 hours on anther account I play this game from 2016 and I recommend it but the survival do not have a final target.
If you playing with mods its give you more fan from game because its gives you more build options.
scrap mechanic 1 love"
1714,"I love this game, the new tutorial piece really helps new players learn, without needing to instantly ask someone for help. The physics are wonderfully janky but it can sometimes be hard to crash the game even with some weird collisions. There are some friction issues, but overall it seems pretty fluid as a game."
1715,"Great game, definitely recommended for people who like building things."
1716,Love the game so much!
1717,Fun and challenging.
1718,"Extremely fun sandbox, along with awesome survival gamemode. Watch some videos on it, it's great."
1719,"i love this game!
best game ever"
1720,";]
"
1721,good
1722,fun to play and make stuff
1723,cool game i never understood how to make an actual functional vehicle
1724,This game is a gem. Would absolutely recommend.
1725,fun
1726,"The concept for this game is good, i found the game stutters a little bit here and there and when you open the chat box while moving it will keep on auto moving that direction and sometimes pressing another button stops it and other times you have to restart the game. The potential is extremely high. Fun game to pass time but the main suggestions i have is the ability to drink water from the ocean/ponds with a chance of some consequence. Hunger and thirst drops way too quickly. Lastly the ability to pump water into a crater to create your own little water supply or pond. Oh mainly give us options to make tools for digging, mining and so on without having to attatch them to a vehicle. pickaxes, shovels would be great. I hope to see the devs keep on improving with this game because the outcome could be something so great with a whole world of possibilities"
1727,v.fun.hahhahhhahahhhahahahahahahahahahaahaaahah
1728,"fuuuuuuuuuun
"
1729,"You need a very good PC for it to be smooth, but it is a REALLY good game"
1730,noice
1731,get this game if you love creating things
1732,cv
1733,gtood
1734,the best part is that you get build every where
1735,by far my favroite game; they are allways updating witch is probobly the best thing about it.
1736,love it
1737,"My character will die of thirst while I evaluate whether or not to continue playingt; let me explain.

My first experience with this game is finding out that my character is thirsty, while trying to build the first car. I can't drink water. A few plants farmed cannot sustain me, so I plant more plants. I protect them by building fencing around it. Suddenly, I get a timer ""unauthorized farming detected'.. okay a raid/horde will attack it in 20 minutes. I continue building the car. I get back to the plants which I NEED TO SURVIVE, and they are gone. A single robot had gotten through my fence, without me hearing anything and destroyed all but two plants. When the horde comes for the two remaining plants, they instantly break all the fences I built.

I played the game it was meant to be played and I lost in a catastrophic way, without even realizing that apparently all my efforts were, quite literally, fruitless.

So? My character can fucking just die, while I instead see if there is anything worth salvaging in the gameplay here.

Why do developers do this? Punishing people for playing the game it's appartently meant to be played? I hate that I am forced to ignore a game mechanic entirely, because it will frustrate the shit out of me.
"
1738,Building makes me cry. Very good game.
1739,"This game is amazing. You can build everything you want, but it`s a single problem, this game have a few bugs."
1740,u need to be like a genius to be good at this
1741,Might be a little challenging at the start but once you get the hang of it its easy.
1742,yes
1743,i think it is a fun game to try out.
1744,I think this is a very good game and it's very fun.
1745,"Fun game! I love the building of cars, tanks, trucks, buildings, farms, and logic! It is just so fun! The only downside is that there are no online servers  to play with other people. And also they should find a way to organize the wiring in logic because you make a cool contraption, you then connect the logic, you have a hard time because it being a big bundle of wiring AKA spaghetti."
1746,it's cool
1747,pp
1748,its a pretty good game if you get into it
1749,"Absolute banger, this is a game for the ages."
1750,holy shit i waited 7 years for this and it lives up to the hype
1751,good
1752,"fun fun game. it's really just Raft, another great game by the devs, but on land (and in my opinion, better)"
1753,good game
1754,yes

1756,VERY GOOD VERY NICE

1788,"best sandbox game once you understand all the wacky and advanced engineering to play this game you can build stuff like cars, mechs, and more alot of game's gameplay comes from all the resource gathering and building"
1789,"fun build game thing
i recommend"
1790,"if yo ulike build i highly reccomend play game. have fun. build trains
"
1791,yes
1792,"As a sandbox game, Scrap Mechanic is absolutely great with its wide array of easy-to-use parts and tools that can be used together to create incredibly complex machines. As a survival game though, its lacking quite a bit. You can only automate or improve resource gathering and collecting for a very small portion of the resources, meaning the amount you have to grind for resources to make better vehicles does not scale with you as you play, meaning most of the time in the late/end-game you'll be spending 90% of your time just farming resources.

However, this game does have a lot of mods, and most of them are really high-quality and help solve this issue while making the gameplay more interesting.

TL;DR Scrap Mechanic is a great sandbox game, but doesn't have a very good survival mode. The survival mode problems can be solved by installing one or two mods though."
1793,"REALLY NICE AND NOT LAGGY AT NO GLICHIS OR BUGS AND IT ALAWAYS LOADS

1845,Would recommend to those that have friends but if you have no friends then you are gonna be sad
1846,good
1847,"At over 1200 hours played this is my most played game on steam. It's easy to play, harder to master. Necessity is the mother of invention, and goals. Set yourself a basic goal that you need and your options of getting there are near infinite. Need a car to get places fast? Start with a seat, an engine, and 4 wheels. I guarantee you that over time you will improve it as you develop new and better ideas. Perhaps to the point where you wouldn't recognize your old car. This goes for anything you create, particularly as you use it.

Because the resources needed to craft are basic it's easy to coordinate with friends as you gather what you need. Group activity is tremendous fun and I would recommend it. Build, fight and defend, explore, gather resources, find new outfits to wear. All of this you can do by yourself or with friends. In almost every case it's better with them.

You don't need to be a genius to play this game and have fun doing it but if you like logic puzzles and engineering you can create things that will amaze your friends and give a strong sense of satisfaction. Don't know how to do something? Want to learn? It's very likely that many people have made how-to videos already. Remember that if you need it, you can probably automate it in very creative ways.

Combat is a lot of fun and weather you are shooting a spud gun or swinging a hammer there are techniques you can master to improve your game play against the farm bots. How far to be away, when to jump, when to swing or wait for the bot to attack first. Tape bots may seem like the exception because of their impeccable aim at your head but with timing and some dance moves this can be used against them as well. Just pray you never have to go against them with a hammer. Even then it's doable but is probably the most challenging fight you could encounter. At least until they introduce boss fights, which I am very much looking forward to!

This is early access and some desired optimizations to physics and networking are worth mentioning but nothing that kept me or my friends from playing. As I read patch notes I see that Axolot is aware of these as well and is working to fix them. In fact I have seen improvements made over the time I have played. I still highly recommend this game."
1848,This game allows you to build anything you want and with learning.
1849,its wewwy gwood
1850,"This game got me to really think about how can i make something better and allowed me to do it. Creative mode is amazing, survival is good/ nerf tapebots and after playing the game and learning the story of both the game and the developers this game is going places and will one day stand either with or looking down on some of the legendary games of now."
1851,Good
1852,'
1853,"the update stomped all my mods, having a install not connected to a server would have been better. As i am the one that purchased the game, I should be given the option of whether I want to update or not. No more steam games."

1872,fun game. haven't played it enough tho
1873,"What a great game. Apart from the occasional glitch, and the tutorial book not having much to help, this game honestly made me and my friends laugh for so long in the sandbox. Try it out! I personally haven't played much of the survival mode because it's confusing to me, but I can tell it's good!"
1874,"Very fun game, doesn't really get boring."
1875,Very Nice
1876,cool game i just dont have enough knowledge or creativity to create something cool
1877,its a good game

1887,very gud
1888,good
1889,There are a lot of fun
1890,Honestly not worth buying but entertaining watching someone play on youtube
1891,Love playing the game it is a lot of fun
1892,"It is in early access but it has a lot of potential, it has survival mode, creative mode, challenge mode, and even custom game modes made by the community! Survival doesn't currently have an end goal right now but it is still a great game and I have been playing it for over 5 years."
1893,Fun to build!
1894,"Meh, nothing to do. wait for the game to finish."
1895,Sure there are better builders out there but for some reason this one got me hooked!
1896,E
1897,storyline ends when you find the mechanic station. this game has been out for several years now why release a game that is less than 10% complete. people have had to create mods just to play this game and do more than drive in circles. frankly you should return the money you've taken for an incomplete game
1898,"gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
"
1899,"This is a really good game for it being in early access, however, it's poorly optimized to the point where it's almost a necessity to turn some graphic settings down so you don't get low fps. Other than that, it's really damn fun. Definitely worth the price ($20 at time of review)."
1900,it was a 10/10 game until about 2 days ago when all my seats just wont work im reinstalling the game rn to see if that fixes it
1901,best game ever!
1902,moch gud #reccomenrt drisllesr

1914,"Despite my little hours played, I have enjoyed every moment of this game over the years."
1915,Amazing!!!
1916,km
1917,"Amazing game, with the experiences that I have had playing the game so far I can see this being the next big game for creativity and imagination. Obviously there are going to be some limits like too many bearings and suspension on creations but the Scrap Mechanic devs are working hard on those improvements everyday. I have a blast in all the game modes, challenge, survival, and creative. Plus the amazing mod support giving people the ability to make their own personal tiles and literally their own game inside the game! Its crazy and the community is even crazier. Full of very nice people usually willing to help you out with your creation or help you fight some haybots in a farming raid or whatever. The Multiplayer can be a bit buggy at times but its still very enjoyable. I can always count on scrap mechanic to fulfil my need to build and create something new or crazy or even just a weird idea, a bot-crusher? Maybe? Whatever you can dream of you can build in scrap mechanic. To think this game is still early access is crazy. Thank you Scrap Mechanic for giving me such an enjoyable experience, I will be playing game for years to come!"

1926,"I've got a few hours in this game, it's a great sanbox game 10/10, it would be an 11/10 if the updates were more frequent, survival has some issues for now but its receiving an upcoming uptade.
The modding comunity is amazing and there is nearly infinte content to explore with the workshop.

If you like sandbox games it's worth it !"

1950,This game is so unstable! I've lost so much work over & over again. 57 hours & I have nothing to show for it......WOW.
1951,i like it
1952,Its a great game!
1953,"The recent optimizations really improve the user experience with less lag with many bots objects and improved support for modifications for the game. The challenge mode has been improved that can teach the player a lot in vehicle construction and the potential that comes with that freedom. When starting a new world as a noob, there are many questions for what you can do, but with 0.6 you get a better starting experience that will be further developed with quests and such in future updates. The downsides are that it does not run optimally and depending on how good your device is it can be laggy in the warehouses and when traveling fast."

1968,realy creative
1969,good game
1970,:)
1971,"ok, so i actually like this game. for what it used to be, its changed alot since then.
it used to be just a open sandbox, with robot/vehicle building mechanics, that actually work quite well.
now that they've added a survival mode, it made it replayable again. it is sad that the updates seems to have slowed down massively, it used to get regular updates. now we're lucky if we get a small update after 2-3 months. i know that this game ""sort of"" died a while back, but i feel like, if they want to keep their current fans, they need to deliver what they have been talking about in the past.

in general a great and creative game. i do prefer the Survival mode tho
7.5/10"
1972,if you like being a mechanic then this is for you its so much fun there is so much and everything i enjoyed playing this game
1973,"Great game with many possibilitys and some very funny bugs and glitches, but some bugs and glitches can be pretty anoying and hard to remember. There are also some lag problems with some vehicles and buildings ,if use many parts and or use many bearings to rotate or to angle things.
But you can at least built funny, stupid or practical things like vehicles and buildings or other things like a giant player sized Slingshot.
Also you can encounter some funny Ragdolls  in Survival mode."
1974,This game is just amazing but it can get boring after a while but with all the new mod support the game has just got even better!!!!
1975,good worth the price and fun
1976,very good
1977," Wife bought me this game after we watched Markiplier and co. goof around for awhile. The game was fun then, but it was in too early of a state for me to feel good leaving a review. This game has only gotten better with age. The objectives in survival mode have been my favorite addition, having a goal to achieve really made the experience far more engaging than it was before. I love Scrap Mechanic and I can't wait for more updates!"
1978,A misson in i already love it and will play more xD
1979,"very fun
"
1980,"You can make jetfighters with giant sawblades and offroad suspension.

1987,"is a very creative game

Highly recommend. Creativity is key in this game and if you can imagine it, you can probably build it."

2010,"It is a good game, that is all I have to say."
2011,It's Great!
2012,"Fun base game, great implementation of user generated content.

One major thing it's missing is achievements, there's a survival mode, but there's no logical goals or achievements to complete, there just doesn't seem to be a reason to play survival without something to do, meaning it's underplayed, with the challenges, workshop items and creative being favoured over survival."
2013,"Honestly its such a fun game to play with friends, i would recommend this to anyone"

2015,Scrap Mechanic is my go to game.

2017,EVERY THING!!
2018,fun
2019,"Released In 2016
Still Getting Updates In 2022

Often Early Access Indie Games Are Left In Limbo In That Time Period.

In my honest opinion early access games in theory ""should"" never survive, Because if you're expecting people to keep buying your game in order to fund development its such a risky thing to expect, Often really good promising games just suddenly stop updating and stop messaging the community because they've just basically ran out of money and thats it, Poof.

The time I streamed Scrap Mechanic it was extremely fun and I've always had it on the back burner in order to play more, And many updates have been released since the last time I played so I'll be greatly surprised with the amount of content that has been added."
2020,It is a great game.
2021,This is one of the best games for building and exploring and survival
2022,fun
2023,this game sucks have you seen the new update i cant play on my old save i had a mansion 5 cars and every building looted and the new update made the dang craft machine was blue and looked like a fricking portal from fortnite and i had like 2 frames a second with a gaming computer and my friend he joined and his game crahsed so fast they made this game a piece of crap
2024,good game
2025,"love the game to play with friends. but is it ever going to get out of early access? they show alot of cool  upcoming stuff that never comes out. which is a disappointment. hopefully in the near future and not in a few years to get it out to the players.
"
2026,super good way to good
2027,its a good game
2028,"If this game puts multiplayer into it, it will compete. Its essentially Adult Minecraft. Open World Surviver! Honestly i give it 7.5/10. Its multiplayer away from a 9! Worth the money again and again!"
2029,ok
2030,"Still in a sorta beta state but i can't imagine what the full game would look like once it is all polished up and finished. I love playing it already, and I can't wait to see where they choose to head with this game. It is an absolutely awesome game, 10/10 made my friends buy it too"
2031,"fun game where you can do almost anything, pretty much as diverse as minecraft."
2032,"fun game to play by yourself or with friends
"
2033,vary fun
2034,ass
2035,good
2036,"Important items sometimes fall through the map, haven't found a way to fix other than deleting save file and starting new..  Also It is ""Single player"" as it says but like Satisfactory it seems to launch in a ""Multiplayer"" style session but I couldnt seemingly make my own manual saves so I couldnt reload when problems happened"

2086,ITS REALLY FUN and I made a battel fort and published it
2087,its exploits your creative skills very well
2088,it gud
2089,This game offers so many different ways to play. This sandbox game is extremely fun and enjoyable to play. However Scrap Mechanic requires a pretty good computer to run it I have a relatively good computer and my Pc can heat up to an alarming rate if I play long enough . (but that could just be my bad cooling  'cause I built it) But in all the game is worth the purchase.
2090,"fun, has great mods, just be ready to grind a lot."
2091,yes
2092,when i went in survival i looked forwards and it lagged i serched up how to fix it i did it after 2 min of no lag it lagged agian and i have a rtx 2060 with a intel i5 11th gen
2093,this game is so amazingly good and is worth every last penny you pay i would personally recommend it to everyone and its even better when playing with friends especially in survival mode
2094,fun
2095,"Enter the creative paradise of Scrap Mechanic! Build fantastic machines, go on adventures with your friends and defend against waves of evil Farmbots in this imaginative multiplayer survival sandbox. With Scrap Mechanic‚Äôs powerful creation tools you can engineer your own adventures!"
2096,"i really liked this game, and i feel really good when i accomplish a work. if you like building, this game is really reccomended"
2097,"It's a fun sandbox type of game, you can build what ever, when ever, where ever."
2098,Barbie Girl In The Bath
2099,its amazing and really fun
2100,BEST GAME EVER (keep up with the good work i can't wait for chapter 2)
2101,very fun
2102,it is good fun and you can be verry creative
2103,"This game is great. It is a game of adventure, hardships, and coop (Also engineering if you want)"
2104,I love this game it is great there is really no limit to what you can do from building efficient survival cars to fun and frankly stupid builds that you can laugh at it is fun to play alone but even better to play with others. Despite this new content updates are slow and may take a long time to come out but when the developers do release a new update you can be assured that it will be at the highest standard possible and if it is not the will work around the clock to fix any issues with the update. So yes I think that this game is worth the money and more that you pay for it.
2105,it is a very fun and creative game to play i commend it
2106,in this game you can make what ever you want
2107,yes

2111,"I have been playing the survival for 2 days straight. This game is well developed and has a high quality to it, there is an issue that i've ran into. When I left the warehouse for the first time the bearings on my car became flimsy almost like a slinky and I do not know how to resolve this issue :( my wheels, steering bearings and drive bearings just fold under there own weight when i have a bare-bones car made of wood"
2112,"FUN AND CREATIVE

2113,This game is very fun and sometimes very funny and ridicules things can happen!
2114,I like this game. this really improves my creativity. i have played for a nice amount of time and i recommend this game to literally anyone.

2125,Good Game :)
2126,"Disliked: No dedicated online server, when playing with friends you cannot make monster machines (BLOKKWATTNE!)"
2127,it's a really good game when you get in to it but it takes some time to get good building btw if you don't have that good of a pc try not to put lots a barings on your builds and if you do when you not using them weld them to the ground
2128,    :) fthgyhg
2129,The reason why I recommend this game It's because Scrap Mechanic is somewhat of a.. Unique game sure it can get frustrating but that's just a catalyst for something far more beautiful in the future and that's what I like about this game

2162,good game not laggy enough dough
2163,e
2164,Its a really good game. Aside from that it is underdeveloped and development is slow with only one or two people on the dev team. With no deadline it seems as if they don't care how long it takes because they've already made so much money off of the game. Don't buy until chapter 2 comes out.
2165,"great building game and it is easy to install mods. 
haven't played it to much tho"

2170,scrap mechanic is game
2171,Great game easy to understand and very fun
2172,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. While I understand that this game is early access, I still feel like I should post this review to help improve the game. First of all likely the biggest issue is it crashes all of the time. There are also too many devices that can lag and crash the game. Also, crashes. frequently. Also, when you try to join a world with an unpublished tile, even after publishing it disallows any other player to join. Another join issue is that friends can't join, because it's something wrong with the spud guns json file.  There are also uploading and downloading issues, but I'll cut some slack. Now, the good stuff is that modding is very easy. Unlike Minecraft where you have to download a file, and run it, and do all this crap. In scrap mechanic, find the mod, and hit ""subscribe"".  Also, unlimited ability. I also like the world and tile creator, it adds character to the game. I think that is all I have to say! I may update this review."

2212,funny sandbox game
2213,this game provides a lot of fun and allows you to be very creative. creative mode is a lot better with friends and survival mode is also better with friends but is still very fun even if your lonely
2214,this is a very great survival game and theres so much creativety
2215,"No story, certain types of items that you can pick up have NO indication that you can collect them.  Also, no blueprints or ""in-game"" help tips to help walk you through how to do things or what items are actually for."

2221,very good game for when you are feeling creative or just wanna blow some stuff up
2222,best game ever
2223,not much to do after about 5 hrs. the game is lacking in every way.
2224,"I love the game, and am so excited that they have a new tutorial for it. I don't like that we have to grow food, and we lose hunger so fast."
2225,This game has insane amounts of mods and a great community. I love it
2226,"so far i think its good, idk. gonna have to play some more"
2227,good game
2228,"its perfect i love it and its soo scary at times and fun at the same time

2229,really great game it's so much fun esspecially when playing with your friends
2230,it's a very fun game i play it with my  friends and it's super fun!
2231,"Scrap Mechanic is great. You get to build whatever you want (as long as you know how) and do whatever. Survival is amazing as it creates a unique experience for you, nothing like you have ever seen before."
2232,"Great game, i would recommend that new player might wanna try something simple like a car at the start and learning how to make the car steer ect but once you've got it down you can literally create whatever you want"
2233,very good

2242,Its a great game you can do what ever the heck you want and be creative.
2243,its fun
2244,very good game for making things and testing out stuff weather in logic gates or physics
2245,"among us





"
2246,"I like the concept behind the game. Every now and then I come back to the game and build something. We need more content though. A story/side quests would also be much appreciated. 
"
2247, It was easy to play and fun.
2248,too much mechanic not enough scrap
2249,"amazing
updates are slow tho
"
2250,lets your engineering creativity sour.
2251,very fun and survival is great
2252,7
2253,very nice building game. also survival and early access so more updates coming to make the game even better
2254,it is a great game but you need skill to play it well
2255,"the best game i have ever played, been playing it since it came out and never regreted"
2256,great game with a lot of very fun features- the building is very smoothe and physics accurate. highly recommend
2257,fun game
2258,yeh yeh
2259,"Frustrating, one-dimensional combat and sloppy physics in survival ruin this game for me. You can block attacks in creative (where you don't need it) but not in survival. You can make great builds in creative but in survival they are loose and don't work right. I keep waiting for these things to get fixed but the devs would rather work on updates for challenge mode (which has no replay-ability) and for modding. Check your priorities devs!"
2260,good game.  you can make trains.
2261,I really like this game i have played this game for so many hours its so fun there are endless possibilities you can find a way to make just about anything i would like to have something like propellers & motors cause needing to use thrusters for everything in survival that is a boat or fly's is so expensive fuel wise but overall i love this game definitely recommend
2262,sus
2263,10/10 very fun
2264,very fun just a bit of a learning curve
2265,"The game is awesome for building. Is limited though by how much the game can process so you can have small complex builds but dont make them to big or the frame rate drops and can become impossible to play. There is a lot of room for improvements but overall i got my $20 out of it and would have paid $40-$60 for it. Wish minecraft had a lot of the things in this game. its cool to build vehicles, boats, buildings and basically whatever you want and have it work."
2266,it is so fun i play it every day
2267,"is gud game made miserable by my friend being annoying, also physics system screws up builds that should work because the system is witchraft"
2268,"Nice 

this will go down as one of the games in history"
2269,it is quite fun.
2270,pog

2278,great game for engineering
2279,really fun !
2280,hi
2281,"survival mode is minecraft with engineering
creative mode is fun i give this game an 8/10"
2282,fun killing time when you can discover new crazy things
2283,"It's worth it for only $20, as it introduces so many complex machines, cool mods and creations from the Workshop that are easy to install, a handbook for beginners, and the building mechanics are very simple. If you are looking for a sandbox game that can do anything, this is the one."
2284,"Definitely recommend this game to those who like games like minecraft. If you want to see what's possible, check out the workshop and see the video game someone crafted in homage to Doom. Quite incredible. And I thought Minecraft had interesting possibilities. Heh... Here's a quick start guide for those who haven't played before (spoilers ahead):

1. Take everything out of the ship before you leave the area. 

2. Looking along the ship toward the path with the shinies, first take the right-hand path to the pond and check out the tutorial for growing food. 

3. Go back to the ship, turn right, go along the path getting all the shinies. 

4. When you come to the first building on the right, climb it and clear out the bots and take all the loot. 

5. Look across the land for landmarks. The world has a lot of randomness, but also some regular features. On several of my runs I found that turning off the main path of shinies, going right at the building, looking for the coastline to my right and following the coast to the left away from the area with the ship, I usually eventually encounter an area with crafting goodies and several rundown shack/stores to loot. The big building with what appears to be a wrench sign has a crafting station inside. Beds in stacked tubes nearby provide new respawn points. In some playthroughs, the compound was set back from the coast behind other ruins. On my most recent run, the wrench sign was visible from the shore. The landscape definitely shifts, but some things carry over.  .........After someone joined the game, I could see that my new base lay directly straight down the original path of shinies, though quite far away. YMMV.

6. Take all the corn you can carry. Drop it in front of a cow. Pick up all the milk that the cow drops. Use this to keep yourself alive until you get going. Search loot shinies for extra food. 

You're welcome."
2285,yes
2286,yes
2287,fun to play
2288,No point in building anything
2289,love it
2290,not gura nya
2291,gud gem
2292,fun game
2293,fun
2294,i just like it.
2295,Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
2296,"Once you learn the physics and mechanics you can build some rather amazing stuff. Survival also gives you the challenge of trying to make those ultimate creations whith what materials you can collect, harvest, and make. One thing i accidentally found is that if you build your defensive machines right they can repel the machines with ease."
2297,Good but too much bugs
2298,nice game i like
2299,Bread
2300,"This game is great fun, friends make this a great experience, though multiplayer, on survival or creative it can be a bit laggy, but gets better over time but not perfect, the multiplayer performance needs work, that's my only promblem."
2301,"cool

2302,yes
2303,this game is really fun because there is like an endless amount of things you can build

2319,great design very fun to play creative but the survival isnt finished yet still fun tho
2320,"It's fun to build stuff, that's about it
"
2321,Fun game 8/10 gets progressively harder which is good and is a little bit of a challenge and fun all around with the possibility‚Äôs of cars and bases
2322,its very fun and it doesnt get boring after a while ive played for 200 hours and i still ahve stuff i want tro build the only thing stoping you from makeing stuff is your amagination and well the limitation of the game so you can build almost everything
2323,there was nothing I didn't like
2324,"I like this game because it is pretty fun to build stuff. much better than Trailmakers or even Crossout!

I love the fact that there is no available DLC or subscription! I dislike having to pay for some random game and then having to pay for the DLC which in total is probably worth more than the game."

2402,fun game to play with friends and I enjoy the crafting. Only have 8 hours in though
2403,god gam
2404,"It's creativity is quite similar to Trailmakers, but it's more of an expanded version because of the different blocks and materials to build with. It contains survival mode, a challenge mode with different levels, and of course a creative mode. All in all, a good game and worth to get for yourself or others."
2405,Scrap mechanic is a game all about [strike]Building creations.[/strike] [strike]Trains.[/strike] Rafts
2406,It is very fun.
2407,i like it i stolen my mom credit card and i bought it !

2410,nice game 69
2411,very good game. begining is hard but it gets better.
2412,Endless possibilities in this game! Lovely sandbox concept.
2413,"Such a fun game. Love this game, made so many things like a, reaper leviathan, Santa fe Engine, Glados. I love this game. I recommend"
2414,.
2415,This game is great for people like me to like to take ideas off of paper and into games or real life. I once made a fast food truck that had full features plus a glowing sign.
2416,Game good...
2417,It is creative fun and all around great
2418,get ready to build the stupidest shit and then suffer 0.00001 frames for it. That is when you know a game is truly fun.

2421,"This game could have been a success with just creative, but Axolotl decided to add so much more, survival is very fun and crafting machine to harvest materials easier to make better machines all from scratch makes you feel like Einstein. The addition of clothing as rewards for dungeons is very unique and allows for a good reason to keep playing survival over and over.

9/10 Would cause mass genocide of robots over a farm containing broccoli again."
2422,"Good Game. There are some things that aren't clear, but it is easy to figure out. The only thing I wish it had is some sort of map."
2423,very gud

2429,wee haha funnie robot go boom
2430,10/10 i would c*m
2431,Its pretty fun to mess around with friends.
2432,Very fun and i play it after my save for the raft survival mod to test it to tell the devs if their are bugs and let them know but very fun game to play with reply
2433,"If You Don't Play This Game Are You Even A Gamer?

I 100% Recommend This Game If You Have Friends Don't? Well That Drops Down To A Whopping 99.9%,
Props To The Creators Of This Game They Did An Amazing Job On Graphics, Story Difficulty Building And So Much More The One Small Complaint I have Is The Time It Takes For Them To Update The Game But I Would Rather A Fully Developed Update That Takes A While Then A Under Developed Rushed Update And With That Being Said I Highly Suggest You Take This Game For A Spin"
2434,Pretty fun but somewhat buggy and laggy. I would play this game much more if the game ran smoother.
2435,"I really enjoy this game. Making whatever the hell comes to my mind in creative mode is fun, and fighting farmbots in survival is equally enjoyable. Overall a very nice experience."
2436,"I hate this game so much. ZERO tutorial so everything is a guessing game, and there's no map. Took me a half hour to figure out how to pick things up. No idea where anything is. No compass, no directions of any sort. Looks great, but it's frustrating, which makes it no fun at all to play. Games are supposed to be fun. This isn't even a little bit fun."
2437,Great survival mode its like the forest but more minecrafty
2438,drtyuhjr
2439,i've had this game since 2016 and i have gotten quite a bit of enjoyment and got my friends to get it. would recommend if you like to make creations that are cool
2440,THIS GAME IS BS  YOU CANT MAKE A 9 PLOT GARDEN WITHOUT THE BOTS ATTACKING IT NOT BUT CAN COUNT ON ON 10 BOTS A SOLO PLAYER HAS NO CHANCE WITH THE GAME
2441,Survival ealry game is the worst iv ever seen
2442,fun and easy to use! love the amount of thought you can put into stuff to make amazing builds

2472,"They copied The Forest a little bit, but the game is still great."
2473,Super good game for all of the creative people out there I love the building mechanic but if you are running a potato computer like me then it is kinda laggy but overall 10/10 rating
2474,"after all these years, today i got to play it without the game crashing.
10/10"
2475,good
2476,"damn, i am now a qualified engineer"
2477,"Scrap Mechanic is fun and all because its a sandbox/survival game were you can build anything so I recommend you buy it and if you don't know how to play watch scrap man (Quick note: They should update the minimum specs, Here they are

2492,sussy baka
2493,I typed this with a Flamin' Hot Cool Ranch Dorito.
2494,"It's a great survival game. Warning to newcomers like me, don't make your garden too big or robots will swarm it and destroy it. Wait until you have defenses set up and focus on finding food in the wild instead. You can place items down and they won't despawn, and it can give you the right amount of challenge to be fun and enjoyable. I'm enjoying creating and collecting things on this game. I would say more, but I'm busy playing the game. Remember, I'm new."
2495,"very cool, can get very creative, mods are awesome (i recommend getting the expanded info mod asap, especially if you're playing survival), currently waiting for chapter 2"
2496,nah okay ys
2497,"Needs Cogs like steampunk, more energy for survival like wind, water, sun / also better moding for survival menu thx :)"
2498,very good
2499,Skrab meckani
2500,i like that there's creativity involved and its fun to play with friends its a very good physics engine that you need to collect meterials and food to build something last but not least the bad thing is that it takes a long time to get an update and the world is pretty small like 3 km long or about 2 miles so wood is very limited
2501,Genuiley great game i just find it harder in survival mode without friends/family to play with but its still great and then creative is aso very good even better because of the amount of mods and bluprints ect but about half the stuff you need mods for but apart from that scrap mechanic has got to be in the top 5 games ive ever played and top 5 on steam
2502,SMort
2503,"the games screen is to big for the monitor so i cant play the game please help

2514,"Best game ever! Love everything with this game, you can build whatever you want and the only thing limiting you is your own creativity!"
2515,get now =fun
2516,"This game is incredible, i just love the way that it is so creative and you can do whatever you want. the aspects of building and survival are so fun. i think that anyone who is interested in this sort of thing should give it a go. making new creations is the funnest thing on steam at the moment.
 10/10"
2517,amazing
2518,Good game
2519,"It's easily one of the best games that I've played. I got this game early on back in the middle of 2016 / early 2017. (Don't really remember the exact time I bought it) It's really fun to come up with new and interesting ideas as well as to build cool structures in survival mode. As a veteran of this game (It's my most played game on steam) I enjoy a lot of aspects of it,  but I generally prefer Creative mode."
2520,"The game is very unique in its own way, if you love redstone in minecraft, robocraft or just love playing around with friends this is the game for you. There is a lack of content compared to other survival games but overall for 13 dollars on sale its worth it."
2521,It's a very good building/engineering game.
2522,"idk what to write, but it is a good game"
2523,pretty good
2524,"good game play it NOW!]
"
2525,"cant wait to see it finished, very strong concept at time of writing"
2526,game for farmers and gamers
2527,"I really wanna like this game, and if you're going to play single player, it's fine. 

HOWEVER, MASSIVE WARNING FOR MP SURVIVAL (And the reason why I'm not recommending the game) :

If there's any craftwork with logic gates, switches, controllers or other such mechanics with large quantities of packet sending/receiving, the non-host will start getting increasing latency, potentially having up to 15-20 seconds of lag to their every move. Making the game quite literally unplayable. The networking optimization is complete and utter garbage.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that if you play with any keyboard other than QWERTY (AZERTY like myself) You're going to have to deal with alt+shifting to QWERTY, because changing the controls is bugged beyond bugged.)"

2548,its very fun way betere then trailmakers cause shit dont break as fast
2549,"Starts off tough, but they give you a journal that shows you the basics. Once you learn more stuff however, it becomes way easier to build awesome machines. Would recommend."
2550,great game
2551,"+ its a fun time
+ god tier workshop support
+ multiplayer is great and you don't need a server 
+ help book is comprehensive and simple 

- could do with optimisation
- survival needs a main goal
 
in general would recommend"
2552,don't kill me
2553,gets stale after a while
2554,good
2555,FUN
2556,"I'll preface by saying it is a good game. It's fun enough for the price point. And I wish there was a way I could give a rating somewhere between ""yes"" and ""no"". The reality is that the game hasn't seen an update in a very long time and it's looking like the game is somewhat abandoned. I mean, sure, the devs have sparingly posted devlogs here and there but no updates in a very large amount of time have made the gameplay cycle of the game run it's course and go stale with very little to do. Is it worth the 21 bucks? Yeah, sure, maybe. I've gotten a lot of play out of it so I'm leaning towards yes. 
That being said, I'd wait till they show some *real* signs of life before you dump money into their bank accounts.

I'll be updating this review whenever an update drops, but from the looks of things, that won't be for a while, yet. If at all."
2557,"Well, its a very good game, and you can get very creative, but with only single bricks and a few curved pieces, your cars will quickly turn into a 3rd grade drawing come to life, they are adding wedges so if that fixes the issue then I will be sure to update, other than that survival is ok but, kinda slow and boring, also night is very very very dark and bot combat is very stiff and confusing."
2558,"HIghly reccomend, very vast possibilities. The skies the limit with this game
"
2559,"I understand that this game is still being worked on and not close to being done. I found the art style cute, and the concept behind it is cool. However, I got bored incredibly quickly in this game. It doesn't feel as if there's a whole lot to do, and if you're not already tech-minded, the mechanics of building a vehicle can seriously be a struggle. Every time I played this game, I ended up with a headache. At it's current price, I would not recommend it for the amount/quality of gameplay it offers."
2560,BEST GAME EVER: Edit.  Its still good
2561,"This game has fast become my favourite. A lot of fun to be had here if you have the creative mind for it.
My only gripe is the slow updates, Survival really needs a next chapter as its pretty dry in its current state but hey i still got 300 hours of fun out of it."
2562,it fun
2563,yay
2564,"This game may have glitches here and there... but this game is a masterpiece.
The survival mode or creative freedom of sandbox and the endless amounts of types of suspension.
I give this game a 9\10. The only issue are the bugs this game has but even then when you get them they are funny."
2565,great gamee but it takes some time tho
2566,I used the scrap and mechaniked
2567,"AMAZING
"
2568,"great creative game, lots of fun"
2569,It is very good game.When you are bored can play this game.There is lot of things to do and build.
2570,Enjoyable. simply a good game. i recomend y'all purchase this wonderful game

2572,This game is very funny:)
2573,"fantastic game, I can absolutely recommend it."
2574,Great game really gets my brain going when i play
2575,great game
2576,the game is not too laggy on a 10 year old pc and is actually quite fun to play both singleplayer and multiplayer once you understand the functions of the game. Would definately recommend
2577,hit robot build car!
2578,relly good
2579,"I like this game a lot and I recommend this to those who are interested in playing! I personally like survival mode because you have to grind a lot and I like how you have to survive like build a farm, get a shelter. I recommend try this game!"
2580,"e - me


very yes like lot - 10 year old"
2581,good game
2582,The worst game I've played but all other games like it are even worse. But it is fun to create stuff until your creation just noclippings under the map because you added a single bearing/piston.
2583,good
2584,"Simple and engaging game play with features like building with simple blocks to make a questionable design
Will recommend 10/10"
2585,"I played this game ever since it first came out and it is amazing. wether its playing with friends, to building flying houses, its always fun. great game, a ton of features and stuff to do."
2586,fun! Wish more different robots
2587,is fun

Also, for the people that think this game is a rip-off of another game, Y.A.W.(you are wrong) this game is an original game!"
2594,grat
2595,love the survival mechanic about it like i get lost for hours playing  this game
2596,potato go bullet
2597,"Great game, personally love survival mode because of the ""create your own survival"" type thing."
2598,silly gam
2599,"this game is all about creating and 
building all sorts of creations and is suprisingly badass for a super colorfull game . the robots are amazing and the survival worlds look so cool.
one thing is lag happens a lot but im running it on a low end pc so it shoud be fine for most players.

want to look at the game before you buy it? just read the devblogs for watch scrapman on youtube 

over all this is a super fun and creative game that apeals to most users .

-shard
"
2600,"do not buy at current state, i am aware that it is in early access but it is not in a stable state to play, it lags when you build thing, it lags when you load workshop items, its not optimised at all and quite frankley its just unplayable"
2601,I wonder if I‚Äôd have a life if I didn‚Äôt play this game for 310 hours. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a life worth living tho.
2602,Good game
2603,"good game, very fun with friends"
2604,"this is in my opinion the bes enginiering game(after trailmakers)

i would realy recommend buying it
its worth it"
2605,"l. boxe#][poi#

"
2606,75e
2607,its fun and you learn some stuff it dosen't realy have a story to it
2608,"has crashed thirteen times in the challenge some causing little progress loss, some.. a lot. and forcing me to rebuild whatever disgrace inhumane build i had going on. loads slowly too.

if i end up playing the game for longer and actually find out how to do anything i will probably change the review.

Ok, so the game is like coding. you can create basically anything. But you have to do every little thing and detail yourself and one little error can send you spending hours backtracking to find out what went wrong."
2609,its nice to play with others and yourself if you don't have frends
2610,"Awesome scavenge survive type game, fun till the end and almost limitless opportunity."
2611,ya
2612,i have already bought this but i have not got the icon yet
2613,"very fun but swimming is frustraiting because they sorta gave up when it came to swimming. Besides that, this is a GREAT game"
2614,anything can be bought and sold for the right oil
2615,"Solid game. I like the freedom to build and the combination of mechanical parts makes the game more dynamic than others. combat is ok, and the exploration is solid. Its not super well optomized yet so it pushes my rig a little sometimes and I have a decent PC."
2616,good
2617,good
2618,"this game is one of the BEST!!!!!!!!!!! game of all time for me and maybe  it is to you i recommend  this game if you like sandbox,survival,creativity,cars,planes,trucks,mods,trains and many more"
2619,Chill way to pass time. great with friends.

2624,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2625,VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD GAME
2626,"its a very fun game for young people who want to let their creativity wild i heavily recoment
"
2627,10/10 good game jesse says 10/10 would recomend
2628,BEST GAME EVER!
2629,Good Game.
2630,Great game!!! 100% worth the price.
2631,"I would recommend this only on the creative mode, but oh boy does survival need work.
 The creative mode is fun, there's a lot of cool contraptions to build, and lots of nice cosmetic blocks to use for building. 
 
But for survival...
 *You walk a long distance and collect a bunch of resources, just for a crafting bench. The oven also costs a LOT of resources!
 *Getting supplies to make farms is based on drops. Can't find any seeds near the 2nd base? Too bad, either you have to trek back to the first base again or pray you do get the drops by wandering further away, putting yourself at risk
 *No real good base building in the early games. Only beds are in places with no doors, so  you have to baracade the doors behind  you or potentially get ambushed when you spawn (hapend to me)
*You respawn with low hunger/thirst, so likely to starve/thirst on your way to the base, meaning dying a lot of times. 
*Combat is clunky and not fun. No real dodge mechanics I jump backwards as I strike, but I sometimes get hit, and sometimes I don't, there doesn't feel like there's skill to it. 
*The game shouldn't be balanced with the assumption of multiplayer, people don't always have other people who play the game, or want to play on their own. 

 I'm hoping they  will improve survival in the future, for now I'm sticking with creative."
2632,this game is Very epic
2633,yuo mak funy thngs.
2634,is good i guess
2635,okay game sometimes its hard to build stuff
2636,"Craft and build!(Survival mode is recommended!)Have fun!   :)
"
2637,This game is amazing and interesting for people to play!
2638,"Love The Game. I love that you can make it to where you don't die in survival if you go afk a lot. I love the game and the amount of creations, the limits, the mods, and the community!"
2639,super funnn!!
2640,"Development is too slow, buy when its out of EA"
2641,better played with friends
2642,mmm monke
2643,"This game is painfully boring and worse than Little Big Planet 3 in terms of playing with friends, mods never show up in mod parts after being downloaded. There is no real fun to be had for someone who even enjoys a mild amount of PVP. Skip this game and start with Besige if you like to make your own vehicles."

2646,"It's a very easy to learn all around sandbox game where you can make virtually anything, and there's 2 fun parts, making how you want and perfecting it the way you want by testing and retry it and learn from your mistakes, and accomplishing something that you made and not going on the workshop to get your build"
2647,GREAT GAME :)
2648,good game
2649,Great game and very fun. Although the physics of the game can be wonky at times
2650,yee close to 1500 hour
2651,"very gud, much flavor"
2652,"great game, extreme potential. One of the best survival crafts I've played. My friend built a formula racer, in which, he was able to intricately design an independent suspension system that allowed for excellent handling. The point is, the physics engine and engineering aspect is quality work. 

ON THE CONTRARY, There needs to be an objective to the game. Quests, various NPCs to interact with, main story questlines, side quests, and different enemies. This is an issue that made me ultimately stop playing the game, despite the incredible creativity potentials. Gameplay: 9/10. Overall: 7/10"

2700,"I really like this game. I think it's at its best when playing with friends.  However game physics and hosting limitations sort of limit your overall ability to grow your world.   4 people is a blast but we quickly lagged out the server with over-ambitious vehicles and equipment, as well as leaving random missed loot on the ground.  It has been in Early Access for a very long time.  Updates to the game are steady yet slow.   There is also a puzzle mode that is completely separate from the open world game play.  It is a lot of fun and helps you immediately learn how to build successful working vehicles and equipment.  The game might be worth the money just for the puzzle mode."

2711,Great Game
2712,"this is a asome game i love it
"
2713," Overall I would say this game is really fun, the controls and items you can you are very simple or well, as simple as they can be. The game its self is really fun but then also when you add mods with all these different guns and cannons and thrusters, its a whole new world of adventure. i've played this game quite a lot with my friends and we've had a really good time. But there is a downside, if a person buys this game and hasn't either watched a bit of gameplay before or hasn't played any other type of free building game before, they will really struggle. There is no real tutorial, there is the handbook but even that isn't in depth enough, if you want this game, or you have  bought it and don't know what to do I would recommend playing the vanilla challenges in the challenge game mode they will teach you a lot. But other than that and quite a LOT of glitches (which can make the game easier at times), the game is great you should definitely give it a try. 8/10  Great game."
2714,"The Story: You are the worst kind of Space Dwarf. You are a filthy degenerate and a disgrace to your clan. Instead of digging deep into planets and asteroids to horde gold, platinum, and other wealth, you want to take up FARMING! After having had enough of your lip, your father banishes you to a prison colony where they send all the degenerates like you. Normally, your ship would have landed, the pilot kicking you out, then flying off, but your ship got shot down and the pilot died. 

Now you have to deal with berserk robots that were built by those who came before you while trying to rescue your elders who have been captured by said bots. Being a Dwarf, you are naturally gifted at the use of the almighty Sledgehammer, which lets you smash robots and rocks, as well as break apart large rocks after they've been drilled. Good luck carving out a life on this green hellscape. Grow crops to feed yourself and the nursing home called The Hideout, but beware of the robots who will come to tear out your garden. You can build various gadgets, gizmos, and vehicles to help you in your task. Surely they don't turn on you, right? Right?"
2715,"I love the game but 1 thing is that i want some of the stuff to be cheaper and some more health in big battles but overall i love the game

2725,cheese gud
2726,This is a great game! Bought it years ago on an old laptop so i couldn't play it on that but now that i have a better PC its great! Just make sure you have at least minimum spec.
2727,Game development progress is so slow as to be none existent. We are at 13 months since an update on an EA Beta.. I expect to play a completed Star Citizen before this too bad too.. pretty cute voxel build.

2737,It's ok.
2738,"6 years in Early Access and it still feels janky, the world feels absolutely empty with almost nothing to search for.
After just 5 to 10 hours of Survival gameplay, there's literally nothing to do, there is no goal or objective, except for the extremely boring resource grind. Co-Op is a mess, netcode and sync randomly just gives up, introducing pseudo-lag and various glitches, like falling through the map or items disappearing."
2739,was good

2741,VERY fun with friends
2742,"very very fun in both adventure and creative mode would recommend this.
 



"
2743,i Love this game
2744,This game is really fun and really addictive. You can basically build anything! I highly recommend this to people who have a lot of creativity or just wants to understand mechanics. And i VERY recommend this to schools because you can really learn a lot of engineering in this game.0.
2745,SM IS GOOD I FRUT IT
2746,very good game have over 100 houers on it
2747,"Most people will think scrap mechanic is ok, and give it like 50 hours, I am not most people, I have almost 2k hours, and have been playing this game since the beginnning and I LOVE IT"

2758,amazing sandbox game
2759,"Very cool game. the different game modes are awesome, survival is the best in my opinion.Creative is just as awesome. challenge   mode is cool, but not for me. I would recommend this game"
2760,its fun and interactive
2761,"This is one of those games that falls into the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" category. Whenever you first start, for example, it is very easy to build your first vehicle. But as you progress, more resources are available, and you learn more and more about what works and what doesn't. I would definitely recommend this game."
2762,"Good game, amazing graphics, some times glitches but fun in all creative ideas can almost do anything in this game.I recommend you all play this game. also gamers like Kan, Scrapman  and Moonbo build very good creations.The workshop has a lot of fun things to do and lots of fun and creations."
2763,download now!
2764,"I highly advise to get this game. Really fun and has kept me sane during crazy times. I love the build mechanics and the logic behind it. The survival is also really fun,it puts you skills to the test.I hope that my review will help you choose between a really good game (Scrap Mechanic) or your normal game that you will play for 2 hours."
2765,"(SURVIVAL GAMEMODE) Where do I start... I played majority of my gametime in 2018 where it was a fun game but was missing some much needed updates. Jump back on in 2022 to find literally ZERO quality of life fixes and pretty much no changes have been made...

This is a dead game as developers look like they have given up and will forever stay in early access.

EDIT - Found a way to make the game somewhat enjoyable again. you just have to edit a bunch of scripts and download mods..... yay"
2766,Game has been in early access for over 6 years and is still bare bones.
2767,cool game more water pysics
2768,"Great engineering game. Many hours of fun. I especially like how you can take any item in game and place it down as a physical object, stacking things in the bed of your truck to take home. its nice to have some realism to an object and not just a picture."

2790,tis fun
2791,i've been wanting this game a long time and when i finely got my hands on it. and when i did it was way more the exspected you should play this its really GOOD.
2792,"Hands down, easily one of the best games ever, one reason being, open world, personally I'm a huge fan of open world games, being free to do as you wish and explore, second being the building factor, it's great being able to make your own ""base"" out of random objects, maybe out of cardboard, wood, or other building supplies you discover while roaming about, third is the survival aspect, I'm also a huge fan of survival games, survival, building, and multiplayer!, count me in. I'm a die hard Scrap Mechanic fan and I've owned the game since 2018, so way before survival was released, and it's been a banger ever since it was released, I first discovered this game by watching iBallisticSquid playing it, and if I never saw his video's on SM I never would have known it had existed until a later date, so I'm glad I watched his vid. 10/10 100% recommended"

2807,Sound glitches that break the game. Get stuck on anything and everything simulator. Every possible place you would expect loot there is none. Warehouses are fucking pointless. Fix this god dam game.
2808,I mean the games kind of good but I might have to play some more
2809,"If you have played with the Minecraft Create mod- you will understand how cool moving parts are. Absolute best game to create or test machines. I do not recommend survival though- I myself found it requires too much grinding. If you get this game, it's for the creative mode."

2831,On its way to abandonware. No updates in over a year.
2832,I have literally never played this game
2833,join the game
2834,This is a great game if you have alot of time but if you set aside a few hours to play you will get far i think i like it so much because of how creative you can be along side bringing the survival and grindy things to i think iv only made a few cars but it already feel like im a macanical master any way this does not deserve a 5 star but instead a 10 star review
2835,very good
2836,"Awesome & fun, although grinding resources and fighting in survival gets harder and harder, which makes players go into a stalemate for resources. Creative can get laggy, but I think thats because of my computer, not the game

overall, nice game and i am willing to stick around for updates"
2837,Amazing. Literally build anything. It's like Minecraft but with premium++++.
2838,u can build stuff i guess
2839,pretty good but you need a big brain for this
2840,"Very great game, can do so much in creative and survival at first glance may seem bland but there is SO MUCH to find as you explore more, and only 20 dollars"
2841,zeuhgtios;
2842,"I mean it's fun, but only to an extent. There's destruction physics, but much, much better physics in other games, there's a large workshop, but to be honest a good creation is like a needle in the haystack of fairly bad creations. Then again, I'm only showing the creative mode aspect, which is where I usually play. Survival is a completely different experience which just isn't my personal jam, so I'm not qualified to rate that. Search up a lets-play on YouTube or something to figure out if you would like that. Overall, it's a fine game, it just gets boring and is surpassed by other (sometimes more resource-intensive) sandbox games like Brick Rigs and Stormworks. 3 stars."

2853,"Hello, as a fellow gamer and an motor head for all things mechanical This game is fun, as for the story aspect it does need more people and i think that it should have a difficulty for the beggining of the game. I really like the way they do the car mechanics and how you have to actually learn things and build things, connect things and figure out new kind of car designs. Overall this game is very good and i hope that the new update will provide alot more aspect to the story and maybe some new weapons? PS- i would also like some big mutiplayer lobbys where they battle and go head-to head buiding cars, stautes, houses and all kinds of things. I know this is a lot but i am just saying what i would think improve and get a bunch more people on. - thanks for the amazing game - ethan"

2877,I can uhhhh... do that stuff.
2878,good
2879,Fun game that allows you to build to your heart's content.
2880,i fun but hard
2881,yes
2882,it good
2883,i would say this is a great game because of the mechanics in survival and the ideas and what you can make. I personally play this a lot to make some crazy vehicles or even bases. I also like how there's hover crafts and thrusters.
2884,Bought this flaming sack of shit like 2 years ago. Didnt try it. Regret ever getting it cuz now i cant get my money back. This game is incredibly shit. Dont buy it. Vomited as soon as i started playing. 1/20
2885,this is a good game for builders
2886,"Its easy to learn how to play, but i would reccomend watching some youtube videos about the game before buying."
2887,"yes
"
2888,Great Vehicle and Physics mechanics! Complex but still easy to learn game design makes the game great for anyone.
2889,"Cool game!
We can do anything in this game.
I created a house and this ""house"" can be car,robot and helicopter .
I recomand this game!"
2890,"m,"
2891,good gamw
2892,is super fun
2893,very fun for future engineers
2894,its good
2895,its awsome just try it youl love it if you like survival/sandbox games its an original
2896,"very good for experienced and new players.
it can be a bit slow and boring for new ppl.
as a new person you need to learn how the game works and build experiments to learn things.
and always remember if your experiments fail lets just call it art.
there are no limits to what you can make in this sandbox game especially in creative.

creative is limitless, where you can build anything you want and you can look at the steam workshop or in the manual to learn some stuff. but some things can get a bit difficult and advanced

there is also survival, a bit more challenging than creative. there will be bots that will try and kill you. hay-bots and tote-bots are the most common and they spawn almost everywhere. there are other bots like farm-bots and tape-bots, but tape-bots only spawn at more dangerous places like wherehouses and for the farm-bot it can spawn in forests but it is a super low percent that it will happen.
farm-bots often spawn in atum forests and outside the entrence of a wherehouse."
2897,fun
2898,"I really enjoy this game. Takes all the fun from Besiege and tosses it in an open world island setting. I have played the survival mode primarily. Only complain is please, please give us hinges with ability to adjust angles!"
2899,"constructing crazy contraptions is very fun, especially with friends."
2900,"A game for crafting the unbelievable. It is great playing with friends and fighting robots together, and surviving threw the starvation and dehydration in the world . The funny thing is that u cant drink water , dont ask how to survive the dehydration ."
2901,yes
2902,its pretty good
2903,Scrap Mechanic more liek eHEhfUEUTFGSWHGSD0IUHRTSD√ÖR0OGIJ
2904,"its quite open world, and the ability to create just about anything with no real building size limit is awesome. AND between this and Terratech, i can test builds before making them IRL, which means this doesnt have to be ""just a game""."
2905,"spent an hour and a half building a tank for a challenge and i tried spawning it in but it said ""invalid joint positions"". fix this please."
2906,good game but needs more killer robots
2907,we need supa biiiiiiiiiig tires and muwtntubull spud gatler and shoty plz devs
2908,A lot like Among us.
2909,Been playing and building for ages and found never ending entertainment out of this game.
2910,"–íear developers, please release the update as soon as possible. I really want to explore new locations and mechanics again. please hurry up"
2911,Very good game mostly bc u can play and build with friends and the mods is a must!!!
2912,i have 400+hours in this game and its Bussin
2913,"This game is great. Light survival and crafting but you make the machines you need to survive. Take water to your farm bucket by bucket or conceive an automated contraption to water your plants for you. Tired of walking? build a car or a bike or a boat or a flying pirate ship with mounted potato cannons. Build your base in a tree or on the water or have a base with legs or a floating base. You have to collect and grow all the raw materials you need for your machines unless you play in creative mode then everything is free. Great to play with friends, lots of laughs"
2914,"It is a very good game, a little grindy, and is easy for mods."
2915,its pretty fun to play. :)
2916,e
2917,amazing
2918,fun and creative game that is fun
2919,bad
2920,"If you are hesitating to buy this game, here is a quick tip.

step 1: Profusely thank the person who showed you this game.

step 2: Get the Kentucky, fried, F*CK out of the reviews and buy the game.

step 3: Open it and play it for 2 years across multiple accounts (Like me!)

step 4: Dabble in the modding community and download the Modpack.

step 5: play it for another 2 years because of the overflow of new content you found that was made by the community. (like me!)

step 6: give me 50 dollars and a back massage and I wont strangle you for hesitating to play this game. 

Have fun, stranger. :)"
2921,Best midget game on the market. Scrap Mechanic is the ultimate cartoon survival game on steam without a doubt. I recommend you play with a reliable group though... If you play alone you will easily get bored.

2961,its a very good game
2962,Good times to be had with the team for sure but terrible performance as you get further into a play through/session. Just as you are starting to building crazy/big things you hit the performance ceiling and its unplayable. Would be a 100% recommend if/when this gets fixed.

2970,"I bought this game with the expectation that its a crafting simulator with some destroy the enemy implementations but I didn't expect to be dragged over the hot coals quite like this. I'll be writing only on the survival portion of the game as the creation portion is essentially a testing experience and offers pretty much everything at the start. so.... within the 1st minute of the game I found myself already fighting for my life with the most basic of enemies which okay was a bit easy but it stood out as the pacing for what I was expecting for the rest of the game. as I walk around to the opening I explore a tall ruin and clear it and nothing but some loot was up there and so I figured okay so this is an okay beginning nothing that stands out but its not complicated either. but I hear an enemy freak out and begin running. turns out it was at me. it spotted me while I was way up in a ruined tower from the ground level while I was in its interior. i figured okay maybe I was being noisy. so I kill it and continue to explore. thats when I notice it. my food and water is nearly quarter and I have just enough food to bring myself to 100% and then I'm empty. maybe I had a stroke of bad luck. so I continue to explore and get introduced to my next enemy type. a robot with a pitch fork. guarding a large warehouse cube thingy. turns out there is like 5 of those there and they all want to stab you the very instant they see you. its a bit interesting that they will stand their ground a bit and coax you into making the attack while they wait for their reinforcements so I have to compliment the devs on a decent AI program for them. but I'm out of food and im out numbered so I run for my life. only to realise that my water is draining quickly and I manage to find water but I cant drink it. i figure even if its unsanitary or salty it would be a nice touch to add a poison affect for drinking bad water rather than straight up denying the player of that choice which is pretty standard in survival games. but im dying of dehydration and the only source i've found is in canned drinks that I found and some fruits/veggies. which I cant find unless its guarded and so I keep exploring till i find a flaming burned area populated by enemies and I noped past that. I find a factory and out of desperation I had to explore for food and get killed by a potato shooting robot only to loose my belongings and have none of the resources to return and grab my belongings as you respawn with half the nutrition you have available. so I log off and put it away for a few days and log on to give it another chance. I begin a new game and knowing I cant survive going that direction I circle the crashed ship and find a pond with some farming materials with a crude but effective tutorial on how to farm foods in the game. but you learn quickly that there is always a looming sense of doom as apparently farming is unauthorised by the robots and they will come to destroy your only means of survival. not every hour or half hour but every 16 minutes which kept me close by the ship to defend my crops. thats when when I feel like Im no longer playing a game, its simply a tower defence simulator that barricades itself from an otherwise good crafting game. I put in 6.5 hours trying to give this game a chance and I have to say that maybe its acceptible to play if I played it cooperatively or simply in creative mode as its construction seems to be legitimately good comparing it to other similar creative titels like trail makers or gary's mod. by as it stands as a solo experience. its survival aspects is focused on a bit much compared to a game like eco where your doom may be imminent but you at least have control over the parameters of the time factors and you can make your own level of challenge. I feel as though this game has potential but has some balance issues where your obligations to your characters nutrition feel quite a bit more hindered than they should be."

2972,good game very fun. best with friends.
2973,E bun
2974,very fun but even more fun with friends which i dont have :(
2975,"TO MUCH LAGS FOR EVERY MOVEMENT U MAKE 
UNPLAYABLE IN MULTYPLAYER AND IN CREATIF
WAITING FOR UPTADES THAT WILL CHANGE THE GAME ENTIRELY"
2976,"best game ever
"
2977,"Very fun game, the only problem is how much grinding is involved in survival. If you don't mind or don't care to play survival then this game is a must-have! So much fun with friends!

The amount of possible complexity is really only limited by what your computer can handle, not the game itself. It is fairly laggy, but definitely tolerable, especially for anyone with a good graphics card. The lag however is being improved as we speak.

Graphics are pretty good, my 1060 can handle near max settings at 1080p 40fps with mildly complex vehicles. For more complex vehicles you might have to turn the settings down a bit, but I've never had much problem with it.

On top of that its development is in full force and when chapter 2 comes out this game will be truly incredible. 

Well worth the price, with plenty of replayability and creative possibilities."
2978,Great game
2979,Is good game
2980,"Great game ,however there is still a lot of work from the developers to make it more balanced in survival mode"
2981,"So.... Ill start off with this, i LOVE the game, the game? is AMAZING, ITS FANTASTIC... It has SO MUCH POTENTIAL, but it is, just that, potential..

Its unfinished, and when i bought it, a year ago, i immediately loved it, cause it has just gotten an update, and everything was golden, until i realized, the community is right.. The developers -ARE- working, but at an -actual- snail's pace, in fact, the snail would win the race. Its been over a YEAR, and theres been -0- updates and content and YES there will -soon- be an update. But it just does NOT detract from the fact that i -do not- support leaving everybody hanging for a year at a time (and theres people theres been waiting much longer than i have between stuff too)

But do i love the game? Yes, the design is fantastic, the vehicle system is fun, and theres SO much room for creativity, this is like... A survival game, that has a sort of, minecraftian creativity system for you to explore, thats on a technical side, this is very much: Nerd; the game. 

And i -WISH- i could gush more about this game, its fantastic and i love it, but most of all? I wish i could get to PLAY IT MORE, developers, come on ... I love you and what you do, but this is almost comic."

3025,"A few days after I bought Scrap Mechanic, I got a bug that makes the game very hard to play. All the driver seats/saddles, Craftbots, refine bots, and some structures around the survival world became invisible or really bugged out. This is pretty frustrating seeing as Craftbots and driver seats are used quite often. I still haven't found a fix to this bug, so that sucks. But other than that, the game play is very fun, and it's impressive to see how well it runs with a ton of objects moving around. I definitely recommend this game."

3106,"This game has so much potential yet it all the resources that they could have put towards his game got all poured into Raft. 

This game has not seen a substantial update in years and the developers can't decide whether or not they want to focus on creative/mission content or survival content so the limited resources they have is being split. You will see more devblogs then actual content updates. 

It's a shame because the game is so fun with friends and building and physics feel great but there are so many QoL things they could add like trashing/deleting loot. Until the devs start updating the game instead of devblogs I can't recommend this game unless it's on sale for like $5.00."

Wait, what was I saying?
Oh, yes.. Buy this game."
3143,Amazing game!!
3144,best game ever. but now i cant play it.
3145,This is a very good game and there is a lot of stuff to do in it.
3146,"this game is fun

update: for 20 bucks its good"
3147,Bussin
3148,"playing this game for 5 years, love this game, such a quick relief."
3149,fun times for sure
3150,"if you like (advanced) mechanics, then this game is for you"
3151,i love that game
3152,Great game little bit buggy but runs pretty good
3153,it is very chill and i would recommend trying mods
3154,penis
3155,fun
3156,everything is good but the controls can get a little overwhelming.
3157,good game

"
3159,it is fun and it has multiplayer which is good
3160,"I would recomend becuase it is fun and any body new to the game might have a hard time since its a bit complex
"
3161,Very fun
3162,very awesome and nostalgic game
3163,"This game is super well made. There are a few optimization issues with large structures but i'm sure the devs will get along to fixing that in the future. My favorite thing about this game is how SATISFYING it is to collect resources in survival mode. The sound design team deserves huge credit for this of course. And in addition to all of the other great things about this game, the dev team gives regular updates regarding future content which is awesome and has me super hyped for the next big update. Super worth the money to buy."
3164,If you are looking for both a game to play to relax yet still have your brain stimulated. This is the game.
3165,eeeeeeeeeeeeeee
3166,i am going isane over dis
3167,verry good
3168,I love this game!!!
3169,BEST GAME for creative people
3170,"Game good, you can annoy your friend by exploding his truck, or placing horns"
3171,"THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN! You can make any thing you want to build! It has survival,creative, and challenge mode."
3172,very good
3173,awesome game with fun creation mechanics.. relly makes you think and the sky is the limit
3174,i LIKE
3175,"yea, great for playing by yourself, not so much with friends. Apparently the netcode is bad enough that inputs of any kind can have up to 15 seconds delay."
3176,this game is addicting
3177,Dis is very cool building game?
3178,I've been playing this game since around it came out. cant recommend higher! can take a while to figure out physics and connection system but when you do you fall in love with it! has an active community. can be lag at times and be slow(depending on what your doing and specs). updates will be few and far between due to size of game dev team.
3179,very good
3180,
3181,yes
3182,"good game
"
3183,i like it its best game on steam but Dont buy it
3184,Good
3185,I started playing very early on and the game was great i did'int think it could get any better i was proved so wrong. This game is for people who love to create and have the freedom to do whatever you want. I recommend this game to anyone that has played Minrcraft.
3186,"tthis game is creative
"
3187,Fun
3188,If you have the minim SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS the game will run perfectly
3189,IS GOOD
3190,They might be slow on updates but the game is great and every update is worth the wait!
3191,A very fun  game !
3192,epic
3193,good
3194,Fun
3195,"for the people that want a more modern besiege and a less complicated from the depths, this game is perfect for the aspiring mechanic. you can make simple cars with the motor parts or you can make your own engine using pistons and sensors. the limits of this game are virtually endless.
the physics engine sometimes does do odd behavior but it handles physical cogs and seperated suspension very well.
the survival mode is a bit hard to get into. i suggest you get this game with a friend. the survival is not very fun solo.
the multiplayer actually works really well over short distances but over long distances you should not let the person connecting to your server drive because the latency can get a bit severe.
i am not too experienced with this game so i can't tell you how good the later game is but the early game in survival mode is very challanging and fun. sometimes a bit frustrating but not impossible,
the creative mode is a lot of fun for experimenting but in my opinion, survival is what this game is about. because its scrap mechanic. not i have everything mechanic.

tl;dr
this is a simple yet challanging game thats best enjoyed with friends. i can't wait to see what future updates bring."
3196,YES
3197,"This game is good if you want to engeneer when you are older, just if you were stranded on an island: LIKE MINECRAFT, Stempunk type is it recomended?: yes"
3198,"I waited 2 years before buying it, i don't regret it buy i'd advice to wait for another patch because the survival is... kinda empty and not awsome in many aspects.

But it just needs a few more features (map, the controlable turrets waited in the next patch, etc)
I'm sure this is gonna be neat soon."
3199,yes
3200,"good

3228,One of the best games i have ever played üëç
3229,Good
3230,great for a solo exploration and growth of tools and materials you use to explore and build better machines and awesome multiplayer with friends for those reasons but with friends! its always better
3231,"this game is really good and i reccomend this to anyone with a sense of creativity that you cant do in other games, the bearings in this game are very flexible and you can make complex or simple mechanical things you couldn't in other building games like Minecraft, Terraria, Roblox, etc. this game has much more like robots which can work together and a way to make robots fight each other. with the ability to make robot teams fight me and my friend would build teams to battle each other. i love the cosmetics area too because (unlike other games) you cant just buy cosmetics or open mystery packs that cost money, in this game you can find packs in survival to open and not spend any money except the initial 20$ to buy it. would definitely reccomend!"
3232,very creative and fun
3233,beans
3234,i really like playing with other people
3235,I recommend this game
3236,"It will not let my play.

3237,its really fun
3238,nvm it works
3239,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game, speaking of creative you can make all kinds of walking male members or a giant dynamite tower to crash the world to your friends.
In survival mode you can make walking male members too but in this mode there is something much more interesting and that is to rescue grandparents from gypsy robots that have them kidnapped to take them to another grandparent's house to set up a retirement party to which you are not invited and I don't like that but I guess it's fine in the aspect of combing bald people or making explosives with alien shrimp diarrhea. I recommend it without a doubt.
There are red dead bums in a forest burned by the communists.

Rese√±a en espa√±ol: Scrap Mechanic es un gran juego, hablando del creativo puedes hacer todo tipo de miembros masculinos andantes o una torre d dinamita gigante para crashearle el mundo a tus amigos.
En el modo supervivencia puedes hacer miembros masculinos andantes tambi√©n pero en este modo hay algo mucho mas interesante y es rescatar abuelos de robots gitanos que los tiene secuestrados para llevarlos a la casa de otro abuelo para montar una fiesta de jubilados a la cual no estas invitado y eso no me gusta pero supongo que esta bien en el aspecto de peinar calvos o hacer explosivos con diarrea de gambas alien√≠genas. Lo recomiendo sin duda.
Hay vagabundos muertos rojos en un bosque quemado por los comunistas.
Ta weno el jogo
Olvidaba recalcar que es un mundo dominado por los negros de Tanzania (Escocia) que a su vez son subditos del gobierno comunista de Babaria el cual provoca una gran difusion visceral/intermolecular en los agentes del FBI que proveen bienes domesticos a todos los simps de el mercado."
3240,This is a really immersive and ecstatic game. Definitely recommend.

3265,This game brought a whole new mechanical experience into my life so how about you try.
3266,will you please make it to where we can use mods from the workshop meant for survival mode use able like in creative
3267,"This game has massive potential and is very fun to play. My largest complaint is when you're dehydrated or starving you get kicked out of the driver seat of your awesome creation. ""oh no im thirsty, guess I just forgot how to drive!""
"
3268,i like black men
3269, (12345)
3270,Good game
3271,"This game is just talksh*t, when do we get the content?"
3272,This game is really fun after you learn how to play. Making new vehicles and bases is one of the best things in this game. Also playing with friends is super fun.
3273,It's gud
3274,Constant issues while trying to co-op with a friend for her stream. You never know if the next part you place on your vehicle will just crash you to desktop with a bug report. Another game that has been stuck in early access forever and will probably never leave.
3275,"Had some fun a while back and wanted to mess around a bit more, but now the game won't even start. Tried everything and still couldn't make it work. So Axolot, maybe fix your glitchy game for god's sake. All my other games run perfectly, so my pc isn't the issue.

Game is also pretty dead and rarely gets updated.. Lack of endgame content or rather any content whatsoever is what makes the experience truly boring overall. Sure you can build a lot of stuff if you're somewhat smart, but it's not enough. It's still in early access and so the potential is still there.. But eh, I wouldn't expect much to be honest. If I'm wrong then prove it by working on and fixing this mess. Gameplay and vehicles feels clunky, combat isn't fun and there isn't a lot of variety to what you can do. Physics are downright dumb too. And I could go on. The world feels empty and just dead.

TLDR: Overall this game is unpolished, lacks content, is very grindy and just isn't worth your time. If you're into this kind of shet then good for you. But I'd recommend not to buy at full price if you wanna try it. Definitely wait for a sale."
3276,fun
3277,is the best game ever
3278,The wait for the survival update was worth it
3279,you can make cool cars and stuff and you can make stuff explode

3298,"2 mil / 2 mil. You can build anything you want like train's, walkers, busus, cars. Anything plus Servival mode is so cool its like a servival building game. Best game ever!"
3299,This game is super fun and worth the money. Either you just want to mess around with friends or build cars. This game has it all!
3300,vfsgsergwtgbwfqerqwdcqwx
3301,really good PVE game.
3302,fun game could use some bigger creative maps tho
3303,"Sandbox is personally my favourite, but playing through survival has been really fun and fresh. It's been super fun building machines that actually have a purpose and are useful for progression. Have a decent amount of experience in sandbox made survival so much easier and I feel like it could be hard for a new player to get into. 

If you enjoy creative games where you can build complex (or simple) machines and contraptions, or want a survival game where you fight for your life and have to throw together vehicles made of scrap and spare parts this is the game for you.

And if you've ever played Gmod sandbox and built cars or vehicles, it's very similar. Just very refined and easy to get into.

"
3304,fun like minecraft with more advanced redstone.
3305,The building system is easy to learn and the cars are super fun to drive around!
3306,it's very fun
3307,I love it. Scrap Mechanic is the definition of a sandbox game!
3308,"yes
"
3309,"I don't think there is another game that lets you build stuff as easily as you do in scrap mechanic. It's ease of use goes into the very DNA of the game itself, even the incidental objects look like children's toys, it's bizarre.
While it is slow to update, what is there at the moment includes some of my favourite content in gaming, and the adventure mode really does make use of your engineering skills and designs."
3310,very cool

3326, get it if you want
3327,Really fun and great game! Got addicted in minutes.  With a total of 76 hours laying so far i would definately recommend
3328,"Scrap Mechanics might be a great game, but it is not ready. There's no tutorial and very little guide on what you're supposed to do in survival mode -- basically the only way to play is to have your browser open on the side. Maybe it'll turn into a great game in a year or two that's actually playable by average person."
3329,"If you like games were you can craft nearly to the limit of your imagination then get this game.  The workshop items and mods available are pretty awesome, and with the Scrap Mechanic Mod Tool, adding your own custom mods is easy.  Survival mode is challenging and entertaining, and creative mode could keep an innovative mind captivated for hours."
3330,its goofy goobers
3331,no limits and sooo many FREE mods
3332,i dont like my friend gunner
3333,This game has a cool and unique concept but it feels so unfinished. You cant even enjoy the game because of the fact you die to either hunger or thirst every 5 minutes. Getting food takes forever and finding water is not possible. Decent game but not even close to being worth $20. If i could go back in time and re buy i would'nt pay more then $3.
3334,i like to make cars with logic stuff and it is fun. it is also easy to get the hang of
3335,very good very good yay

3343,"Who doesn't like a good sandbox game? No one that‚Äôs why I'm writing this review on an amazingly simple yet complex game (depending on what you chose to do) created by Axolot Games. 


Scrap mechanic is a great game full of fun' building and more one of the key features that separates this game from the crowed is the drag to place feature just chose the two angles and drag the sheet to any size you want it to be. There are many different tools in game including the hammer, weld tool, and connect tool witch allows you to connect all of the button's engines and more quite easily there is a in game book that tells you how to do all of this. 


There may be some wonky physics but honestly it‚Äôs all part of the fun There's even a physics Slyder which makes it more fun the lower it goes the floppier the bearings and suspension get so there is plenty to play with having races and battles with vehicles that are floppy and all over the place may sound wild but that‚Äôs the physics Slyder for you. 


We have looked at the physics and the fun the tools and the tips I conclude this by saying I hope I have Inspired you to create."
3344,"Excellent game, and the new updates really help."
3345,"""W game"" Nick garza"
3346,I haven't even had this game for more than 2 weeks and i already have 113 hours this game is better than good its just spectacular. I cannot express in words how absolutely speculator splendid absolutely amazing it makes me feel emancipated to know that i have found such a absolutely outstanding game
3347,"It's a decent game. The graphics are good, the idea of the game is interesting, but overall, the game lacks things to do. No special missions, nor any dialogue from the few NPCs present. The game is boring after exploring for just a few hours."
3348,it fun so it good

3350,"Single Player survival Is not very well balanced. Progression is slow, Robots attacking your farm are to op for single person. The game is fun though. Trying to obtain a spud gun is a drawn out process. vehicles do not go up terrain with load of harvest. Tires will spin in place as vehicle rolls back. Just my opinion of course."
3351,OH HELL YES
3352,Gud
3353,"cool game however misleading name. i thought scrap mechanic would be vag/volkswagen mechanic since that too is scrap

3354,sexy game

"
3361,W game
3362,Pretty fun
3363,"It's a fun game overall. I first heard of Scrap mechanic a few years ago from YouTube, and only recently actually bought the game. It's fun to work out how to make different machines function properly or using mods to get new things. I think by far the worst part of the game is it's survival mode. It does little to explain why your there and what you need to do other then ""You crashed your spaceship. Get home."" which would be fine if I knew how to repair the spaceship. The fun about scrap mechanic is you get to be creative and make your own things, but you can't do that as well in survival because of the limited things you have to work with (Sometimes that an upside, sometimes it's a downside) and the fact that you can't actually build on the ship. I thought survival mode would be about finding or making things like strong metals for the walls and thrusters to get the ship off the planet, and then actually fly it away because you turned it into your own thing, but instead your lost and starving. You lose hunger and thirst very quickly and heal to fast. If the devs wanted it to seem like the robots your fighting are powerful, they should have made healing slower so every battle will have consequences. The creative mode is fun though."
3364,its amasing evan better than mc
3365,I find the wide verity of thins you can do in this game is rather entertaining.
3366,"This Game is a Masterpiece!!


     The Creative game play is astonishing, with so many possibilities for creation. You can let your mind run wild and make anything you want, provided you watched a couple of tutorials on YouTube for working things out! I built a full scale, fully functional RV Mobile home and it is amazing, as well as a Suburban based off of my dad's. I have built many tests and awesome creations, and enjoyed every second. Being able to use your knowledge of how things work, you can make very complex machines. People make 3D printers using the logic gates and controllers for God sake!

      As for survival, the game play is awesome as well. Using your knowledge of building, you can find parts and resources and build your very own survival vehicle to travel the robot infested landscape. You can break Hay bots to get scrap metal, as well as possible computer chips and component kits, which can be used to make handheld tools and your very own robots to help you cook, refine resources, and craft more advanced items! You can build a house on the ground and farm food to survive. But beware, if you plant too many crops and water them, the Farm bots will come in a matter of minutes to tear it all down, so be prepared to fight! You can build a big base with ginormous walls, and have mountable spud guns (Potato shooting guns, with farmable ammo!) attached to switches via your connect tool to blast away those Farm bots! There are still humans in this world, however. There is a big farm base hidden inside of a rock formation somewhere around, but I'll let you find it! There, you can trade compressed packages of certain crops to trade for soil, fertilizer, and if you find the poor trapped farmers, spud guns! 

        Multiplayer can be used in Survival, or Creative modes. Although it seems that everyone who uses it experiences some kind of connection lag one way or another, and depending on your internet speed, can be tolerable or straight-up unplayable. I happen to have very slow internet compared to most people, and I often experience horrible connectivity issues. But I still managed to make many good memories with my friends when it worked better. Some creations will function differently on other people's screens in multiplayer, sometimes glitching out and moving unexpectedly, but is otherwise not that bad.

   

          Overall, I rate this game a solid 9/10. It would be an easy 10 if there weren't as many connectivity issues, and I know there are lots of people who can agree. This game is extremely worth the money, and I recommend you buy it IMMEDIATELY! If you want a taste of something new, exciting (and sometimes comedic), get this. I guarantee you won't regret it! :D"
3367,gud
3368,"Really good and fun game. How you get survival, challenge and creative mode in this game is great. I would recommend this to anyone who loves minecraft but wants a more mechanical change."

3373,"Oh man,  I found this game through Neebs Gaming, and though there is a bit to learn as far as creative mode, its a blast.  It's like a lego set for adults, with minecraft style survival."
3374,"Highly recommended!!!! One of my favorite games to date!  You like survival/building this is a must own!!! 10/10!  Make sure you clean up all our harvesting though because that can make some lag issues. Your imagination truly is the limit in this game.  So far we have built a semi, drill trucks and all sorts of fun things."
3375,idk

3398,build cars with friends
3399,If you think the hopper is the best block in minecraft then this is the game for you. I only play the vanilla survival mode and have lots of hours. The negative is that your imagination is not the limit; your pc is. With a 3090 and a 5900x i still have trouble with lag from large creations especially mining.
3400,epic super deluxe build

3407,je
3408,ok
3409,its fun allows you to express your creativity there is a amazing workshop nad is single or multiplayer
3410,Great fun.
3411,A good and fun game
3412,"This game is an amazing game. I love playing around in Creative Mode and Survival Mode, I always make and try to find new glitches to use in Creative Mode and Survival Mode. Honestly a really fun game to play.

You can play on it with a decent computer and probably a potato computer aswell. The gameplay is fun and has 2 Gamemodes sadly not really a story for Survival but still a really fun game.

The audio in the game is amazing and fits the game perfectly. The graphics quality is really good for a game like this. The game is pretty fun and easy but a bit harder to master the mechanics but still pretty easy to learn.

The game has alot of grinding in Survival but really fun, This game is definitly worth its price. (10/10)"
3413,"Fcking great. So first of all you have mods, which are a literal part of this game. Thousands of mods for you or you and your friends to have fun with. Now creative is great, but survival is amazing. One of my friends has a world and there are 4 of us on it. Survival with friends is just pure fun. It's like you would extract the concentrate from ""fun"". This game is absolute peak. Buy it. Now."

3421,very good game recomend it if you have a creative mind
3422,is gud
3423,"nasa computers can barely handle it lmao
gameplay and graphics are ok, physics are very cursed, but havent played much yet
i wouldnt be mad if there was an update, like, monthly, though"
3424,This game is straight donkey ass
3425,very good game lets out my creativity
3426,BEST GAME EVER PROBBALY YES 100% WORTH IT!
3427,yes
3428,is good
3429,i recommend it because its a fun design and build game
3430,noice!
3431,its a fun game but the only thing i would change is be able to make copyes of your survival world
3432,"Scrap mechanic is the best axiety disorder simulator on the market. While the mechanical part of the game is fun, I cannot stop grinding and shaking with axiety, because at any moment, one mistake could turn my life to hell... out of 5."
3433,its good
3434,BUIULD
3435,very fun. destruction physics make it very fun to build weapons of mass destruction to fight friends
3436,yes
3437,best vehicle building sandbox and survival ever
3438,big dick energy
3439,"A really fun game, can be complicated at first, but only takes a little bit to understand. You can do about anything in sandbox or play survival."
3440,the best game
3441,"thar are NO rules
"
3442,"Very fun game, the physics are amazing! Fun to play with friends, but i don't have friends :("
3443,A game for folks that like engineering
3444,best game ever
3445,"Scrap Mechanic is a challenging game. While it isn't the most awesome graphical game it surely does make up for it in game play. At first I didn't think it had a point to it but soon after a few hours went by it became clear that you have to work at upgrading everything and that eventually you will have better equipment and faster build times. It is fun to play, challenging and time consuming. Building is very fun and easy once you learn what things do and where they should go. It may not be the greatest game every made but is really is good fun especially if you play multiplayer. I only found a few quirks with the game and that is Food and Drink. Always comes down to food and drink. Food isn't a huge issue if you go grind and make a garden but drink surely is. There are plenty of bodies of water but nothing you can drink. You have to get corn and set it before a cow and after 3 times of doing that you get a milk to drink. I would think the creators of this game would allow you to build a purifier of some sort to set up by the body of water so you can have water to drink. aside from that everything else seems to work just fine."
3446,Good game.
3447,"You like building stuff? you like Minecraft? you like survival games? Well here it is in one package. your imagination and reasoning skills is your only limitation here. Also lack of madness. embrace it. but its a lot of fun, esp with friends. I mean you can make cars, trikes, planes, and death dealing robots."
3448,Awesome Best played with friends to help speed things up can't wait to the new updates.

3473,"I'm gonna be honest. absolutely honest.
This is basically MineCraft and Space Engineers rolled into one. (sort of)

Pros: Definitely challenges you to several aspects of it while being on survival mode. you have to change your priorities CONSTANTLY based on the situation you are currently in.
Forces you to think like an engineer and attempts to build your own means of transportation.
Forces you to gather certain items and components (as long as you actually know WHERE to find)

Cons: Severe lack of story mode/lore behind it. Immediately drops you off on the spot where your spaceship somehow crashed and now you're on a planet where there's several hordes of murderous robots around, yet, not a speck of blood or/and guts has barely present where it would hints extinct race of humanity.

Your hunger / thirst depletes very, very fast, no matter what kind of situation you are in. it literally forces you to start gardening and planting like no tomorrow.  It impacts and hurts your experience where you want to explore, drive around, or attempts to find some certain crates/ruins to explore around. Thirsty? hungry? It forces you to do some serious long-term gardening until you manage to amass an sufficient amount of fruits/vegetables where you won't be dying of hunger/thirst for few days. It is very, very time consuming.
(and seriously frustrating when no matter what you do, if you make a huge plot area for gardening, somehow HORDES OF MURDEROUS ROBOTS SPAWNS OUT OF LITERAL THIN AIR AND KILLS YOUR HARD WORKING EFFORTS BY DESTROYING THE PLANTS. HOW?!?! HOW DID IT TRIGGER THE ROBOTS TO COME TO THIS SPECIFIC AREA?! THERE'S NO SENSOR, NO CAMERA, NOTHING THAT WOULD TRIGGER THIS!!)

Lack of map. Seriously, you happens to have a half-wrecked burning ship, somehow you manages to salvage a ""engineer log"" or some kind of book where it happens to contain two location coordinates that you can go back to back if you get lost or needing to go there. Any place beyond that, force you to build a Beacon. Make ZERO sense. There's actual physics and whatnot present yet, the actual term ""logic"" do not exist anymore in this game. (seriously, why do you need HONEY and WOOD in order to make a SINGLE WHEEL??)

I played the game, and endured, a lot of suffering, and endured to end. I'm nowhere from finishing this game. 
 NOWHERE.

I understand that it encourages you to explore and discover stuff and all of that, but it does not work well for me at all. I compared this to MineCraft and Space Engineers. Both is very playable. Both is very interesting and enjoyable. Hell, i poured LOT OF HOURS into SPACE ENGINEERS than this game. This game is incredibly bugged. I'm not going to lie. If i was given an choice, i would pick Space Engineers / MineCraft OVER this game.

Unplayable for Multiple Co-Op players. Horrid UNSTABLE internet connection and lagged to the point it'll force us to play it solo. for rest of the game itself. SOLO.

If there's an actual huge chance that it can be reworked/scrapped and rebuilt from scratch, i would suggest that the system of building vehicles/whatnot be started over again. While i admit that there's originality and uniqueness to it, it's just difficult to get the hang of it, even with the manual it provided in the game.

And Lastly, i would like to mention this, it killed my motivation when i find out it has not been updated since 2020. I find out on internet, several players is playing version of this but it's heavily MODDED and it INCLUDES several devices/things that is INCREDIBLY useful to have, THAN the freaking vanilla version.

I don't have the mental capacity to make efforts to keep playing this game anymore. I'll just go back to Space engineers where things make sense and more fun than this game."
3474,very fun especially if you're creative highly reccomend
3475,"Quite fun. A little difficult to get going but once you start the momentum carries forward. All in all, fun."
3476,very good but i have a thing that changes my new controls to my old one

3489,"Ive had this game for several years, I remember before there was even a paint tool and having so many ideas for vehicles and bases and just, purely random things that were never meant to work but only for the satisfaction of watching something soar into the atmosphere and wondering what I could improve next. Ive loved watching this game grow ever since I got it, keeping up with the devblogs about whats coming next, speculating on what things could turn out to be, and ultimately playing around with those new items and features. When the workshop was added my mind was blown with everything everyone else had made. Just spawning those creations in and pulling out my connector tool to figure out how they made it.

Once survival mode was given an actual release date I have never been so hyped. Finally after several years we would see the survival mode with all of the new blocks, items, and of course the enemy bots. Safe to say that I was not dissapointed. This game is one of my all time favorites that I have ever had the enjoyment of playing, and Im so happy the devs aren't dropping it like some other game devs do once they hit a major update. Im so excited to see where the game goes next and how the actual story unfolds. Sure sometimes it has been slightly annoying when updates get pushed back but I know that means they are taking as much consideration and thought into making it the best they can.

I have never had as much fun in this game playing with my brothers and friends than I have had in any other game and I am so happy to have been here when I did. Axolot Games, you did a incredibly amazing job with crafting this game and even with the bugs sometimes those make it even better experience (And the ragdolls are the best thing ever lol). Thank you for making this wonderful game and making it even better with each update."
3490,Nice
3491,"gjgsjkjkyhsjnbsnm otherwise it is very good game gamer bois

3492,"its just good, buy it"
3493,"A fantastic game! There is a lot of freedom, along with potential. The updates are slow, but they are worth the wait! You can build anything you can imagine. Like literally, your imagination is the limit... Along with the game not being fully optimized yet, but hey! They do work on it ^_^"
3494,"this is funner than gmod with a fgew people
best game ever 10/10
bugs are amazing"
3495,"The survival mode is really fun with some friends. The limit of what you can do is your imagination. 
Kind of buggy sometimes, but still easily playable. 

The creative mod is also fun, but a little boring compared to the survival one. Nothing can beat finishing your vehicule or your house by using all the materials you found by walking around."
3496,no
3497,"me like
"
3498,this game is amazing but slow at first then gets better later game
3499,"Just got it, and there is already a problem. Went into creative mode, and neither the driver's seats nor saddles were displaying properly. in fact, after a short while, they stopped displaying. it may just be my laptop, but this is a problem. other than that, it's a really great game! I've already made 4 different cars, and i'm really proud of them! I have not played survival, because that is simply not the gamemode for me, but I'm sure it's amazing! I definitely recommend this game to everyone!"

The survival mode seems to run fine, but I didn't build anything in there.  I really want to play the creative game mode and build whatever.  I've recently found Scrapman's vids on youtube and I'm obsessed with the game, but can't get it to work.  Help please.

After verifying integrity of files on STEAM, I got the creative mode to work.  And it's awesome!!!!"
3518,"you can do lots of very cool things, and very funny with friends"
3519,"Dev's please add multiplayer servers similar to Rust or Ark, It would save your game and interest old and new players. Ive been waiting forever for this please :( btw super fucking amazing game if not my favorite"
3520,"amazing game, a bit grindy tho
"
3521,its good
3522,pretty chill little game.
3523,"i want to love the game i really really do but there is just so many things wrong in survival that its almost not worth playing and if your a person looking at reviews trying to figure out if this game is worth playing,right now its barely worth a follow let alone early access. it has so much potential its oozing with it,then again i know games take alot of time and love and patience  but from my point of view from watching my favorite gamer play it almost 2 to 3 years ago,i think this game hasent seen a update in awhile."
3524,"yes very cool

3525,its pretty good
3526,A good game for the more survival gamer.

3557,IT'S THE BEST GAME EVER. IT'S A BETTER VERSION OF MINECRAFT. SO MUCH MORE FUN. YOU CAN DO SOME MUCH MORE THEN BUILDING LIKE SHOOTING AND FIGHT WITH YOUR HAMMER. AND IT'S ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS LIKE YOU AND ME.
3558,very fun
3559,better than minecraft
3560,i love this game everything is good however a while ago i came upon a glitch where i joined a friends world and got clothing but when i left the game i had no cloths (other than crash landing cloths) and i couldnt even get cloths anymore so im now stuck with the ripped cloths plz fix but other than that this game is great
3561,funny car
3562,"Good game, very fun

3563,its a great sandbox game but if you like the thrill of survival this is also a great game to play also with the steam workshop you can get blueprints to inspire your own creations.

3570,Funny and wonderful game!!
3571,good
3572,"hey so ive got to say i love this game.... WHEN IT WORKS.. I do have to reinstall multiple multiple times in order for it to work but then it only works for a few hours then starts crashing again.  I have over 2000 hours into this game and yes its been crashing since the day i bought it. So ive been extremely patient with this game because its by far one of the funniest games ive ever played,  But Hot Damn these crashes need to stop.  Please devs reach out to me and help.  Im at my wits end.  I want to play the game but at this point its to frustrating due to the constant crashing.  Ive done all the fixes that are online. Most didnt work and a few would only work for a short period of time...  DEVS yeah you ... PLease help..  thank you.."
3573,Really fun but there is a lot of grind but to me its fun because anything is possible to build and have fun playing.
3574,"IT IS A RELLY FUN GAME
"
3575,this is fun
3576,"Early development was shaky. We had to wait a long time for any content whatsoever, the developers decided to save all of these developed features for they released the foundations for survival mode - can't say i fully agreed with their decision. 

As things are what they are now, its worth purchasing for its reasonable price and what it now offers.

My only complaint at this moment in time is that MP is unstable. Playing with someone else (who was from the next county from me - so not very far) is frustrating because of the constant elastic banding and with creations spazzing out when using them together. This is a pretty big deal as they quite happily advertise this game as something that should be played with friends."

3581,"I will admit that I've gotten my money's worth out of this, however from my observation, the game appears to be dead in the water. Lately, the creators post ""hype up"" updates without actually updating the game. It feels like abandonware that the devs are still trying to suck money from. It has been over 1 year since functional content has been added to the game (November 2020)."

3589,This game is a very fun game to play because there is no end game thing that you have to beat so you can take it slow and not rush to beat the game. This is a definite recemend to others

3592,Apsofrigginloutely one of my favorite games of all time and looking forward to the next updates!
3593,great game
3594,The game was okay at best. The graphics could only be described as subpar and frankly cartoonish. I thought this game would be more like REAL engineering! I take a freshman engineering class and the things in this game DO NOT match up with what i'm learning... So yeah 2 stars (out of 5)
3595,its cool
3596,good game
3597,Its a fun and adventurous time to create many creations that one normally couldn't do in other games.

3600,"this game is one of the best games out there the game is really good
"
3601,its a great game
3602,very interesting
3603,i think it is a good game because it is a fun game and survival can be scary but really fun and the fact you do not have any limits to what you can build is amazing and i wold 100% recommend this game if you have a lot of creativity
3604,"fun................... in creative

survival is extremely unbalanced and unless you have a spud gun(which is hard to obtain) you can't go any where without dying.

Play for creative, not survival, i only play because i'm a masochist.
(56.5hrs at time of review 1)
review 2: I like this game now :)

I stand by my last review for the most part but once i became better at the game and created a flying machine the game became fun, although that is absurd because I shouldn't need glitches to have fun.
It has a charm.

review 3(385 hours): I love this game so much, the possibilities are endless and the challenges persist when creating no matter your skill, i've made a cargo plane, a jet, a truck, a self stabilising monowheel, a trike, a bike, a mobile survival base, a submarine, a tank and a farm so big all the soil in my survival world couldn't fill it. I love this game so much, the possibilities are insane. If you like low priced games with insane amounts of freedom in your own creativity then buy this damn game."
3605,its fun and creative

3611,Please. JUST PLEASE GIVE US THE REAL UPDATE. I'm waiting since years it's still on early access how hard it is that makes you keep updating raft but waiting for this game which has more potential than raft btw. At least fix the lag issue while playing multiplayer that makes the game unplayable.

3627,very fun. dev's seem pretty happy and are working on it altho they are a small group and updates are slow. I'm cool with that. Look forward to the updates!
3628,it is fun
3629,its is so fun and if you have to waste time its awsome you can just get lost in this game

3635,This Game let's you make whatever your mind can come up with. I can't wait for what they add in future it looks awesome.
3636,"This is a reeeeeally creative game. I reccomend this game to minecraft/terraria players too!
"
3637,BEST GAME BEST IN SURVIVAL SOOOOO COOOOOL
3638,cool gam whee u can mak missil- i mean cars
3639,poopy game always lages
3640,add sex
3641,genuine enjoyment from a very unique game
3642,good game
3643,great game in general good price for the game
3644,very good game if you enjoy suspesion and car design
3645,"The survival mode is disastrously unfinished. It feels like a prototype proof of concept with fancy graphics. QOL features are severely missing. I feel like I could win the game just by farming a few different items manually from the world and then crafting a chest and hopper and then use it to buy a potato gun just by doing that, then win the game by using potato gun with good aim, completely bypassing the need for any mechanical contraptions at all."
3646,it is a decent game worth getting hours on
3647,Very fun to play on
3648,"love it




































"
3649,"it is a good game for those who play minecraft and want machines. the gameplay is kinda buggy, but viable if you don't go to complex. survival is a GREAT campaign and is grindy but fun! creative is cool because you can build whatever and test bots! challenge is... well.. challenges!"
3650,YK THIS GAME KOOL
3651,I recommend this game because it is very fun and creative me and my family love it lots
3652,"My favourite game and I say this for many reasons that I don't have enough space or time to include them all!
Firstly. if you've never played this game, i highly recommend you splash a few bucks because this is as close to real life mechanics as it gets. 

I got so addicted to this I had to take it on holiday lol

anyway, i digress. As someone that suffers from a few mental problems (dont ask, dont wanna get into it rn) this really helps me relax and get into the groove of repairing and putting my neurodivergent brain to good use.

I cant wait for them to add DLC as i feel i have milked all the hours i can get out of this. Cant wait to go back to coming home from a long shift at the garage, to sit back, grab a bev, and do some repairing.

In conclusion, thank you devs fo making this game. Sorry if i get sidetracked by brain just works in mysterious ways. or so im told."
3653,is good
3654,good game for up and coming terrorists
3655,car go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
3656,"Pretty good game, has 101% realistic simulations probably. I recommend creative for new players to get used to the game and build mechanics and then move on to survival for a slightly more fun approach."
3657,Super fun and different survival game but still has a lot of flaws.
3658,performance till struggles when 2 vehicles get close together and the vehicle controls are still really limited
3659,its amazing
3660,"its a cool adventure game

3661,"I made squidward

3668,this game is a wonderfull creative and survial game full of educaition and ti teach you the way of logic you realy neeed to get this game
3669,"I love this game, keep up the good work!"

3671,i will crap
3672,one of my fav youtubers play it and it is a good game
3673,I love this game so much i just wish that the updates were more frequent
3674,yes
3675,"The best creative game i have ever played, just the freedom to create anything imaginable ranging from complex mechanics and logic systems to stupid creations to have fun with your mates. This game will never get boring as long as you have new and interesting ideas. 10/10"
3676,fun crative game
3677,cars go brrrrrrrrr
3678,"Fun, if you friends to play with."
3679,"It is a beautifully chaotic game with fun physics, decent multiplayer and a really fun both creative and survival mode. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun, mentally challenging game where the planet is your workshop and the only limits are your willingness to spend awhile with trial and error and your computers RAM."
3680,"Very good, very nice"
3681,"Scrap Mechanic is a slow-baked creative engineering game basically.
It's got some complex stuff you can do, a survival and creative mode, and an unofficial modding community which is just the best.
it really rewards creativity and outlandishness while also still letting you make your vehicles mundane as hell.
The multiplayer is a little rusty and gets worse and worse the farther you live from your mates though.

Overall, this game is worth it, but don't expect lots of updates, they develop stuff slow and are spaghetti coders. As of writing this, Survival has yet to get ""Chapter 2"" launched and its semi-identical to how it was on launch back in 2020."
3682,YEEZY SLIDS
3683,very fun sandbox! i like using mods :)
3684,can not wait for the new update :)
3685,"Want a sandbox game that doesn't let you put blocks floating in the air with no explanation? This is your game.

Scrap Mechanic is a solidly built game with many, many potential possibilities. Featuring a free sandbox mode, survival mode, and a large amount of puzzles which challenge your mechanical ability and resourcefulness, you encounter endless options. 

One of the coolest things in the game, something that has been there from the start, is the workshop community. You can post builds and scroll through many professional or quirky builds, and choose to spawn any single one of them into your world through the lift. (note that this is only possible through sandbox, not survival or puzzles)

I would 100% recommend this game, and would say that it's worth full price. 



I'm a cheapskate so I buy everything on sale. But maybe you're not."
3686,I like the survival. It is well made and not like all the others.
3687,FUN
3688,"Pretty good game from what ive played of it, the survival is very grindy but thats how I like it with games so you have lots to do. Would recommend to anyone who likes games like minecraft survival."

3690,This game allows you to build Literally Anything you want No Questions Asked You can build Cars Boats (Planes if you download a mod) Submarines Robots you name it Anything that you could think of You can do in this game. Not Just build things In the Game you can Also make your own Worlds! and custom tiles For your worlds.  And it looks hard to build in this game Believe me It Really was hard when i first got this game to build But Over time you Will learn i Know you will.  I Guarantee that Anyone that just got this game can build a driving and working car within 4 days.   I Absolutely Guarantee that.

3729,Its full of things to do but the co-op lag is just to much. The lag is insane and almost unplayable sometimes. Its probably not because of the internet because it always lags whoever hosts. If it would be fixed then i would play it mroe often
3730,puuha pate simulaattori/5
3731,i love it
3732,"I like this game but I was a little disappointed that some materials aren't renewable like trees. The funniest thing is that scrap metal is the most renewable resource in the game since you can just destroy some bots for it. It is also a bit of a pain to have to monitor your crops against bots every night. 

Despite that this game has some of the best vehicle creation I've seen in these games. It's pretty easy to learn and simple but you can make some very complex machines. The controller makes for some great smooth transforming contraptions. You can make great machines to mine or process lumbar. The game also has a charming style and I still need to get all the drip in the game. Hopefully they can get regrowing trees so I can make a fully blown lumber and stone mill.

Also tape bots OP and they suck >:("

3765,Love this game. It allows for so much creativity and many wonderful creations. I cannot wait for the new 0.6.0 update.
3766,The game is great! Survival is very good with friends. Creative is probably what I have more fun with because there are no restrictions. Only problem with creative is there is no time. But its great! Go buy it.

Creativity is well awarded, thinking this game would only give me a few good hrs of gameplay, I was very surprised I got so hooked on the game. This game has a lot of possibility and the sky is the limit. Unless they add a way to travel to other planets :D 

If you love making your way by yourself this game is endless, like a sandbox game should."

3791,"Scrap Mechanic, where do I start?
This game used to be my favourite to just mess around in a Sandbox/Creative setting and building ridiculous vehicles.
Now it's nothing like how it used to be.
If anything i'm disappointed now, the new survival aspect of the game has added too many confusing items along with different tiers of confusing materials. I just don't enjoy it anymore, it has changed for the worse in my opinion.
I will still be giving this a positive recommendation although I am unsatisfied I have come to terms with the fact it will never be the same again."

3811,It is a fun game
3812,can I get uhhhh veggie borger with sum woccy milk
3813,"I write this review fully aware this is an unfinished game. In it's current state, this game is unentertaining. Right off the bat, it feels there is nothing to do. you can harvest materials from trees and collect parts from boxes but with no real Direction. you can't craft anything in your inventory, and the initial crafting table is locked behind both a battery and a fire. The in-game helppage focuses so much on building cars that you can't build until you find the battery and even when you unlock the crafting table you can ONLY craft junk car parts. once night falls, you are stuck sitting and waiting for day to come because it is impossible to see anything at night and there is no way to skip night.

To summarize, the crafting and building is terribly undeveloped, the car building mechanic that the game focuses is uninteresting, and basic mechanics like skipping night time or even personal light sources are non existent, and the is no real direction to the game when you first start."

So far so good though"

3874,Great game! Can't wait for future updates.
3875,no but yes
3876,"though the survival aspect could use some love, it shines bright. It hold so much promise and give me a tone of hope. the devs clearly put love into the game and want a lot from it. If they could add the amount of item found in creative to survival and expand on the world a bit it'll be a huge success. I know they have chapter 2 coming out that hold many new features also. so far im loving it and cant get enough of it, i want more! best 20.00 i have spent on steam in a while and highly recommended.. KEEP IN MIND, its early access and a growing game with so much room to expand, give the devs props for the hard work and usage of their own engine."
3877,
3878,Very fun.
3879,yes
3880,AMAZING
3881,"Ah yes, very fine physics indeed. 
After 820 hours, this was worth it"
3882,"Game could be amazing, it has a ton of potential but the devs have not done anything for 6 months and the content is stale. Do to the physics engine the game runs like crap in multiplayer because of the amount of objects the game is constantly calculating. There is no reason to make everything slide, but literally everything slides on the ground, so when you you mine stone the game freaks out over the amount it's calculating. 

I truly like this game a lot, I love all the crazy things you can do with logic gates, timers, controllers, pistons, and bearings, It's truly an amazing game. It just sucks they seem to have given up on it and until they show some sort of effort I can't recommend it."

3888,"Hmmmmm. So hard....

Ive played this for quiet a while now and yes, I've definitely had fun, BUT... How many years has this been in development? Really?

The physics are still shyte. The graphics not much better.

There ARE bugs no matter what people sat, including items missing from inventory.

10 coder team? Really? Then if that IS the case, they are not producing the output I would expect for the time in EA, and I DO know what to expect as I was a coder, working 7 days a week and sleeping for 5 hours a night.

EA doesnt mean ""take the piss"".

You still get a positive review for now because it is fun, but dont TTP. 

I have raft as well and ironically, that feels more ""finished"" up to chapter 2, than this does."

3904,There's nothing really here. I just don't feel compelled to build towards anything for even play it. There's nothing that sets this apart from existing crafting survival etc. games out there.
3905,"Nice game, had fun going through a warehouse with my friend BUT on the other side of things we haven't had a update for a really long time (If it was a different indie dev we probably would have had at least 2-4 updates since 2020 but Really the only update i remember is the survival mode update and maybe the creative mode update)"

3946,"This game is dead. Its been in Early Access since 2016, and has not received a worthwhile update in a very long time.
Would only buy if you find it on sale for a few dollars, and need to fill a couple hours of boredom. Otherwise there are much better games available, many of which are still actively updated.

They like to tease things every once in a while, just to make it look like they are still around, but there has been nothing since mid 2021, and here we are at the end of Feb 2022 with no updates. 

Game seems more like a cash grab. 6(ish) years later and still in Early Access."
3947,you can do what you want
3948,yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
3949,ITS BEEN LIKE 2 YEARS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST RELEASE THE NEXT UPDATE ALREADY......SLOWEST DEVS EVER LMAO

3951,alot better than in silence sam
3952,"the game can be better optimized, but at the time of writing this game is still in beta it just needs a better computer to play and its fun, also my friend gave it to me so I cant be angry at a free game."
3953,game is super fun in multiplayer all i could say is multiplayer is a bit laggy but its fine also survival is fun but it can help if the first farm you plant witch would normally be right beside the spaceship not have raids till you plant 2 times otherwise the game is super fun but in chalenge mode i would like the basic ones easyer that's it good game!
3954,good learnin experince
3955,i love this game shit my pants a couple times too in survival

3995,I would recommend this game to others as it is a long game which is fun to play for a long time.
3996,"the game had a ton of potential, but unfortunately due to lack of dedicated servers i wan unable to fully enjoy that.  I wanted to play with my friends but  that's impractacle when you have to wait on 1 friend in your group to host the save file.  Meaning i would play in  a sperate world and maybe once in a while change instances, i got a refund.  

I will reconsider when dedicated servers are a thing, looks like a bunch of fun just not enough fun for me to buy an extra copy and extra PC to host my own dedicated server... personally dedicated server options should be in every survival craft base building game."
3997,Really fun but new updates on the game is quite slow
3998,this got boring quickly.

4002,mecanich yes
4003,"aside from it having no controller support(i have arthritis, so keyboard and mouse is difficult for me),
then i love it, great for anyone whom loves building things."
4004,its a goood fing game
4005,good
4006,"Been eyeing on this game for so long but never had the urge to actually buy it until a few days ago, at first got mixed feelings about it but now liking it a lot. It's in a way similar to Ark SE, resources are sitting there waiting to be taken quite easily as long as we know where to get it while resources that are required in large quantity have dinoes to help, in here it's in the form of tools, vehicles, also mechanical stuffs, and that's the selling points of the game. 

Vehicles need to be built from scratch, and the parts can be upgraded, not only it's used for moving stuffs, but also for mining and cutting woods by attaching drill heads for stones and metals, and circular saw for trees. It can be made more advanced after understanding the mechanics of each part. 

There are also many mechanical stuffs that are interesting once we get the hang of it. Like making automated watering system for farming, making automated door, it involves sensors, pistons, controller box, etc, just to name a few. People have crazy ideas on Youtube.  

The game world is infested by robots that hate life forms, so everytime we plant crops a countdown timer will appear and they will raid the farm when time is up, defend the farm and harvest it for food for sustaining life in the game. 

The balance of the item economy is good, we always need stuffs to make and gather, once we know where to get them, it will become our second nature where to look. Some items are more scarce than the others and quite important for upgrading or make more advanced stuffs, so that will be the incentive to explore, repetitive but driven by needs.

Lastly, it's a sandbox, so don't expect in depth story, cinematic cutscenes, dialogues and all will be good."
4007,"Bought this to play with my son (7 years old) because he's really into Minecraft but I cant get into it. This is pretty good though. All the engineering aspects make it very interesting and he really likes it too. 

- A lil buggy. My son has gotten stuck in geometry a couple times and I couldn't find a reset option to get him out. So I had to get creative. Using the lift the first time and smacking a metal pole on a bearing the second time to knock him out.

- No map? Maybe I haven't gotten far enough yet but I hope to find a way to use one soon.

- Robots can swim?! Having trouble protecting my food but I'm sure we'll figure sumthin out.

- The first three hours flew by quick. This game is pretty fun."
4008,this game is very complicated. but even with that it is very fun especially the survival mode.
4009,This is an amazing sandbox game with a highly developed lighting and collision engine!
4010,It's a fun game to play
4011,awesome
4012,"Some of my thoughts after playing for a bit.
You‚Äôll want a good computer to run it. Not the fastest triple monitor computer made with love by NASA, but at the very least something classified for medium to high tier games.
There are three main game modes: Creative, challenge, and survival. 
Creative is great for people who like making structures, vehicles, and other contraptions. Plus the in game world editor expands these possibilities. This mode is the core part of the game and is what you are mainly paying for at this time.
Challenge mode is good for puzzles and sharing yours with other people. Think of it like the type of game Portal and Portal 2 are centered around, except with a wider range of possibilities for the creator to effect the player.
Survival is ok. It has grind but not too much. There isn‚Äôt a whole lot of content either at the moment. Mods aren‚Äôt officially integrated into survival, but are easy to set up to expand your experience. If all you want is the pure survival gameplay, I‚Äôd look into it more or wait for it to be fully finalized. 

Also there‚Äôs multiplayer for each mode but I have no friends. I think it‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm not sure.

In summary, it‚Äôs good for an early access but should still be microwaved for another minute before consuming (Mainly survival)."

4081,"The survival mode is incredibly tedious, early game is hugely difficult as a new player. The inability to retrieve your gear after being rounded on by 3-5 farmbots. Means you essentially have to start grinding again. I bought this to build vehicles, and the first 2 hours I built one, it had 3 wheels and was shite. Not a good vehicle to grind ratio.

4135,good

4137,i love every aspect and cant wait for drilling to come out :D
4138,.
4139,"There's a lot of potential that I hope to see honed in future updates, but after a very short time I've been frustrated by getting locked out of one of the main gameplay loops early in my survival campaigns, ie vehicle building. To drive a vehicle you need a seat and to build a seat you need cotton which only grows in certain biomes, after two hours of searching I haven't found a single piece and decided I wasn't going to walk around in circles any longer. Also, why is there no store all / take all or sort button for player inventory and storage containers? It would be a sizable quality of life improvement.
 Overall I wanted to like this game but after a  slow frustrating opening where I was never given a chance to engage in the game's main draw I can say it's not for me but that could be changed with some pretty simple fixes.

EDIT- Discovered the scrap seat is build-able without cotton. Changed my review"

Imagine a more light-hearted version of Imperion with out the space travel.  If you love tinkering as much as my wife does, you'll love Scrap Mechanic.  Totally worth the money.  The only request I have of the devs is that they include a recycle bin for the things we don't need.  Beyond that, you all should be very proud of your work here.  We played raft, loved it. This one is so much better though. Well done :)"

4161,best game EVER but would recommend watching vids first
4162,"Scrap Mechanic is a family friendly game, and has elements of all games that I like; Open World, Survival, Pve, etc.  I have the most gameplay hours in this game, more than any other game I play.  I've bought this game for several friends and a few strangers, just because I like this game so much.  I'm looking forward to the long-awaited next update, Chapter 2, and hope more people buy and play this game too."

4197,yes

4199,good game
4200,"One of the best games I've ever played. It's a sandbox game that allows you to be creative and build whatever. If the base game gets boring, downloading mods will refresh the experience. Survival was a good addition, it adds more of a Minecraft-y feel, but with more tech."

4204,very fun my friend showed me it
4205,"This game is one of the most fun purchases I have ever made. While it has some drawbacks, such as game breaking glitches, those issues can be harnessed to make even more creative creations. I recommend this game to anyone that likes to create cool and sometimes quirky masterpieces. The workshop offers an opportunity to share your creations with the community. I hope these statements helped you make a decision."

4214,pls playing
4215,"I've played this game for 374 hours as of writing this now and want to say I love this game to death BUT I want to talk about some problems I've experienced in my time playing.

first thing i noticed when playing was some blocks like signs and bolts get stuck in the ground in the mechanics station it's mostly a 
problem early game when you have little storage and have to store things on the ground,on a similar note the amount of resources like
circuitry and chemical can be ridiculous and annoying to my immediate knowledge there are only 2 recipes using chemical and every bot drops 
circuitry so you get way more than you may ever need, when it comes to collecting other resources like wood it's a very satisfying process 
to progress in but the large trees seem to fall in whatever direction they want which isn't necessarily a problem but can be very annoying if there's water nearby

resources aside the combat is actually really fun for how simple it is especially in the warehouse where it really matters against the tape bots however
just one slip, wrong move or even a lucky shot will devastate you especially if you are trying to recover or are alone 

all random shit aside the absolute worst issue (which isn't saying much) is a known issue with the physics engine resulting in extreme frame drops occurring when two ""complex 
vehicles"" (with suspension and other moving parts) come too close, in my case the vehicles that cause this problem are the ""Cargo Utility Mechanism"" (c.u.m) and the ""Road Train"" (witch doesn't have a 
funny acronym) jokes aside these vehicles are made for each other literally the Road Train is a multi car vehicle with a bay to park and deploy the c.u.m 
but with the frame drops it is near impossible to use them together which is very important seeing as the road train is my main base and i play alone most of the time so i can't move both

that's all i have for now i may come back to this in the next update so don't be surprised if i change it also thx for reading this is my first Real long review of a game so its kinda bad

4224,"how download mods and get build

4225,It's really good both creative and survival only negative thing for me is that you can't use the lift to spawn creations in survival so please add it and make so you need to put every part and block in the lifts storage or a chest right besides it and then you can spawn the creation because I would love it so much because I'm not that good att building and especially not good at making so it both looks good and works so please add a feature like that
4226,I like the possibility to create anything your imagination think of stuff from real life stuff from fictions and whole lot more. This game is fun and reliable and at first as hard but is easy to catch up fast enough so you DON'T DELETE IT ITS SO MUCH FUN!!!!

4236,"This is a very unique game and I am really enjoying it so far. Positive: It is really cool that you can build anything right from the start and don't have to wait to level up. Find the materials in the world and you can make it straight away. Really like that is supports multiplayer and you can have more than one save. Negative: The ""mechanics"" of building are not that easy to understand and the instructions are there but seem limited compared to what is needed to complete a more complex build etc.
Overall, I am really looking forward to spending more time getting into this game and the huge world it offers. Thanks Devs"

It is mainly because this game is actually super enjoyable to play in fact Boomojaka and I have been playing on survival and also for the fact that I have been playing this game ever since the original creative version is the reason why.

I mainly just can't wait till the next chapter for scrap mechanic survival finally releases that would mean the world to me :)."

4306,"!!!WARNING!!! This game is not ONLY $20! Hidden fees! Although the initial payment is $20 as you play the game you will begin to become enveloped in the game. After you pass 5 hours there is no turning back. The First Stage: You know you have begun the process when you begin to spend hours dreaming of all the possible things you could build. The Second Stage: Now you have passed 10 in-game hours you have made some mediocre builds and you play Scrap Mechanic every other day. The Third Stage: You have passed 50 in-game hours, Scrap Mechanic is now better than life. The Fourth Stage: You have now spent 100 in-game hours and this is a brief pause. You take a week off Scrap Mechanic and step into the sun for the first time in months. The Fifth Stage: You have reached 1,000 in-game hours. During your one week break you started feeling sick and you were unable to remove your thoughts from Scrap Mechanic for longer than 5 minutes and now you have come back with renewed strength and endless builds to make. 11/10 would pay $20 and my soul again."

4323,"I really like this game altough the new update messed with some of my buildings so I'm using older version now
But I like that I can create a big pp and make it fly"
4324,"I spent lots of time on this game last year and loved it. I thought the building aspect was great and worked really well, for the most part. The physics can get glitchy and a bit frustrating, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some further development, and nothing game-breaking. Further, judging from the amazing videos of other people's creations, there's so much possible that I have never even tried to build. But the core of the game, constructing complex machines, was really good and gave me 130 hours of lots of fun, building all sorts of vehicles, crop management machines, etc.

So all in all, a year ago I would've given the game great marks for an early access game with lots of potential. I did feel the survival mode definitely needed more work:
- There was little to no progression in survival gameplay
- There was little variety in enemies
- World feels dead and empty
- It's hard to find your way (no map or compass)
- The grind of getting resources gets worse as the game progresses
- Most importantly, combat is frustrating and not fun (until you get a gun, halfway in the game)
But I was willing to give the devs time to improve these things.

I came back to the game this week after a year and found that the survival mode has not improved in any noticeable way. Now all of a sudden the shortcomings that I found last year seem a lot more significant. That is to say.. the construction part of the game has improved and expanded since then, but all of my critiques of the Survival Mode remain. 

I now think of this game as essentially a sandbox with rudimentary survival elements, which appears to be how the devs see it as well. So if that's what you're looking for, you'll enjoy this game. For me personally, I don't really intend to come back to this game unless the survival mode sees substantial improvements. Perhaps I'll return in a year, try again and update the review. It is still officially in early access after all..

4373,"This game was released 6 years ago and still plays like a tech demo. It is not fleshed out in the least and lacks a lot of even the basic qol that are standard in survival games. Also the devs haven't updated the game since March 2021. I guess that with an update cadence that approaches once a year, it makes sense that the game feels abandoned and underdeveloped for being released in 2016.

"

4376,Mega Mind
4377,good game
4378,"What a fun game.  Get's you thinking and adapting builds and things to play around with.  The warehouses are tense to fight in and is no easy feat.  Especially the top floor (not the roof).  And playing with friends is so much fun and quite hilarious when you strap a switch on a costly jet engine and it flies off into the distance.  Or when you try to build a tank, but it keeps flopping over all the time and you have to beat it with a hammer or use your trusty lift to get it upright.

You can build flying vehicles (aforementioned jet engine), or boats, and of course land vehicles of all kinds.  You can even make mechs if you want!  

It's a ton of fun and looking foward to the big updates the devs have in store for this game. A real hidden gem."

4380,absolutely love playing this game its a lot of fun with friends grinding can sometimes take a while but other than that its great

4384,great game for anyone who likes to build cars/planes/tanks mods many other things get its fun yea! oh and survival be careful of the farm bots
4385,good
4386,The survival mode sucks. But the creative mode is good.
4387,"Scrap mechanic offers a different take on a survival/creative game and in my opinion is an amazing experience with a cartoon based look and block based mechanical system which is simple yet effective and offers a player to build a range of machines. The survival mode has good robots to take on and allows you to progress at your own pace and at a certain point allows the player to get a 'spud gun' which is fun. The game runs smoothly even if you are on a cheaper PC. 

The only real issue i have with the game is that some of the amazing features are currently only in survival, however creative still offers other blocks and mechanics. Other than this, honestly I wish this game was on xbox and playstation aswel because it is so good and its a shame i cant see how it would look with max visuals"

4452,"You can make some pretty cool stuff in this game. Automated farming, defenses, intricate vehicles, whatever you can think of.

Seems to be a really fun game to play with friends, if you're playing solo I recommend to play on easy seeing as all that does it change the damage enemies do to you, easy will cut the damage in half. In MP, other players can revive you on the spot but SP has no such feature.

The physics engine seems to need a bit of work still though. Tried making some super nice adjustible suspension for one of my utility vehicles and the game became unplayable (could only get ~10fps once I tired to drive it haha) once I finished it so I had to scrap it lol, kind of disheartening. 

Some crucial, natural resources also do not respawn. Trees of any variety do not respawn and eventually this will soft lock you from making the higher end materials as you'll run out of embers to make the more durable metals.

There also is not much of a story yet, so outside of base building, farming, unlocking the few weapons they have in the game, you'll exhaust this aspect of the game in due time. 

Would love to see some story progress and make resources respawn please, I know some do but all of them would be great."

4469,"I have almost 200 hours in this game and i recently built a giant bicycle that actually drove, I'm so proud. It's a great game I mostly play creative cuz I think you can do way more cool stuff like build a spaceship, which is actually my project right now. It's a very big spaceship but I only built seats and the very epic doors. Anyway, it's a great game and you should buy it if you like creative games and survival games. I wouldn't buy it if you only like survival because survival gets a bit boring after a while. Dikke vette Peace!"
4470,"Pretty fun game, very expansive with all of the different things you can do. I would rate it a 7.5/10 because there are some bugs but then again, this game is still in early access. That rating will probably go up when the game is fully released with less bugs, more places to explore and more things you can build etc."
4471,PLAY it
4472,"TL;DR:
pros: creative and survival, advanced logic, workshop with mods and blueprints, multiplayer support, easy blueprint share, sandbox like expierience even in survival.

cons: multiple physics glitches(like suspension bouncing), gets very laggy when either 2 builds are next to each other or a huge build is not on a lift or welded to the world. Can also get boring if you run out of ideas on what to build.

Great game. Multiple fun gamemodes, huge community making both awesome builds and amazing mods, simple and advanced logic allowing to create things like cars, trucks, planes, fully automated things and many more! This game supports multiplayer so you can have fun building (or trying to not get killed by robots) with your friends! (there are still sometimes de-synchronization glitches and lags between clients tho but its rare) The physics side of this game isn't optimized the best. If even simple creations (like a car or small plane) touch or just are few blocks away from each other intense lag happens on all clients and worlds can even become destroyed if the creations are complex.
Overall great game! 10/10"

4559,Super bad
4560,It's really fun when you play with other people. For a solo game it's pretty dull and time consuming.

4564,"This is a game about you being a gnome engineer who wanna make stuff, either with no limitations or in a survival world. Minimal story, good amount of progression in the survival world and ton of physics interactions to figure out without it being too complicated. 
Runs really well on my computer but more complex stuff will cause issues when in multiplayer.
You make your own fun here, so don't expect there to be any handholding. For survival just go in and explore everything while figuring out what you can and can't do. Don't be afraid to try shit and do stuff that perhaps dont make sense. Cus... its fun too :D

I challange all to make a car without an engine, to make a car without any conventional wheels, to make a boat that works, to make a plane that kinda works and to make the most efficient way of gathering all the resourses that you can! 

And when ever you stumble, mess up or loose everything cus of bad parking... remember. The fun is in the making. Make more, make better, remake and have fun doing so. x2 with a friend."

4600,"(Note this review was written at 40hours of gameplay and may be updated later) 
Although I have played 40 hours I have yet to experience everything this game has to offer. I really enjoy the mechanics of this game. There is so much you can create in this game making it really enjoyable. I was able  to make a giant truck that i named Big Larry and it is great for  running over robots or hauling a bunch a boxes to the farmers. I am currently trying to make a functional walker like vehicle that can be used for mining, lumber-jacking, and fighting. My current mining rig is okay but i have noticed that vehicles with wheels on uneven terrain make for constant sliding all over the place. Best way to describe this game is it is like Minecraft but with in-depth vehicle construction. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the survival/crafting genre with a focus towards crafting unique vehicles to aid you in farming and exploration than just building a base."

I first thought of this sort of concept after playing Little Big Planet in creative mode and spent dozens of hours making vehicles and cool gadgets. I love chapter 1 survival and really enjoy building contraptions to accomplish the various goals in the game. My only complaint is lack of polish (I was most bothered by vacum pumps not working with fuel containers), but I understand it is a work in progress. I would love to see this game get built into a masterpiece, thank you Axolotl for bringing it into existence."

4641,its not bad it lags a bit
4642,"we played survival first and it's just weird how this game struggles to give you any directions. you really have to read a ""things i wish i had known before playing scrap mechanic""-guide to get a somewhat enjoyable start. for instance we built our first car, just to realize it's worse than walking. was a good laugh though. weirdest thing however was how all items blink and shimmer, except for the only main quest item (the ""master"" battery).. also on our first play we didn't even enter the ship-wreck, where you get a ""logbook"". however the logbook only contains one entry which is: ""go to big wrench building"" and that is the full story of survival (so far).

however i found it pretty addictive. grinding for resources, improving your tools and managing to build a halfway decent mining vehicle from scratch. we even built an automated farm in the end.

the warehouses were a full on disappointment though: the tapebots are the worst enemy in the game because these are ruthless motherfuckers with aimhacks that kill you in two shots (there is no way to craft armor besides building some tank-like vehicle). warehouses are just a few randomly generated floors full of these bots that if they see you first will definitely kill you, meaning you get spawned at the first floor and have to run through the whole building again and again just to find out that there is *nothing* interesting in there. when i made it to the roof i was anticipating some giant robot boss or reward, but there was just nothing. there was some loot room on the last floor from which i got some cosmetics such as a pair of very ugly medical gloves, nice, but that's it. just really, really bland and lifeless. and again: you will die randomly to tapebots that wait around every corner and then swarm you.

progression is slow and you really have to embrace the grind to find survival mode any enjoyable. nonetheless, it's a really good sandbox and personally i liked the grindy. the automation also worked a lot better than in games, such as astroneer and had a lot more to offer."
4643,"The game can get a little grainy when playing multiplayer, but it has definitely improved over the game's existence. It isn't too hard to make cool vehicles, and is very fun to build, and create. I would definitely recommend this game to other people."
4644,eh
4645,"I really like this game. It shows you how to be creative, think outside the box and always find solutions. I liked that you can build anything you want and there are so many possibilities to make crazy, random, or AWESOME things! If anybody sees this review, the money that you pay for this game is TOTALLY worth it, I totally would recommend buying this game, or if you can tell your friends because this is the best game on steam."

4670,"This game has high quality visuals, physics are okay. There are a lot of cool mods and workshop creations.
Survival mode is not complete but still fun to play, but personally play a lot more creative mode. Updates are a bit slow though, but it is still being worked on. The game is built on a custom engine which often times leads to more performance, and it gives more room for optimizations. Game engines like unreal engine or unity are a bit slow and bloated."

Within five minutes of installing and playing the game, i found where to change the controls. But anyways, if you want a game about making anything with multiple gamemodes, play this game. :)"

4683,is sandbox is survival and chalanging this 3 mods is realy fun for yea is a cretion game
4684,"Scrap Mechanic is right off the bat a decent game. There is a survival mode, creative and a new challenge mode. Its not bad.

BUT, there is a workshop feature so that automatically makes it a really great game. It combines a sandbox game with 1x1 blocks and a near infinite number of block types and textures, with the use of mods.

10 out of 10 highly recommended."

4686,"Great game. 
I started playing this game when the only mode was sandbox. now I have seen it evolve and change all for the better.
survival mode is great fun, just started my own world, and while there are a crazy amount of obstacles while getting started, the game still remains fun because of that ever elusive idea that you will someday be able to have the resources to build this 'mega base' of some sorts (at least that was my experience). personally I think survival mode was a great addition to the game because (just like in creative mode) there a lot of obstacles that you have to overcome. And that's what makes the game fun. The satisfaction of completing something you have spent hours thinking about is great and keeps me coming back for more. I can definitely see myself spending more and more time in this game because of survival mode.

Even though I have raved on about how good survival is, I think creative has to still be my favorite mode just because of the endless possibilities this game has to offer. Especially with this games mechanics and features, you can do more than other creative building games.

Scrap mechanic is a very technical game, so with this, the game can do lots and lots of things, but can also be quite hard to pickup and start playing straight away. this can cause some people to loose motivation for playing the game, but once you've come to grips with how to control the game properly, I is very rewarding completing hard tasks. Definitely aimed at a more older, mature audience, just because of how technical it is, so before you play survival, a couple hours in creative is definitely recommended, along with some guides from Steam or Youtube.

So if your wanting a game to scratch your head over, and don't mind doing a bit of thinking to work out your problems, then I cant recommend this game enough. All in all 8/10, solid game. Sometimes It can get a bit framey, when buildings get big, but great fun.
- 9/10"
4687,Amazing game
4688,fun. yes
4689,Big man scrap and Small Man Mechanic.
4690,Very Addictive and fun to play with friends~
4691,Great game. Perfect for those who are creative. Favorit game of all time 100%.
4692,good game
4693,Nothing like what's on the tin and does an EXTREMELY poor job of explaining itself or even basic tasks. Seems like a HUGE waste of time before getting to any of the fun gameplay.
4694,"fun, lots of stuff to create 
build with friends or alone"

4699,"This game is pretty good.
I enjoy the survival mode with the thrilling exploration factor and creative you can just go ham.
The amount of variety and complexity you can add to a machine or structure is incredible with the different motors, logic gates and rockets. (game has explosives so thats another reason)
It also has diverse workshop content and a challenge mode.
reason to why im writing this is 100 hours lol"
4700,"I love everything about this game. I really like satisfactory but i was overwhelmed by the logistical mess i created. This games as good, but better in that you can make vehicles and homes as well as ""smaller"" factories if you want. Still impressive interaction and style. If you want to learn more about a craft you just have to practice, like with minecraft, no tech trees to make it magically happen after you punched a certain number of trees. This games by far the best survival game next to minecraft, grounded and satisfactory, raft. The world is randomly generated using set tiles so its both random and hand crafted which i thought was absolute genius. The result being a very cool world with no weird glitches in the ground and rocks, no world devoid of anything of interest, but always a fresh take when playing a new game. This is my alltime favorite game of all time.
(update) Finally did one of the raids and OMG! Its like rainbow six. The bots can kill you in two shots but you can kill them in two also, or one headshot! Stealth is key and firefights are intense as hell with destructible cover. I never expected such excellence from any developer. They exceed my expectations consistently. Its hard to believe they're planning so much more content!!"
4701,it is good if you try

4709,"It's ok, survival was kinda a let down tough. NGL.
Was pretty goddamn hyped for it but it got boring pretty quick, the progress was way to slow for my liking and food's kinda impossible to get.

Creative's great tough."
4710,  bv
4711,Why do i buy this game?

4732,good game
4733,SO FUN
4734,hee hee
4735,yes.
4736,"First of all, this game is in beta so any reviews you read may not be aware of this. scrap mechanic is extremely fun with a good engineering element to it, but also a good survival and combat element. keep in mind that survival is pretty difficult which caught me off guard. but for a beta game, id reccommend getting this. future updates also look promising."
4737,really good game for free grid building tbh
4738,I like this game because it is a nature game
4739,"The game is quiet unique and a lot of fun, the issue is that it can become quiet complicated and you have to watch a lot of youtube videos to understand certain component, its also a lot more fun in creative mode where you just build random stuff or download stuff from the community to test out rather than farming in the survival world, its also rather annoying to play survival because the food mechanics can be improved in my opinion but over all its definitely a great game to play"
4740,"I love this game so much. i recomend this game so much
to."
4741,"good fun game, very laggy if you built alot of stuff. Would recommend more if they would optimize the game abit more. Still recommend now"
4742,"Ew no, I don't even like it, not even a little...   Now, you may be thinking, ""Well SuperPog, if this game is so bad, why have you played for 133 hours?"" my answer to that is.. well, I have no idea. I guess in the past I enjoyed this game, but dude, it's pretty boring if your not with friends. I wouldn't recommend this game."
4743,Waiting on more of the good stuff. but the base of the game and concept are very well done
4744,it be amazing
4745,"good

4746,Red neck robots vs dumpster divers

4795,good purchase
4796,DONT MOD GAME BREAKS EVERYTHINGS TRASH

4800,Was fun for a while but was/is lacking updates kinda gets boring
4801,it is fun with friends
4802,Great game! Hoping Survival Mode is given more stuff to play in. Excited to see where the devs take this.
4803,"minecraft is the best, but scrap mechanic is my favorite."
4804,is coo
4805,"a bit laggy but super cool 
if you dont have this game GET OUT FROM UNDER THAT ROCK!!!! :>
"
4806,good game
4807,"This is a creative game where you farm, build, and fight or you can go in creative mode and build anything with your hearts desire. You can download mods to add to your game."
4808,"I am not anywhere near making anything cool but im getting there have fun scrappers. I approve
"
4809,Yeh
4810,i like game
4811,"Very addicting!!! Even after 100hrs, I feel like I finished 10% of the game"
4812,"After a while of using the game it just bugged out and the fullscreen could not be reversed but it wasnt regular fullscreen, no it was to the point where i could only see a tree in the main menu
"
4813,very cool game! good to play with friends.
4814,it is a game that allows you to be as creative as you want. I love it. ten out of ten.
4815,"I would recommend this game to others. The mechanics are through out, and the game play flows well. Farming materials in survival seems slow at first until you discover how to build machines to make your life easier. The process is rewarding as you discover new ways to build mechanisms with different things you find in your journey. The multiplayer works well for a game that processes large physics equations on player made vehicles. From what I've read in the Dev blog this is being worked on, which is great to see for a early access game."
4816,fairly cool game
4817,Its minecraft but better
4818,"I love this game, it's incredibly addicting with friends. I'm a newbie gamer and I found this to be a perfect balance of challenging/fun and wholesome/stressful. For not even being fully released the mechanics and gameplay are amazing. I'm no expert, but after watching YouTubers play games for 4+ years I've never seen some of these concepts before. Worth every penny and highly recommended."
4819,"Fun game to play with your family or friends. It's a type of Kids Cartoon game. You can farm, destroy, build, and shoot potato's at robots. I give it a 10 star review!"
4820,i have made more nukes than the US and China combined
4821,"Extremely fun game, you lose track of how long you are playing and eventually your computer shuts off and you finally see that you have survived nuclear war while trying to find what the issue in your 50 floor elevator is"
4822,"I love this game, the amount of things you can do in this game is unlimited"
4823,"cool
"
4824,"I have always been wanting this game, and now that i got it, it feels like a great dream. HIGHLY recommend"

4830,Perfect Multiplayer and Singleplayer game!
4831,"ITS FUN
"
4832,i love this game and the endless amount of things you can do but in survival mode i wish you could obtain other parts from bots. for example if you kill a farmbot you should get its poison gun for yourself or something. but overall its a great game
4833,I never thought I'd like a tower defense mechanic. This is an awesome game.
4834,amongus
4835,it is realy fun
4836,55 of these hours was just building a car that doesn't flip when I turn... I highly recommend this game.
4837,Fun survival game - not overly challenging.    Still investigating.....

4846,banging game tbh
4847,"Survival mode makes it a lot more enjoyable vs a straight up engineering game.  It adds some food and water stressors while trying to solve all the engineer problems.  Graphics are middle of the road, performance is good on a high end machine as expected, block mechanics for building are a little limiting but still fun.  Recommend also to play with kids to teach engineering principles, they love learning about all the mechanics involved."
4848,DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS. JUST DO IT! 10/10 would buy again.
4849,I LOVE THE CREATIVITY
4850,it is a very good game but it has it's glitches thought but that is expected too but that gives it charicters
4851,"One of the best games I have ever played, I love this game mainly because I like sandbox with (Realistic) physics engines, I have become quite evolved with this game. I haven played it recently because I have lost a little interest whilst waiting for the under ground update."
4852,dse
4853,i lik gaem :)
4854,omg gooooooooood gane
4855,Yes
4856,"Scrap Mechanic is a good game and i recommend it to people who love building, farming and survival games because this game has all of those you can build cars which i enjoy i love how easy it can be to play it but i don`t like it how hard its to get component kits which are used to upgrade your engines, seats, pistons and the craft bot that`s used to make some goodies which is really only needed in survival mode and in survival mode you can unlock new clothing by making a dress bot using garment boxes that come in 3 tiers Common, Rare and Epic. I enjoy this game very much and i very much do recommend it to others"
4857,very fun and educational game would recommend
4858,very fun
4859,spent 7 hours making a car that didnt work

4872,200 hours in and my car still broken
4873,Its fun. Survival isnt too hard but you need to understand the games mechanics.
4874,very fun
4875,"Fun! Creative is nice to come up with designs, while Survival is better for exploring."
4876,"This game is just not fun if you dont have any friends to play with. *ahem* me. If you have friends, get it because this could be an enjoyable experience with friends. There are a lot of fun things in this game. The art style in here is just great and original. Just couldn't cut it for singleplayer. (I have friends just they dont have the game)"
4877,"Fun game easily breakable sadly, I hope future updates improve game stability"
4878,"-Lots of bugs 
-Always losing stuff for no reason 
-I Enter a building for 30 second and the car i been building for 4 hours just disappears
-Yesterday me and my friends were playing for 10 hours straight ans nothing saved we connected the day after and no 
 progress saved so we lost everything!!!!!!!!!!!
-Even if you do the best suspension setup for your car 2 wishbones and everything when you turn the wheels it will act like 
 they going to destroy like bouncing and lots of camber for no reason  
 -Almost impossible to find coton we found a few after driving for more than 2 hours !!!

The game have a lot of potential but a lot of things absolutely need to be fixed because its not playable like this i dont even want to play because i know im gonna lose a lot of important and time consuming stuff!"
4879,This is the best game to learn about engineering and it helps to express creativity
4880,this game is very fun
4881,Creative and really fun.
4882,good
4883,"I found it fun.... but it wasn't very friendly in survivor mode.  I had no idea what to do for food, except for get milk by feeding the ""cows"" (Woks) corn from the field.   This was very slow to build up food, but quick to build up fluid.   However, you quickly start to die when you have no food.  I found this part of the game to be stupid. I wish it was more like Craftopia where you lose life slowly, to give you time to gather more food.  I died from lack of food!   Don't know if I'll continue playing survivor mode."
4884,First 12 hours in. Would spend time writing a review but I want to play now
4885,"great game, should play"
4886,"good
"
4887,Super game!!!
4888,"Scrap mechanic is an amazing game.

For survival it does take a while before you can let your creative spirit free. But being an actual scrap mechanic and using salvage and simple materials such as wood to build vehicles is it's own fun too.

For the creative side you are only limited by your creativity and you can create anything you can think. I would definitively recommend this game if you like to play survival or creative games. 

Fair warning is that this game has slow development because it's being made from the ground up in its own engine. And it is worked on by a small (but wonderfull) Team.
The Survival side of the game can also be very grindy at times."

4895,"I just wanted to say that in it's current state, I cannot recommend this game. It just doesn't have enough content to enjoy."
4896,If you have a good imagination and patience then you would love this game.
4897,what i like about this game is the game is not only challanging but it is fun at the same time you can be as creative as you want

4949,"Didn't think much of it when I first bought it, just thought it'd be another crafting and survival game.
But damn is this addicting.

Build tons of things, from cars, to forts, to auto farms, to giant saw walls.
Very time consuming and a bit grindy to get materials for things, as with all crafting survival games though.

Right now the only things I would suggest is either a dodge or block for your character when you just have the hammer. Trying to play regular solo or even exploring by yourself on regular is very hard without a spud again and you will die, alot.
Only way to really avoid getting hit right now is to just run circles and spam jump around the bots, unless its a bot with a spud gun, then prepare to be annihilated.
Obviously once you get the spud gun and a decent amount of ammo, things become way easier. But be prepared to struggle until then."
4950,"50 bomb amogogs

4951,BUT ONLINE SUCKS BECAUSE U HOST FROM YOUR HOME AND YOUR FRIEND LAG AF
4952,"6/10 Not bad not good falls short on the this genera of game Not worth it unless you find it on sale for 7 bux or so

It feels like it could have great potential but its really limited compared to most tittles of the vehicle building / mechanic genera.  Lacks content and enemy plurality and grindy in a boring way combat is either kite walking backwards with hammer run onto an obstacle and die or point and shoot until thing dead or you run out of ammo. Survival feels really underbaked and boring.  Creative lets you fuck around with the parts and physics but again not as many parts to mess with as simmilar games in the genera and enemys are not very reponsive to them.
Overall verdict. Feels like a boring and much worse version of space engineers aimed towards kids, It offers way less features then the average game of the associated genera.  Frankly it is probably really fun if you are a kid and want to play with crazy engineering thingies and make babies first crazy contraptions."

4965,Best game ever super fun creative mode fun farming fun sandbox epic so cool pls buy it is to good gun go pew pew and u get gun by selling food les go eprogame21 pro gamer moment yessir yessir YESSIR (No but legit i think this game is a really good game. It is super fun and calming when your not fighting bots. But when you fight bots its pretty stressful. as you can see in the trailer if you plant to many crops a hard raid like that would happen. Also warehouses are pretty hard to get through. But the rewards you get from the warehouse is 100% worth it. Thanks for reading!
4966,i good
4967,yes
4968,"Good game, I play it with one of my friends and we just play creative all the time. Sometimes multiplayer doesn't like our creations but that's fine."
4969,very funny

4971,have fun
4972,gud gam
4973,"its a goof game some very annoying concept that if they were or werent intended need to be fixed. but if they fix those then the game is a very simplistic game other than the building. It can get real complex but thats the fun part of it to see what kind of crazy stuff you can come up with
"
4974,Please for all god add a day and night cycle to creative mode or at least and option
4975,"This game is one of the best games of its genre, an absolute blast to play with friends!"

4993,"""How to play"" tells you how to build a car.
To build a car you need to survive.
To survive you need food.
""How to play"" food ""Coming soon..."".
Food cannot be found.
Food must be grown.
Need soil.
To obtain soil ""coming soon...""

Waste 1 hour looking for food/soil only to find out map has none, and I need to create a new world to get soil.
I know its EA and all, but in any survival, knowing how to fill thirst/hunger is essential."
4994,fun building game.

5009,its ok
5010,"it's an awesome sandbox you can do and build anything you want from a simple boat to flying cars to airplanes  that can stop and start mid-air, but it still has a challenge aspect to it, to survive you need food but when you plant plants, robots plan a midnight raid so you better defend those crops ether with a trusty hammer and a gun or with a complex defense system that crushes the bots. just don't forget, almost anything is possible in this game, and don't forget to explore, other wise, progress will slow down to a halt."

5015,"So.... after playing this game for a good year now (over 1000hrs) and eventually moving on to other newer games i come back and check on this sometimes and this game is still technically described as ""under development"", the dev's have been promising chapter 2 for so long the games gonna be dirt old before it comes out with no fan base.. im supprised scrapman and kahn are still making videos.. 
i did try playing with mods for a while like FANT but the devs decide to update it just enough and often enough that it crashes and deletes objects so next time you load into game half you structure is missing, way to kill the only thing thats actualy updating your game and making it funner since chapter 2 was promised damn near since i started.. 
Jerrys ""Final Thought""... if your gona label it as still in development then you might want to actualy Fing develope something.. I BOOO this game like Bob Saget Booo's Dave Chapelle for being addicted to weed.."

5087,survival
5088,its pretty sick but better with friends
5089,Only like creative but the potatos better be from idaho 9/10 kinda glitchy.
5090,"The game is good for those of you who are adventurous and curious. When you are bored this is a good game to play. It makes it even more fun when you have friends to play with. It was well worth the 25$ I spent on it and that was still when it was in early beta. I was pumped for survival mode when it was supposed to come out but it kept getting pushed back. Instead they gave us challenges. I played this gamemode for a couple of hours and decided I still liked creative better. It was probably 1 to 2 years later when survival came out and when it did, you better believe I started playing it. I first played with my friend and got pretty far, but then he got bored and quit. I kept playing for a little bit, but it got boring too. I recommend playing survival mode with a friend, otherwise it will get very boring. Overall creative is the best when you are playing solo. All in all this game was absolutly amazing."
5091,no

5093,good game would play
5094,"Very fun, much wow

5095,fun game
5096,YES
5097,"absolute trash, expects you to know everything about its complicated and strange mechanics that dont make sense including the fact that you can't drink water or eat corn. Ingame tutorial/guide is utterly useless. Of course I could just search for external guides but uninstalling and refunding is easier."
5098,"I saw this game a super long time ago but just recently saw that the survival mode was out,a little buggy at times but a great game if you like farming and base building alone or with friends. This is also a good game for people with a lower end GPU (I have a 1060 3gb and it runs great)."
5099,"Nope. Just nope. The building system is interesting, nut everything else is either bare bones, none-existant, or lazy made, like the same map assets repeated ad-nauseum, having nothing to do, and having a total of only a couple of recipes in the game. Progress in the development? Very little to show in 2 years. The ""Very/Overwelmingly Positive"" reviews are puzzling. I guess the game makes a good impact when you first enter it. But if you actually try to play it for more than 30 minutes, there's nothing there."
5100,"very very fun if you are creative and like to billd (I know I don't know how to spell very well) This is your game:)

5123,this a good gaem u can build stuff
5124,"This is a great open world crafting game. With the ability to create buildings, boats, car and a lot more. I would suggest running this game with recommended spec. Also if you are lagging weld your movable creations(car, boat) to the ground. 

game is fun with or without mods. However mods do add a lot to the game.

Would be great if they had dedicated servers...."
5125,potato gun go brrrrrrrrrrrr
5126,Best Building / Creative Game Ever!
5127,I'm not even good at this but it's still really fun
5128,"I think that this game is fun and I would recommend it for a good 40 hours. Eventually it becomes easy to loose interest. Part of what made me stop playing it is that the farming in survival mode at least, was governed by silly game rules that are not explained to the player at all. One can only have small crops scattered all over that can not be protected from the wondering enemies reasonably.  I also think the game has potential that it never quite achieves."
5129,issa very cool

5160,"Scrap Mechanic: Survival is a game I want to love but ultimately it falls massively short from delivering a compelling survival game experience. It has the making of a great survival game, a pleasant stylized graphic style, the hint of a cool story, awesome building mechanics, it‚Äôs amazingly polished but ultimately fails from its lack of content, world-building, game design and quality of life features. It just leaves you wondering why the developers released it in this state. 

Here‚Äôs the problem in detail:

Story: Wow, what a wonderful basis for an engaging story. It‚Äôs like the developers were told they needed a great story, wrote a synopsis but failed to actually include the story within their game. They tease you with the idea of one, but never deliver. 

Empty, repetitive world: The lack of real world-building also extends from story to the actual world. There are literally only 4 mobs. That‚Äôs right. Four. Repeated ad nauseum until you want to just log off and do something less boring and tedious. There really aren't even many friendly mobs, two or three? The world does not feel alive because somehow only the cows and some glowing fish things survived. No birds, dogs, cats, etc. Just cows and one type of fish. That's it. The same goes for the map. You can see it in the world builder they provide, it‚Äôs a system of repetitive landscapes that confuse you into frustration.

It‚Äôs like Axolot built the skeleton of a great survival game but didn‚Äôt care to put any of the things that make one great and that extends down to common quality of life things like‚Ä¶oh, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶the freaking UI. You can‚Äôt change key binds. Well that‚Äôs not entirely true, you can change them if you want to dig into your file structure and edit the json file and find the key codes to rebind your keys. Sure, that sounds like fun. And that's something the average user really wants to do! No, they really don't.

There isn‚Äôt a map. No map. No compass. No way to tell where the f*@k you are in this repetitive landscape unless you drop down bread crumps. You can't use the landscape to tell where you are, because that landscape feature or marker is repeated over and over on the map! It's a nightmare landscape of the same crap. Good luck finding your way home, kid!

There are THREE recipes. So Axolot built a game with farming at the core and you have THREE recipes. And those recipes do two things. One revives another player. The other two merely fill your cores up. That‚Äôs it. No buffs -- no depth at all. Again, they said to themselves ‚ÄúHey a good survival game has recipes‚Äù, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make three‚Äù. ‚ÄúPerfect!‚Äù Not so much.

There is one melee weapon and three ranged weapons. And zero item progression in any of them. Do you see a pattern here? No armor, no buffs to weapons, no way to progress in any way other than building better more advanced objects and even that is limited. The lack of real progression is just the fetid icing on the cake to an otherwise vacuous experience.

Finally, want to play this with friends? Sure you can do that. Want a persistent multiplayer experience? Again, it‚Äôs possible with some stupid work arounds. I don‚Äôt understand the logic to build a multiplayer survival game, but not let your user base set up a persistent server. It makes zero sense. You can‚Äôt make a game based on grinding and expect your user base to only play when one player brings them together. It‚Äôs an antiquated and thoughtless design decision. Like every other decision here, it seems designed to fail. 

If you want to build cool vehicles and other experimental oddities. It‚Äôs awesome. Buy it. In that respect the game is polished and brilliant. There you are only limited by your creativity. And you would think that would be the case for a game that has been in early access for FIVE years.

If you want about 10 hours of a survival demo with friends, sure, buy it on sale and be prepared to be bored and frustrated when you realize it is only the promise of a survival game. I had almost 20 hours of a light hearted, fun experience with a friend. And then we wanted to kill one another to spare us from the nightmare hell that is this empty, copy paste world. We couldn't kill one another sadly, so we sat on a rock and starved to death because who wants to eat another Pizza or Veggie Burger?

You aren‚Äôt going to find a deep survival game experience that will keep you busy for thousands of hours‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not here. And it doesn‚Äôt look like it ever will be nor ever was intended to be. The ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù tag, seems to be added on to get sales not to actually make a compelling, long lasting survival experience. Too bad, too. It would be very unique and very fun if Axolot actually put the effort into it."
5161,This was a very nice Christmas present!  I'm glad I got a head start watching neebsgaming play this.  The robots do not appreciate you farming so be prepared for a fight every night.  It's relaxing and fun.
5162,Wanna build a plane/boat/car that barely drives. Doesn't turn. And uses rocket engines for 2/3 of those thing. Well you got it. You can also shoot potato's at robotsüòÄ

5169,"I love this game its not only a really cool physics based sandbox but with the new survival mode it is one of if not my favorite game. If i could 6/5 stars.
For such a simple game it is super fun.
My only complaint is that is it simple and i wish there where more parts to play with but that will be changed in future updates as more parts will be added to the game.(hopefully)"

5184,I love this game. Its a fun creative building game that has some humor to it.
5185,"A fantastic game. Before i got my computer, i would watch Youtubers playing this game and dream of the day i could do the same. When i got a computer this was one of the first games i bought and i have never regretted it whatsoever. I remember building my first car, building a rocket-platform-ship-thingy and just messing around with the physics. The graphics are surprisingly beautiful and for ¬£15 (¬£10 on sale just now) this game is very worth it. Creative mode is great for those who like to build and design without restriction. Survival mode is good for those who like, well, survival games. I highly recommend you try this game out, you might just find yourself hooked."

5202,i have played this game for 110 hours and personally i would recommend it. Out of all of those hours i haven't ran into a single bug or major glitch. Sometimes i get mad but once u get the thing your making to work it feels good. So if you were unsure about buying it then take my advise... BUY IT!

Might give it another go when there's more content/on release."
5215,From the time I have played i would say this game is fun from the perfect balance of grind and goofy fun not like other games with repetitive quest *fallout* overall the game is a 10/10

5268,"Scrap Mechanic is a perfect game to get into building stuff, you can build cars, transformers, and even creepy basements! I will list some pros and cons here:

Pros:

You can save your creations once you've built them.

There is easy access to mods, just download a mod from the workshop and turn it on in the mod manager, although some mods so have to be installed manually.

Good weight simulation

Graphics and physics quality can be changed for lower power computers

Multiplayer is easily accessible

Cons:

Glitchy physics in multiplayer

No in-game tutorial (yet)

Very laggy when two large objects collide

And a lot more stuff..


Anyways, even though there is a looot of bugs, this game is still too fun for the bugs to ruin it!

"
5269,"great game , even better with mods"
5270,"looks like the devs totally forgot about monitor resolutions , not recommended for old monitors , mine is 1024x768 sadly"
5271,nice
5272,1000 out of a 1000 it is a great game i recommend to every one that comes across it
5273,very cool
5274,fun and easy controlls while being challanging enough to make you use your brain and not sit there with nothing to do.
5275,The physics and survival mode are on point. Very swanky game indeed.
5276,i think this is a good game
5277,They seriously need to rework the hunger and thirst system. Cant explore anything if I have to keep staying at base guarding the garden.
5278,more like crap mechanic
5279,more like crap mechanic
5280,"This game is frankly a mixed bag. It's a laggy mess with glitches everywhere, from suspension on bearings rotating the entire vehicle, to clipping through the world floor. And I love it.

There are a variety of parts and blocks, and each one is uniquely shaped and textured respectively. The blocks are what your builds will usually be mostly comprised of. They each have different stats (weight, durability, friction and buoyancy) that shape how said block interacts with the world. Some are easily breakable, but very light. Some are buoyant, and some are great for vehicles made to slide. With each build you want to make, you have to choose the right tool for the job. The parts are mostly just decoration, but they can really shape your builds. The interactive parts are the real main feature of this game. They control your vehicle, literally. Each one has a distinct purpose, but you could be an absolute madlad that could use a combination of the three main ""control"" parts (engines, controllers, and pistons) to make the other. It's a whole creative process, and I love it. Even if you aren't doing that, there are countless ""bugs"" that shape your gameplay experience. Some bugs can be game destroying, but not in Scrap Mechanic. No, they can actually be quite helpful. Remember the glitches I mentioned above? They can be very useful. The first one can help you create controls for flying vehicles. The latter allows you to get little bits of rock that get stuck under terrain after mining in Survival mode.

Survival mode is quite fun, but the grind is kind of annoying. The one thing you always need but can never automate getting is the glue clams. The other thing I hate about Survival mode is the warehouses, specifically, the enemies you fight in them, the two Tapebot classes. The first one, the blue, normal Tapebots, are glass cannons. They deal the most damage out of any bot class, are insanely accurate, ranged enemies, and can two shot you. This is a problem because they are ranged enemies in an enclosed area. There can also be large groups of them. I went into a room in a warehouse once with a couple of friends (it was also really laggy in multiplayer) and all three of us got mowed down. There were five or six of them in there at one time, and they had the high ground. We couldn't even shoot back, that was how fast it was. My proposal that would fix this is making them do forty or so damage, and making them a consistent two shots. When fighting a Tapebot, it's always whoever gets the first shot off is the winner. This just makes them unfun to fight. When they get the first shot, they feel really op, but if you get it, they feel kind of easy to kill.

Overall, Scrap Mechanic has quite a lot of potential, but I must say I prefer the Creative mode over the Survival mode. 7.5/10, pretty good, but there's a lot of balancing and automation aspects that need to be adressed and optimization to be done. There's also a lot of untapped potential. This could be a great game, we just have to wait and see. Also, I didn't even talk about the modding potential in this review. I will update this later to reflect that potential.

Edit: Something I forgot to mention was the PC requirements. You need a pretty high-end PC to play this game, it's very laggy. Also, the modding potential for this game is virtually unlimited. I've not made a mod myself, but I've seen a wide variety of mods, adding many useful parts for decoration, adding blocks, or just straight-up QoL features."
5281,"awesome game
"
5282,Scrap Mechanic is a highly enjoyable game if you enjoy making terrible cars or terrible rocket machines
5283,so fun
5284,"Im sorry but this game is kinda trash... i enjoy the building aspect and it has some positives for sure but let me give you some advice Axolot, if your gonna add a weakass combat system to the game, AT MINIMUM you need to add block and lets not have robots perma aggro you nonstop to where anytime you travel away from your based to an important location, you just swarmed, then get to spend time trying to get you shit back just to die over and over and over cuz again they just keep aggro"
5285,yes

You will be slaughtered by tapebots over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. 

Other than that, it is a really fun game to play!"

5299,"This is a wonderful game.
But the dev team is absolutely horrible.. the game needs more content, and they are ''working on it'', since the beginning of time.
Don't get the game at least till chapter 2 is released.

Edit: Also I forgot to mention this, but the more you play, the laggier it becomes.. after you have one or two complex creations, the game starts dying. This is not much of a problem if you are playing alone or with a friend, but once there are 3 or 4 people in the server, the FPS die.
Better wait for chapter 2 for that reason as well, since they're supposedly working to fix that problem."

5302,"the game is pretty good but i think that it could 100% be improved by adding some sort of ending for the survival mode seeing as after a while of playing, it becomes boring because there are limited thing to do in the late game. overall i give this game a 7/10, its fun to play solo but even better with friends and in my opinion its worth the price"

5317,build thing. fun.
5318,"I would totally recommend this game because there is so much to explore in this game like, the map in general, vehicles, farming, and different robots! Starting this game might be a little hard but once you get locations found for resources and game progression, you will start to progress and find new and cool things to explore! There is still more! If you don't feel like exploration and having to worry about the three main stats hunger, thirst, and health and all you want to do is build then they even have a game mode just for creating things called creative (most games have this though :P). But, say you are getting bored of just seeing vehicles that don't work or just don't look, there are so many talented creators putting things on the Steam workshop worth checking out! But, if you feel that you are good and big brain enough about this game there are many challenges in the challenge mode for you to do. In conclusion, Scrap Mechanic is a very fun and creative game. Plus, there is still more features coming to the game!"

5348,i dont really know what to say about this game other than its definetively worth buying
5349,best game ever but can lagg alot and is unespectivly good
5350,"So far...brilliant...if buggy and basic. 

As far as survival goes, it's bog standard and even dated, basic eat a bit of food and you're good kinda deal, the crafting however, well that's where it differs from other survival games. Realistically you won't really be building a base early, you'll start off with some sort of car to travel and collect materials with before stockpiling and then maybe building some form of compound.

The combat is dated...hold mouse button, be close to enemy and hope you kill it before it kills you, ranged combat is all but impossible until you progress quite far into the game (at least that is my experience) and the melee combat gets stale asf after the first 50 enemies so be prepared to grind that out.

Multiplayer is crap in honesty, it's buggy, crashes too often and is not how i would recommend first experiencing this game, not to mention the game world is quite small and just a few player built vehicles will lag and crash you out.

The physics in the game are good if annoying at times and can make building projects feel amazing when done right...and tedious when done wrong, there is a learning curve when creating machines from scratch so doing some research first hand is recommended.

Overall...it's a good game for what it is and charming for it's genre...I wouldn't have bought this game knowing the lack of attention it has and how trash the multiplayer experience is but it's fun and worth a buy if it's on like a 90% sale."
5351,"This of one of the best sandbox games I have ever had the pleasure of expiriencing. My only problem with it is the lag can get very intensive at times. Other than that, it is more than your moneys worth."

5363,"If you want a multiplayer experience do not play this game , multiplayer requires so much internet that it's near impossible to move without teleporting back to where you were. Single player is fine though but not as fun without a friend.

Edit: Forgot to mention that most lag occurs when the world has existed for a while."

5390,"Holy shit, 5 hours in. I'm absolutely addicted. Its a perfect game to test your creativity! I love the survival mode, love trying the challenges, and just making what ever I want in Sandbox mode is basically a dream. I really hope I make friends, or get friends to play this because multiplayer seems like a blast. I'm going to miss these moments where I'm learning the games basics. That is usually the best part to the game! Highly recommended!"
5391,ffffffffffff
5392,"While it doesn't necessarily add anything especially new to the survival formula, Scrap Mechanic takes existing gameplay mechanics (automation, construction, and exploration) and perfects it. It starts off slow as you don't really know what to do or how to do it, but once you get the hang of it, the game becomes a non-stop thrill ride of self-made challenges and creation. The possibilities with the tools this game presents are limitless and the game doesn't force you to do anything you don't want to. This gives you both the potential for anything and the ability to engage with that potential in the way and at the pace you feel like. Every time my friends and I are on, we are all showing off the cool new vehicles we've invented and talking about the crazy places we've explored.

Note: My experience has been primarily playing in a multiplayer survival world with my friends."

5401,"Sure, some of the game may be unrealistic, but yet, this game is decently realistic when it comes to building and it's wide variety of blocks and possibilities. Scrap Mechanic is worth the $30 in my opinion. Back when I had a low spec laptop the game was fairly playable, so, you really don't need a great computer to run this game! Currently with my 128.2 hours of Play Time, the game is very enjoyable. I recommend playing the game with a friend, just makes the game tad more fun when it comes to survival. Keep up the great work Dev's! Can't wait for Survival Chapter 2 as well! Hope this helped some of y'all with thinking about buying the game."

5456,yes
5457,"a good game for anyone who likes to create planes, cars, boats etc 
the survival is also a amazing way to have a good survival experience and the sandbox togther.
well worth the ¬£15"
5458,"I've only tried 2 of the 3 play modes: creative and survival. Creative was fun for a bit and good training for the mechanics, but long term didn't hold interest for me. I've enjoyed survival more. It kind of throw you into the sand box out the gate, teaching you how to feed yourself but nothing else."
5459,good
5460,Very Fun
5461,"Currently Really Enjoying Scrap Mechanic Survival, Some Great Builds On The Workshop. Multiplayer Is A Bit Hit Or Miss, Sometimes Works Great, Other Not So Much. Would Have Liked To Get Through The Tutorial A Bit Quicker And Would Like To See More Cotton Around Spawn. 9/10"
5462,yes
5463,"A machine-building game with superb detail and obvious high-effort put into the game, and is still getting updates."
5464,ONE OF THE BEST GAME EVER !!! <3 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!
5465,Machine gun go BBRRRRR
5466,"This is a hard one. TL;DR - Building and mechanics are A1. Survival mode is hot garbage.

IF you are a solo player -  THIS GAME WILL BE A FRUSTRATING PITA AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE FUN.

The mechanical and creative freedom aspects of this game are fantastic. Really in a class of its own. It causes you to think outside the box in how to solve certain problems and it is really fun as a result.

HOWEVER, the above is squandered by how abysmal the survival mode is. Seriously, your character has a bottomless stomach and food really is a challenge to get a consistent source of. Its hard enough to get a decent farm going - its even worse when said farm is constantly attacked by robots.

That's right. When you grow crops, depending on how many crops you grow, your farm will be attacked. The solution? Grow less crops in spread out areas. Is it just me, or does the fact that THIS is the easiest solution to the problem not tell you that there's something wrong with the mechanic itself?? I pretty much have to cheese the farm detection function of the game because its such a pain in the ass that its not worth dealing with as designed. Fan-tastic.

"
5467,quite fun but a bit grindy
5468,"Very good, it is very good, out of ten I rate twenty."
5469,"I Like to Build car that break everytime...

 I LOVE SCRAP MECHANIC!"
5470,"Game is a blast but suffers from long unsolved glitches. I play multiplayer with my kids and we have a great time hunting for scrap and defending our farms. Oddly, after being out for such a long time common bugs like holes in object collision models have not been remedied. After grinding hours to get all the parts, I built my dream truck and it handled the environment with ease. Without warning the vehicle began to jitter and the attachments to the bearings were no longer solid, but wobbly, leaving my cool ride an unstable mess. A bit or reading shows this is an ongoing issue that has persisted for years without resolution.  The only solution I can see is starting a new world, but without a clue how the bug started, I'll probably just shelve the game and play something else.  Sad, because as a Raft player I was becoming loyal to the Axolot line and would have bought their upcoming games without question. Now I'll have more that a few."

5543,"so much fun but quite grindy, if u like grindy games mixed with some creativity, building, looting and sprinkled with a bit of combat this is definitly the game for you. one thing tho is that the physics can once in a while be a bit janky when driving but other than that, this is a really great game! i highly recomend it"

I go in, there is not intro, no story, just me next to a crashed ship. Ok... what am I doing? Where do I go? How do I get a better weapon so the robots aren't kicking my butt all the time?? Nothing. Well, ok, that was NOT fun at all.

5649,"I only play survival but so far:

Able to create whatever you can think of, mentally fun kind of game.

Still rough around the edges- there is no hand-holding here, and interested to see the updates that come to the end game.

I think about base defense, new modes of defensible transport etc even when I'm not playing. I got the itch."
5650,very fun game fysics kinda broken but that just makes it more fun to play
5651,god game
5652,Highly recommended!
5653,the best game ever
5654,this game is great the creativity and freedom it allows you is so nice and the environment  is perfectly suited for almost any type of creation the only things i have a problem with are the damage from enemy to player is a bit high and you can die very fast if you are not careful and there is not a whole lot to do aside from building creations and exploring the games ware houses for more parts/resources but other than that it is a good and and i would recommend it.
5655,"One of my biggest problems with Minecraft is that almost nothing you make can actually move- the best you can do at the moment are loud, bulky machines that slowly float in one dimension.

In scrap mechanic, that isn't an issue anymore. Everything you make has physics unless it is attached to the ground. There are tons of moving parts, and ways to make them move, as well as sensors and logic.

However, it isn't all good. Development on this game is very, very slow. It's a small team working on an ambitious project, and they seem to want to release features in big batches called ""chapters"" instead of releasing them as they are ready.

Overall, I would definitely still recommend. Great game for creative people. Don't let the childish art style put you off, you can make computers, drag racers, and bipedal walkers in this game."
5656,"The only enjoyable survival game with friends that isnt the most dogsh/it difficult experience. 
in my 3-4 Player survival game we had seen the entire map, buildings, trades, warehouses, farms and all of us had a car and spudgun each in less than a week. the game isnt grindy, i dont see what the other reviews talk about.
Other survival games are just for RNG gods and get-top-equipment type of people only, in scrap mechanic you can take your time because there is no horde of overpowered insufferable cannibals hunting you down at night (looking at you the forest) or need to have the second most powered or the most overpowered armor to get out and hunt (looking at you minecraft) you can use your hammer and kill all bots you can see, if you need more, get guns that you can get for just planting food. 
Sure, farm bots require more than your hammer and tape bots too due to their damage but with the amount of crafting possibility i've seen people one shot the farm bot with their inventions.
if you buy this game and think you've seen it all, you can always go to Axolot's second survival game just like this one, Raft, with just as big of a scale as this game and even more. 
Honestly, this game is fantastic and i think its the only survival game that is entertaining. Congrats Axolot, you did a great job."

great game gotta love it"
5678,you can build cars!!!!!
5679,good game
5680,"[h1]Great, but co-op is largely unplayable[/h1]

You can build some truly awesome contraptions in this game. Cars, airplanes, rockets, boats, cow launching trebuchets, robot sarlacc pits...you name it. The game does an excellent job in enabling the player to explore the depths of his or her creativity. I am dozens of hours in and still brimming with unimplemented concepts and ideas of which I have barely scratched the surface.

Unfortunately, this cannot be said for the game's co-op survival mode . It will not take much. Maybe a couple of basic vehicles and a small base. When it hits, though, you'll know it. It's the lag of doom, and it will eventually make the game unplayable for everyone but the host.

This is certainly not a big deal if you intend to play survival mode by yourself, but if you intend to play survival mode with friends then I would highly recommend waiting to purchase the game. I am currently in the latter category and am thus in a holding pattern until the issues are addressed.

But definitely add the game to your wishlist if you do intend to pass on it today. I have no doubt that the game will be awesome once the lag is tackled. It is definitely a game my friends and I are eager to pick up again."
5681,Good buildingg game! Good job!
5682,"[quote=Blue Oni] Score: S
If you like building random stuff complex or simple, this is the game for you plus there's a survival mode. Game really reminds me of LittleBigPlanet creative mode, so much possibilties with the tools they give you.

This is a great game to play with friends because there's a little bit of everything for everyone who likes survival games, whether you're a builder/designer, stronghold fortifier, or material collector - this game is for you."
5684,yes
5685,car
5686,I've been playing on and off since 2016 and the game has evolved nicely. I'm excited for the game's future and I definitely recommend giving it a try.
5687,good for commiting warcrimes
5688,"Good game, fun to mess around with the physics."
5689,it has rtx on and the game has easy
5690,fun
5691,good
5692,not bad
5693,"Awesome game with (rare but) awesome updates. It's the most fun played with friends. If the players could shape the environment like in Minecraft and with a pseudo-infinite procedurally-generated map, it could very easily replace Minecraft as the most-bought PC game."
5694,good
5695,Really fun
5696,"Pretty fun game. Updates are slow to come, but are worth the wait. Doesn't require a strong GPU."
5697,"I don't have a lot of time on this game and I've only played a few times, however; I first purchased this game when it had only just been released, early-stage development.

After playing this game and watching the progress so far, as well as the optimisation, graphics, utilities and sandbox tools/building focus, it is probably going to leave an imprint on all these other engineering/survival/open world games.

Thew new survival mode has an extreme level of promise, with the main game consisting of bearings and motors and engines and control boxes and switches and pistons/pulleys - there is an unlimited potential for bases, contraptions, vehicles and machinery that can assist you in your playstyles. I can't stress enough at how good this game was in concept, is in practice and appears in future.

For the price it is listed at, it's a no-brainer, try this game!"
5698,Fun Game
5699,meh
5700,yes
5701,"Started playing this game shortly after its release on steam in 2016, waited for about 4 years that survival would launch. It finally did and with a few people it is really fun. Creativity is ALMOST endless, if you're playing without mods. Unfortunately it takes many months between updates for survival and we only get a devblog around every 2 months. It is frustrating but in the end it was always worth the wait."
5702,Great game to free your mind and build anything you want.
5703,nothin like joining a friend's world and your other friend is trying to teach your other friend and he ends up wireing the wheels to the chair and not the engine
5704,mmm love it

5712,fun
5713,is cool
5714,is good
5715,"It's a great indie game. The survival mode is very original, and I love how they've implemented it."
5716,"The game looks more fun to watch than it is to play. 

The creative mode is okay, but the number of things you can do are still extremely limited, even after several years of updates and development. 

The survival mode is anything but fun, and nothing is explained, with hunger and thirst decreasing so quickly that you often run out of supplies before you can establish your first farm, and even THAT is difficult to do when you're being swarmed with enemies that knock you around and kill you before you can do anything worthwhile.

Buy at your own risk."
5717,bombs are cool and they are in this game. 11/10
5718,spin
5719,Great game
5720,its fun there is survival and creative and you can play online
5721,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game with a lot of options.
In multiplayer the game will lag a lot but it is all worth it!

I fully recommend this game for everybody who likes making their own creations combined with a little survival."
5722,Nice
5723,Fun to play

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"
5732,"Great Game, lots of updates over the months, great survival mode addition. I would like more optimisation if possible as it would improve overall game experience but it runs great until you attempt to build something way to big :)"
5733,game gud
5734,yes
5735,nothing pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog pog
5736,"VERY MISLEADNG!! THE GAME IS NOT ABOUT SCRAP AND IS ONLY ABOUT MECHANICS!!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT IS SCAM VERY MUCHG!"
5737,it good
5738,epic game
5739,let the cursed airplane car be created and used
5740,Great pysics.
5741,dadawdawd
5742,Amazing game
5743,It's probably the best game I own. It's good enough to be a final product (ignoring some hitbox issues) but the devs keep updating it and adding new stuff which makes it even better
5744,survival too short. Need next survival chapter ASAP
5745,This game is really fun you can add mods to make it even more fun i really think more people should play :D
5746,love it so fun
5747,"Game is a lot of fun, mechanics are great and the physics are fun."
5748,yay
5749,very cool game for smart big brainers who build big camping car
5750,sex
5751,would recommend if you enjoy creativity.
5752,best game
5753,A mechanic that likes scrap
5754,yes
5755,"over 100 hours in and i still suck at this game.

good game tho"
5756,"Scrap Mechanic? More like Crap Mechanic. 
"
5757,its a survival game and building game theres robots that you fight and theres little dudes under water you'll find out more about the game if you play it
5758,"Cool
"
5759,yes
5760,Its fun please develop next chapter sooner please
5761,good game... but you have to grind forever
5762,yes
5763,"well this is a 13 dollars well spent, played with  my friend and we had the worst time, please try to fix it so we can play multiplayer
"
5764,It is the game is one of the best games that has creativity and physics in it.
5765,"I have played this game for more then the displayed hours and have had quite a blast doing so in coop with my gf. It is an open world sandbox where you are required to build various machines and vehicles to help you achieve tasks and as you build game knowledge you improve on those designs. This game imo is best played not using guides but to figure things out yourself as it seems very simple but gets very in depth quickly. This game is well worth the asking price and you can easily get your monies worth of entertainment just exploring, gathering, fighting and creating."
5766,Pretty cool game! Survival needs lots of improvment tho.
5767,"This game is for people who have creativity and use their imagination.  Sort of like Minecraft, this game allows you to make anything you want.  You can create machines such as cars, planes, trains, bikes, and more.  You could even build things that aren't even machines but build things like cities and towns.  If you aren't for creative that much, the game also includes a survival game.  When building contraptions, it can be difficult but if experiment and test out devices, you can become a very good engineer in the game.  The game also has many similar characteristics of real life engineering.  You can play with friends in both survival and creative and do challenges.  I overall recommend this game to anyone!!"
5768,yay
5769,good game
5770,very fun
5771,its a were fun game you can make cars planes and more you can let your creativeti out
5772,"AMAZING GAME!  This game I have watched youtubers play it and now I'm playing it as its such a good game from creative to survival you can't get bored at all. I love the design of the game and how creative you can get and from watching youtubers it's actually easy to build your own vehcile. Scrap mechanic has added a book in the game which tells you how to use the items. Good Job scrap mechanic . 10/10 keep up the great work axolotl!

I totally recommend this game to anyone that likes survival mode and that likes building stuff."
5773,noice
5774,"I love the way you can build whatever you want in this game with as long as you have the knowledge. The mechanics for the game are great and I love all the cool parts you can use to make different creations. The game is very fun and I would recommend, and it‚Äôs great to just mess about in and have fun."
5775,Physics + paper terrain = hilarious results
5776,"This game is awesome for the kind of people who like to mess around with crazy things, I mean the amount of really cool creations and mods on the workshop shows that this game is worth the hours, and say maybe you don't like endless creative fun? Well there is still something for you here whether you like to fight enemies, do escape rooms, farm, shoot stuff, have fun with friends, you name it, it's here. But one problem I have with the game is that it's a bit too hard for me to unlock costumes and more customization options, but I do like the attention to detail where if you take off your characters clothes (which you can do) there is underwear underneath, which is an awesome detail!"
5777,Fun game! Easy to lose track of time.
5778,this game is ruining my life... do recommend
5779,"Oh boy where do I start.  I watched my first video about this game right after it came out.  Then one day I got a computer and bought this game.  I have now owned it for 5 years and sank almost 1000 hours into it and let me tell you, those were some of the best 1000 hours of my life.  The devs may be inactive right now, but that's because they are hard at work on the next phase of scrap mechanic.  They have really shows was determination can do for a game and I think axolot are some of the best devs out there.  They went to extreme extents just for optimization such as developing their own engine and re-writing ALL of the games programming in this new engine.  This game is amazing, do your self a favour, and buy this game.  If you don't like it you can always refund it.  But overall I think this game is under priced because of how much effort axolot's small team of developers have but into this outstanding piece of art."
5780,"great game for builders 
"
5781,"Fun game, some things missing that im sure is still in devlopment."
5782,if you love building and you love minecraft go for it
5783,"nice
"
5784,dfg
5785,oogie boogie
5786,One of the best games I have on my inventory. Thinking about streaming this game on twitch!
5787,"not the fun i expected thats for sure. once you build a sturdy vehicle, it gets a bit easier as you can use vehicular homocide to wreck the farm bots en mass. until then be ready to starve to death every 5 minutes and die ALOT. starvation or thirst can eject you from your vehicle leaving you stranded and dead in some screwy situations."
5788,Just started playing really but it's a fun and relaxing game.
5789,very fun
5790,most beautiful game ever
5791,"Scrap Mechanic is a mix of construction and survival.You can build cool cars or others.You also can grow fruits and vegetables.But you have to pay attention.All over the island there are evil robots attacking you.It doesen't matter if you run away.The robots will always find you.So you have no choice but to fight.Most robots are not that difficult to defeat,however.Scrap Mechanic ist very fun.Especially in multiplayer mode.In Scrap Mechanic you have a lot of options.So you can assemble a beautiful Island in a short time with friends or alone.The Creative mode is also really nice.You can translate your fantasy on the map and this is pretty cool.When you have crazy ideas it is very funny,because you can troll other player or your friends.Tnt Spam is the Best troll option,because the Tnt kill your friends probably and then they maybe make a ragequit.Scrap Mechanic is often laggy,but it is okay and your game never crash.The Building system in Scrap Mechanic is not so good for Beginners in my opinion.But the graphic is fantastic.This game is absolutely recommendable.It gives nothing to improve.Except the Building system and the laggs.Axolot Games do a great job!"
5792,dxfzxngdch hg
5793,Good graphics and physics.  Survival can be challenging at times.
5794,"Very addicting but very grindy ,in a good way. Would recommend"
5795,What can I say ... This game is pretty nice and I enjoy playing it ... even tho a higher update frequency would not hurt . For anyone that liked Minecraft in the past see this as the same game but taken a lot more steps further with more advanced mechanics and overall better quality.
5796,i like the building and art-style as well as the enemies and the weapons. i think that the game is everything i wanted it to be
5797,7
5798,I love this game so much!
5799,this game is great to play if you have a very creative mind and even if you don't it is still a fun survival game.
5800,Amazing
5801,GOOD
5802,"honestly speaking, this game is truly great. it allows for creativity. it could also be considered as educational because it can teach kids about physics, allows them to express their creativity, and hours of fun and creativity which in turn can improve how a kids brain develops."
5803,
5804,"ITS AMAZING AND HAVE GOOD MODS
"
5805,"amazing game great freedom if you like minecraft you will probably like this game

5806,Verygood

5808,"very good, very fun. 5/5"
5809,"build spaceship, fly spaceship, place explosives on spaceship, crash spaceship straight into the ground, laugh, realise that you forgot to save the spaceship

Good game, although survival is disappointing, should be worked on a lot more"
5810,"obama
"
5811,i like big cogs
5812,Mods + multiplayer = fun
5813,very good!
5814,"My favourite game, once you start playing and understand the very very simple but amazing mechanics of the game, you'll love it like I do. I would seriously trade my liver for this game because it is just the most fun and imaginative game probably ever made in my style. So go buy it, because even though survival isn't finished yet, even that aspect of the game is great. I could go on and on and on about how this game is so incredible, but it may crash my laptop with that many words."
5815,"Give creativity to build whatever you'd like, though very complex build can cause fps lag. Worth the $20 and is still receving updates, survival mode is a bit bare but has updates coming to add new features and more to it"
5816,Best Game
5817,really fun game with alot of things to build you can never be done a modern and mechanical minecraft
5818,do it

5837,"ever just wanna explode something you just spent 2 hours on, just play SCRAP MECHANIC, a game where you fuck around and somehow create a car that flies better than any plane ever has. or maybe get sick of your mess called wiring because it just becomes a clusterfuck of colors and shit. Aswell as having the weight balance matter, God i hate physics."

5861,good
5862,IT IS FUN
5863,"fun and intuitive, lovely open world game"
5864,"Fantastic game but the fundamental code design seems incompatible with complicated machines or multiplayer that is performance friendly.

The setting, gameplay, and creative options are all top notch. It's easy to execute your ideas and have them work predictably. I would also describe the current state of survival to be incomplete. There's enough here to enjoy for many hours but it is obvious that the world is missing key elements and polish. 

I found few to no bugs during my 100 hours of playing, which is impressive, but I would like to see improvements made to performance when creations scale up or become more numerous in a server. The game has 9 or so physics settings so you can improve performance, but the simple settings do not simulate mechanical systems effectively so once you turn down physics, expect better performance at the cost of having your vehicles unable to drive or move correctly. I found the 'introducing the controller' video to be somewhat disingenuous for this reason, as most of the creations showcased would not run at even 30 fps on a decent gaming rig.

I highly recommend this game, but expect your creations and your multiplayer lobbies to remain small in scale."

 THING"

BUY NOW 9.8/10
"
5896,"This game had me in tears. You spend 30 minutes constructing a vehicle to meet a challenge or fulfill your dreams of flying a spaceship only for it to ragdoll out of control with your little friends strapped to toilet seats. the physics are about as accurate as goat simulator, but its part of the fun. This is a game to play with friends and have a drink or two. You will have trouble breathing from laughing at the chaos."

5898,this game is brilliant in every way especialy love survival

5904,slow not fun
5905,"Its a shame I can't recommend this game as the actual building and vehicle mechanics are very fun and well designed, however the combat is very simple and gets boring quickly, the survival mode is not balanced for single player (but it won't tell you that) and the game really lacks direction. Aside from make fun little gadgets and test the limits of creative mode, what am I supposed to do here?

Future updates look promising, but they come out quite slowly."
5906,"This game is so fun, and is a challenge to play which is great! i 100% agree with anyone who says its a good game!"
5907,i like the bulding vere much and conbat
5908,amazing game with hours and hours of game play tried to get a friend to get it but he is to stingy even though he bought like 3 different games for 60$ once chapter two comes out though it'll be at least 10 times better.
5909,"The game has a fair advantage and the game isn't hard, learning stuff is easy, includes survival that you will get used to easily, and you can build!"

5965,"This is the best game on steam.
This is unlike Minecraft in any way.
Modding is insanely easy,
and the workshop is so versatile.
Whenever I log onto this game, I just get feelings of absolute freedom.
Like, it's just ""oh man im on scrap mechanic, FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
5966,great game the amount of creativity it allows is amazing 100% recommend
5967,"pretty good. u can do anything, really anything: rockets, cars and ANYTHING u want so basiclly the best game ever created"
5968,very fun game makes you think about what your building... Its not a super easy game... and it can be extremely funny when you screw up a creation.
5969,I enjoy the feeling of being able to build a wide range of machines and the added survival mode is a great feature of the game. Runs smooth on my cheap laptop

5973,this game is just so much fun its a sandbox game survival or creative your choice but there's endless possibility's and whether your good with coding and stuff like that or you just started and want to build stuff its always fun and you should buy this 5 star worthy game

I have been streaming this game the past week and have found the community to be top notch that alone is a great reason to give this game a +1,  but it's more then just that.      The level of physics in the game and the ability to create almost anything you want having your imagination and time to gather the materials being your only barrier just simply makes the game fantastic.   This game is a treasure trove of content for the creative mind individuals.         Seriously pick it up, and play with friends."

6061,"When I think of this game, I clench my booty cheeks in painful memory. I had a lot of fun, and the game is very impressive in its physics mechanics and creative freedom. My issue is that, when I had played multiplayer survival, it was a laggy, glitchy nightmare. It made the game quite a struggle. Not because the game itself was challenging, but because half the mats you had to grind for, and you had to grind through the laggiest and most uncalibrated gameplay I have seen in years. God bless this game"

6072,"SM:S is a rare find that combines a creative sandbox with a fun PvE game loop of farming to survive. It's a chill experience that you can sink a lot of hours into. The world is interesting and fun to explore... spanning land and sea. The voxel-style building platform is great for creating structures and vehicles with near endless possibilities. The workshop also hosts a multitude of blueprints for vehicles if mechanical aptitude is not your forte... although the mechanics are simple and well-designed enough that my 10-year old can get a basic car up and running. Multiplayer is locally hosted and can be laggy at times, but it is a lot of fun to clear factories (dungeons) together. I would like to see a wider variety of crops to farm and more crafting possibilities."

6122,"I purchased this game back in 2016, and have played it a few times since. In terms of the game as a sandbox builder, it's pretty good, you can create a lot of really cool stuff, the game was obviously made to be as creative as possible, and it succeeds on that end.

Where this game fails, and has always failed, is anywhere outside of building and your creations. There is no multiplayer server browser, so the only way you are playing with anyone else to show off your creations is through a direct connection. 

Also the survival in this game is not fun at all, and that to me is the biggest disappointment because you can make a fun super creative/builder style survival game, tons of games have done it very well but this game fails at the very basics, in that it's not at all captivating to play. The gist of what I've played of it is you run around, you hit crates with hammer and collect the items (individually, in the most annoying way possible where your cursor has to be right over it) Sometimes annoying enemies that aren't at all fun to kill come out of no where and you have to fight them. I played for about an hour, and beyond the blocks I acquired and a few wheels from smashing crates and finding chests in structures, I was no where near close to building anything beyond a small box hut, which is really dumb because that seems like the simplest way to get people inspired to continue to play, is to actually give them tools to construct and things to build or a reason to build it. And maybe the problem is that I'm missing something, and that could be, because there actually isn't any in game tutorial or direction given for what you're supposed to be doing in survival at all. The devs spent plenty of time working out a little guide book for creative and how to build things, but it doesn't explain what you should be doing in survival or a general direction at all for it.


After all this time, it's really disappointing to see survival in this state."

6134,pretty good except for when my computer starts thermal throttling and my fps goes to -1
6135,yes
6136,lag simulator 2022 :) anyway very good!
6137,"One of if not the best mechanic-y games out there, giving you so much freedom, and it's clearly got a lot of soul in it's design. Always a good experience, and there's jank, but the devs are super active and clearly passionate. It's got everything and will continue to add more."
6138,"I cannot recommend this game in its current state.  The game does have great potential and can become a truly amazing game.

I feel sorry for people who bought the game and waited those long 4 years for survival to release.  I waited for survival too but once it released is when they got my money.  

The update speed did not improve though, sadly, when survival released.  There has been only 1 update to survival since it has released.  A few quality of life fixes like making it easier to obtain oil in bulk if I remember correctly.

Creative mode got a patch or two and so did their challenge mode I believe.  Both of which I could not care less about.

I'm not sure what Axolot is thinking honestly.  The early game is a nightmare.  If you think you can jump in, farm some resources, and make some cool machines to help you advance then you are sadly mistaken.

The grind is mind-numbingly boring.  Not only do you need to do the usual resource collecting of wood and metal but you also need circuit boards and component kits.  The latter two can only be found in crates guarded by mobs that frequently also drop them.  Both are not guaranteed to drop them though.  

Resources come in tiers.  When you first start you can hammer a few select trees that will give scrap wood.  Other trees you need the saw for.  You get scrap metal from killing hay bots and shaving their arms with your laser potato peeler.  Then you have to upgrade this metal into a different metal.  You get a lesser amount too. 15 scrap for 10 metal.  Even high tier metals cost other resources too and still deduct at a 1.5:1 ratio.

There are tier 2 trees that give better wood without having to upgrade it but you need the saw to get them.  Similarly with t2 metal there are rocks that need the drill.  I rush for the drill.  Since this is a physics game anything that spins the drill will suffice.  Make a pillar near a exploitable rock.  Toss a bearing on one side and extend that arm upward. Another bearing on the face of the arm for the drill.  Then once gravity drags it to the rock wack the drill with the hammer to get it spinning.  Before I learned this my only option was to farm mobs for scrap.  This is much faster then hammering thousands of hay bots.  Which, you'll need to do anyway for component. 

You can queue up some jobs for your craftbot but if you go out and farm component chances are you will be so far away from your crafting bot that it will stop crafting because it has despawned from the world.  If gathering the materials wasn't enough of a time sink then I have good news.  Everything is gated with a crafting time you cannot influence... and you call yourself a mechanic? smh


Combat is dull.  You whack things with your hammer while back peddling and strafing in hopes to not get whacked back.   No blocking. No rolling. Just click kite click juke click click  repeat until one of yas has 0hp.   Once you unlock a spud gun though those worries are gone.  The guns makes combat easier but even less enjoyable.  A hipshot or a headshot using the iron sights are indistinguishable in terms of damage.   You can also sneak up on bots by crouching for a free hit or two.  That about sums up early game combat. 

I personally think Axolot is making a mistake adding their specialty buildings like the refinebot.  I want to be the one that makes a machine that refines my resources.  Just give me the parts!  Sure, it may not have been as animated as theirs but, it certainly would not have been half as ugly either.  Check out the trailer with the forklift.  It is just a gimmick.  That vehicle would be useless in survival and that is a shame.

Perhaps the next update will change things but I am skeptical.

Do I recommend buying Scrap Mechanic? Yes, 100%! I don't regret my purchase one bit and look forward to any and all future updates.
But... I also recommend you wait another 4 years.  You're not missing much as it is.
Until then hopefully I can find a engineering game with survival mechanics in which I build everything!

Rant or not to make a long story short, the game in its present state is too much Scrap and not enough Mechanic."

6177,"A Crafting Survival Game....

Mrs. Wolfe and I both ended up returning the game. Scrap Mechanic is listed as a 'crafting survival' game. That label fits, but only loosely. Steam says it is like 7 Days To Die. It's not. It's more closely related to Satisfactory or Factorio. if you like those games, where it's a heavy 'crafting' game with some very minor survival elements, this game is for you. The crafting in general is very tedious and monotonous. 

It has less survival than Subnautica. I would say the survival elements almost not enough to qualify as a survival game. Yes you need food and drink but really that's it, and it isn't much that you need. 

Fun if Satisfactory and heavy crafting alone is your thing. It wasn't ours. I'd almost say the survival tag is very misleading."

6186,its fun but dont get until you get a mouse
6187,shoiiiiiiiish
6188,a
6189,gud game
6190,This game is really fun if you are not dumb because most of the cool stuff like logic gates are hard to lean for new comers but when you get the hand of it you can build anything
6191,yees
6192,Haven't been playing this game for too long really fun you can make some really stupid funny things
6193,fun to play
6194,"game
"
6195,wow so epic
6196,"its a realy cool game i am lost without it
"
6197,Love the game :)
6198,"great game i love  it 
"
6199,"it good
"
6200,This is so creative that it make the game so funny lol XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
6201,you can use the things on top of the sunshake vending machines to make wheels. its so perfect for an indev game.
6202,i like of how you need to think and what you can build on this game! and i don't think i have any dislike about it.
6203,Game design's so bad it's impossible to play.
6204,it was good
6205,the game is exciting.
6206,Great game to play with my nephews who live in another state!
6207,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game, made greater through the addition of Survival mode some time back. Mid range PC's will hit a lag wall forcing players to be economic with their builds towards the later mid to late game. This is the only drawback i can find as the game itself is fantastic and worth a purchase. Highly recommend. Download and upload your creations in creative mode and engage with an active steam workshop community. Hope this was helpful :)"
6208,"this game is great! the money spent was definitely worth it, i suggest others who like survival and building, you can build anything you want  your only limit is grinding but from that you can do anything from your imagination!"
6209,"i spent over a 3000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 thousand hours at this game, pretty boring"
6210,It is a fun game to play and i enjoyed it.
6211,The game just got a lot better when the survival mode came out! I haven't played it in a while but I decided to make a review on it and saying that I def recomend it!
6212,BEST GAME
6213,  it is very fun and a tool to express imagination
6214,Great Survival Game!!!!!!! :)
6215,i had it and it was very boring.
6216,It is a fun game to play with friends
6217,"Its a really good game
"
6218,Aaa
6219,Great Game what else can I say?
6220,"Nice game with nice features. But unless they FINALLY create the following after all these years in development, I will not play it anymore nor recommend it to others;

- Cancel crafting cue.
- Reverse engineer/ deconstruct items.
- Survival Settings that let you change the grind or difficulty.
- World Map and Mini map.
- Larger area to see coop player's location and Health.
- Quicker updates instead of useless Devblogs."
6221,I like making stuff
6222,B
6223,haha car go brrrrr
6224,rer
6225,"Its fun if you know what you are doing, great game needs more updates though"
6226,best
6227,it is a very fun game with infanate possibilities
6228,"Amazing game, really lets your imagination shine. The building mechanics aren't too complicated, yet not too simple at the same time. You can build amazing things as a new player, and still have things you want to build after nearly 300h. Probably one of the greatest games I've ever played."
6229,survival mode is bad
6230,love scrap mecanic little laggy but thats probly just my computer
6231,...
6232,"absolutly amazing, most fun game to play with friends"
6233,THE SURVIVAL MODE IS BAD AND LACKS IN TEACHING NEW PEOPLE SO NEEDS SOME WORK THERE BUT OTHERWISE GOOD.
6234,this is amazing buy very fun
6235,get if you like messing around and having fun
6236,yes
6237,"this thing is ok, I guess"
6238,l
6239,"great game
"
6240,It is a wonderful game that me and my friend have enjoyed
6241,GREAT
6242,This game is amazing can't wait for more dude I've done a lot the survival mode is crazy takes lots of time if you have no clue what your doing the building of cars and stuff is infinite the mods are easy to get to so in love with this game
6243,"Survival mode is really addicting, and I enjoy all the creations you can make. Can't wait for wedges and duct corners!"
6244,"gud
"
6245,it goooddddd
6246,I really enjoy this game and i cant wait for survival mode to be completed.
6247,POG
6248,very good game
6249,"eee, sobolan"
6250,build destroy explore get killed have fun
6251,meh
6252,weed car
6253,very fun
6254,"If you're thinking of buying this game you definitely should.
This is probably one of my favourite games right now, its amazing and here's why...

You can use your creativity to make anything you want, and if there is something you can't then there is probably a mod that can help.

For example I made this small car that can drive on land a move about in the water, but needed smaller thrusters on the side to make it turn without getting in the way of stuff, and i found the mod i needed, and now it works flawlessly.
Here's the link to it on the workshop if you want to check it out: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2638692180

And with the survival mode you can play the game with a challenge, with raiding warehouses, farm raids, bosses and more to come, you can build your own fort to protect yourselves from the farm bots, explore the huge map, build a drill car to mine rock, a tree harvester or a mobile base, the possibilities are endless.

But needless to say playing with friends is the best part about this game; me and my friend like to mess around with workshop creations and build are own fun contraptions. But if you don't have people to play with there steam groups, discord servers and subreddits with people wanting to play so you wont be left out."
6255,Amazing
6256,This is a great game! Fun to mess around with the wacky physics and make interesting builds!
6257,a
6258,"this game honestly had a lot of potensial, but the survival is absolute dog, sandbox mode is great if u like that type if stuff i guess, but id rather jerk off to gaypron while my grandparents are watching than play the survival mode, it just feels empty and dead, it feels like trying to sqeeze juice out of a stone, grinding for hours with no real purpose"
6259,"Nice gameplay, and very fun"
6260,Hit tree many wood. Build car many fast. Hit rock no stone. Eat food... No food. No fucking food.
6261,"Bit of a learning curve at first but Survival mode is really addicting.  Cheerful atmosphere, clever, and Multi player. What's not to like?"
6262,eksplkoerisive
6263,is good. is fun. highly recommend.
6264,its the best we only need a tape bot nerf and it well be balanced and better

6266,i likehow you can be very creative
6267,"Great game, the physics are kinda goofy, but other than that. Its a great survival game."
6268,good game very funny
6269,i want to know why my gear cant be use and after attach it will make error
6270,poopy but
6271,yeS
6272,I say if you love to biuld car truck or just love to survive and minecraft dont do it for you play this game its fun intertaning and you van play with your friends so lets go get a heybot and watchout for those pesky tapebots and the big red guys are big and mean come join us on scrap mechanic
6273,It's an entertaining game however it is extremely grindy so only get it if you  like to grind or like to be creative and make things in creative mode.
6274,"There is so much to learn and do, you can really let your creativity run wild on here."
6275,Recommend survival
6276,it is cool

6282,Mcrap Sechanic
6283,"absolutely amazing game. love it 887 hours of gameplay and, the game is pretty simple to create something great. 100% would recommend."
6284,"Good game, you do need a somwhat good computer tho"
6285,good
6286,if you like building crazy contraptions that do wonky stuff when you least expect it give this game a try... the game is still in early development and at this time i have 674 hrs into the game.. played through several Survival sets and always finding new things to do.. :) if you like Minecraft Redstone components and have an interest in Engineering.. this game is super fun... finding a new way to overcome an obstacle is great.. even if youve tried it the same way a thousand times.. the outcome could always be different in this game.. i love it.
6287,very fun it can be slow at first in survival but once you get going it gets really fun.
6288,"This is a fun survival game, that is great with your friends.  Just wish the Mod support was available in survival mode, not just the open world/creator space mode, there is a way around it, but I find it doesn't always work."
6289,"This is a good game, came here from scrap man!"
6290,"good
"
6291,haha duck go brrrrr
6292,i drank a gallon of cum
6293,"this game is great for people with lots of creativity, if you put lots of time into the game it can become a hobby in itself"
6294,"very nice 
"
6295,What can i say this game makes my hormones kick in.
6296,This is an awesome game to play
6297,good
6298,"Cool game, it has 3 gamemodes: Survival, Creative and challenge mode. In survival you crash on a planet where you find alot of robots and ruin buildings. There is also farmbots which are the most dangeorus robots at the moment and you can find them in places like huge forests, ember zone canyons. After you kill a farmbot he gonna drop a key that you use to unlock warehouses (the big structures you find around the map) . But you need to prepare a spudgun since theres alot of tapebots that can kill you in 2 shots. Later you can visit the scrap city which has tons of loot but also robots.
In creative you can build anything you want, from a starter car to calculators and planes.
In challenge mode you must create cars and other stuff to get to the finish, its hard so i did not complete challenge mode
fully yet.
The only problems that i found is not perfect optimization when you make creations with like alot of bearings or stuff
and also problems in multiplayer, it just starts lagging when theres 3+ players (2 if someone has bad internet like my friend)"
6299,A nice and creative game
6300,"Watch out! this game has poor optimization for many GPUs, it has some overheating issues and overall just some general bugs, that can result in a broken or damaged GPU. GTX 1060 6Gb seems to be have the worst effects from the game, as the game doesn't function well & often crashes with them. After researching, most people who own GTX 1060s have crashing issues. [This doesn't mean it will be the same case for you, but some experience issues.] Me, and 2 other people Ik had issues with it. I use to love this game, it's great, but I can't play it anymore. (I could play it before the survival update)"
6301,"cool
"
6302,I suck at this game.
6303,this game is so fun i recommend
6304,gud game
6305,good fun

6311,fun
6312,fun
6313,"For sure a game for people that like thinking, building, and creating. I've been playing this game for quite some time and would confidently say that its fun on both survival and creative. This game makes lots of strides to make it fun and inventive. It only sucks when you realize you played it too much in one day. 10/10"
6314,I had dreams about this game.
6315,good game

6327,It is very fun
6328,This is bad. You always do the same thing. Minecraft is way better.

6357,Creativeity
6358,Very fun if you re a crative person
6359,Enjoyable and sometimes hilarious. Love the concept. Would definitely recommend to a friend that loves open world survival games.
6360,yuuuuu
6361,bob
6362,
6363,I really love everything about this game - I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes a challange!
6364,its fum
6365,"With the updates that have come out over time, I can officially say that the game Is more fun now. However, I do encounter some multiplayer Issues sometimes, Whether It's the host's connection or my own (Which when I test Is fine) this can be extremely annoying and the game can end up being unplayable. I also believe that survival still lacks a few things like there not being enough variety in enemies or bosses. Overall good game though."
6366,Good game
6367,fun
6368,10/10 game
6369,"The creative and survival are very good, although, survival is a bit grindy."
6370,"Fun game, just wish the updates came a bit quicker. think its been a good 5 or 6months since we last had a update."
6371,k
6372,la ppoopop
6373,"Really fun building in creative mode, if it wasn't for that I would have already returned the game.

Played for about two hours, grinding just to make a car, drive it 5 min and it get's destroyed by bots. Survival is a pretty big waste of time if you play alone and just want to relax. If you sit at home all day and have nothing else to do I recommend it but if you don't have much free time and just want to have a relaxing experience, stick to creative."
6374,place lift. build car. destroy car. get bored. discover workshop. get unbored. build big thing. done.
6375,best game
6376,"wee woo

6381,this a very good game with many possibilitys you can aslo download mods for FREE from the steam workshop
6382,"When I'm drunk I don't always buy dumb games like these, but when I do review them, I'm drunk.

6394,This game is absolutely genius. Buy it
6395,very good but also very laggy
6396,"I don't really like this game all that much, at times its fun, but other times its frustrating and annoying. If you just like to build and stuff creative is alright but if your looking for fun survival game-play, I don't think you'll find it here. It may get better in the future but as of now I'm not completely satisfied with it. In other words its difficult to survive whenever you plant crops because when you do raids come for them and will destroy everything."
6397,people who play this game are either really smart and good at building or build penises and random shit which crashes your game 10/10 would play again.
6398,I tis fun
6399,It would be a good game if developers didn't make farming nearly impossible with all the bots around.
6400,"Like the Mechanic's
"
6401,THIS IS BEST GAME
6402,"excellent game, please finish it
"
6403,Yes
6404,its leli god
6405,"This game feels unfinished in a lot of spaces (it's a Beta after all) but I also see a lot of potential in it. Despite of that it can already give you endless hours of fun building vehicles and using them.

The focus of this game appears to be 1) exploration 2) building 3) logistics 4) resource collection and 5) automation. You have to create vehicles in order to collect or transport resources to your destination of choice. Those of course need to meet certain requirements to function at all, e.g. have a strong engine and fitting chassis or build. I enjoy this aspect of the game a lot, it's actually something that I've been looking for. Numbers 4) and 5) still need a lot of work in my opinion.

It also lacks guidance: there is a manual you can look at when you start survival (which is nice in ikea style), but it gives you vague pointers at best. It doesn't explain to you e.g. that you have to find a power source or insert the battery into a mechanic station or into your ship. Or the fact there will be raids at all when you plant too many seeds.

The resource grind in survival can be hard, time consuming and repetitive (hit with sledgehammer -> collect). To a degree, you can make the grind easier by creating devices (e.g. self watering farm) or mining/lumber vehicles. For resources other than wood or stone, I wish the possibility to automate resource collection was easier, e.g. by providing resources that reliably renew each few minutes instead of on chunk reloading (leaving / reentering an area). Having the possibility to replant seeds automatically would be nice too.

Creating doors or gates is quite cumbersome as you need an expensive controller and logic gates to make one work just like a real door. For huge gates it kinda makes sense, but not for simple doors. What is also hard to create are joints that stay in a fixed position e.g. those used in cranes. This is possible with a controller, but is not optimal and tedious to create and use. So while the possibilities to create structures, devices and vehicles in this game are vast, the devs still need to work on that more I think. Or alternatively, add modding support at least, which I think they are already working on.

Overall it needs more content and fleshing out, e.g. enemies, or more detailed production chains, detailed farming mechanics, more story elements/environmental storytelling. It's still a great game with lots of potential and definitely worth its money. Cannot wait for future updates."
6406,pog
6407,"Amazing game, has a lot of potential with right development and updates."
6408,"Axolot is moving almost as slow as a dead snail with development at this point.

Numerous bugs and problems needs to be fixed, but there doesn't seem to be any intention to.

I can no longer recommend this game despite having over 1000 hours spent on it."
6409,e
6410,"very coool game, makes my synapses go wee woo"
6411,Very fun game just not so fun when your the raid fails :/
6412,good game but kinda laggy in multiplayer

6424,(sorry for spelling errors in advance) It is hilarious for People with friends but its even fun alone. its amazing for someone who wants to work machienary and see that so many little factors can ruin or make your  build. I would suggest getting it asap and hop online with friends or just by yourself

6438,very good
6439,to everyone who wants this game this game is a world you want to be in
6440,mmmmmmmmmh yes very gud
6441,This is a pretty good game however it takes some time to learn how to finnese normal hay bots also the grind for thrusters is pain.
6442,"Careful with playing too much and rest every 20/ 30 min.; on the other hand, you can build any machine/ vehicle/ contraption you imagine, so yeah."
6443,GG
6444,this game is like spaghetti
6445,"honestly, this game is great. pretty addicting too"
6446,Its amazing for creating programing and just having a good time.
6447,this is very fun with friends and also alone and its worth buying
6448,Cows are to sexc they distract me to much
6449,very nice game

"
6453,Yes.
6454,pro
6455,"Confusing, my friend and I got this game and we started playing survival. Played that for an hour and then we tried out creative to see if that would help us understand the concept of the game. Whatsoever no clue still. Maybe we'll try again later when the game releases."
6456,It is a overall fun game but it is only as fun as long as you have ideas. Survival is the greatest thing added to Scrap Mechanic.
6457,gud
6458,very fun with friends
6459,Learning how to connect the car was wack. I might just be kinda special
6460,good
6461,urd
6462,cool game but very lag
6463,yes
6464,In multiplayer the game becomes an unplayable lagging mess once you get beyond the basic early game blocks. the content is repetitive at best and even after years of early access they haven't managed to make the game playable
6465,"After over a year of not playing nothing changed. Multiplayer is still laggy as f**k.
And the content is still cheap. 
There are no real enemies and the factories are all the same boring rooms with nothing beside one room of good loot.
The rest of the World is also very empty with not much in it. 

Currently not worth a cent :/"

Pros:
Fun to build stuff

6479,"Great game! Some mechanical problems here and there but wont effect gameplay for most part! Still an overall good game to play with friends! Ive played since before survival has come out and gotta say, survival just adds so much more to do!"
6480,"fun game to play, a very good time killer too"
6481,"super grindy, not very much to do. Mechanics seem cool in creative mode but survival mode is terribly balanced and extremely slow, with most necessary gear gated behind extremely long periods of walking and waiting."

At first its complicated but the more you play you learn this game has i lil bit realistic with physics and some but its good its a survival game that adds tech from the future and kinda modern survival"

6531,"Nearly all of my hours are in survival and most of it played with friends. This was a really fun experience with some very rewarding building mechanics. The game is pretty grindy, though. If you enjoy iterating on building designs and increasing your efficiency while exploring and collecting, this game is for you."

6534,Really fun with friends but gride is insane

6610,Awesome. No other words to explain it
6611,"Physics are really broken and I guess they don't care, but it's pretty fun, I think survival is too punishing.  It's insane this game has been in early access this long and it's still not done."
6612,"this game is fucking trash i cant make a decent fucking vehicle why cant it just be simpler i hope all the devs burn in hell
"
6613,this game is super in depth on the engineering even more if u have mods and the survival isn't bad either although the story line is kinda hard to follow from what i've experienced so far
6614,Good

6663,It takes a lot of creativity to try a car of your liking. But nothing comes easily you have to work for your stuff in survival and in creative you can just figure out cars and other things you may want to figure out.

bc it just is i dont know what to tell you"

6681,plm faci orice iti trece prin cap si de cand cu modul de survival e mai top
6682,I absolutely Love the game except that I have no friends. :(
6683,"Starting off when i paid a low price, I loved the concept but found myself getting bored easily. the building is amazing. I have had this game for quite a long time. there was no survival, the lack of a purpose was lacking. throw in survival and i tried it for 5 minutes. literally 5 mins, then backed out. just yesterday I hoped on to see what happened. now that i passed the drudging first half hour with lack of tutorial and hitting up the wiki. I love the game. the survival aspect is actually great. building my vehicle struggling to upgrade what i have and thinking extra hard on how to make my concepts reality have them work properly gave me more of a purpose. the enemies are good from the two basic mobs ive seen out of 6. more variety would be awesome in random spawn. even so without the spud gun has gave me some wtf moments. the guys with the pitchfork are assholes and give a good challenge and their chase when following you will have you begging for a bit of mercy. once you figure out how to take them out no big deal. i felt like this is more geared towards kids at first. but really its for everyone if you have the open mindset. all in all would recommend to everyone to at least give it a chance. Its good, would i say perfect, no. but would i say a blast to enjoy for a couple hundred hours maybe. definitely going to play again tomorrow and see how long it keeps me hooked. happy building to everyone."
6684,I find it really fun and theres a lot to learn
6685,is good buy now while it exista
6686,expensive and trash
6687,YES love this game
6688,good
6689,Fun for the first part and middle part of the game. Late game grind really boring right now but I heard they were fixing that so. A work in progress.
6690,very creative i highly idvise it after watching it on yt
6691,"Scrap Mechanic is a game that makes you feel stupid in the best kind of way, because it makes you want to do a better job. I've owned this game for a long time, since very early on, and even then it was fun with just creative mode. But with the survival mode? The whole experience shifts. You'll spend 10 hours building a machine just to realize you can do it better and waste another 10 hours. But every hour is thrilling, the feeling that you're always closer and closer to the solution that'll make the whole machine work perfectly. Everything you do in this game is like a little puzzle you design. And that's not even mentioning the timelessly classic art style that I'm sure will make Scrap Mechanic a gem of a game for years to come."
6692,its epic and POG!
6693,"Great game, lots of fun"
6694,build lag things
6695,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
6696,9/10 would recommend multiplayer at the time do the review is about glitchy but haven‚Äôt seen anything bad in my years of playing
6697,Very fun game
6698,"I really like how I can build almost anything and it works (Drives, Flies, Floats, etc.)."
6699,good game but the grind is real just to get a single fire gun but please let us USE THE LIFT WITH THE CRATES OF FOOD PLEASE and be able to eat corn but it does a little bit of food i have died to starvation so many time it is unbelievable or add  so you can use the cook bot to cook the corn oh the last time armour so you dont get 2 hit by the tape bots
6700,s
6701,Mekanik
6702,i can make peins
6703,"before the survival mode update that came out last year, i would not have recommended it to anyone. no doubt, it was a good game then, but it only had about 10 hours of content for the average player. more if you resonated with the game play.

post survival-mode update, its like its a whole new game. there's so much new content that i cant even summarise it here, but believe me, if the trailers interest you, get it."
6704,it is a really fun game and good for creativity
6705,Best game!
6706,fun but my friend sunk our house

6710,gosd
6711,Good Game.
6712,"This really is a fantastic game.

But obviously since its a thumbs down and im starting this review like that, i think we both know where this is going.

              Poor optimization.
I have barely scratched the surface of survival mode. 
Built a tractor and a flat bed to move my crap around.
Sure it works great, the physics are cool. (albeit a complete pain in the ass, constantly flipping over)
Why am i already having a frame drop?
I have 12 rotor joints and only 3 moving parts (aside from wheels), and im already having issues.

Now i dont have a beast of a PC buts its not complete garbage either. (Specs below)

OH SHIT. My computer just died...
SNAP, my PCU was being kicked by the hardware trying to render this shit.

(Turns out its a flaw in my system, but exposed by the game... Same thing happened in CyberPunk, but i got a clean 80 ish FPS all the way through VS. a rough 20 - 55 FPS with Scrap Mechanic) 
Regardless, it seems this game has a severe problem with mem dumps or allocation with its physics engine.
Had to turn down the graphics quite a bit...

This has been mentioned in some of their dev logs as to be addressed, but FAR down the road, years possibly and thats just not acceptable.

                 Difficulty
HOLY SHIT
This is one of the hardest games ive played lmao.
Now im not a Dark Souls kinda guy, more Stationeers hardcore.
Get into my first fight, a ""Haybot"" swipes me and half my health is gone.
But i survived! Crap im starving? its been 2 minutes.
Great another Hay bot... Wait why cant i dodge or block anything? How can i even fight this thing without getting hit?
Crap im outa food because ive been scrapping bots the whole time.
Wait, cotton? where do i find (anything)? Soil? Do I dig a hole? How do i grow crops!?
Oh thats how (Fucking hours later of trying to figure it out, -no im not going to google this shit- :/  and the tutorials are a bunch of instructional images that you would find in the Axiom handbook (Wall-E))....  

Seriously the raid timer started immediately after i finished planting my crops? i had zero time at all....
So wait, you mean to tell me that those bots are going to raid my farm every 10 - 15 minutes because of illegal farming? ( a whopping 10 plants, whoa farmer john. better slow down on them raddishes.)

10 TO 15 MINS!!! ??? FUCK ME, how do i get anything done? Rush in like the cool-aide guy? Wtf?!
I walk like the Pillsburry Dough boy with bowed legs after a long night...
And my jalopy flips around more than my sausage in a cold Alaskan winter.

Ok, well either way i still need resources... I go out and successfully grab the crap i need.
But Bots have spawned DIRECTLY on my shit.
I cannot for the cheat of the game get to my base in time to even stop them from attacking it.
Great. i left for 5 mins. 5 MINUTES. I still had 13 mins on the timer for the raid, my base is half gone, my farm it has been destroyed, my cars been totaled, half the crap i had stored has been destroyed.
19+ hours to build. 5 minutes to total... Yeah, thats how we like to play our games....

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME

OK FINE EASY MODE!!!!!!!!!!

Are you kidding me?

OK FINE FUCKING CHEAT THIS SHIT

/noaggro
heh that will do em..
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK... UGH It doesnt work? are you kidding me?!?

hmmm, ok maybe an invicible block mods?
oh... it doesnt work...
Fine ill dig around in the code and make my own mod...
Ok.... never mind... 
(Their code is actually absurdly easy to read, im just really fucking tired at this point.)

Fuck it... I quit,

6717,ive had this game for 2 weeks and ive put 122 hours into it. This has to be the funnest most balanced crafter survival creation type game that i have ever played. tons of replay value and i mean tons. I love how all of the machines have there own personality and the clothes... i didnt know they would be one of my favorite parts but you get to keep the clothes you unlock and take them with you wherever you go. Also i was able to play with 4 of my friends at the same time. 5 player creation and survival this game is basically super fucking epic!!

6734,"Singleplayer: Vanilla - Yes, Modded - Extreme Yes
Multiplayer: Vanilla - Yes, Modded - Do it lightly, otherwise prepare for a bad time

For a modding experience for survival mode, there is no mod loader as of 9/28/2021. It's all in file editing, copying and paste mods into game folder and so forth.
If you know what you are doing, its a good game. Be sure to make a modpack for friends to straight copy and paste into game folder."
6735,"This Is literally the most broken game I have ever played. It was fairly glitch ridden a year ago when I got it but, fun to mess around on. I uninstalled after I got bored, and just reinstalled as I wanted to do some more
 ""battle bots"" with friends.

Yeah after an hour its safe to say they have just not fixed prior bugs, they've just fucked the game even more. I mean I have something like 200-300 saved vehicles and contraptions many of which I used to play with constantly. Every single one function improperly now, and on top of that the stability of just being in a creative world with friends is worse than ever. 

Uninstalled, not installing again.
plz save your money. there are better sandbox creation games out there, with devs that will provide a stable experience, and fix bugs."

6768,"I absolutely recommend this game! It is fun, you can do anything you want (Including limiting the things you can do), and it is very kid friendly. I believe that the developers of this game were aiming to make it safe for all ages, because even though there is fighting, you are using a potato launcher against robots which can't even pierce your flesh. they just wack you, with no blood or even scratches. I will end this review, saying that it is fun, kid friendly, and a five-star game!"

It's a very addictive game, and hopefully more stuff to do in game will be added like ways to build and materials you can make."

fant mod


seriously tho, it add a lot of new and welcome content to the game and i cant imagine playing without it.

base game is fun and all but only for a while, fant just brings it to another level with all the stuff and things he adds and tweaks.

if you ever feel like youre getting bored of the base game go check out fant mod.

and yes, game is highly recommended, even if it gets a bit dull at some points."

6800,"Scrap Mechanic is a really creative game, I enjoy playing it the only problem is it is very time-consuming so don't expect to have a really great functional car at day 2. The game takes time to learn so before buying it I would recommend watching Youtube videos about it I personally like ""Scrapman"" and ""kAN Gaming"" and it doesn't even need to be a tutorial you will learn just by watching. If you're still not a fan this game is in early access so they are constantly updating it so come back later to see if its interensting in 1-2 months."

6808,"Really good game and also very addictive. The mechanic's of the game are absolutely on point and although complex, easy to learn over time. In my opinion this is probably the best game so far that let's you build simple or complex cities, machinery, lights, cars etc. In conclusion, I recommend playing this game as after you learn all the mechanic's in the game, then it gets really fun to play and you can make many things. Thank you developers for making this amazing game! Hope everyone has a good day/night!"

But theirs this problem that led cost me 2 hours, I was creating this vehicle when I accidentally right clicked deleting the whole thing with no way of getting it back, I think they should make it so you can't accidentally do that as I lost a lot of time.

6826,"I really love this game! I played almost 400 hours!
It is like the Minecraft, where I can create anything that I can things. But the main different is that the things can move.
In the Minecraft I can make something that seems like a car. But it will never be a car. Just wood, stone, and dirt.

Here I can use some mechanical things. I can use wheels. So I can make a car that move. And instead of have some prepared fix version of cars I can create anything that become a car. It can have 4 wheels. Or 8 wheels. Or just 1 wheel. And it will work. Or maybe not.
Put a thruster and it will fly! Build on the water and it will be a ship. Of build a simple house. Build an automated super castle. Build a defense system.

The only problem is that after finishing a warehouse ride, you will have all material what you need. You can do anything what you want. You don't need to go and explore the map. You don't need to go to ScrapCity. You will not find anything special or new things there.
Okey, ScrapCity is fun for 1 time. But I will never go back to there.
My place is very nice near to the mechanic station. I can find all materials that I need next to my base.
I can protect my base from any time of raids. So the game started to be very very boring.
I build a ship. I build a flyer. I have an invincible car.
I can mining, I can cutting trees. I am sure that I can make better vehicles to be perfect.  But I don't need. I will be boring.

A new update will coming, the underground. There will be many new things.
But I want that ScrapCity, the Maze, the SecondSpaceship and other POIs will be unique with unique things. Like we need to go under the water to find glue. We could need to go to the SecondSpaceship for unique crafting. There can be unique materials in the ScrapCity. There can be unique food in the maze. There could be chemicals in the Chemistry Station. And yes, even the Warehouses should be unique! I don't want new clothes, because they doesn't change the gameplay (don't give protection, like in the minecraft). All Warehouse should give different unique thing.
And if the tapebots will respawn there, it would be more interesting to go back to the same warehouse."

6833,"If you're the type of person that thinks you'd like a game like this, you're probably right. It allows so much creativity in building things, and has a surprisingly high ceiling of complexity in the engineering of things. Survival mode is still centered around building in a delightful way, and isn't punishing when you make mistakes. Definitely would recommend."
6834,"This game can be very fun at times, but other times, the game breaking bugs do not make it very enjoyable."
6835,good game

6852,"This is game is Awesome.. Here's Why

This game does not let you place most things the way you want them to be place so you kinda have to improvise which i like.
Unlike most Other games this game has the weirdest key-binds at least for placing and building. 
    Overall The Game IS SUPER fun.
 I love the building and the survival it is super awesome i like the way mechanics work etc.

6881,"Scrap Mechanic, a game, I like."
6882,scap manic
6883,"The building aspects of the game are wonderful. Things snap together in fun ways and I like the mechanics for motors and bearings.  If you like creative models, this is a game for you. However, to call the survival mode grindy would the understatement of the day.  Sometimes you run around for 10 minutes just to find one bot to kill that gives you 10 metal scrap blocks; only you need like 60 of them to make the next component.  I played about 8 hours  and I'm done with survival. There is no story line to keep me hooked and the grind is ridiculous. Even just picking up blocks from a robot that I just killed requires me to push a key for 4-5 seconds.  Its such a shame, cause the mechanics of the game are great."
6884,"I wish I could give this a thumbs up but the game play and the world ends up feeling fairly empty. currently it is still in early access so this may change.

Building vehicles is complicated and very in depth while it is fun making complex machines there really are not too many things you can do with them.
Building buildings is tedious due to tiny block sizes. 

Performance is awful, if you build a few vehicles or chop down just a hand full of trees the game begins to lag heavy.

It is still in early access so I think in time this game could be great in time, if the developers keep at it. 
"
6885,amazing game much rekomend :D much fun to play and physics are totaly very amazing
6886,this game is a must have you get to build to survive and make turrets cars jets or even gigantic vehicles that drill throe the ground and come out somewhere different or you could just build to your desire and make farms submarines or literally anything you can think of so buy it now AND I MEAN NOW!
6887,yes

6890,Very fun game I am playing with a friend highly recommend but the multiplayer is very bad I think it needs an update or my friends PC is bad lol
6891,"its alright, but the gameplay is just veryboring and generally not good. The game looks good but its just not for me. Multiplayer is alright its just a pretty average game."
6892,"Its fun, but the whole eating and drinking in this game is annoying even for a survival game. You have to eat and drink like every 5 minutes or you constantly make groaning noises until you die. Also, not really a purpose to this game if your looking for one, other than build shit and it might work."
6893,it is good
6894,Awesome
6895,GREAT GAME
6896,Yes.
6897,"Fantastic. I love the small building blocks so you can create more intricate shapes. The provided logic is simple and connections are fairly easy to use. It is more than likely my PC that has a slight trouble running it, but I do wish there was a bit less lag from larger creations. I like having a mobile base..."
6898,play the creative for about 2 weeks before survival

6900,10/10 amazing and fun
6901,"yeah it's good, probably better than minecraft and i've been playing that for 7 years"

6907,you take thre scarp and youm kae a cra
6908,Always fun and exciting to play! Fun is endless.
6909,"It seems like survival mode is balanced for 2-3 player multiplayer, not for solo players at all. The amount of time you have to put in for the progress you make is simply not worth it. Mobs like tapebots two shot you, making warehouses (the ""dungeons"" of the game) nearly impossible for solo players, as you pretty much can't make a single mistake or you lose everything.

For some reason, whenever the grind and difficulty of the game is mentioned on forums, people respond with suggestions such as ""Just do some lua editing to make the game fair for yourself"" and I think to myself, ""what other game have I ever  considered doing that for in order to make the game enjoyable?"". The answer is none.

It's a shame because the sandbox element of this game beats out most others, and if you are looking at this game for the creative mode I would recommend. 

Overall, I wouldn't consider playing this game as a solo survival player again unless a serious balancing overhaul were to take place."

Love the game, great mechanics, physics and creation tools, but whenever i launch it, it plays alot like shrek super slam. it also says im playing shrek super slam, did i buy the wrong game? ive played a lot of shrek super slam while trying to launch scrap mechanic and i can recommend. The game takes on a whole new scoring system for fighting games where instead of getting to a certain amount of KOs leads you to victory, its based off of a timer meaning you could get an infinite amount of points, as long as its within the time limit. This new timing system leads to some very tense moments near the end where all the players try to squeeze as many points out of each other in the last few moments. 10/10 unique and fun!"

6974,"The start of the game involved running around with buckets of water for an hour. Then came the farming, running around with more water. Then defending the farm every 20 minutes against the same two adversaries with a single weapon --- so that was ""Tomato defense"", which was pretty dull. I then spent a good while making a car from poor (and incorrect) instructions. The resulting car, finally built exactly as prescribed, was no faster than running and would constantly tip over, resulting in (having had to google how to turn it over) having to whack it numerous times with a sledgehammer to right it. I know this is early access, I've played many EA games, but this one one takes the biscuit. How anyone can find this fun is totally beyond me."

Never-mind the components you need to build the basic construction bot are difficult as is to find, couple that with all the other resource-intensive parts and tools you need to build on top of that, AND THEN all the basic materials to put a decent vehicle together, and you'll be running around, whacking crates and trees, way more than actually, you know, BUILDING ANYTHING."

However, it is still in Early access. AFTER 5.5 YEARS. It is a large bugfest, has serious multiplayer performance issues and if players are too far away from eachother, FPS goes through the floor. Releasing half a game in early access and lazily releasing a small update every 6 months is a bad business practice which should not be supported in any way or form."

pls forgive for spelling errors.

but seriously this is a pretty good game, its fun but theres very little to do in the survival mode since its not finished, its also grindy as hell and extremely punishing and difficult, but its super fun... in multiplayer that is. the creative mode is the star of the show, its very good, its one hell of a time for sure. i say worth playing if its on a sale or once it gets more content :D But it has alot of options with friends thats why i recommend it!

the artstyle is rlly good, its special, thats all i can say.

Once you know about the basic blocks moving on to mods is a great idea. My favorite mods are The modpack, X's train mod, and new legend mod. Things like smart engine, math block, counters, and trains will surely make the game way more fun. Highly recommend this game if you have the money and overall a great game."

7054,"Fun game to let your imagination go wild in. 

Enemies are not particularly diverse but crafting is phenomenal and continues to improve. There is a bit of a steep learning curve at the beginning but watch some youtube videos and you'll be amazed at what you can do."

7079,yes
7080," Gonna be honest,
I found out about this game from on of my early childhood idols (iballisticsquid), and couldn't resist buying it. This game let's unleash your creativity, and personality. Survival mode is a plus to, so much fun! If your thinking about buying this game do it! You will not regret your purchase! I approve"

7092,"extremely good game, need a good processor thou"
7093,"Scrapmechanic is an open world first/third person multyplayer programmer game. I love programmer games since they give you so many possibilitys for machines and rockets and tanks and even Boats.
Things i liked:
The openworld part,
the programming mechanics,
the shooter part,
the fact that ammo in the scrapmechanic world is  starchy potatos,
and the part where crops are mixed, for example if you grow a carrot it at first grows to be a gourd, but when its fully grown, there is a carrot inside of that gourd

Things i didn't like:
the constant farming raids, i get that its part of the story that the robots took over and that the first wave is just some spiderbots but farming is an essencial thing in scrapmechanic and the raids just get so hard that i have to die over and over again just to finish the raid,
and the rarity of repair kits, theyre so rare that half of the game is just raiding abandond outposts and killing and refining robot arms and breaking open scrapcrates or whatever theyre called.

That's my Revew on scrapmechanic, but hey, if you like any of the titles: Survival, programming, first/third person, multiplayer or openworld then scrapmechanic might be for you."
7094,pogers
7095,me and my bro love this game almost 100 hrs to date
7096,very nice so SPARKY DOWNLOAD IT NOW
7097,serg
7098,"Scrap Mechanic is a sandbox game, with SOMETIMES working physics, which leads out to a really fun game.  You CAN make mechanical contraptions, engines, etc.  The survival mode is really creepy in me and my friends' opinions.  You can do many things as it is a sandbox game.  Its also fun to go onto the workshop and look at some of the other things that people have made.  Overall a good game."
7099,rdf
7100,KEEPS YOUR MIND GOING THE HOLE TIME.
7101,"good game 
"
7102,Very good game
7103,Excellent game if you like creating things from scratch. Raising gathering rates so you can move along quicker would make this one of the best games I've ever played for survival. I would recommend this game to all.
7104,"Scrap Mechanic review (EARLY ACCESS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros:
+First-person game
+When you actually create something that works it feels great

+Multiplayer
+Workshop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons:
-Could take some time to remember all the mechanics
-Survival might be boring

Do I recommend Scrap Mechanic?
Yes"

7107,great for every body easy controls
7108,donuts are tasty
7109,This game is still in early access so some of the glitc- I mean features are being worked out still but I have had some of the most fun on this game and I seriously think it has a lot of potential
7110,awesome sandbox with stuff
7111,"Highly suggest. Totally worth it. If your looking at this game and these reviews, just get it."
7112,good game if you want a engineering game and with the mods don't even worry about not having the right part for the job
7113,This game is great for those who like creating cars or other mecanical things
7114,pogers
7115,super fun
7116,yes
7117,Survival mode is kind of generic and the creative mode is a bit glitchy (especially multiplayer) but the game us very fun otherwise.
7118,i love this game because you could build anything you want and i had this game for over a year and survival is a fun mode to and in the there is challenges that you will face when ever you playing survival your goal is to defeat the haybots and thats what i love about survival i love the game thank you for making this game

7121,..
7122,"It's very fun when you are creative, in survival it could get a little boring but with friends it's fun. Creative mode is also fun to test stuff, build towns, challenges against friends. It's overall a great game I've been eyeing since first release in 2015."
7123,"I like: The freedom of creativity
I dislike: complex designs require a really good PC, really fast"

7125,fun with multiplayer

7128,"Great game! But what is so great?
Well, find out yourself! I am serious. Imo this game has so many elements to it, I guess basically everyone could have fun with it.

I can tell you what makes it great for me:
It is the modding support and the awesome modding community. 
Unleash your inner Engineer! How? Take a look at the Workshop.
Don't have Wings in the game?  Mod it!
Missing Heavy Weapons? Mod it!
Build your own Spitfire out of cardboard? Do it!

Seriously, a dogfight with potatoes is probably the most fun you can have! This tells a lot about the ways you can play this game.


However, besides that, there is a survival mode (you can also mod this :D). The survivalmode is being updated constantly over the years and it's just great how it suits the spirit of the game. So, if you aren't -the engineer-, just play survival and have a great adventure!"
7129,.
7130,this is a creative and awsome game id love to see more people play this game
7131,toilets
7132,"It is fun 
"
7133,"this is one of the best games that has ever been made, it is right up there with games like Minecraft."
7134,"A quirky and fun open-world sandbox with additional survival and challenge game-modes. Survival mode is punishing but sometimes rewards creativity, and challenge mode tests your problem solving skills. My only complaint is that developers don't announce progress very often."
7135,"I would say that this game should be the standard for physics sandbox games.  The building system is extremely simple, the physics are great, and the potential is massive.  The survival mode is excellent as well.  This is one of my most played games of all time."
7136,"[h1] [b] THE BEST GAME EVER [/b] [/h1]

Every time me and my friends try to play survival, we just end up stopping after about 15 minutes, currently it seems kinda boring and I hope the developers keep working on survival, because in my opinion, it needs some work. I still love and will continue to love this game, just survival kinda lacks in fun."

but all in all incredibly fun wither building something as simple as a house to a bipedal mech"
7175,this game is so fun
7176,"Scrap Mechanic is a game for scrap because mechanics can scrap other mechanics for scrap but dont get scraped on bc you are a mechanic and scrap is scrapping for mechanics. Also scrap is for mechanics, mechanics will take other mechanics to scrap scraps for more mechanics scrap can be scraped when the mechanic is scraped for scrap mechanic. Mechanic scrap is not scrap, you have to mechanic the scrap to get scrap from the mechanic scrap, but remember that you cant mechanic mechanics for scrap only mechanics. I recommend this game for mechanics who scrap to be mechanic scraps. This is Scramp Mejankik and i hope you consider buying scap crap."

7193,my mind is blown about this game its fun
7194,Its so fun
7195,I really like this game but it always crashes everytime i get to the axolot screen and the only solution i have found is to reinstall the game which is very inconvenient because sometimes it doesnt even work on the first reinstall. I should not have to reinstall the game every time i want to play.
7196,entertaining

7198,I LOVE IT
7199,"Good idea ruined because they went too far without fixing the suspension glitch. Would be awesome if the developers reworked the game like many other ""Early Access"" games are, it would bring back a lot of the player base and breathe fresh air into the game."
7200,This is an AMAZING game especially when you have downloaded mods too this is a great sandbox game that I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves creating things
7201,YES
7202,pretty fun if i say so myself hmm
7203,Fun
7204,well... game cool i like the building and multiplayer runs smooth... sometimes and yeh overall a fun and good time for building stuff so yeh survival mode is cool but i want more of a story to it cuz to me it just looks like the same creative but u hav to worry abouy stuff and collect but overall fun building game

If you actually wanna play this game and get attached to the worlds you have and things you build you will love to hear it will corrupt and you'll lose it all."

7269,"[h1]A charming looking world that you can fill with buildings, machines and vehicles of your own creation![/h1]

This game does not have a step-by-step tutorial for how things work. However, I feel like this is [b]intentional.[/b]

As a programmer, I have encountered a large number of design / algorithm challenges in my career. All of these challenges involved my team developing a solution. It's not like we had a guide to walk us through it.

I feel like this game gives the same approach. 

[b]YOU[/b] are supposed to solve the problem through trial and error, rather than a tutorial solving it for you. There is definitely a learning curve in this game and I don't fully understand everything, but I am excited to expand my creative design skills with it, and come up with amazing creations.

So as an engineer and a noob to the game, I would recommend it, but only if you're willing to learn."

7293,"This is the type of game where you start it on Friday afternoon and then 5 minutes later its the Monday morning.

Pros:
Building is tons of fun
Automation is challenging and rewarding.
Gameplay loop is addictive.

Cons:
Survival needs polish.
Loading times are crazy, and once the scene is ""loaded"" it still takes time to finish loading all the model skins.
Resource gathering is a painfully start. The lack of components is incredibly frustrating. I moved to scrap city as soon as I got a car that could carry a Craftbot, just to have a semi regular source of kits."
7294,the game is great. you can run into some glitches but if you play the game like its intended you wont have trubles.

7336,"This game needs to be added:

1. Please add mini map to the game. It‚Äôs too hard to find way back home or to mark any point of interest.

2. No help and support about what and where and also how. We don't know where to find things. what are those and how to use. No document! Only youtube and wiki can answer.

3. No zone information. We are lost when we wander around. We don‚Äôt know anything. No map. No zone info. Where is that. Where are these. It maybe because of it‚Äôs survival mode. It is okay but new players will leave and go better Creative mode such as my son and I did.

4. Hard to find metal. If there is no Youtube, we cannot know where to find metal.

5. After dead, all items are gone. Run to far to get back. It would be better if we rebirth on the same place after 5 seconds or friends come revive.

6. Marking point would be great. To tell our friends where to go, player should mark the destination on the map and let‚Äôs go there.

7. I am not sure what does ‚ÄúUnauthorized Farming Detected‚Äù mean? I plants veggie on the land and message often shows.

8. Trader (one who sell guns) is hard to find. No info. No marking. It takes too much playing time to reach there. If no Youtube, I never know it.

9. Enemy should have zoning. The zone for beginner should be simple and easy for them too learn how to farm and how to play. Difficulty of enemy should show up when the players are ready.

10. Voice and sound are too low. I compare when playing Fortnite. Yours is too low. I have to use wired-earphone.

11. Too dark in the night. It seems low contrast. I have to adjust Brightness to 100% and peep my garden.

12. Help and description can help. Just click ""Help"" or ""Manual to Survive"" and see what do you want to know. such as I want to know where to find honey. Open ""Manual to Survive"" -> ""Honey"" the manual will tell basic info of it and where we often find it.

I agree the game is great."

This is still a very early build, so I have hope that it will turn nice towards full release. With friends it‚Äôs extremely fun. If you buy it don‚Äôt kill the cows. You can milk them for an eternity with corn. That beef ain‚Äôt worth it."

7393,"Scrap Mechanics is a multiplayer survival sandbox game that allows you to build awesome vehicles and contraptions. Altho i haven‚Äôt played much of the new survival aspect of the game, from what I've played it's fun and engaging and adds a whole new take on the game. I've played the game quite early on in its development and I can say that it's still being frequently updated as it's still in early access. On that note I have experienced lag and hitches sometimes however since this game is still in development it is completely understandable that there are some bugs here and there. In general this game performs very well for a building sandbox game, many other games in this genre are much more taxing on my computer and it relieves me to see a game that performs this well. This game reminds me of other sandbox building games like space engineers and besiege. If i were to describe this game in terms of these other games i would say that it would be closest to besiege if it was first person and does not have the editor for building. Overall I highly recommend this game to people who love building games or anyone who just wants to have fun and create cool vehicles."
7394,very mediocre but is good over all
7395,"Crashes every 30-45 mins while doing the challenges. Doesn't save your creations, so when it crashes you have to create your machine from scratch."
7396,i like the big block of characters
7397,is good
7398,"Decent game for early access.  I am happy with the direction and as long as they keep the difficulty and the variety up, this will be an amazing game!  So many games these days cater to those that want the game handed to them, and I think that Valheim showed there are WAY more of us that enjoy a challenge.  More monsters, more biomes, more to discover, and more to build, means this game will be amazing if they can keep going.

Frankly I was never excited about it until Survival mode, and as long as that remains a challenge and has variety, I will keep on playing."

It is safe to say that this game was abandoned many years ago. There are also many other engineering games available which i will rather go to now. I will check in on 2025 when the game is out of EA. This game is an example why EA games does not work. Fix the game!!!"
7449,if you've got at least 5 brain cells and a creative mind this game will suck hours out of you like nothing else.

7451,"[h2]A quick summary[/h2]

Scrap Mechanic is a multiplayer sandbox survival game which places a large emphasis on building vehicles and machines to automate or otherwise expand your activities. The game is currently in early access, and some elements aren‚Äôt quite there just yet. As of now, there is a very limited amount of progression, and no significant story elements. Typically, it takes a long time to acquire enough resources to build vehicles or a base, and while the building is really good, the game isn‚Äôt worth it due to a variety of issues.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]

[b]Farming[/b]
Survival in Scrap Mechanic is about as simple as it generally goes. You‚Äôve got hunger and thirst as two independent bars that will drain over the course of ten to fifteen minutes, and a health bar. Run out of hunger or thirst and you‚Äôll start losing health. Get stabbed by the haybots or their buddies, and you‚Äôll also run out of health. All you‚Äôve gotta do to survive is keep the health bar from declining, and to make that happen, the first thing you need to do is eat.

While you can find some food in crates, most of it is supposed to be acquired by farming. As you explore and clear out some of the abandoned buildings, you‚Äôll find bags of soil, which can then be placed on natural terrain and planted with seeds. Crops need water, and will generally grow within the span of an in game day. At first you‚Äôll need to water the crops with buckets of water, which is agonizingly slow. Later you‚Äôll be able to automate the process with water tanks and such, typically on wheels. Extra crops can later be traded away for various other items that can‚Äôt otherwise be obtained.

On a final note, farming is used as a metric by the game for player progression, as having enough crops growing at once (around ten) will trigger nightly raids with a number of robots relative to the number of crops. It makes sense with you having more resources on paper, but it‚Äôs mostly the source of problems in other areas of the game.

[b]Combat[/b]
Since there are lots of robots, you end up doing a fair bit of fighting. Sadly, the combat is bad. In effect, you‚Äôve got health, and you‚Äôve got a hammer that you can swing when you‚Äôre not sprinting. The way it typically plays out is that you walk backwards while swinging. On occasion you may be able to jump over an attack, but nothing will really speed up how quickly you kill things. The hammer will always take five hits to kill the hay bots and three to kill the note blocks, all while being completely ineffective against anything more threatening. This is how you‚Äôll fight for the majority of the game.

Of course, you can eventually get a little better at combat. If you‚Äôve got enough component kits, you can rig up traps around your base. If you‚Äôve got a fast car and a solid bumper/saws on the front of it, you can run stuff over to some degree. More likely your resources will be used as a wall to give you enough time to hammer the bots into scrap. With mostly static and poor combat capabilities, the player simply can‚Äôt keep up with the bots if the farm is fully utilized. The combat is mostly unenjoyable, and continually becomes more of a deterrent as the game goes on.

That said, there is a gun that can be acquired through trading, which requires a decent amount of farming and raids by extension. With thirty hours in the game, my friend and I were unable to nab one of those bad boys, and ultimately grew tired of the mechanics.

[b]Exploration[/b]
To become a proper scrap mechanic, you‚Äôre going to need to get some scrap. The best place to start will be those glowing green crates of goodies in buildings. That‚Äôll score you a little food, and more importantly a random assortment of crafting materials. Past that, there‚Äôs a lot of materials you‚Äôll need from the environment around you like the wax needed for tires. To this end, the player will need to make trips out to deposits to collect some, and explore to find new sources to keep up with demand.

The trouble is that the map is randomly generated, and as a result, some resources can be incredibly difficult to find. Cotton, the resource needed to make a respawn bed, was a notable five minute drive from my base (and further from spawn). Worst of all, if you‚Äôre farming you can‚Äôt go far due to the nightly raids. That said, there isn‚Äôt all that much to find anyway. There were only a handful of buildings, and of those only a few are worth exploring. Painfully common are roads that are nearly vertical, which prohibit most vehicles from passing through. Exploration is a chore at the end of the day.

[b]Resources[/b]
Resource collection in Scrap Mechanic differs from a lot of similar games mainly in that many resources must be refined after being harvested. Trees and large stones break down into bars which need to be shaved down into usable blocks. Over time you‚Äôll be able to build vehicles to fell trees and transport the bars to a refinery to significantly increase your output, and it‚Äôs honestly quite satisfying. That said, you don‚Äôt get many blocks from each bar, and to make a halfway decent anything you‚Äôll need to go through a hell of a lot of trees and rocks to get there.

Of course, wood, stone, and metal will rarely be the bottleneck. That privilege is reserved for the ever evasive ‚Äúcomponent kits‚Äù, as they‚Äôre used for just about every interesting block, such as pistons, controllers, logic gates, motors, suspensions, item storage, and any automatic processor. While you get a decent number from looting buildings, it pales in comparison to the amount you actually need. Not only do you need a fair few to make your various facilities, but you‚Äôll need many times more to upgrade said facilities to a usable state. For instance, the gas engine can hardly move more than the basic seat and wheels without an upgrade. As such, you‚Äôll always be short on kits, which prevents you from building great vehicles or bases for much longer than you should.

[b]Building[/b]
The building is what makes this game special. Vehicles are the best way to get around, harvest resources, and automate farming. With that in mind, the system for constructing and testing these vehicles is one of the best I‚Äôve seen. Vehicles are free standing structures which can be moved (and unflipped) with the car lift every player has. In effect, the player can select any free standing structure, and teleport it on top of their lift. From there, they can raise and lower the structure as needed to help in assembly, or just remove the lift to set it back down. 

Aside from the lift, the player can pick up and move inventories and machines from one structure to another, without consequence. As a result, all you have to do to unload a truck laden with resources is to pick up the cargo containers and drop them off at your base, which saves a whole lot of time, no matter what you‚Äôre doing.

On a final note, placed blocks and structures can all be removed instantly and without loss. Misplacing a wheel or engine or sheet of blocks can be corrected in a single click, which helps a ton when working on more organic shapes. Further, old vehicles can be gutted incredibly quickly to get parts for newer ones.

All of this creates a system which makes it very easy to rapidly put together new vehicles and structures, and enables the player to quickly experiment with new blocks and functions. With that in mind, the game gives the player a wide variety of dynamic blocks to make all sorts of contraptions like drawbridges, sprinklers, and piston cars.


[h2]Conclusion[/h2]

The game has some truly great building, and looks fantastic. If it weren‚Äôt for the rest of the game, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it. That said, just about every other aspect of the game is rife with issues. Though a friend vastly improves the experience, the grind just isn‚Äôt worth it. While the issues are not present in creative mode, neither are the problems motivating contraptions. Without them, why build anything here at all?"

7476,"So you build totally cool shiza and survive farming wilderness shite. pretty good lots to do, its a creative sandbox of epicness me lads."
7477,"I really like this game. It has some beautiful graphics, a very cute art style and somewhat funny (but not necessarily game-breaking) physics. It definitely needs some polishing with the physics engine, and especially some optimization. The sound breaks in my game a lot, especially when I'm at my base. I haven't even built one that big, but I know there will definitely be some people that will make really big and complex bases/vehicles, so if it's already having issues with the first floor of my dinky little garage, it'll definitely have issues with more complex structures. Multiplayer is great, but again needs some optimizing. You absolutely have to be wired into your internet, especially if you're hosting but even if you're not, and even if you are wired directly in there's still some syncing issues. I know they're working on adding a bunch of content, which of course I'm excited for because I love this game, but I really, really hope they work on optimizing it first, or at least very soon."

7490,"It's been 5 years, the lack of content and no tutorial is a very bad way to start this game.

At first, I thought dev's need more time to fill up the contents, so I'll wait.
5 years later, the game probably took 5 steps forward, and that's all.
By it's speed of progression, it'll probably take another 15 years to become an enjoyable game."
7491,i love it because you can make anything and it takes skill my only complaint is that it doesn't give the best tutorial.
7492,very fun game.
7493,"This game allows you to use your imagination to its almost fullest potential and so you have the feeling of i made that and i did it legit if you did it in survival, i have made bases, cars, somewhat working VTOL, i even made an escape room. and the game is 20-USD so vs games like Rim World or Rust it relatively less expensive, and worth it in my opinion."
7494,definitely a game for creative minds out there that like to build vehicles to use and the survival is also pretty challenging for new player but they would get use to it fast
7495,good game

7513,"I recommend this game for those who like farming, moderate grinding, and building stuff like machinery to make things fast and efficient.

I am running this game in intel i3 (2.5hZ. 3MB L3 cache) laptop with 1760mb video memory.
I have 37 - 60 fps (playable)

Can I run this game offline? Now it can't, you have to be online to launch the game but when you're in, it doesn't matter anymore (I hope this change because I don't always have internet)."
7514,no
7515,"If ""Storm-works"","" Starbase"", and ""Space engineers"" seem to over whelming, this game is contains the fundamentals of a vehicle building game that keep it easy and fun to learn without you needing to go through 4 years of programmers college to play the game properly. the survival mode has that on the edge feeling of ""Rust"" or ""The Forest"" fit with a fluid base building system and many mobs to fight. for anyone who loves building things to solve problems this game is for you."

7519,"Although Scrap Mechanic can be frustrating at times, it's unique and unlike any other game I've ever experienced. 

Scrap Mechanic seems complicated at first, but as you play it you will begin to learn what different things do.

Some builds may lag or crash your game even on decent machines. As long as you're not spawning huge builds that usually isn't a problem.

TL;DR, Scrap Mechanic can chug on bigger builds but it's still worth every penny."
7520,"Good game, bad devs."
7521,Great game
7522,"After all this time still no proper multiplayer. All they say is ""they know there are issues"". Simply disappointing. This could be one of the best games, if they had their priorities right. This game will probably be long forgotten when it reaches a playable point. If it ever reaches it and won't get shut down half way."
7523,Great game would love if it had a propeler though when i make subs its like thruster myhem.

7525,It;s an amazing game but you also have to be kinda smart for it
7526,"You have to build everything! While it can seem a bit of a grind at first, you soon realize that you can build a mechanism to help you. Some of the mechanics can be tricky at times, but play with it enough and you'll find a way to get it done."
7527,"Scrap mechanic is very good. You can open your imagination and build anything possible.Good with friends(Dont have many) and can be a realll blast.Survival is great, the grinding is long but it pays off in the end. Only problem I find is water mechanics.Why add a type of drainage system or something when a submarine(or something similar) goes underwater and it still keeps the air.But overall, Its a fantatsic game.Theres also Ducks!"
7528,its... P E R F E C T
7529,its fun but a guy aka lando thinks its not
7530,this is the best building game i have ever played if you like building games i really recommend this game.

7533,this is fun :D
7534,"verry fun
"
7535,"This is a game I want to recommend later on. For me to do this there are a few things that need to be fixed.

First of all an overview:

[b]Pros:[/b]
- creative mode, challenge mode and survival mode
- survival has a lot to offer (though it does not seem that way at first)
- multiple solutions and room for creativity
- amazing and more or less insane creations online

[b]Cons:[/b]
- no offline playability
- difficult to start, no help in form of dialogues or guided tutorial
- survival is not endless and certain landmarks will appear again
- little variation regarding enemy types
- a few issues I will mention now

[b]Please fix: [/b]
1) The saws do not work in a good way. Cutting wood does not work e.g. when the saw is in a tree but it has to be in a certain angle and there is still trouble when you make that happen.
2) The character's neck is missing. When you do not wear the jacket, a part of the character's neck is invisible/missing.
Characters can change clothing so please change that.
3) There should be an intro and some explanation what to do/where to go at the beginning. The tone of the game is different but this should be a thing for people who start out and do not look up everything immediately. I think this should be fun without a wiki.
Later on, it is really difficult to get a single warehouse key. That should be easier to obtain.
4) The plants you grow and harvest will be attacked by robots. So far so good.
When you log out and log in again the raid counter disappears... no go.

You can have a lot of fun and build the weirdest machines but I have too many issues right now.
My recommendation: Wait for those to get fixed and enjoy it afterwards."

7538,"There are a lot of improvements that could be made to this game to make it great.  Steering, Dungeon difficulty and layout, base building options and resource management to name a few.  I would also add the lag with mining as well to that list.  The positives keep rolling though.  Great go op for parent and child as well as adults.  There is plenty of challenge and a moderate learning curve.  Looking forward to the future of this game, I just hope it doesn't take an eternity to get to it's pinnacle."

7584,The Game is super fun and lets you build anything you want but at times survival can get super grindy and if thats not for you dont worry theres always creative mode
7585,"This is my favorite game on steam!  The physics may be janky(but fun!), but the building systems let you do anything, the modding community lets you do even more of anything(mods are super easy to use, download and pick your mods to play with).  The survival mode lets you have tons of fun fighting bots, and creative mode lets you do whatever crazy shenanigans you want.  Dont like the creative map, make your own tiles, super fun!  10/10, would Reccomend!"

7598,"My long playtime is from leaving my server running for friends.

It takes a few hours to realise that what you saw in the first hour is pretty much it.

The mechanics for making a car are cool...but that's it. That's the game

Exploration is boring, combat is painful, base building is a massive grind that's undone by the mechanics around farming food.

I was pretty dirty about how long it took to realise that there's nothing here - so I cant refund."
7599,I LOVE THIS  GAME

7615,epic pooger
7616,"There is no story line.

There are no quests.

There is no real tutorial, just plain and frustraing trial and error.

The game is openworld but there is little to no incentive to actually explore, if not for the components that can rarelly drop from enemies and are a little more common when destroying chests. Components cannot be crafted, which a lazy way for the developers to force you to explore.

Exploring is boring and repetitive since there are no secret places nor collectables. No even cool places to see. The game lags a lot when loading a new chunk of the world. There are some buildings here and there, but they are all the same, copy-pasted and boring doungeon-like structure you can go to, to find some crates to break and hopefully find some components.

It's a survival game, which means you need to eat and drink (not sleep aparentelly). The ironic part of this is that the first building the game guides you too is near a river, and you cannot dring water from it. why? because, again, they are lazy and could not find a way to incentivize crop farming, so they force you to do it. In fact, you can only regain hunger and thirst from eating vegetables.
Not only that, farming crops is one of the core mechanics and actually the one if not the most frustrating thing in the game. If you are cultivating any crops, at night a new horde of enemy will spawn near your field to destry them and any other buidling near them. Multiple times enemies spawned DIRECTLY inside the farm, making it impossible to defend, and causing me to lose almost all my seeds thus making the run over. Another times an enemy decided to spawn inside my base and started destroying it from the inside...

After 13h i feel like i've basically found everything the game has to offer and is very little... It's a shame i cannot ask for a refund..."
7617,Nice
7618,"I have many hours spent on this game.  I recommend for those that like creative type games or open world games.  

Survival is the best way to play in my opinion.  You start by trying to survive, you end by creating massively complex farming tools and/or things built for fun.   I am looking forward to the planned updates."
7619,"my excitement faded after playing the game. The bad optimization that has been going on for years and the addition of less material are gradually reducing the possibilities of the game. The incredible low fps that comes from rubbing some of the blocks together has disturbed me and I am sure a lot of people. the potential of the game is great, the logic is great, but the gameplay breaks the expectation before buying the game... sometimes I want to return the game, but I'm waiting for the update to fix the game, of course it's not easy to make a game."

7693,Super fun and casual survival experience
7694,this is a great way to express your creativity
7695,"Wanted to like it but the physics just aren't there... Example, I built a paddle wheel boat and that sounds all good on paper....well there is no collision detection on the blocks in the water that make up the paddles... so i made a jet boat instead and same issue where the rudder isn't actually able to work so i had to make the jets move instead. Not a big issue but I did end up returning the game for these reasons and more. I expected more since the game was released in 2016."
7696,habeebee
7697,it is soo fun to play with friends
7698,One of the best games i have played.
7699,great game
7700,good graphics but you need a good computer to run
7701,amazing  physics
7702,Great game over all. It‚Äôs harder than it looks and can be a bit confusing at times but it‚Äôs a great game over all
7703,"Its is a game where you can be creative and build bases and fight off robots.
There is certain thing you need to do before doing another thing

"

7715,good

7717,gaem
7718,I like seeing this game get better and better with each update but also it not easy to code a game and i took 3d game classes
7719,"This is not a good game... it's one of the best I've ever played! I have played well over a hundred hours of this and it's fun, innovative and absolutely hilarious. A must buy for creative people."
7720,Hey
7721,This game is so fun and amazing!
7722,"If you are here for the survival mod: move on, not worth it."
7723,great game with lots to do
7724,This game is a bit punishing but super fun with friends.
7725,cool game
7726,"this is a great game. its quite challenging but once you get the hang of it, it can be easy. it has great graphics, sound, animations, and gameplay. it even runs great on my nearly 12 year old laptop. would recommend."
7727,Hours i wont get back. I don't mind.
7728,"great game fun survival and creative gameplay really fun for you and your friends.
"
7729,Good game but co-op is so laggy.
7730,The first time I played this I was completely addicted. Survival mode was exciting and engaging to play. Then the updates stopped coming for survival mode. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
7731,Game Doesn't Save its stupid i lost 5 days' worth of building in a challenge :steamthumbsdown:
7732,"it is great, i have watched many people play and have played, GREAT GAME,"
7733,"Fun game, has a few bugs but overall is fun to play and build in. Highly recomended."
7734,"good game i like it, BUT FIX THE FUCKING MULITPLAYER EVERYTHING I BUILD HAS A FUCKIGN SEIZURE IF I SPAWN IT IN IN A FREIND'S SERVER AND ITS DRIVING ME FUCKING INSANE"

7747, i got the game to play the new survival game mode but then saw that it was grinding and had no point
7748,great game
7749,very good
7750,The team is working on making this game better and better. I like it a lot. Especially the survival game mode.
7751,123
7752,Wonderful and with the new parts soo cool
7753,good game
7754,Amazing game
7755,"it fun try it
"
7756,"This is a great game and the best thing about it is that you can create anything in a hour of gameplay.....so i have an idea.
I don't know if the devs see this but I have a new plant weapon for survival.(please dont steal this idea anyone, you can make a mod for it but please don't plagiarize my idea) OK so the idea is a onion. Its an onion grenade, its endame (post warehouse) and the seeds are with the pineapple and broccoli and it takes the same amount of time to grow. it does around the same damage as the small explosive and has a five second cool down before it explodes, but there's a twist. after it explodes a ball of GREEN gas (like the farmbots chemical cannon) comes out of it and lasts for 4-5 seconds before dissipating, if your character walks into this gas then you will lose hydration -5 each second. this is just an idea but it sounded really good to me.

P.S. its in stacks of 20"
7757,is cool multiplayer is laggy sometimes
7758,"Loved this game, No hate for this game"
7759,spud shotgun go brrrrrrrrr
7760,"i`ts so good,i like game

7766,yes
7767,it is good game
7768,fun but only took me and my friend like 4 days to complete the entire game and now its just boring
7769,the best game I've ever played.
7770,"good fun, got old quick but i keep comin back to it ,
i love it."
7771,"Really good game you can build veichles air, naval and land.  You can do lots of challenges and have mods and I play this game a lot really fun I reccomend"
7772,"Fun, just made my dog commit suicide tho"
7773,"I like the freedom and the ability to make land, sea and air vehicles. Only problem is lag, especially in multiplayer. Overall though, definitely worth the download!"
7774,this game is very fun and enjoyable
7775,is fun
7776,crazy and funny stuff.  This is my favorite game!!!!
7777,This Is Possibly The Best Early Access Survival And Creative Game Ever!im exicted for the next chapter
7778,fun to play survival if you know what you're doing and it's also fun to mess around in creative with friends
7779,DAWDWAD
7780,I liked the free choice of the game
7781,"Great game, would recommend.  Updates are a little slow."
7782,"This game was and is a game i want to play, I'm really glad I got it even tho there is a few gameplay issues and glitches. I highly recommend trying things out in creative to learn the game before hopping into survival. This game is far from done and I really can't wait to see where this game goes in the future. I hope anyone who plays this game will enjoy it as much as I do."
7783,this game is amzing so you should play it
7784,"Great game! But a tiny, tiny bit more updates needed. Like the rendering engine needs to be faster and then i can play survival at decent framerates. Physics engine should be updated because we always have random bounces on wheel with suspension. And the steam API connection should be updated so that my friends won't have trouble joining. Anyhow, the game is *WOW* amazing! I've played this game for about 376.8 hours when i posted this review.
"
7785,"god gam
i lik it"
7786,good
7787,i can launch bombs across the map
7788,great game
7789,"You know. I didn't think I'd like this game. But the more I play, the funner it gets. I am having so much fun learning different builds and creating a whole bunch of different creations."
7790,fun
7791,very good
7792,fun
7793,I think its very hard in some aspects (which I dont mind) and you almost always gotta play with someone else so thats a downfall but I like it at the same time it just needs some tlc.

7811,it a big time fun time
7812,u-u
7813,ik heb wel goed een paar mechanics gescrapped 10 van de 5 sterren
7814,"This Is a amazing game. The game provides a unique experience where in the survival mode you have to manage resources, farm, build vehicles, and trade. You can also play in creative where you can experiment with different vehicles, farms, and traps."
7815,good game
7816,fun
7817,man this game is good
7818,grate game to play and build
7819,This game is fucking dog shit PLEASE DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY PLEASE LISTEN TOOOOO MEEEEEEEEE IM NOT JOKING DONT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7820,"It's an absolutely beautiful game for engineering minds, I scroll from idea to idea half finishing a lot, saving and going back over ideas. I absolutely love it."
7821,gud gaem
7822,Its very Fun.
7823,built a flying cock
7824,huh
7825,this is so fun and cool and challenging and even a little spooky with the robots but i recommend this to people who might be wanting a game where they can let there imagination and creativity free.
7826,its really fun but a bit hard when it comes to killing the robots
7827,it was fun. kinda laggy in multiplayer though. might just be my internet
7828,super game
7829,nerf tapenots pls
7830,because
7831,k
7832,"Really Fun Game, but it could do a lot more to show new players the core mechanics, new players may find it hard to do tasks such as find the battery in survival, and an interactive tutorial rather than a book could be better for creative."
7833,"THE BEST GAME EVER!!! If you are interested in engineering then this is the game for you, you can make complicated mechas and also make factories that actually transport stuff."
7834,"Yes.
"
7835,"cool game, would suggest making it not as hard for players without spudgun to kill farmbots, component kits are ridiculously hard to get despite it being needed for half the recipes, but other than that its pretty good and creative is good too"
7836,Very creative gameplay! would definitely recommend this to any player who loves building games
7837,Playing this game in 2021 is almost impossible with friends. Just being in a world without any creations causes more lag than running 300+ mods on Minecraft.
7838,Yes.
7839,it's fun
7840,"great game, the multieplayer is somewhat laggy if u  dont have the best wifi but other then that it is amazing"

7844,fun
7845,the most realistic physics engine around
7846,fun game but laggy
7847,"Great game, very fun to play and check out others builds."
7848,Good game worth the money. Some people might think its a bit buggy but i think its fine
7849,LOVE THE GAME
7850,Boring after 30 minutes
7851,didn't have much fun and is kinda boring
7852,good game for creative people
7853,"Hands down one of my all time favourite games.

Where do I start? This is one, very unique, survival game that revolves mostly around constructing vehicles to explore the world. It's very rewarding and satisfying and really allows one to unleash their creativity to the fullest. 

The game has a fun art style that fits it's gameplay perfectly. 

It is still very much in development although there is already so much to do! Would definitely recommend to anyone with half a creative mind. Worth every penny!"
7854,great game and ive played over 90 hours and it great for all types of gamers calm or intence
7855,it rips your pc apart

7891,very epic gamers
7892,"Good game
"
7893,fun
7894,stop telling me to write something I just want to rate this game
7895,"fight retired seemingly useless spider robots, farming robots i think are zombies, rogue packaging robots, rogue packaging robot but explosion go boom, and massive murder robots that really should have never been used for farming, in an attempt to grow oranges bananas and other various fruits and vegitables so you can give them to a suprisngly skilled in survival farmer along with caged humans you find in the forest so you can get more cloths and seeds.  thats only one part of the game, but all of its amazing.   10/10 would reccomend to anyone and everyone, if you like games in general youll find fun in atleast one of its brilliant game modes.  i wish i had freinds that played this, im so lonely.  oh yeah it has multiplayer.  anyway im gonna go farm the poop of a glowb."
7896,GOOD GAME
7897,i pressed thumbs up and now steam is forcing me to right this
7898,Yes and no...
7899,I love this game I just wish there would be a Deattacher or something like that
7900,"its a bit unstable as of late but this is a great game if you love to design and find ways to automate everything great for just chilling with friends aswell

7914,"Basic game is great, well over 100 hours and still feeling like so much to do. Huge grind, so keep that in mind if your not a fan of games like that. The mod community though is what makes it real though. With the VERY VERY slow updates from the dev's - i truly believe its the modders that keep things going."
7915,grate game
7916,you can build things and it's cool
7917,this game was super fun for the time i had it and would recomend but make sure you have freinds or else this game might get a little lack luster in terms of content. What i mean by this is that the game is bare and doesnt feel finished but then again it isnt. if you have lots of freinds or just being creative then you most likily will enjoy the game. but after saying this i must say that if you play lots of other games then buy this on sale. you will get at least 20 hours of enjoyment but at the time i have to lay this game to rest for lack of content. hope this helped you figure out if you wanted this game or not. have fun!
7918,it was great   :)
7919,pizza
7920,is good
7921,"Its totally worth the money, just buy it."
7922,"it takes a bit of getting used to but my favoritve thing to do is to make good andling or extremly fast cars
"
7923,great concept. really fun mechanics. keeps it very open for creativity. cant wait for story update in survival. only down side is the learning curve. hard to learn at first but once you have the basics your good and can let your mind run wild.
7924,Hehe

7952,Hey what can i say its fun. Survival is a bit difficult but I'll figure it out.
7953,"Gra bardzo fajna i relaksujƒÖca, z realistycznym systemem fizyki i budowania. Polecam!"
7954,"its lots of fun ill say ill play this for hours im just saying you shold downlode it you will not regretit so tbonist i do'not speak for you all so hope this is yous full so hope you have a good day or night i dont know

7955,"no
"
7956,Cool game but it sucks that it lags so much when constructions are too close to each other :(
7957,"we gota make the dick cars 
THE DICK CARS"
7958,"Game is fun, but one of the most important pieces in the game (component kits) can't be crafted, or bought and is rare to loot at best. The game requires that you eat and drink often. For some reason you can't drink the water that is everywhere on the map, but you do get water from the food you eat so it's not too bad because farming is easy. However, unless you intend to ensure you are at your base every 20 min on the long end you can't set plants to grow and go explore the furthest reaches, because the bots somehow magically detect your farm if you have more the 3 or so plants and sent bots to attack it. It's an annoyance and pretty much sucks all of the enjoyment out of the game."
7959,"Scrap Mechanic is a wonderful game.
You can create anything your imagination can come up with; whether it be an oil derrick, or a powerful trophy truck. You can create planes, boats, mechs, and so much more. I love survival mode, but the lack of content, end-game activities and goals makes it hard for me to want to return to the game after having the perfect vehicle and base setup. There is no real story other than the fact that you have crash landed on a farming world where all the automata that are supposed to maintain and work the farms on said world are malfunctioning and are now hostile."
7960,It is a very fun and technical game which is what I like so that is why I recommend it to people of all ages especially younger people like me as it opens up an entirely new world for us to develop in.
7961,"its a amazing game where you can let your imagination run wild

one of the best games ever"
7962,"it gud

7970,"Great game, lots of potential.  To laggy for large projects so keep them simple."
7971,"Amazing game. The endless possibilities of creative and the more strict survival mode makes scrap mechanic perfect for anyone who likes to build. I have made some really cool creations from trains, to boats, to flying machines. and what the game cant offer, the community supplies with mods for anything you need. Truly a one of a kind game. Best played with friends :D"
7972, i like this game its good very fun super roket ship donkey awesome game
7973,Is good
7974,my system sucks so i cap out at 28fps. i hope the Devs work on game optimisation soon but other then that it is a very good game.
7975,This game is good as long as you have good enough Imagination
7976,vbuild funny car and plane and tank and boat and submarine and building and penis
7977,very fun be creative many things you can do!!!
7978,It's a game that lets you be creative!
7979,fun and creative
7980,"The blocks don't attach to each other when you build and often just fall apart, as well as the game being very laggy with explosions, even if they are small."
7981,"It is a good engineering game. It has a survival, challenge, and creative mode. All of these are very fun with creative being creativity, survival being challenging and fun, and challenge mode being a gamemode to play if you want to test your building skills."
7982,"honestly this game has gotten worse over time, 0/10 never play again"
7983,fun game but i find that the survivel mode is to hard it would be great if they added hardnes levels
7984,i like the GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7985,Pretty good ez recommend.
7986,gud
7987,"As much as I would like to love this game, as it has great potential; one of the core game modes is not in a realistically playable state: Survival Multiplayer.  You and one other person only have the leeway to each build a couple vehicles before the game slows to a crawl - presumably brought to its knees by physics calculations - despite having all unused vehicles welded to the terrain in an attempt to alleviate the issue.  There is no leeway to create anything more substantial than barebones, steerable vehicles if you want acceptable performance in SMP.  Should one become too ambitious in their builds, for example; attempting to construct a mining or lumber processing vehicle in addition to a couple other cars (welded to terrain when not in use); The game will quickly become unplayable.  We saw a drop to 5-10 fps at times, and occasionally, all joints and bearings will collapse, leaving you seated in a heap of twitching scrap, as the physics engine apparently gives up on keeping things together.

Creating vehicles is fun, and it seems like the game is great if you and a buddy were content with importing builds into creative mode to fool around.  But, if you desire SMP play where you must build a base, farm, and devise contraptions to extract resources with any degree of complexity - Scrap Mechanic, in its current iteration, simply cannot handle it.

(And for any wondering; No, we don't have potatoes for our gaming rigs.)"

8014,"I've played this game for 24 hours. I purchased this game from the beginning in 2016. I liked the premise, I saw the potential, and every so often I'd check back in to see what kind of progress has been made. 

Well, fast forward 5 years and I check back in with a beefy PC, and what do I find? A load of trash.

I keep crashing to desktop by just playing the damn game. I can't bind my mouse 1-5 without the game insisting that I'm pressing Ctrl Shift & Alt, in all various configurations of said buttons. 

This game is trash. The developers are trash. Don't buy from these Devs and don't buy Trash Mechanic."
8015,Fun.

8022,"It is very interesting and addictive sandbox. Here you can just have fun on selfmade car with your friends as well as go deeper and do any logical mechanisms etc. But this game is not very optimized and have a lot of bugs (it's still early access). For me survival mode is less interesting than creative mode. So, i recommend SM for fans of sandbox genre."
8023,This is a great game. 10/10 would play and buy again. I am a little upset that no updates or chapters have come in a while though.
8024,CAR
8025,good game and all but i was trying to play it today and it doesn't show my full screen only half of it

8063,5 stars
8064,I Find Scrap Mechanic Worth It And Fun Because 2 Reasons Survival Mode And Being Able To Play With Friends. I Highly Recommend If You Have Some Friends That Are Intrested In Survival Type Games.
8065,just do it Just Do it JUST DO IT NOW                                                                             XD soz for caps
8066,BIG CAR JUICE
8067,"game very fun I love to build I like the survival mode the most. but I would like a rope to be added so that more cranes and winches could be made to facilitate the retrieval of vehicles from, for example: oil, water, and chemicals. and e.t.c  thank you for the word and I recommend the game very much."
8068,"is fun and after experimenting, learning and joining the community you can really make some cool and creative stuff!
for example i had experimented around with making a hover craft, then went and learnt more about how sensors work and then i checked the community for tips and how to make the suspension glitch then did a bit of engineering and experimenting, and now i have my own no wheels car!
its also pretty educational because you learn about buoyancy and density of different materials as well as engineering."
8069,As good as I imagined it to be
8070,it is a cool game and heres a tip for raft mechanic: get the pick not the axe first it will give you metal 1 to make scrap metal xd
8071,"   This game is really good! It's story concept is unique (about as unique as robots taking over a planet can get). The bot designs are really cool especially the upcoming Trash Bot. Sure, the updates may take forever, but you gotta remember that they're only a 13 person group and that they put a lot of effort into there updates. The replay ability is pretty high. The creative mode is good too, and with all the fantastic mods that are available, it can get even better. It can get a bit buggy tho. Overall 10/10, Cook Bot kiss."
8072,
8073,i like :)
8074,10/10
8075,VERY FUN BUT scary
8076,pretty good ngl
8077,Terrible game
8078,If you've an Engineering degree and jobless.This is the best place
8079,"Bought this cause I like survival crafting games.
Patches/fixes are very few and more focused on creative mode gameplay.
Last update was a year ago.
Survival mode needs more attention.
Lag is a big issue in this game.
Also -when building flying vehicles I really don't want to be dependent on suspension glitches to be able to fly without flipping over. Yes i know about gyros. They are not good unless building huge ships the size of arizona desert.
And vehicles keep sliding unnaturally on slopes almost like the tires was made of ice.
Quite irritating when trying to mine iron.
If they iron out the bugs in this game I might change my review.
Until then I have to NOT recommend this unless you catch it on sale."
8080,you can make a table that spins and shoots bugs
8081,this is a good game if you have a lot of creativeity
8082,its nice
8083,"It's a super good game! It has good graphics. But sometimes laggy if you build big stuff. And also a slow developers team. But I love the phisics. And the creative way you are forced to think. I rate this game an 8 out of 10. If they make more updates on the progress of development and just more updates. Even small fixes. Like the horn ui that hasn't been fixed in like idk how long. And also, if they make the game more compatible with older computers I would make it an 10. All in all worth the money. I have 1000 hours in this game. Not every hour has been completely smooth as in design. But totally worth it in the end!"
8084,"It's really fun, you can make whatever you want with endless possibilities and survival mode is epic too. I highly recommend playing it."
8085,"Loved messing around with friends on this derpy build sandbox, the workshop has a lot of fantastic builds. Highly recommended."
8086,grate game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8087,this game is great for your creativity and its just all in all a great game
8088,"building massive dick cars
"
8089,"It's still in Early access at the time of review but the wife and I have a blast with this little gem.  I spent 4 hours trying to perfect the buoyancy of a boat, my wife built a bridge.  Have fun finding the answer to the problems you encounter."
8090,its fun
8091,"I would recommend this game to anyone, even if they don't plan to dive into the extreme intricacies of it (such as logic gates, which for some reason I cannot comprehend) it is a blast to build simple cars and strap an immense amount of thrusters to them to see how far they will fly when launched off of a mountain, or when you hit a tree or the world border how fast it will ricochet. This game is fun when you are alone, but it really goes up a notch when you add other people. Let's just say, with my friends at least, chaos commences.

Some things that I like about this game specifically, are the complex level that you can attain when designing  and constructing your machines, the art style, and the accuracy (or inaccuracy, at certain times) of the physics.
The only two things that I have a problem with in this game is the multiplayer lag, which isn't a big deal with good internet and a fast hosting PC, and the learning curve to mastering all of the components.

I would buy this game again, 9.5/10"
8092,a great way to build whatever you want
8093,"I love the freedom, you get to do almost anything."
8094,agree
8095,its pretty fun! me and my friends like to play this together

8113,Honestly a very fun an hilarious game. I've spent so much time just messing around with my friend and having a great time. This game is absolutely worth the buy! :)
8114,"It's fun
"
8115,no controler support
8116,Epic game needs a better tutorial/ guide and has to be more rewarding
8117,like mine craft and other survive games but with more to do and robots
8118,a amazing game for how far it has got into development. even if some say that you should not get it because it is still in somwhat early mid stages of development its a real big thing already! if you dont get it you are crazy because of how good it is and how much there is in its future.
8119,game is great not much of a story but thats not why i think people buy this game the mechanic part is where its at i dont know the mulitplayer cap but ive seen over 4 people play it at once so it has the ability to be very fun
8120,"nice
"
8121,phun
8122,"This game has a ton of potential. The mechanics, physics, and vehicle building around it are super great and really interesting. Creative mode is probably worth your time, especially if you play with friends. However, it does have its problems. There is a lack of a lot of basic quality of life features. There is not much of a tutorial, you have to constantly flip things in your inventory/quickbar, and the parts list is very limited. 

I cannot recommend survival mode. It's generally clunky and dissatisfying, and exploration feels mostly pointless. There is no real story arc or endgame. The game is in early access so perhaps it will improve, but it has been in early access since 2016 so I doubt it.  Pick this up if you want a sandbox to build some neat contraptions, but don't expect to get much more out of it."

8130,Very fun
8131,"Scrap Mechanic is a interesting, fun, and quirky game for creative people and tinkerers. It is not ideally optimized, and multiplayer is a bit buggy, but over all it does what it says on the box. It runs great through Steam's Proton for GNU/Linux"
8132,kak kaker kakste
8133,"buggy mess, but worry not, as this games full 1.0 version will probably finally drop in only 37 years :) good to see that developers like this still keep up the good work after getting so much sales revenue, im glad they are not the type to use all of these resources for, i dont know, maybe hookers and cocaine instead of just finally finishing the game and meeting the consumers expectations uwu"

8161,"This game is very good as you can build almost everything  you want.  As long as you have the specs and a big imagination, this is and obvious game to get.  It's also low storage, so anyone can fit it onto the computer."

8165,car go brrrrrrrrrr
8166,fun
8167,WOW
8168,very much wow
8169,"Tons of fun progressing through survival, building up your vehicles and a base with friends is really satisfying, and the surprising turn to a hardcore tactical shooter after so many hours in is an interesting choice that leaves open a lot of possibilities."
8170,.
8171,It is a good game i played for hours and i liked it very much yes very creative so you should play it yeah yeyeyeye
8172,very good also check out scrapman on yt
8173,"YES
"
8174,its the best mechanical sandbox game i have played so far.
8175,yes
8176,"its a fun creative sandbox that you can do whatever you want, it has challenges survival and creative, great game"
8177,"I fine the game grate bekose you can make stuff form you minde in to a fing you cann lock at in 3D and the grafigs are also nice
"
8178,good game
8179,"good game to kill time, buy the friends DLC for more fun"
8180,fytfhiutytytyty
8181,get the game. the game is good. this is the best game ever. i don't have enough room to write why this game is amazing. it. just. is. buy it.
8182,it is amazing get it it is worth it
8183,"This game is really cool but lacks focus, if they updated survival mode to have some kind end goal this game would be better. that being said its fun and I recomend it"
8184,yes
8185,.
8186,.
8187,gud
8188,I like you get to build your own vehicles and stuff and shooting and defending and traps......but the game makes it so complicated and no manual that you have no idea what to do and if you did it would cost alot of stuff just to make it and it takes out the fun and everything in the begining
8189,i stayed up for 111 hours and its true
8190,Its a good game
8191,a very fun game that doesn't take much processing power to run well and you can create anything you want basically
8192,Game has real potential. Pretty fun for the first 20hrs of game play but after that you run out of any goals to hit. Trader needs more things to do and more POI's with loot. Looking forward to more of the game soon as a good update drops for it with more things to do.
8193,this game is awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8194,"Nice game, contents are vast, now dev have to look into optimization and some QOL."
8195,it'a fun game
8196,A great game for anyone who enjoys games like Minecraft or Terraria but found the engineering in those games lacking. While Scrap Mechanic has its glitches and can be difficult to run I would say it is worth it.
8197,"this game is good, but it lags if you don't have a good PC."
8198,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMmmmmmmM monke
8199,"game fun, like game"
8200,"I got this game many years ago. It's been over five years, and it's still not close to being finished.

This has happened with a bunch of games I've bought, so most of the time I just move on and don't bother with reviews.

The difference this time is that I've been watching Nextlander play the Scrap Mechanic challenge mode in multiplayer, and I've never been more frustrated watching SOMEONE ELSE play a game. Constant crashes resulting in having to rebuild entire vehicles from scratch, building parts disappearing requiring full resets of challenges (and rebuilding of vehicles from scratch), vehicles remaining on after being reset so they immediately drive away repeatedly until you either reset the map entirely or chase them down to turn them off, no quality of life features like the ability to save/reload vehicles... All in a game that has been in early access for over half a decade. Insane.

I don't often get on soapboxes about things like this, but there's just no excuse for that. The game is an absolute mess. Looking at the update history, it appears to be in ""We'll release an update every few months to keep up appearances and then quietly abandon it"" mode, which again, is deplorable considering how many copies it's sold. It's made an absolute ton of money. There's no excuse for the incredibly poor support it's received."
8201,funny bearing go brrrrrrrrr
8202,"I love this game a lot. You can do so much in it!
Pick from three of the following options: Survival, Creative, and Challenge.
Fun game to play by yourself or with friends"
8203,this is a very fun game to play and  i would recomend but the multey player is very laggy so if u plan on playing 2 player it will be very laggy
8204,.
8205,game is amazing 100% worth it
8206,"i like the game because you can do whatever you want, but in survival i feel like the tape bots are just way too op because they do 55 damage"
8207,"Its a fun game! its worth the $20 this game costs. and if/when you put this game on consoles, you should make it so when you open the game, you get a free code to get the game on any console you want! (and this only happens once.)"
8208,"Needs an insane combat overhaul.  Combat feels arduous and unfair.  enemies constantly bum rush you and just take your health down fast.  With lack of healing and food items in the beginning area, it becomes a little harsh at times.  I refunded this game but I hope that's not where I leave this game because at the base of it, it's very fun.  Just needs many quality of life changes and just a complete overhaul of mechanics.  I don't have much to say of the advanced crafting and such as my friend and I got quite annoyed at the game and returned it."
8209,"yes

8223,This game is very fun if you like sandbox games and if you're very creative. you can make very cool machines  and they can become very complicated. you do need a good pc if you like 30 fps or more
8224,It is a veryyyyy enjoyable game!

8238,I made a missile that crashes the game help
8239,dog
8240,"If you like Minecraft and especially the Create Mod, You would LOVE this game. Pretty much you start out on a crashed ship then scavage resources to create a vehicle and then you drive to a mechanics station. After that  you can craft a better crafting machine which will start the game for real. So many little components which you can combine to make cool stuff like flying ""helicopters"" and planes, speedboats, cool bases and a bunch of other stuff.

I would 100% Recommend this game. If you are willing to spend some time gather resources."
8241,good game. unlimited possibilities.
8242,it is a very good survival/creative game
8243,this game is very fun but i reccomend watching a youtube video on it before just so you know what to do. Also i recomend playing with a friend or two

8254,it very goood
8255,"I can make a giant flying cock, but the game needs optimization."
8256,"buy some friends, its more fun that way"
8257,"This game started as a small thing, slowly building up the first thing I owned on this account or my only steam account, I slowly stopped playing this game as my GPU and CPU were outdated but over time I played more because of a new engine that fixed most of the problem then heard of a survival and was hyped so I waited... for four years until it finally came out my 100H quickly jumped to 170H while having the time of my life, 9/10 amazing game"
8258,SIBL IKE
8259,the amount of creativity put into the world and mechanics of the game also on a bad note a lot of bugs that need fixing
8260,Bathtub gaming
8261,Nagyon fincsi nagyon jo
8262,Simple and fun. Can build cool things.
8263,fast boat car good yes
8264,"This is another example of a game that would benefit from something between a thumbs up and thumbs down. The ideas this game is aiming for a great and something I would recommend but in it's current state it is missing a lot of features that I honestly don't expect will make it in anytime soon. Right now this game does terrestrial vehicles quite well with your main mechanics simulated being tension and weight distribution, however there are no atmospheric/drag/fluid sims in the game so anything beyond a vehicle with 4 wheels is going to be a janky mess. Boats are pretty much out and can only realistically be made using a flat plane and the same rocket thruster piece used in ""flying"" machines that coincidentally don't really have the kind of support or mechanics needed to make them interesting. Where the game does shine however is with the use of sensor blocks that do in fact recognize movement from objects on pistons which opens up some clever work arounds to create logic gates and a pseudo interpreter switch. But again the rest of the game is just seriously lacking and halfway to being a good vehicle construction sim. Something I would consider more feature complete in terms of simulations the players machine can interact with would be a game like besiege, where drag and mass are more dynamically accounted for in creations. Also don't bother with the survival mode of this game it is a total joke and waste of time."
8265,"I don't know how this game works


how

8266,this gae
8267,"Definitely still feels very Beta, but I'm enjoying it. I've only played survival mode, and the first several hours were a bit meh. I was intrigued, but also felt so limited in what I knew how to do that I wasn't sure what to aim for. While I learned that there is a pretty helpful wiki, there isn't a lot of in-game info to help you along or tell you what you should do. Eventually I got far enough along and started building things that actually move, and that's where the game really took off for me. It is so fun to be able to build vehicles, add your own suspension systems, experiment with different drive configurations and feel how they affect the driving dynamics. I've watched some videos of other people playing through, and while they can be a little overwhelming in their complexity, they also provide a lot of motivation and new ideas in how to play the game.

I believe I got the game on sale for like $10-15. $20 feels like a bit much for what it is currently, but I'd say what I paid was fair, and $20 will probably be a solid price once the game is out of Beta.

Long story short, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival builder type games where you have tons of freedom in what you can build, how it can move, etc."
8268,bananas are good but scrap machenic is good-er
8269,I have 306 hours on steam.
8270,"This game is awesome to play. This game you can make cars, planes, and more but i don't like the survival mode"
8271,so gam fune yes so fun for fr
8272,Good creative game that keeps you entertained for hours on end
8273,"Over 5 years in early access. Updates are not that often. It's still missing a lot of QOL features for survival. They could easily do little updates such as adding some different shape blocks for us to be creative with (Look at space engineers block selection and see how far behind these guys are). It still has broken physics and you just get excuses from the dev team on why they can't get it to work properly. It could be an incredible game if it was in the right hands. From what I can see, it will be in early access for at least a couple more years."

8275,"[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]
+ Make your own vehicles, block by block.
+ Create your own machinery with their own unique purpose.
+ Build using micro-blocks, giving you the ability to be more creative.

[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]
- Constantly have to eat and drink, where these resources are scarce.
- Building a farm to get food will send robot raids to attack you.
- Robot raids are way too frequently.
- Robot raids are extremely difficult to stop.
- Trees do not regrow.

[i]Honestly, the only reason I bought this game is for it's survival mode. Unfortunately it needs loads of work. You're constantly starving and growing food takes time. While you're waiting and dying, robots are spawning in masses destroying your food. It's just a frustrating and annoying cycle that needs work.[/i]"
8276,everything is nice it isnt that hard to understand and and does need a decent laptop/computer to run on minimal graphics. I do have trouble running the game cause my laptop isnt trash but otherwise i have played it on a better laptop and it is fun to play with friends. So all around i say give the game a try it is amazing but sadly i cant play it on my laptop cause how low my fps is and how slow it is but it is a good game so i say try it out

8349,"This game is actually amazing, I love the art style, survival is phenomenal, creative is fun, especially with friends, and challenge mode is great fun, and helps you understand the mechanics of the game much better. Scrap Mechanic's approach to building vehicles and other contraptions is easy to learn but hard to master, and for the most part, you can make anything you can think of, as long as you're good enough at building. I definitely recommend Scrap Mechanic, especially at it's low price tag, and I personally can't wait for more content."

8352,Bien Bueno
8353,the game itself is very enjoyable other than a few bugs that I've experienced. id only suggest expanding the how to ply section to have some more info about survival as unless you watch videos of others playing the game you may never figure out certain mechanics in the game that aren't ever explained by the game itself
8354,"If you ever want to play a creative,survival game Here is the game for you ,its fun on both survival and creative it has electrical functions and many more"
8355,VERY GOOD GAME I SPENT HOURS ON IT  I FOUND IT DIFFICULT BUT I COMMITED AND I GOT A GOOD RESULT PLEAS PLAY THIS GAME IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE

8357,The Game is good But i would say the i Wish itnhad more Update im Not saying IT Bad or good. But when survival came Out i was Happy But when i played IT for a while IT get boreding. And If your a creative type i would say get IT But If your Not the creative type i would say try it

8393,"Do not play this game.

There‚Äôs no mid or endgame. No progression on armor or skills. The only progression is the weapon you work for, and then after that there‚Äôs literally only one thing you can do with it which is raid a warehouse with 2-4 floors that literally only gives u soil and a few random parts for you vehicle in the end but‚Ä¶. WHAT IS THE POONT OF THESE PARTS IF THERES NOTHING TO DO??? No biomes. Just allllllll grass, maybe a little bit of farmland here and there of hay but its so minimized. The game is bad and dont play it.

8416,I build things in this and my friends keep destroying them. They'll regret it.
8417,"1) Farm raids are broken.  There's no midnight notification, so your entire farm can be destroyed without you even knowing.  This game is impossible to recommend until they fix this horrible issue.

2) The building system is great, but it fights you far more than it aids you.  Not being able to connect switches and mechanical devices from different creations together is especially egregious.  I just want to make a garage door, for fuck sakes, why does it have to be so impossible?

3) No achievements."

8454,"It's got some fantastic ideas and design, but any time you try to actually build something meaningful beyond a small go-kart or something, it kills your framerates.  As long as you don't want to make anything legitimately cool, you'll enjoy this game.  Otherwise, it's a broken, unplayable mess."
8455,minecraft but better
8456,its a really fun game and with friends its even better although survival is kinda slow and the dev team is super slow with updates like slower than minecraft but still fun
8457,GOOD

8459,Just not great overall
8460,It has limitless possibilities and super fun!
8461,"Scrap Mechanic is a game of creativity. This is a skill that a lot of people take for granted, and this helps make you realize that it is good to be creative. I would certainly recommend this game to others. This game is so good, that it could inspire other non-creative people (like me) to become more creative. All in all, this is truly a spectacular game."
8462,"Very good game, fun building mechanics fun with mods also"
8463,Backwards cows. glow children worms. weird builds. good game.

8482,yes
8483,"Rating 3.5/10

The good stuff:
The game's graphics are pretty decent,
Game runs smoothly on a run of the mill gaming PC.
That's about it. 

The bad stuff:
Combat is wonky.
Zero Tutorial in game, it provides a basic handbook on keybindings.
Inside the handbook is a link to a ""Tutorial"" video on youtube, where the guy is playing on an out of date version of the game, on creative mode. 
Spent the first 5 minutes looking up online how to do what, when, and where.

Audience? Anyone that wants to try it I guess.

Quality? I returned it, but I'd say if you want to give it a chance, go for it. I didn't particularly like it as you can see. Doesn't mean you won't."
8484,"Fun game. I've seen other reviews saying ""not recommended"" because evidently, they say it gets boring after you master it. But mastering it is well worth the price of the game."

8497,"[h1][b]‚Ää[u]Scrap Mechanic Review After 24 Hours of Gameplay[/u][/b][/h1]
[h1]About the game[/h1]
          Scrap Mechanic is a game mainly about creating inventions and vehicle like cars, planes, and mechs. There are three game modes in this game. Creative, Survival, and Challenge mode. Creative lets you freely build inventions in this game with all the items. Survival is a game mode where you have to survive and destroy robots and you can hunt for other resources in this game mode to survive these robots. In this game mode you can also explore different areas and bases in the game. In challenge mode the game has you build things with a limited amount of blocks to see if your invention can pass the challenge.
[h1]Review[/h1]
           This game has tons of content to offer and with that you can get even more context from the steam workshop like blocks, items, tiles (terrain tiles), terrain assets, and challenge packs. Custom challenge packs can let you experience different challenges different from the basic building challenges. If you don't want to spend a ton of time making vehicles then you can also get some from the steam workshop making the game even better and more fun for other people. The way this game works with the steam workshop is one huge thing I love about this game. The developers update this game often so that you don't have to worry about the game lacking updates. The only issue is that when you get really wild with you inventions the game lags and gets really glitchy so you probably want to have a good computer to play this but you don't have to for example if you play survival it doesn't really need a good PC. In the end this game is so fun and has a lot of content in the base game and lets you have even more with the steam community I have to say that this game belongs in everyone's inventories. It doesn't even matter what type of game people play, I think everyone can enjoy playing this game."
8498,"Its good
"
8499,"Really fun, but way more fun with friends"
8500,I just love this game it's amazing
8501,sauhbyhujaht
8502,"very fun 
"
8503,"This is one of the best games I've ever played, the building is spot on. The updates are amazing and the survival is just... Spot on."
8504,really good building survival/creative game
8505,"I should have bought this game sooner!
Its fun and keeps you busy!"
8506,"This game really itches that old Lego Racers / Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts itch when you just want to build a scrap monstrosity and see how it runs.

Survival mechanics are pretty fun too, I enjoy the exploration and resource gathering even if it's quite grindy at the start.

The art style is fantastic, light hearted and a fun environment to play in.

The devs keep adding content too so I must recommend it since it's only ¬£10-¬£15."
8507,Love this game so much if you like bilding you should play this game
8508,"with enough speed, you can knock the teeth out on your own character in a car, just speed up then stop, repeated quickly and your char will get whiplash XD

Modding could use a facelift in the ""support"" department, but other then that, pretty awesome.

I enjoy this game pretty much.

Survival mode makes it worth the money!"
8509,"I was watching a video of a semi truck get into a near-accident and mid video I caught myself analyzing the truck like ""is that a leaf-spring or air-spring suspension""

10/10 this game has obliterated the way i look at vehicles"
8510,bob
8511,I am a fan of sandbox games such as garry's mod but I always felt limted in what I could do in those games but with this game it lets me make ANYTHING that comes to mind and I highley recomend it. Also if you are worried this game might not run on your system I can tell you I have a semi poato and it runs good.
8512,76 hours should tell you enough (i got it 2 weeks ago)
8513,yes
8514,"very cool
"
8515,poo
8516,"Worth the Buy?

The game was released around 5 years ago now, and is still in Early Access. This isn't a death sentence for a game, as many games from DayZ to Paladins were both in early dev stages for years also.

This game is fun, I like it. In the beginning, (being a newby to Scrap Mechanic in general,) i had no clue what i was doing. There was no method to my madness and this made me doubt the game. However i kept playing, and a few hours in, (and a lot of research online,) i gradually learnt how things worked. From resource gathering, to building, to defending my precious crops, this game is simple, slightly baron, but defo worth the price.

The developers have been active as recent as a month ago at the time of writing this review, and claim to not be in Developer Hell with the game. They have big plans that to now still has no definitive release date.

I think throughout the next few years, the game will thrive so long as the playerbase remains. It is certainly an entertaining and challenging survival to sink your creative teeth into. I built my own car! It flips a lot... Time to build a better car! And a Garage! And a house with a Garage! Even better, A Car in a House Garage defended by Potato Machine Guns!"
8517,ITS GOOD

8522,This game is one of the greatest sandbox games it has building survival ability and a lot of creativity ahead of you i know it is hard at first which i recommend playing creative mode first then survival to learn the basics of the game but if you have a friend you guys can just set off to your next level journey to survival mode and you will have a ton amount of fun
8523,"The gameplay footage looked like a survival game that had mechanical elements, but it is just a shitty version of gmod sandbox where you have to scavenge un-interesting structures to find few mechanical parts. The challenge mode is the same thing, but you just are given the answer(via the parts given) and have no goal other than to get a time that you have no reference for. That being said, I think people can have a good time with it, seeing the reviews. It is just really not for me. The videos and pictures made is seam like a 7 days to die with cool complex mechanics, but it just felt like I was going through a slow process for a very lack luster result. I may just be un-creative, but I am just giving my point of view."

8540,really really lack of tutorial
8541,good game. thumbs up.
8542,"Every time me and my brother play this, whatever I do, happens on both out screens, such as waving the sledgehammer, i click, the sledgehammer does its thing, but it registers on both our computer screens. But other than that, the game is a little difficult to understand, but its fun once you know how to do a lot of things."
8543,Very fun in survival and creative and for anyone who wants a bit of a challenge you can try out challenge mode
8544,"Fun, Challenging, and makes you use your brain in a way that most games don't make you."
8545,great game
8546,Awsome
8547,the game play is rather bland but the building of cars and mechs is interesting to say the least

8563,"Game is unfinished lack of mid and late game content.. Avoid until fully released, last noticeable update dated of May 8 2020 which makes more than 1 year without any content.

8564,This game is agony
8565,yes it is good.
8566,"amazing, been playing the game on and ff for the past 3 to four years. really amazing to see how far this game has come since I have started."

8575,NEEBS GAMING
8576,many build fresh car mobile
8577,ITS COOL
8578,"Yes, Because its a good way to be creative. For kids i think this game is a good way to learn that, being creative helps life in various ways."
8579,i love that people can get so creative with this game. you can litterally build anything you want. from a jetpack to a giant bird to a spaceship. all of which ive seen in-game. multiplayer can be a bit laggy (or so ive heard) but you can do very fun things. and where do you even start for survival! although you have to grind A LOT it can still be very fun.
8580,"No world map, can't pause. I found a tutorial video on youtube, but by the time I finished watching it it was night time and I couldn't see what I was doing. You cant even pause. No map. Nothing. Total trash. Refunded."
8581,You can drive over the robots with your own made pickup truck while listening sweet home alabama. 11/10
8582,"I LIKE IT
"
8583,Yes
8584,
8585,"I was only interested in this game for the survival mode. It just drops you into the world, no backstory, no tutorial, no nothing.

No world map, can't pause. I found a tutorial video on youtube, but by the time I finished watching it it was night time and I couldn't see what I was doing.

Refund."
8586,yes

8589,Very fun.
8590,"Cool game, cuz buinding bery cool"
8591,VERY INTERESTING GAME >>> LOTS OF POTENTIAL for CREATIVITY so hope they stay with this one to further develop it and get all the glitches out of the software and add more content and mods (and that the software stays SAFE for those with sensitive mental bodies ;).  Thanks for this one and guess we'll see! :)~
8592,A little bit hard to figure out at the beginning but over all solid game. Lots of good stuff in the workshop and you can have a lot of fun with the multiplayer.
8593,great to play w friend
8594,it is a game where you crash your plane and need to survive while killing robots and making a base
8595,"If you're looking for an enjoyable survival game experience, then this is not the game for you."

8618,This game is fun/annoying and addicting. I played for three hours straight and didn't notice because I was having so much fun.
8619,
8620,I love the creativity this game gives you i love the vehicle creative aspect great game love it
8621,"BUGGY MESS.  

A very fun game that allows quite a bit of problem solving, engineering, and even some logic circuit hell. Cartoonish graphics and the survival mode add to the overall gameplay, which is great.  -However-
Soooooo many game-breaking bugs and I mean big nasty ones... some even persist after closing the game... yep keypress memory leaks.   

Also, no snapshot saving feature.  If your base is massacred, you restart, unless you manually copy the db files as a backup or create a quick batch file to do it.  

For instance, just this last map I started with a new base concept in mind.  No warehouses spawned, just round empty patches of earth... this one was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.... the others I could work around.  Movement is very janky, crap falls through the world floor, including you, and sometimes the physics computations will lag you all to hell, even on a very high end gaming box.  If you try to move while your character has fallen, or just exited a vehicle, it will sometimes lock your shift key and sometimes your control key... EVEN AFTER YOU CLOSE THE GAME.... 

I really wanted to give this a huge thumbs up and support the devs who want to expand on this and add new stuff.... gotta squish those bugs first.  I will watch the changelogs and gladly thumbs this up if these issues are addressed.

8635,ayyy who put the cow in a clear box!
8636,its a really open game and it gives the game type needs like multiplayer and guns the  to make cars and ships and whatever mind thinks of
8637,"I'm going to get straight into the main issue, multiplayer does not work. Every time i try to join a friend or a friend tries to join me, we get an error message. From what I've researched and tried, I haven't been able to find a fix to this issue and it is disappointing beyond words. Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable and chill game. I've very much enjoyed playing the survival game mode. However, if I am unable to play this game with my friends, none of that really matters to me. I hope this issue can be addressed sooner rather than later because this game has an immense amount of potential."

8645,"very good game, i love itt"
8646,this game is very YES
8647,"Apparently this game has been in development for NINE years. I'm not sure that's something to be proud of, which is probably why they don't ever mention it. Now, someone who's been playing for years might be a little miffed at the pace of development - BUT if you're coming into the game late and getting it on sale for a great price, it's a decent albeit quirky builder that's got a lot of parts to play with and most of them almost work right.

Pretty fun in co-op survival mode, the content is a little thin but looks like more is on the way. Most of my time was spent grinding for the materials to build up a base and a treasury of parts. After perfecting a fleet of machines and vehicles there's really nothing else to do, but we've certainly enjoyed it. We'll be back to check out future content for sure."
8648,not waht i expected

Devs have put a lot of time and effort into this game (they also made Raft). It is an engaging game with amazing potential. Multiplayer is buggy at times but it is fun to play with friends. Game is fun for new gamers like me and for people who have been gaming for 10 years. The game has not been abandoned and it is clearly loved by the dev team. My girlfriend got mt the game at the Summer Sale for 13.99 USD (normally 19.99 USD) and it has been very worth it. I usually get sick from first person games due to the motion but this one i can play for hours. Graphics are very awesome on my meh computer. I can run max graphics settings on almost everything in game and it doesn't lag or have any issues. Of course there are bugs but I am sure they will be fixed in new updates. It's a really fun game that will just keep getting better and better."
8677,axolot games i love this game but have low frames please add auto quality adjustment
8678,to play multiplayer you need to have nasa internet i got 20mbs and it wont work or it will but it will be laggy as heck anyone know how to fix
8679,"amazing! game trust me
"
8680,dfghnm
8681,it's a great game and I love it. building is fun but I wish welding was a little bit better.
8682,"I had to play around with the lua files to get the game to play how I like it, would have been great if they were just in the options menu but still worth a buy on sale. 
Pretty fun game if you like building stuff :D"
8683,Good game
8684,good
8685,cool
8686,It is a very creative game that lends itself to many play styles
8687,it is very cool
8688,f u n
8689,fun game some grind and some learning curves if thats your thing
8690,"If you like to make vehicles, survive, and loot, then this is a good game for you"
8691,very fun and a bit educational but still very fun and good for designing things
8692,I ate ant
8693,very good
8694,This is a really cool game as you can build whatever you want with friends without limits. I also like the Survival Mode because you can explore different places + achieve things.
8695,"Honestly I have played alot of survival crafters. I just got valheim, grounded, 7 days to die, and rust. I would say that so far, this is by far my favorite out of all them. I like that its less important to fight and more important to craft. The possibilities with the mechanics is pretty endless."
8696,its fu#@#en dope
8697,Fantastic game to play with family.
8698,Very Good! Great Succsess!
8699,"very thing is awesome
"
8700,"yes, game iki sangat bagus, mengasah otak, tapi tolong dioptimalkan lagi,soalny kl udh barangny banyak jd ngeleg ngeleg, overall josss gandos."
8701,
8702,This game is REALLY awesome
8703,This game is pretty damn fun but it would be nice if they could release fucking updates. The last update was last year and they still said they are working on it
8704,"Super nice game in creative for when you wanna build stuffs and mess around with friends
Just don't play survival.The stacks are so small in size and the grind is insane for component kits"
8705,its fun but gotta learn alot
8706,"good game 
"
8707,FUNNNNNY
8708,Peepee poopoo check
8709,this is a great testing game

8711,"I bought this game for a buddy and I. We loved it and played it daily. We got a pretty nice base setup and had just started exploring the warehouses. Our very first warehouse, we die on the last floor, respawn at the truck down below and the elevator is busy. So we try using another key, nope. We try going in through the top door, nope. So we just say, fuck it, we'll start a different one. But then, we notice, it's been night time for a long time.... The game is stuck in the night cycle. The game was fun and amazing, but once this happened to us, I say ""fuck Scrap"" every time my buddy brings it up."
8712,Very interesting and perfect game to play with friends
8713,Prea asa
8714,"Slow development, but a great sandbox minecraft-like game for adults. Only your imagination and building skills (and maybe your computer) will limit you."
8715,"This is probably one of the most revolutionary game out there! This is a game where you don't have a car / boat / air plane .... but you have to build your own! I bought the game for the survival aspect of it and at the current stage is totally disappointing! I know that there is the plan to release a new update but the developer unfortunately are extremely slow. I am completely understanding that this is not an easy game to develop but at the same time it is a real shame that such a masterpiece cannot be fully enjoyable for the lack of contents in the survival mode. 

I can't recommend the game for the player orientated to play the game for the survival aspect of it."
8716,very goooooood
8717,noice gameeeeee
8718,I love that you can be super creative and it is super simple to learn how to play.
8719,"great for people who love building like me, its very challenging at first but you get use to it."
8720,Well Just yes its fun and fun and fun and i cant think of a good way to say its fun and good other than this
8721,e
8722,"""Hop on crap mechanic"""
8723,car
8724,you can use ur mind
8725,good game
8726,"it's fun, but it gets incredibly boring after a while of playing. Buy a better game instead of this"
8727,"the game itself has very few if any limits to what can be done, so much to offer, so much to do and it isnt even finished yet, so much more to come and experience, so yes, a very worthy game to get own and play often."
8728,great game
8729,"Its a very good game, yet the multiplayer survival optimization is super bad and laggy."
8730,Its a good game
8731,"Great game, bought it day one, no regrets."
8732,veri gud
8733,Before the Survival update the game was very fun with friends to play in creative and fight with giant robots now with the Survival update you gotta Find new ways of making a machine without many parts its even more fun now
8734,.
8735,"10/10 best game
"
8736,well this is a great game
8737,very pog
8738,basically the minecraft create mod but with smol blocks  like what heavy from tf2 once said...IS NICE but really for any one who likes minecraft and or wants minecraft but with extra things like hmmm....A FREAKING POATATO GUN i would really recommend this game to any one who likes minecraft AND IT HAS FREAING WEDGES WHO DOES NOT WANT WEDGES but well there are like so many things to do in this game so i rate it 10 out of 10 so please continue updating this game :)

8741,"it's like minecraft, different, but better"
8742,e
8743,Awesome game
8744,Really good of a game but it gets boring when you have no friends to play with
8745,"Very poorly optimized. The moment you add it a lot of physics and something has a few collisions etc, the game just lags like crazy. Same thing applies to even computers used through NVIDIA Geforce NOW which is crazy on its own given their specs.
"
8746,No.
8747,Even after 270 hours of playing im still having blast the survival update added so much and made the game so mush better
8748,great game
8749,ddvf
8750,Best 13 dollar game i've ever played.  prop top 10 game too!
8751,This game is a good sandbox game its very creative to play
8752,fun but challenging!
8753,BEST GAME EVER!
8754,"I absolutely fucking despise the challenge mode in this holy shit is it the worst experience I've had with gaming in a long LONG TIME it starts off easy but god damn does it get SO BAD that it melts my brain and I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE HOW TO DO IT AND THEY DON'T HELP ME EXPLAIN WHAT TO DO SO I JUST MAKE SHITTY CONTRAPTIOSN THAT FAIL AND GET ANNOYED AND I DID THIS WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER DYING OF HEATSTROKE NND IT MADE ME LOSE MY FUCKING MIND AND I NEVER WANT TO TOUCH THIS VILE, HORRID GAME EVEYR  AGIN.

8758,lllllllllllllll
8759,pretty pog game if you're creative :D
8760,super frustrating
8761,Ur Dad  :3
8762,i like this game because it allows you to be creative in a way other games do not. when i first saw it i did not want to get it because there was no goal to it yet. Then they added survival so i got it and even the creative part is better then i expected.
8763,im a mechanic lol
8764,IF NO LAG THEN GOOD
8765,very good
8766,hard and complicated butt very rewording
8767,"Game is very simple in it's (mind the pun) mechanics, building construction based and ""grinder"" vehicles that can be re-engineered for most tasks. Side effects to this game include buggy physics, and sometimes game breaking glitches. But for an early access game i do recommend people continue to follow the development on this game."
8768,"There's almost nothing intuitive about the game for people just starting out, the handbook is pretty much worthless when you're just starting out because you don't have any of the components it's describing. The handbook is your only source of information in game, and it contains no information about basic survival or how to start getting advanced components or anything necessary to progress through the game."
8769,"It is such a good game. To oversimplify it, It is minecraft with physics. you can build anything: Cars,trains, houses. This game is in early release so I expect more to come!"
8770,"Love the game but always have many problems starting the game. It usually takes like 7 restarts and 10 mins to start the game, but when i finally runs, it runs good. I dont thinks its my pc tho , i bought it a couple of months ago."
8771,"really good game. 10/10

8778,better than most survival games
8779,it good
8780,I made a door
8781,"Alright, it does crash often in challenge mode, but other than that, it's a really fun game."
8782,egg

8784,GG
8785,.
8786,boomer gombrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
8787,needs a bit of work with the physics engine but i know the aren't to many people working on this and i respect the creators of this game
8788,very fun :}
8789,Amazing game
8790,aight
8791,"No bigger Update since November 2020. Scrap Mechanic feels neglected.

A nightmare in multiplayer which kills the fun after all...and we tried...we tried hard.

""This game is riddled with bugs, glitches, poor optimization, weird physics, and a lifetime of early access."" is on point.

I would not buy it again. The games potential is wasted, as was my time.

Could have been a great game though."
8792,"it great
"
8793,is good game
8794,wery nice

8797,i love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8798,This game is great but there hasn't been updates in awhile. A group of friends and I have been waiting for server support for over a year. Nothing has come out. When it does then the review will change.
8799,"At first glance, this game has such an amazing concept, however it's still an awfully buggy game with bad combat, disturbing, and unreasonable FPS drops whenever you open a loot box, and terrible connection if you want to play with friends. I'd give it a 4/10. Would recommend you to buy it when it's officially out."
8800,"The game is good, but badly optimised. Couldn't join my friends in multiplayer, the ping was horrible and random spike lags."
8801,"BEST GAME EVER
"
8802,s
8803,its a enjoyable and relaxing game for people who like a building/survival/puzzle game. its a great game
8804,Its kind of boring...
8805,"Sadly dissapointed by the performance. 

RATING
*I don't have a 3090TI / 10*"
8806,It's harder to learn than my stem class
8807,game game game game game game
8808,"I Was wondering weather or not I should get the game, and now that I have I definately don't regret it
it runs fairly well on my laptop.

Learning Curve: very fast to get the basics, once you get to logic it becomes a bit more difficult, but the in game manual definetly comes in handy

Graphics: No Complaints, cartoonish, Pleasant overall

Sound: No Complaints, nothing special (but not in a bad way)

Creativity: High, whatever you imagine you can do with enough effort

Survival: Minecraft Like, no story, but that seems to be a Soon to be Added

Overall: Reccomended, Very fun,"
8809,Good
8810,you can build.
8811,gg
8812,"[strike] My main complaint is that it barely runs on a beefy computer, can hardly get it to run long enough to play if I can even get it to open in the first place. Poorly optimized graphics so it runs poorly when it is working. Have even had a bluescreen from trying to play it. [/strike]

Other than that there's not very much instruction on what to do and where to go within the game itself. Making the early game fairly difficult to figure out.

Edit: After the first 3 hours or so of playing the crashing let up a lot. I still crash and freeze occasionally but the game is playable now. Loading still takes forever. I've still come across a variety of errors including graphical glitches and objects in the world just disappearing for about 30 seconds at a time. I've even had the vehicle I was driving just up and disappear while I was driving it somewhere.

The game itself is fun enough but definitely has the feel of a work in progress. There's less to do that you would expect and most of the gameplay centers around its unique building and vehicle mechanics."
8813,"great game
"
8814,greatgamr
8815,really good game but could do with more bossed and stuff after the warehouse raids
8816,just good fun
8817,"Ok, first thing's first. I heard that this game Is dead, one point down. But the thing is: I'm trying, I'm really trying to love and enjoy this game. And as much as I am satisfied to have it I just can't have fun with it. It's next to impossible for me to get started on the game, to build shit and stuff. I'm completely uninformed! I don't know how I can have fun with this..it's boring, feels incomplete. Seriously, think a lot before you buy this game."

8863,so fun
8864,poggers
8865,"Very good, I enjoy it because it allows you to be as creative as you want.
You can create anything you imagine in this game, the limit is your imagination.
It's also very fun to play with friends and I recommend this game to others that like to create."

"
8883,"This game is very enjoyable, even in singleplayer it doesn't feel as desolate and alone as other games"
8884,Survival and creative have a lot to offer. I suggest this to anyone if you only want creative or survival. The game is well put together. The only problem I found was in survival mode it can be laggy if you don't have the best pc. The lag can be very easily fixed like most of the problems with the game.
8885,Its a ok game but the multiplayer is boned .  Who ever host's has no lag and whoever joins does  When they fix this I might be able to recommend this game
8886,Amazing
8887,Yes
8888,"Brilliant Game for those with a creative and industrious mind. 
I strongly believe that this game could be improved by providing smaller thrusters, as right now players are forced to create flying machines that are very large and thus time consuming if they don't want the thrusters to be too visually dominating.

A multiplayer faction wars style game mode I could see taking the world by storm."

1 engines should make noise which will make robots detect you from farther away. but upgrading it will make it make less noise.

2 when it is night more robots should show up as a night patrol.

3 at night robots should have a light in front of them.

4 robots should have an exclamation point pop up over their head when they detect you.

5 armor I am sick of taking 30 damage from a haybot on normal

6 an armory bot maybe it can improve spud guns and craft weapons"

8930,"This game is lackluster. World is too big and empty, grinding is too much and tedious and the only thing you can do in this game is to build things without an objective. Game updates are rare and the game seems abandoned by the devs. I do not recommend this game."
8931,This game is pretty cool :)
8932,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
8933,the robots make funny noises when you beate theam
8934,very fun game for gamerz to enjoy

8936,10/10 would exploit oil fields again

8954,Very fun but confusing at first!
8955,Very fun and great with survival mode- waited a year or two for that great multiplayer

8972,"Hard to get started at first, survival could use a better way of giving direction. but after trial an error an some basic photos i found in game i got some idea of what to do. after that it was really fun. very good mechanic system, the photos were a big help with understanding how to build. only thing i would add is the better Q an A section of the help section. overall i give it a 8/10"
8973,great game!!!!!!!
8974,"i like this game

8975,fun
8976,if its to piss off your loved ones this is the chaotic mess of a game for you. several times my boyfriend and i were in a panic of did we water the plants? when is the next wave of robots? where did put the carrot seeds??? and much more. typically i like to invent new ways to piss him off 10/10 would recommend to piss off the ones you love.
8977,"The game is awesome. Some glitches should be fixed. The experience would be even better with a little improvement of mechanics. Overall, its a nice game."
8978,cool sick
8979,hehe scrap mechanic more like brap mechanic haha p.u.
8980,"Lag Simulator!
This is not an engineering game. Its a creative game with quirky physics. Its far from perfect and no where near complete but has a good amount of mods to help with most its downfalls. You have to make your own fun with this one, think Minecraft alpha."
8981,yayayayayyayayayaa
8982,good
8983,"Excellent game if you like to craft things and aren't worried about ""real life"" physics"
8984,"When I first picked up this game, I was in love with it. It's a casual and fun building experience, where your imagination is the limit. I have sunk over 100 hours into it. I strictly came for the survival aspect of the game, which was fun at first.

However, I would not recommend this game to anyone on the fence about buying it. The rate of which the development has progressed is abysmal at best. I've waited over a year for an update to the game, and nothing has came out. They have teased the next chapter or season, yet earlier this week they announced they are only FIFTY PERCENT DONE WITH IT. This is simply unacceptable in my eyes and are now saying it probably won't come out till next year. Lazy development has ruined what was once a very promising game. I don't recommend supporting companies that exploit the early access model with promise of updates, then produce nothing in 2 years.

Save your money, there are better survival games out there than this.

"
8985,"just fun, a bit complicated but fun"
8986,Yes. I love it. Buy it. It good game.
8987,yes yes yes yes yes
8988,fun and simple (ish) approach to design and game play with a level of realism that allows quick and easy game play with fun aspects and no frustration. Educational for children and entertaining for adults.
8989,all this game does is freeze whenever i hit something with my hammer or move stuff in my inv. waste of money
8990,In this game you can build what ever you want! It allows you to expand your creativity and have fun!
8991,"its a good game for all ages
"
8992,"I like this game because its fun and there is lots of stuff to do in it and you never get bored.
I would recommend this game to anyone who has a creative mind because on this game you can build whatever you want.
However the price is a bit expensive and i would definitely recommend waiting for a sale if you were going to buy it.
But to be fair all in all its an excellent game."
8993,Good grindey fun.

8995,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!

9034,"I've played it wayyy before Survival came out. I'm kind of a verteran, and I have to say that this game is amazing. I played it as a smol potato, and it actually taught me degrees before I even learned them. Its not only fun to build your own contraptions and make amazing stuff, but also somewhat educational, as mentioned before. Maybe you could build a space station in space and would have to pressurize it with air? I would love to see that, maybe. 9/10, imo."
9035,"Good game with endless possibilities, but the lagg is really hindering me from creating more complex creations, especially in multiplayer and thus completely ruining the game experience."

9116,"I would definetly recommend this game to a very specific group of people.
If you enjoy the technical part of survival games like playing around with Redstone in Minecraft or electrical work in Rust, this game is for you!

If you enjoy the survival aspect more, might not be the right choice for you. Cant drink water or eat corn, you will die at the start due to a lack of tutorial and if you're anything like me, you will run straight into the woods and struggle for the first 10 hours of gameplay because you refused to take the beaten path with all the tutorials laid out for you only to come back later once you don't need the help."
9117,This is an overall amazing game that requires some big brain engineering skills. (That i dont have)

9129,very fun!!!!
9130,"[h1] What do I think about, Scrap Mechanic? [/h1]
[b] Gameplay [/b]
The game is a Simple, Engineering game, To Build and Experiment. I have been playing the game since Mar 2, 2016. So I have been playing the Game for a Wile now. It's a very good game, now. It changes massively since the Survive update, which took a long time to get. The Survive is Interesting and makes you think in Complicity Different way it did Before the update. The Extaticks of the game is quite interesting, the textures and designs, and User friendly, and easy. The game is designed to be played by Kids, and it suits it for it. 

[b] Performance [/b]
For an average PC user, the Performance should be fine, on lower settings, they have made a lot of Performance updates, which helped a lot over time. But the performance Depends completely on what you are doing. In Survival your Performance will be slightly lower than in Creative. But it doesn't make a huge impact. There is one massive issue, it‚Äôs being fixed since the Release and its way less than it used to be, but two big objects colliding would massively drop your FPS.

My average FPS: 168

[h1] My Recommendation [/h1]
I would get the game if you are interested in building and experimenting with new things. The Price is quite decent, for the Game you are getting. It does make it way more fun to play with friends, so I would recommend doing that. It still has a lot of bugs and issues, so don't be surprised if you find any. But it is at least worth the try.

I love how Scrap Mechanic gives you freedom to do whatever you want! in the few days I've had it, I already built many cars, trailers, etc. in creative, and have gotten to the point in my survival world where I feel I'm actually doing alright!

9154,"If you are buying this game to play survival, don't.

Disclaimer: I have no interest in playing this game in creative, I would just got draw or make music. I bought this game to play survival because it has survival on the cover and that game mode has been out for years. 

Survival sucks. It feels as if the dev were the sole testers, nobody new to the game.

[list]
    [*]First you can't drink water in ponds, you have to drink soda or eat food, that's stupid.
    [*]You can't eat corn, you how to feed it to a wok to get milk (had to look it up online because the word cow is too uncreative).
    [*]You will encounter an entire two types of enemies for the first two+ hours of the game. If you connected to your friend, good luck with the lag. 
    [*]2 hours of gameplay and no easy way to determine how to change your spawn point. Have fun running back over and over. 
    [*]The first wheels you get just suck. What is the point of them. I can run faster than the car. Then I have to look for BEESWAX for a better wheel? 
    [*]What's the point of the vehicles in this survior mode if you're building a base?
[/list]

I could just be missing something, but if i designed this shit, I would have made it so that you bulid a mobile base and travel throughout the land, gathering resources and moving towards some endgame. Why would they add this mode if it's not important? Every review on here is users that play creative mode. 

Why do people lower their standards for survival games? This is inexcusable for a game 5 years old. Enough praising just because it ""works"".

"
9163,"Fun game lots to do and some good mods!!!
"
9164,"One of the very few well-made physical sandboxes (with some crafting and shooting sprinkled on top). I'd say one of the very best. Very nice cooperative mode for a group of friends that doesn't require everyone to be available at the same time.

Just one minor downside - the developers are a small company, so they are a bit slow with the updates. Don't expect a full release for quite a while - maybe years. Still, there is more than enough in the game right now for a few hundred hours' worth of entertainment.

Some of the things that can be done in the game: 3d printers, logic-gates-controlled robots, cars (including complex suspensions and control schemes), huge sprawling bases with sensors and moving parts, complex physics-based wood- and stone-cutting machines, fully automatic food farms, flying machines... In this game you really shouldn't do anything by hand, build a machine instead to do it for you.

Don't expect the survival mode to be difficult (the bots are easy to deter or destroy), do not expect the game to provide you with a lot of pre-set tasks and goals (the development is still in progress), but if you enjoy setting your own goals and/or have a friend who likes it - the fun will be endless."

9166,"pretty cool game, i haven't played it very much though"
9167,"so much room for creativity

survival mode needs some improvements

good game"
9168,
9169,"i highly recommend this, even though there are still tiny bugs left here and there, all round awesome game with multiple different kinds of physics and random world generations to experience, each and every world may have the same tiles BUT the layout will always be different from one to another"
9170,"i like how u can build in this game.....
i no like my creativity"
9171,it is so fun and exiting

9173,"Rating: 7/10

I have recently purchased during a sale and fell in love with Scrap Mechanic. It has scratched an itch I've had for a long time. Although all I did was play survival mode. I highly recommend everyone to give this game a try, particularly if you have a friend or two!

9191,its a good game bro
9192,"The game is fun nonetheless, but I always got annoyed  by the fact that the blocks are tiny and it's hard to count, if there was some sort of display above every terrain you build with a number it would've been way better and easier to play with
"
9193,good

9211,in survivle mode in scrap mechanic the dress bot wont work when i made it the new clothes wouldnt appear then i opened a common clothing box and i opened it i diddent get any clothes i still recammend the game though
9212,"Yep. This game is the goat. And by goat I mean a literal goat. You might be wondering, ""can you drive into a wall of explosives and still come out alive?"" Yes yes you can. Also, you can have a beard in this game. If that doesn't convince you I don't know what will.


All joking aside this game is good."
9213,"Lego Technic with all the block, sensors etc you could never afford to buy"
9214,Epic
9215,you peaple need to buy it its realy good
9216,Freedom to make vehicles. They may be ugly but they work. Survival is fun but I dislike how fast hunger and thirst goes down
9217,"This game is pretty fun to play, although would definitely be better with friends. The challenge mode really forces you to be creative with your solutions, and is a fun time when it works; the issue arises when the crashes happen. On my end (I don't know if this is a problem with my computer hardware or a game issue) crashes in the challenge mode are frequent, about once every few levels or sometimes multiple on one level. if this issue gets resolved then overall i would have no complaints, sometimes the physics are buggy but this can make the experience better in some cases because it can be really funny."
9218,Do not buy this game yet. It is basically a glorified sandbox game at the moment. They have a survival mode but it's not well fleshed out nor balanced at all. Please wait on it and don't waste your money unless you're into pure Sandbox and not having a point to your creations.
9219,My favorite Game :)
9220,good
9221,gaming
9222,"this game needs a emergency fullscreen button, but other than that it is the most anti-boring game ever
"
9223,"GREAT GAME YOU CAN BUILD ANYTHING AND THE DEVS ARE ADDING A LOT MORE AND THEY ALREADY HAVE A MORE THAN EQUAL AMOUNT.
sorry all caps its just SOO good"
9224,great game would definitely recommend. it can take a while to get use to everything and might take a bit to learn how to use all the different items but once you do you can make anything. BEST free-roam survival game I've played
9225,"Its a cool looking game were you can build,destroy,and more with other people.Also you can put cool mods into your world and make amazing things."
9226,Amazing game Used to play TF2 Daily but now im rethinking that and prob gonna play TF2 and this game daily Amazing game and almost everything is good gameplay is amazing and the building I had a bit of trouble with but I got through it and every time I had good FPS. One of the best games I have ever played.
9227,I like it very funny game my friend also like and we like both of us like.
9228,Amazing
9229,EVERY THING
9230,it is a great game because you can live your life in the game and have fun
9231,"Yes it is an fun game to build things in that move and not too complicated but still enough options.
Survival mode is a real game, not just a build simulator. The roobots give oposition and you need to kill robots to get some components that you need to build stuff and progress. You can upgrade many things but stilll build much at the start if you harvest much. You need to eat and drink to not die and the robots destroy farms and walls to farms. Some buys are still bad June 2021 when you drive cars that get stuck when nothing is in front of the car, at least in coop. Coop is great if you do it with a real friend that can invest many hours in a game and is fair. As a christian I like that there is no Fantacy/New Age monsters in the game."

9243,game is fun but online theres no dedicated servers so its really laggy
9244,"If you played with legos as a kid, and would want to be a mechanic/engineer when you grown up, idk just play this game (if you got a 200 dollar laptop and try to play this it would literally break your laptop) its fun if you have other creative masterminds of friends."
9245,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
9246,this game is really fun i spend hours on this game and it gets better and better

9248,mmmmm good
9249,"it is fun, you can make almost whatever you want."

9255,big good
9256,great
9257,GUD
9258,I think this game is really good because you can build almost whatever you feel like! I recommend this game to anyone who likes to build and create stuff.
9259,car go sideways
9260,its a fun game
9261,"I know the game is still in early access, but PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PHYSICS. The game is unplayable between the glitching through the map, being afraid to step on, place or destroy anything because it will send you into either a glitchy jumping state, produce a lag spike during which you can go grab a cup of coffee or just outright crash your game. Part of these issues might be due to Proton and me playing on Linux but I highly doubt that, having a rig that should have no trouble running this. I regret the 14$ I spent on this game."
9262,"YES! The game is a bit laggy but it is still very good with the amount of creations you can make. The survival mode is a really great mode and I'm still waiting for the quests update, more enemies and that plasma drill. But overall I really recommend this game."
9263,is game is very fun
9264,"asdcfghjk,."
9265,"The ability too make anything you want is just what i wanted i love this game and the fact that you can use other peoples builds makes it even more fun to play, I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who wants to be a mechanic who can make anything they want."
9266,better and better! nice bug fixed!

"
9275,Its rly fun u should play
9276,I love it because the game allows you to release your inner inventor or mechanic. I would really recommend this to people that would like a challenge.
9277,"yes xtreem good
"
9278,Its like Minecraft but more fun! very mechanical and a big learning curve but its definitely worth it.
9279,Yes
9280,:D
9281,yea

9283,very fun but so laggy that i can only play creative flat terrain world
9284,i think its rely fun to find bylds on te steam woekshop and just try them so i wold rely recomend it
9285,ITS SO FUN TO PLAY with friends
9286,nouthing
9287,we need to build a wall
9288,this game is not fun at all when u begin and getting friends too play wich makes it fun is hard ecause the game is so utterly overpriced
9289,"liked the midgets you play as
"
9290,i love the game but mace it so wen you kill a hay bot it will rag doll and you can pout a  batorey in it so it will not hrt u and it will farm for you please i no it will be hard but if you do it more than 200 boys and girls will love your game more so please
9291,e
9292,it is pretty good and all but now i have to pay for it again what is all of that about?
9293,Nice survival mode
9294,"Good game, can make some pretty cool machines.  Could use some enemies and adventure."
9295,"I have been playing this game for awhile now, I only have good things to say about it. Since I have been in the beginning of early Access I have seen bugs but every new features that come in, excites me more. I purchased many other copies for my friends because I love this game so much, keep it up dev team!"
9296,so laggy its not even fun anymore and I had this game way before survival came out
9297,best 20 dollars ever spent would defentliy recomend
9298,You should play this game
9299,it is very fun
9300,hehe fun gaem
9301,Well worth the price
9302,
9303,"The survival game mode is really strange. You can't even drink water form bodies of water and most of the food give you more water than it feeds you.
I can't really put it into words, but it feels strange to me once i played it, which is sad, because I really was looking forward to play it."
9304,"The game is in an early access state and has lots of potential.
 To me its a survival game which takes and blends aspects from games like minecraft and rust, and then slaps a vehicle creation mechanic on top that's very reminiscent of something like Besiege.
 Exploring and creating your own vehicles and contraptions with your friends is very fun,but there's not really that many incentives to explore the dungeons and discover the world, once you do a little bit of exploration and find the utility buildings that are required to access certain gear you end up getting into a rhythm where youre just farming and packing the resources, more resources and items that can only be acquired trough exploration and dungeons would be a great way to break that cycle.
  The combat also doesnt have much depth or variety, theres only one melee weapon and three ranged weapons + a mounted cannon, whit all enemies except the Big red bot you can just walk backwards and click to kill them without taking any damage, so i hope the devs plan to improve the combat in the future
  i think some dungeons and activities that incentivize vehicular combat would also be a great addition."
9305,"Very good game, definatly recommend it!
I hint to new players to watch some basic YouTube videos to get a feel for the game, learn some tricks!!!!"
9306,"pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis? noun | A lung disease caused by the inhalation of very fine silicate or quartz dust, causing inflammation in the lungs..... Idk why but just go with it."
9307,You can build whatever you want. Minecraft with better mechanics :)
9308,build go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
9309,i like the game althought maybe not for everyone. It is a fun game
9310,it is a  bit laggy
9311,very good game build what ever style game. very addictive and easy to learn even though it can be confusing at first. overall a very good game  accept it can be laggy with bigger creations
9312,this game is super cool
9313,"Abit glitchy but would recomend, but guides are not provided, learning is part of the game"
9314,i have 19 hours in 2 days time let that be the review
9315,i like it
9316,it fun
9317,its fun and worth the money and 1 reson why its fun is you can build cars whilst being able to build big forts
9318,"I like Scrap Mechanic because unlike Minecraft you can build simple stuff that moves, instead of it being super complicated. You can also build vehicles without mods which is very nice to have."
9319,I love this game as you can tell! I have 592 hours! It just took me this long because I just remembered. But I do recommend this game. Very fun and creative also haves some cool and funny gliches! Like the piston plop you just got to put the physics to 1. Also I like the story line very cool!
9320,super fun i love

9335,A very fun survival game with a mechanical twist. Just watch out for bots (especially red bots those things give me nightmares).
9336,It¬¥s one of the best game i have playd. the thing i like most is that you can play with you¬¥re friends. And i also like that you can take others creations and make them funnier or dummer :) I recomend this game if you like to build cars and stuf.

9352,good game no lag

9355,IT JUST GOOD

9357,very gud
9358,"5 years old, expected more... depth? Especially for it's received rating, I find it's very, very shallow.

Crafting itself is.. OK. Having played other crafting games e.g. Conan Exiles, KSP, Rust, Besiege, Stormworks I have to say the crating feels 'clunky'. Creations almost always look bad.
Once you get the craft bot and built a base and a vehicle (let's say 4-5 hours) you've really done all there is.

Story is non-existant. You crash on a planet where robots have risen up. You manage health, food, water, and build stuff so you can get more stuff quicker. There is no end-goal.

Based on older youtube video's they really improved the graphics, optimization and atmosphere... But 5 years is a long time.
In its curent state, I can't recommend this game. But perhaps if the devs manage to add more depth this game can we worthwhile."
9359,"DO NOT BUY

Pros:
Amazing concept, Engineer's Dream game...

Cons:
Game cannot handle more than a handful of actuators before permanently crashing
Insanely long grind for survival mode"

9378,"GOOD GAME
"
9379,"Very fun, good to make you think while enjoying yourself. Honestly makes me feel smarter than I probably am"
9380,"I recommend this game, especially if you like making stuff with logic gates and stuff like that, but the survival, at least without mods, is very grindy, and takes a while to get stuff, so you'll probably get bored after like 3-4 hours if you just play that"
9381,"Kinda boring. there's no tutorial so I had no idea what was going on. Not to mention, that there is also nothing to really do after you make your car"
9382,verry fun challange with freinds
9383,its cool
9384,i would advise playing this game if your a creative person and if you like survival its good but its lacking at the moment but i have faith the Dev team will be adding more and the fixes i have seen so far have been positive
9385,This is one of the greatest building games i have played right next to Minecraft i love it!
9386,no
9387,very fun to play with friends

9402,"Cool game, but it should be some startup missions to get u going. If you're completely new to the game, it takes a bit long to get familiar with what you can do, and how to start out. Otherwise, really easy building mEchanics and cool concept for a game!"
9403,ewrrfwrwedf
9404,epic
9405,"favorite game by far. you can do anything you imagine in creative, do your limit in survival, and challenge yourself in challenge mode. workshop items (builds, mods) are very easy to download. to download them, go the scrap mechanic steam workshop, pick out your item, then hit subscribe. if you got a mod, then you can edit a world so that it can have mods. if its a build, then it will be on your lift.
the community is always pumping up something new, the physics of the game will give you a good laugh. 
overall a good game, you should get it"
9406,"I loved to play Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts and I loved to play with the Redstone in Minecraft.
Those times are gone but now I found this game that revived once again my favor for creatively building stuff with purpose in a natural world. A unique game with passionate developers.
Thank you <3

9434,"good game i built a supersonic dildo so yes, i recommend checking it out, its still in early access so theyre adding things and are more open to the communitys suggestions"
9435,yes

9437,"Okay guys, I'll be brutally honest about this game.

Pros
IT'S FUN. IT'S SO FUN. If you like survivals, resource managements, tower defenses, and/or having tons of creative freedom, you will adore this game. It is a hard game. Harder than minecraft for sure. I have been playing in my world for some hours, and it is still challenging, nothing like minecraft where past a point it's almost impossible to die if you're careful. In this game, the more you play, the harder it gets. But it's never TOO hard. So it keeps you on your toes. Props to developers for balance.

Cons
Learning how to play is HARD. The developers REALLY need to improve the quality of game for first timers. There is no clear order of what to do first, and that makes the game frustrating at first. You will need the wiki a lot. If you take time to learn though, you will have a great game to play for 100+ hours at least.

Tips for how to start:
1. There is a tutorial for how to farm food near the starting point, but it's very easy to miss it. It's right next to a small lake. Make sure to find it and read it.
2. Next to the starting point, there is a crash site. Use the water from the lake to turn off the fire in it and pick up the travel log. This will let you set points in the map for you to follow and travel. There's also a battery somewhere, but I don't think it's necessary. If you find it, you can technically craft a car with the parts from the crates of the next step. But I don't recommend doing this unless you are experienced.
3. Follow the trail of crates that the game leave for you until you reach the road. Once in the road, follow it and try to find the mechanic's shop. If you have been walking for more than 20 minutes, you missed it. You might be able to make the travel log point to it before having found it, but I'm not sure.
4. Once in the mechanic shop, go to the sleeping rooms. Open the doors by hitting them with the hammer, and SLEEP. This will set your respawn point.
5. In the nearby lake, plant the soil and seeds that you have obtained from the crates. That will be your source of food. After about 3 nights of gameplay, you will get a suspicious message if the game detects you have planted food. Get ready.
6. ONLY THEN should you try to make a car if you're a beginner. You won't have to worry about food, and you will have time to figure stuff out. 
One note: There's 100 ways to design and upgrade your car, and there's an unlimited number of mechanical constructions to make. It's hard to learn how to make them work, but it's worth it.
Second note: YOU MUST make a car. This game is HIGHLY DEPENDENT on exploration. You will get bored if you don't explore. Further, there's no way to replant trees so eventually you'll need to travel for it. Exploration gets really annoying without a car. And feel pride for upgrading your car! After enough hours, you'll have a car that doesn't tip over every 15 seconds, and you'll be proud af.
Last note: There's A LOT more in the game than what I have said. But I'll let you figure it out."
9438,i had this game on my dads account but he was annoyed because i would play it all the time because he likes to play rust so he bought me this so now we play it together sometimes but its a awesome game especially since you can get mods without worrying about hackers trying to get you data

9449,I love the game but when my friend tries to join it says on his screen error and says here is a problem with my survival game.Lua and (69) what should I do
9450,its fun
9451,"This game as of now is mostly about crafting and has not much to offer in terms of PVE content.
I am all about survival games but it seems the main focus here is building stuff which isn't a surprise.
Outside of crafting the world feels empty.
Also there is a noticeable input delay if you are not hosting, something I feel like needs to be addressed"
9452,Fun to play and interesting build mechanics.

9459,"Scrap Mechanic is a wonderful game.

You can create anything your imagination can come up with; whether it be an oil derrick, or a powerful trophy truck. You can create planes, boats, mechs, and so much more.

Recently survival mode was released, and in the year since it came out, it has not had very many updates; some of which are very dearly needed.

I love survival mode, but the lack of content, end-game activities and goals makes it hard for me to want to return to the game after having the perfect vehicle and base setup. There is no real story other than the fact that you have crash landed on a farming world where all the automata that are supposed to maintain and work the farms on said world are malfunctioning and are now hostile.

Thats pretty much the extent of the story.

My recommendation for this game is to avoid it until survival is properly finished and able to offer lasting, repeatable content for the mid to end game."
9460,"fun game u can mess around and stuff if ur new just ask me about the game

9461,"it is the best game becasue i fished it

9477,I think Scrap Mechanic is a pretty fun game. The Survival mode is fun with friends but is pretty challenging at the start. There isnt a whole lot of hints or anything so we had to look up how to do some things but so far it seems like there is a lot of stuff to do.
9478,Best game in the world I LOVE it

9488,"This game is not what I thought it was. I was expecting a survival game like Conan Exiles, Don't Starve Together or Valheim, but rather than building bases, it would focus on machines with mechanics like Besiege, Trailmakers or Kerbal Space Program, all games I've played for hundreds of hours. Its not that. Before you read the rest of this review, I am going to spoil 100% of what this world has to offer. It wont take long, but you've been warned. If you want this game for a PURELY creative experience, its probably quite good. The building mechanics are solid, so read all the other positive reviews here and look at peoples playtimes. But I would recommend you play one of the 6 games I've mentioned instead; the survival games are far better for exploration and difficulty, and the building games are far better for creating out-of-the-box machines with real purpose. Just keep in mind this is a review for the Survival mode only.

So, here's my experience. The Survival mode is incredibly barebones and hollow, to the point where me and my friend stopped playing after barely 6 hours as we had literally seen the entire game. The survival mechanics are a joke, you lose nothing on death so rather than waste food early-game we just stood by the free beds we were given near the Mechanic Station and re-spawned instantly. Later on, we didn't need to do that, because you can feed ""Wocs"" (one of two animals in the game) with the never-ending amounts of free corn on the map and get enough milk to never need to eat anything else. So, we built a car with some chests attached and started exploring. There is one road that goes in a mostly straight line and you find most important structures along it. There are other locations on the map but I never saw them, and if you go to the wiki pretty much every page says ""this area contains nothing of interest"". So I don't think I missed much.

Along the road, there are some Packing Stations where you donate bundles of crops, in order to gain Crates of said food which can be traded with the only NPC in the game. The Trader doesn't give much of importance, you can buy some guns here which I think is the only combat progression in this game. This crop mechanic reminds me a lot of Slime Rancher, except that game gives so much more purpose to raising the Slimes and rewards the player for doing so. So, why plant crops in Scrap Mechanic? You certainly don't need these for food, and you don't really need to use the Trader either when you have a car and can just melee the common enemies. Planting crops also runs the risk of being attacked by a horde of Farmbots, which will try to destroy your structures. Unless you specifically want to have a raid, its a hindrance. This is my biggest problem with the game, there is no point to any of it. You could build a gigantic automatic farm with sprinklers and such, but growing so many crops is punished harshly, the crops themselves aren't rewarding, and you can play the game in its entirety without ever needing that kind of system. Could you play KSP without building a rocket, or DST without preparing for winter?

Moving on, further down the road there's a few more pre-fab buildings you can loot for some furniture or seed bags, then finally you'll reach the Warehouse, the end-game area. There are some enemies with ranged attacks and a final area you need a key to get into, but when you do get in there you cannot loot or build anything within the environment. Right at the end is a loot room full of gold chests. The actual chest loot here? Some dirt, some crops, and some cosmetics.

And that's the game. No, really. I have just spoiled 100% of what this game will offer you in its Survival Mode. Why cant we repair the ship and fly back home? Why cant we liberate the planet from the Farmbots entirely and reclaim it? Why is there no story? The game just makes no sense in its current state. Scrap Mechanic cannot be called a survival game with how it actually plays out. This is a sandbox game with a tacked-on health and hunger bar, objectives that feel like an afterthought, and it provides absolutely no purpose whatsoever. Again, I cant speak for the creative mode experience, but the 95% positive reviews clearly can.

I know the devs have been working on *something* for Survival Mode that's coming in a future update, and I am waiting for that. But given that Survival has been released for almost a year and this is the first update its going to get, I don't hold any hope that it will ever become what it should be. I will edit the review if the game changes, but until then, stay far away from this one."
9489,i HEAVELY RECCOMEND THIS GAME PURELY FOR ITS FREEDOM AND CREATIVE POSSIBILLITY
9490,it's a very fun and great game
9491,This is a great game and very fun! I built many flying cars.
9492,this game makes me c u m
9493,"If you plan on playing this game solo I wouldn't recommend (This may be different for multiplayer).  The resource gathering/grinding is far too much.  The block durability is too low.  The robots attacking your stuff destroy blocks in one hit so it takes hours to build something that can get destroyed in a minute.  Some robots in early stages of the game are unkillable with early game weapons.

TLDR: Game requires a lot of balancing."

9502,"Great sandbox game.  The requirement to ""keep moving"" keeps the tempo up.  Goals are easy to find and the building aspect provides a constant variety of things to do and change. Resources that seem endless suddenly are in short supply and new ways to keep up must be found."
9503,"VERY POG

9504,this game is great for you are your friends to go play on nad theirs lots of glitshes in the game and that always fun.

Gives you Basic info for a Advanced Game you never know what to do or how to do anything you wonder aimlessly till u figure out holding right click picks stuff up but you don't quite know what is an object you can take, and you have very little guidance or hints like where to find things or metal.

9518,"Needs content like missions and achievements. Graphics look great, but you can only craft or swing a hammer for so long before its overly repetitive."

only thing i don't like is how time consuming this game is to build stuff."
9528,it good g
9529,I can't... stop...
9530,you can build
9531,good game
9532,My brain hurts
9533,"its a bit slow getting started for the first time and haybots(the orange enemies) are a real issue at the start because you have to fight them up close.
 planting with  no water starts raids even though you cant harvest the plants.
creative is very fun.
in the beginning survival is a bit more along the lines of: ""*building a tiny hut to hide from bots* AHH HAYBOT RUN!""
then later it gets easier.
overall 3 star start 
4 star game play
4 star game play mechanics (no pun intended)
3 star controls (quite different compared to other games so it takes time getting used too)
overall great game in my opinion!
definitely worth checking out!"
9534,too high quality i cant run it help

9543,"Scrap Mechanic is a fun game with 3 different gamemodes:
1: Creative where you're free to unleash your creativity, wich is acompanied by the huge amount of parts availlable.
2: Challengemode where you can learn the basics & advanced building methods through challenges with limited parts & a course to complete
3: Survival where you fight aggressive bots & try to build up a base in order to survive. But be cautious as the bots will attack your farm. The strength of the attack depends on the size of your farm aswell as the rareity of the crops you planted.
I hope I helped you to decide wether Scrap Mechanic is a game for you or not. :)"

9549,Monsters creep on. Not funny :c
9550,"I'd have to say it's probably my favorite game and just pretty great in general. creative is fun to goof around and all that jazz. survival is great, a pretty well balance in thing besides how hard it is to get component kits, i feel like they should make it so we can like trade something at the traders place to get some. still really fun though!"

Pros: its fun, the bugs are oddly funny... and multiplayer even more so.

9569,one of the best and creative games
9570,"epic
"
9571,great game a must play
9572,great i play everyday
9573,"I do recommend this game to people, people who are creative, who have good ideas or bad ones, people who think outside the box of physics, anything for that matter people who desire a world where almost... anything is possible. So my overall summary about this game is that its just about what you would expect from a game about dwarfs living in a robot infested world, if not more. That is not all though you can pick from two game modes Creative mode, basically a mode where you can spawn in a prebuilt world in witch you can design and build creations from cars to planes, then there is survival mode, where you are thrown in a world overrun by robot farmers you must survive to continue through the story. Now this is still a work in progress there is not much story, but this is still a great time to buy this game it just got a big update not to long ago meaning its still a game that is actively being updated so if i were you i would buy it now before it gets pricey."
9574,"sheeeesh
"
9575,"Overall, this game is pretty fun, just like minecraft but with more technical side"
9576,friking beatifull
9577,"A cuter, simpler version of satisfactory, but its a fun game. the art style is simple and appealing. gameplay is satisfying and sometimes even hilarious. the potential for custom builds is only limited by your imagination and how many resources you do or don't feel like farming. watching your friend get mobbed by robots from the safety of your sky base is also fun."
9578,so much fun
9579,excellent fun for my son and nephews and brother and I

9614,"I was born a gear head and love cars. I was messing with cars since I can remember, I didn't even understand the fundamental concept of a car. My mom gave me Hot Wheels cars and she said that if she gave me the car backwards, I would flip the car to were it drives forwards. Again this was when I was like 1 or 2 years old. I still have a collection of Hot Wheels cars today. Scrap Mechanic came out in 2016 and I was 11 at the time. I started seeing You Tubers play the game. And I was hooked right away. I begged my mom for just a spare 20 dollars, lots a chores had to be done cause my mom was not so loose with me always. I was so excited to get the 20 dollar steam card from Walmart that I almost peed my self. Unfortunately my laptop was so trash that if you ran a game so simple it would still lag, and back then when Scrap Mechanic first came out it had so much performance issues (still does) so it didn't help at all, but I didn't care. I remember my First ever creation in Scrap Mechanic was a home made Jeep made of wood and so tall like my dad carrying a belt about to open up a can of beatings ( I swear he gains like a foot of height when he holds a belt, either that or I shrink from fear ;-; ). Anyways, I had the game for 5 years now and still playing it. All I'm saying is that if your into cars and mechanics or just building stuff, consider looking at this game. It been fun to play and still is fun. Yes there is still some issues with the game like the performance and the multiplayer lag and glitches. Considering that it is still in early access, it has come a long way and still has a long way to go. But don't just take it from me, the Scrap Mechanic Community is filled to the brim with awesome good folks all around the world. So thanks for listening to my opinion about this wonderful game. I hope y'all have fun. Can't wait to see what the future holds for Scrap Mechanic."

If you survival or sandbox (or both), you'll like this game probably. I recommend to to use mods though as they can be essential if you really want to go crazy with your creations. 
For survival I recommend to use the Fant Mod, but there are no workshop compatibilities for survival mods as for now so it is a bit more difficult to install but still worth it."

This is a great survival game a lot of creativity and has got good water physics also some great backstory and enemies, its like minecraft but with cars, boats and smaller blocks.

Cons
There is no air physics which isn't the worst but i do find mods to glitch the game and it can be grindy.

Summary
This game is great but it can get a bit boring like any survival game at a certain point when its just grinding, i rate this game 8/10."

He made me watch a stream of him showing off his creations. I wasn't impressed.

I tried it anyway to shut him up.

It's actually really quite good... I only really play it as co-op, but the grinding is actually not too bad - gathering materials actually challenges you to make it easier for yourself; they give you the option to try and automate everything, but you've got to be very creative."

9700,"Its a fun, creative game but you need friends, otherwise its kinda... meh."
9701,"Alright, so I just want to say right now that I am by no means an expert at SM. I just like making random creations.
I've also never seen a warehouse in Survival, never had a Spudgun in Survival, but that's not really important as I'll just be focusing on the game as a whole. The issues I'll be talking about may make it seem like I'm just being really critical of the game, but they are really big issues.

So. Scrap Mechanic. I purchased the game shortly before the Survival update, mostly just messing around with cardboard and spudguns. It was only after the Survival update when I got into trying to build creations that would require a good physics engine. A few months ago, I attempted to make a trebuchet-type thing, using only a winch, a catch, and a counterweight. It didn't work. At all. I connected a bunch of pipe pieces with loose bearings to almost create a rope, which i would wrap around a rotating piece. Instead of lifting the counterweight with the force of the controllers, the pipes started stretching and separating due to the weight I had put on the other side for propulsion. And here's the issue. The physics engine. Scrap Mechanic's physics engine is so incredibly janky, the way things behave is nearly illogical. You'll see parts that are connected with bearings or suspension stretching out when pulled apart with nearly any force, causing the creation to be flung away. Instead of just having a limit to how they can move, objects stretch and spring back, but never land in the correct place. Things that should be perfectly clear of obstruction sometimes randomly collide into the edge of a block that has managed to move itself just a few pixels. Sometimes this is almost bearable, but usually the physics engine just does whatever it wants. Half of the stuff you try to do that you think would work doesn't because of the really weird physics. 

The next problem. Performance. Scrap Mechanic. Will. Lag. There is no doubt. For some reason, this game is barely optimized and anything of significant size will drop your frames if not on a lift or welded to the ground. I have a fairly powerful PC, and even some solid structures with no moving parts at all will cause it to lag. 

Now, onto the gameplay. Scrap Mechanic has a large community with a countless amount of creations and mods on the workshop. Building creations is usually not too difficult, save for anything that uses real-life physics concepts. Survival mode is fun, and works well with the building-sandbox style, allowing you to create your own bases, vehicles, defenses, farms, etc. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating, as getting some items requires some serious grinding at the beginning of the game. Not much else to say about it. The story is okay, probably not the most unique thing ever, though the characters and general art style definitely have their own... Charm.  

And so I only request 2 things from Axolot. 
1. Please, just get your stuff together and fix that physics engine. It just doesn't work and nearly ruins the gameplay.
2. Please optimize the game. A lot. I know Axolot has already done a lot of optimizing, but this game needs more than a lot of optimizing. It's flat-out unplayable on anything short of a supercomputer.
(though the recent addition of the physics slider can help with this a little)

In conclusion, if you don't mind the physics and performance issues and are a fan of building/survival sandboxes, absolutely buy this game. I love this game an endless amount and genuinely hope Axolot fixes these glaring issues so that, hopefully, maybe some other people can find this game one day and feel the same way about it that I do."

9711,
9712,"9/10 - With Fant mod
6/10 - Vanilla

Game is still not finished. Developer wasting too much time on Raft IMO. Need to spend more time on this project.

PROS:
-Limitless creativity and ingenuity
-Multiplayer
-Graphics and game physics (for the most part)
-Building is well thought out and pretty solid
-Anything will work with enough tweaks
-AI pretty good for early access. Certain bots will bait you instead of just charging and will avoid items they see as hazards


CONS:
-Not optimized... building too complex or too large will turn the game into a lagfest
-No dedicated servers (listed in roadmap as a maybe far future feature)
-Lack of story and content
-Steam workshop is great for items and designs... not for mods. Manual installation for each player is required to play together.


What got me into this game was the survival mode, challenge mode is also a good time. Initially the concept and execution is great, however after playing 30-45 minutes in survival it becomes a farming simulator. You can run warehouses, but when you get to the roof it is lackluster... no boss (yet) or really that great of loot to make it worth. There are plans for quests, but when they will be implemented who knows. Game is early access 5 years going strong with modders easily outpacing the developers lol

If you want to get immersed and give yourself (ALOT) more content, install fant mod. It is a must until the developers realize this is their block buster and dedicate more time into this project. It transforms the original 150 blocks and parts into over 600+. Huge QoL features and even further interaction.

Then there's survival, something pulled out of the fiery pits of hell (literally), where there's a 99% chance that you're going to die and lose everything at least once, most likely twice. Either way, both game modes are very rewarding in their own ways, I love them both, and the game overall."

9766,"As someone with almost 6,000 hours in this game, it's probably about time I write a review. I'm just going to say this straight off the bat, this game is a MUST HAVE, what sets it apart from other building/survival games you may ask, let me tell you. First of all, the game is simple, it is easy to build and wire things up,  while you can build complicated and efficient creations, you can also stick to the simple and aesthetic part of the game. So now onto survival mode, which is also, an absolute blast. While it takes the building section from creative mode into survival, it also adds fairly challenging elements to it, I won't be spoiling anything about the actual mode, but I will review the basics, as I found it super fun to wander into it on my own, and discover new things. I quite like the progression of the game, because it is not too slow, and not too fast, I find it to be rather satisfying discovering new things to upgrade not only your car, but your base and weapons, some people may find the game too heavily based on grinding, but it is well worth it to improve more things, and it also has an automation aspect, a good example of this is oil, you start off slowly swimming collecting little bits of it at a time, but as you go on, you can automate the process with pumps and tubes, or how you start off hand watering your crops, but end off with a huge system that can water a whole farm in seconds. While I could go on and on all day talking about survival, I'll move on to multiplayer, while it is buggy, it is by far the best way to play this game, it opens up so many possibilities with just one other person, like racing, co-op building and survival mode especially, and if you are playing survival, you can improve efficiency massively with another player, and it is just an absolutely incredible experience. Now, I could not cover this, but if you buy the game and wonder why I didn't go over challenge mode, then maybe you'll be a tad bit confused, so I'll do it just for you, yay! I'll start off by saying that this is not the best game mode, while it can be useful for beginners learning the basics of the game, the other modes give you a lot more freedom, so maybe if you buy this game, start off doing the first of the challenges, then hop into creative or survival where you can stumble upon things on your own. I'm not saying the challenges are bad, (I still finished them all) I just would recommend the other game modes more, and if you do plan on finishing them all, you'll need some experience as they can prove to be quite difficult, either that or I just suck at this game. Well that's gonna wrap it up for this guide so I say you should buy the game. 10/10"
9767,Its pretty fun but it gets really hard to play survival because of the robot attacks on crops which makes it hard to actually progress but other than that its fine.

9797,"What can I say other than how great the game is? I guess I could say that it can become laggy if you have too big of an idea, or if you really love playing PowerPoint. Sometimes your car rejects laws of physics, but you get used to it and you can get around that. It's a really good game if you're creative and love building things, or if you like playing with logic. It's endless fun and genuinely really fun.
It might not be the most fun in survival yet, but it has potential. If you're a hardcore survival player, you might want to wait a couple updates before trying it out because right now, survival is pretty boring and grindy.
If you like making challenges and puzzles, you can do that using challenge mode, where you can't just destroy everything and have to use your brain cells. You can make some intricate puzzle maps or challenging maps where you need to make a car with limited resources and drive it to the end.

Basically, you can do anything you want. If that's what you're looking for, go for it!"
9798,its fun lol

Honestly, a lot of stuff that happens is kinda logical. It never really felt cheesed when I lost a lot of things which I appreciate. It was just a list of bad decisions.

Honestly my favorite survival game so far."

9870,"Endless fun and limitless creation, would recommend to those who like Minecraft and that type of game. 10/10
"
9871,"This game is a lot of fun, but sadly it has been in early access for a very long time and i wish i could see it become more of a fleshed out game than just a sandbox where you build cars, its a lot of fun and i would recommend it but i really think it needs more work into becoming something more than it is i don't remember the last time i saw news about the survival mode getting better or being updated with some new story line or any kind of story other than angry robots and a crashed ship, its iffy but ill still recommend it

yours truly, HueGho"
9872,gud
9873,"I personally would highly recommend this to People who like Logic/Programming. This is quite an easy game to understand, it just takes time to get used to it. If you like Mods, this is great too, you can easily install Mods and such and have fun those stuff. No wings in the game? GET A MOD! It's that easy üòâ

Nice game, I rate it 4/5 stars!"

9875,Love this game
9876,nice
9877,Good
9878,"have wanted to play this game for years, self described as an engineers wet dream. i""m loving every minute of playing. on it"
9879,"Y'know this game is older than you think since that this game came out in 2016, and well since then we've came a long way since that the Survival mode was announced a long time ago and when that dropped I sat there and waited... and waited... untill one day I saw it, the day that Survival dropped and I was far from dissapointed. With the topic of Survival mode, its not a sterotypicial Survival game since its not, take rock from ground, hit tree, take leave and make rope, no no this mode made you use your brain since a complex egineering system is implemented allowing you to create machines that no other survival game would let you. 

Of course there is some drawbacks some people could have with this game such as the games set of pace, the game emplements farming vegatables and fruits as a form of curency to buy items, but farming takes, well a very long time since you need loads of goods before you can buy anything.

I give this game a 9.5/10, it has unlimited possibilities but the farming is a bit time consuming."
9880,it is fun game that i can play with my friends with but there is a bug in multiplayer where bearing and piston locations on vehicles are all over the place but anyway it is very fun :) plz read
9881,E
9882,this game is very fun I love the creativity of it and I love the new survival mode I had waited for it for so long I am so glad it is finally here
9883,good game
9884,"this is the best game i have ever bought i recommend but there is one bad thing, its way more fun with friends."
9885,good game put room for improvement
9886,"Been playing this game for 3 years! I find that it is time to review it. So, I wish there were some items like ball bearings and corner wedges. Maybe a way to load the survival map in creative. There are lots of glitches also, but besides that, this is an amazing game!"
9887,5
9888,where monke
9889,Fun game with lots of things to do.
9890,good game

9967,i like this game because there is mods
9968,This is just from my perspective but this game opened up my imagination. The learning curve is long and amazing when you figure out tips and tricks on how to play the game better or have much more fun! As you can see it is early access but that just means you can be excited for the things to come!
9969,Finally I can build me a father who loves me...

9979,This game is just as fun as i thought it would be. I found this game through a youtuber and it looked amazing and the physics are great. 10/10 would recommend
9980,"I bought this already back in 2017 because I tought it might turn out good.  Now its 2021 and they did almost nothing over the years, custom controls are still only with numberkeys. WASD are preset and not changeable. Imagine driving a car with 1234 instead of WASD. The newly added survival mode is completely unbalanced. There is no place where you can find usefull parts, or if there is they dont tell you where. No tutorial or whatsoever.

Completely stupid game, whatever they sell it for save it"
9981,it is a very creative game. build your dream veicles or hop into survival and battle against the bots to survive!!!!!!!! (very very very fun) (mods recomended for more fun) :))))
9982,It's a good game with a good community
9983,I like scrap Mechanic because you can be very creative
9984,pee
9985,"Game is good for the state it is in (developpement) - Engine is outdated and archaic. Wich means this company is victim of it's success. They're making promises that can't be accomplished with the current engine.  Honestly they're gonna need to either rebuild from scratch on a new performing engine or wich is what is happening so far: Radio silence with some devblog every half year...  I don't see a future in wich they're gonna start over. Game is more of an elaborate fraud. Looks so awesome and promising but actually sucks. And do not dare building a railroad or anything that goes beyong 100cubes lenght or your whole structure will start to shake like its living on a permanent earthquake. Worse, if you dare to vehicle on it itll throw you, and sometimes catapult you for no apparent reason... If you buy this, beware you get what you get and nothing good shall ever be added to it under the current conditions it is built upon."
9986,great game. The devs are still working on it but its pretty awesome.
9987,cool game but can sometimes be confusing.
9988,"very good game =), also i need help"
9989,"good game fun to play totaly recamend it, just make shuer you compuder can handl it cause it can be laggy"
9990,game makes me need to clean my under wear out
9991,"to all the people calling this a rip-off minecraft, how? "" It HaS cUbEs So ItS a MiNeCrAfT rIp-OfF"" shut... just shut! ITS GREAT, it a survival game so its a bit of a grind but its so fun."
9992,Epic
9993,I love the physics
9994,"You may think this game has lots of potential, and to a certain extend it does. 
The game however has horrible frame rates at certain points in the game. For example when using a drill to mine.
Growing crops early game is a pain in the ass since the robots go straight for the crops and whack it. 
Got the spudgun and lots of food and potatoes.
Go to the warehouse and get wreck by tapebots.
Seriously these pieces of shits can 2 shot you. 
For the people who say tapebots are not an issue, glad you are so good at dealing with them. Also fuck you.
These pieces of shits have lightning speed reflexes, shooting you immediately when spotted. Their projectile though can be dodged, is super fast and accurate. 
The warehouse is crawling with these things so if there's 2 or 3 of them, 2 shot death is imminent.

Durability is a BITCH. enemies can easily destroy parts of your creations. Also once they destroy the driver's seat of your car, its fucked.

Also I tried to make a boat or submarine only to realize that propellers don't work in this game. So how the fuck are we suppose to make a boat? 
There are people on youtube who tried using paddles but it's slow as fuck. 
Thrusters are not fuel efficient. So don't bother.

It's 2021 and I wanted to play a new game. Should have bought something else."

10014,"While this game has a lot of potential it is still not a fulfilling experience in survival. the building mechanic is excellent, the parts are interesting and the whole framework of building and crafting is great. The only exception to this is the time it takes to build things- it just makes you progress slower artificially and does not seem to add anything valuable to the experience.

In a similar vein, the balance is very off- even the most basic early game parts needed to make vehicles need resources you are practically incapable of finding while staying alive. You will die of hunger and thirst many times over because the farmbots are attracted to anything more than a couple planted vegetables and take seconds to destroy farms that take hours to build. Without a way to reliably grow food you are locked in a constant death cycle and a constant cycle of having to defend your farm every 15-25 minutes. You cant explore very far in that time, and if you dont have enough food, you can't explore without dying and leaving all your stuff behind only to retrieve it later, if you have time until the next farm raid. It is incredibly frustrating."

It's the best game ever. (if you have friends)"
10041,very fun and it makes me feel smart
10042,"To be able to give a credible opinion on this game we have to divide it into two things: Survival and Creative. Creative mode is amazing. I've spent many hours playing this mode and i don't regret it. Doing random things and watching if they will drive or not, downloading mystery boxes and opening them with friends. Great fun. Survival, on the other hand, is another matter. I didn't play it for a long time because it didn't interest me. The main disadvantage of this mode is monotony. All in all, I highly recommend the game if you want to play creative mode with your friends. (Don't turn on survival)"

10064,"The game has a solid framework going for what's to come with later updates and the devs seem decent.

Besides how beautiful the game is and how satisfying a lot of its mechanics are, what surprises me most is how robust the AI is. After playing games like Ark: Survival Evolved where enemies just beeline straight for you and hit you it's actually kind of terrifying how the haybots in this game can clown-car out of a building, run up to you, and then all circle around you like a pack of wolves trying to limit your movement options. They don't just run up and attack you, they actually kite YOU and try to bait YOU into attacking them so they can retaliate.

One big warning I should give right now though is how unstable the physics can be and how limiting a lot of the tools the game has are. Parts clip through eachother far too easily which makes trying to make a train or any sort of machine with interlocking parts like a piston powered by rotational force completely unviable. They just clip straight out of their housing with a big middle finger held up. If you have something spinning fast enough (which isn't difficult) then rather than hitting enemies or flinging you it just clips straight through them. It's maddening.
Additionally, the action sequencers in the game have very limited functions such as only having a max speed of 1 second per action (which means any complex sequences are gonna take like 10 whole seconds), the timers work in an irritating and strange way, engines can only power one direction when hooked up remotely, the entire friction system is jank and unreliable with even sliding along on perfectly flat terrain bumping like crazy, and a million other pet peeves with the system. If you're a veteran of LittleBigPlanet 2 or Gmod then these limitations are going to drive you up the wall unless you want to treat them like a challenge like me.

Either way, I hope with all my heart they fix/change these issues in the future, and despite them I'm probably going to put a lot of time into this game. It's got a lot of character and it's nice to play a game that has more polish than the usual survival crafting fare you find on Steam. Even as it stands right now it's pretty fun and lacking in the sloggy bullshit that most survival crafting games have."

10110,"EDIT: I played another 10 hours and changed my review to positive as i want this game to succeed. I'm still wouldn't recommend the game to new players but wanted to change my review to help the devs as this game has a huge potential to make waves with some changes to make it friendlier to new players. I spend another hour watching tutorial videos online as the in game ones are really  confusing. As I mentioned I'm used to building games and survival mechanics. I'm a full grown adult and I'm not sure how a child is supposed to figure some of this stuff out?

Things in the instructions like you can use RMB to block incoming attacks with the sledgehammer does not seem to work at all. Is this a mistake in the instructions or planning to come later? it would relly improve this game if it had a parry system or something. for now I guess i just have to keep jumping backwards hoping not to get hit. Maybe a slow circular attack around you could be really nice.

////////////

So much potential, but somehow when it all comes together it's a hard pass on this game for now. Builder and survival games are my jam and the trailer really did make this look epic and right up my alley.

The good:
- graphics
- not too buggy
- very unique building system with potential

As a new player, here are my notes to devs to improve the game and to others why you should wait to pick this title up.

- Overall the game just feels like a chore. Especially in survival. I tried the game in creative and challenges but the tutorials are really poor (YES i read the entire handbook manual).

- Farming is really weird as a new user. Why can't crops just grow with water? Why can't I drink water? The spray stuff to make crops grow is really hard to obtain and most crops you try to grow in the beginning just get demolished by enemies when you step away.

- Remove the free phone app style build timers and collect buttons for crafting items. This is such a terrible mechanic. Just make me hold down build for a second or two or auto dump the items out of the machine. Manually clicking collect is ridiculous. At least give me a collect all button (for collecting stuff off my dead body as well please).

- The food system is probably the worst offender. You go through food so fast in the beginning its almost impossible to leave your base for long as you can't grow enough crops without the crop growing spray. The highest recommended way to get around this is just not to eat and die and repetitively pick up your dropped items when working in the base. How annoying is that? also some weird sound issues that make the dying of hunger/thirst the loudest and most annoying sound in the game. Reduce food consumption rate 10x fold and/or remove the crop growing spray and stick to water only working to make this less of a chore. Also water should cover more than 1 tile, ideally up to 5. how annoying is walking back and forth with 2 buckets to water 25 plants. PITA. 

- Look at games like Valheim that make food systems enjoyable. Let me build my base in peace but when I wander out food helps me survive. 

- The build system could be sooooo goood. It's super hindered by the way the toolbar works. give me dedicated tools in one location or better yet as separate buttons from regular items. Inventory management hell ensues every time I die as everything gets moved around and out of order. Take a look at factorio or satisfactory, they handle this really well.

- The lift for building is interesting but you should freeze all objects from falling in an AOE or let me move disconnected objects so I can reattach them. Usually disconnected objects with any springs or other interactive elements just bug out and whirl around so I can never attach them again without breaking them. I tried making complex things in survival but it was just a nightmare when i wanted to move sections. Speaking of creative not being able to save creations seems like a complete dealbreaker. All that time to lose something so fast. Also when I fall off a cliff i don't want to walk around a mountain 20minutes to get back up to my machine...

- Make the exploration building more interesting and have objects I can pick up there to add to my creations. Box hunting these monuments just feels like homework. Spawn some random sheds that can be broken down at least.

- AUTO pickup items that enemies drop or plants. Why do I have to go around all these boxes I just broke and spam the pickup button? Its just makes me cringe and is so unnecessary.
- Give me more lockers to store crap at the bases.

Fix some of this and I'll be happy to change my review and hopefully have a really entertaining game. I bought the game first to test if it's right for me and my buddies but I can't recommend it to them at this stage."
10111,Please do yourself a favor and do not get this game.  Every aspect makes almost no sense.  Shocks makes your car bounce around more than ever.  You cannot see to drive off road.  Farming is like pulling teeth and I like to farm.  Machines that make your stuff do not make it when you walk away.  They just simply stop.  This game is utter garbage.
10112,"I can say that this game is one of my favorites, even if it is not the one that i have played the most. I can say that the developers of this game are truly devoted to developing this game as fast as possible to bring the best experience for the audience. The whole idea of the game is remarkable and it really puts your mind to work regarding what you can create in this game, be it a car, plane, sprinkler or other mechanism that might help you. One of the greatest additions is the multiplayer, which makes the game 10 times more fun, in my case I do not have friends to play with, but I have seen various youtubers which play together with their friends. The level has stepped up with the addition of the survival game mode, which has been awaited by the community for a very long time. 
  I hope you have found this review helpful in a way or another. I am not a certified critic or something like that and my opinion may be invalid in a way, even so, I would like to thank you for reading so far."

10159,"With plenty of stuff to do, and almost complete freedom, i would say it is one of the best games available to play, allowing you to expand your creativity beyond what you could imagine, and the availability to rotate blocks unlike Minecraft makes this game as good as it could be"
10160,good game kills a lot of time
10161,"Decent sandbox game,especially with friends."
10162,Its a pretty cool game its kind of like mincraft there is a survival mode and creative mode where you can build things. Also its a creative multiplayer sandbox game which drops you right into a world where you quite literally engineer your own adventures. Choose from the 100+ building parts you have at your disposal and create anything from crazy transforming vehicles to a house that moves.
10163,"Most survival games doesn't really have any goal to it other than building your basic base, here come the possibility to build your own vehicle and the limit is your imagination. Awesome game in general"

10165,"fun game,  still some jankyness to be fixed yet even after years in early access maybe? Seems like slow development? must be a team of 4-6 devs?"
10166,"It's so fun when you know what you're doing but its also not that hard to learn how to do stuff. At start stuff might seem complicated but it took me only 1h-2h to get the hang of it so if you're wondering if you should buy the game or not because you might think its complicated, then don't worry you can always search a tutorial and learn one by one. But the survival on the other hand [yes i know its a pretty relatively new mode] is still pretty fun at start but then the more stuff you do and collect it might get kinda boring if you don't have any more ideas to do. Overall fun and enjoyable game for sure."

10171,Fun to play in creative or Survival.

edit, it is been installed for 2 days and i have played for about 22 hours, it gets addicting"
10173,wow
10174,challenging way builds or surviving. maybe bot but it need a lot reworks in surviving and some items not in creative mode. why take so long update? need more craft-able and stacking items

10210,"This game is very fun. Ive played since before survival, but never played anything but creative until about a year after survival. And now im addicted to survival. Creative mode is good enough, you get to engineer your own cars, planes, boats, etc. And installing mods is SOO easy. But then survival mode, its just so fun. I do think that survival mode could use a lot more features, such as upgradeable weapons, crafting recipes that you buy from the trader (such as a better bed that will actually skip through night, and it could cost a lot of high teir plants that are harder to grow due to raids) and also raids should be nerfed. Raids are fun the first few times, but get annoying, i think they should stay as hard as they are, but only happen maybe half of the time, and or space them out a minimum of 2 in game days. I also  think there should be more ways to get component kits as they are pretty much the whole game, you cant do anything without them. So maybe add separate components that you get from mobs, and have mobs drop more than one thing, and then if you have enough components, you can make a component kit. I also wish totebot heads dropped as items rather than a physical object, because they just lag the game if you dont clean them up, which is no problem to me, but it gets annoying. But to someone who doesnt know to clean them up, after a while, their game might lag. I also think totebot heads could be refined, but only give like 5 scrap metal. I also think that pumping water and oil and chemicals should be slightly nerfed, because when you pump them, you just get so much so fast, and its so cheap to make a pump, even early game, and it just kinda ruins the fun, cuz you either work way to hard to get like 3 water, or you pump an entire large chest of it and never have to worry about water again, which is nice, but just kinda makes the game too easy."
10211,"I love this game

10213,yes

10215,"I freakin' love this game, hitting farmbots with rockets at lightspeed. amazing"

10217,Banger game
10218,i like the creativeness you have with it and adding the survival into it makes it even more fun

10240,"Good survival game because building barely functional vehicles is fun, especially since smashing into haybots on the road is quite ""fun"", it also does a good job of making farmbots feel very scary early game because of their design and size. The farm defense system is also a good mechanic for the way the game works. Can get pretty grinding if you dont have many resources around and repetitive if you can't find certain biomes. other than that the warehouses are at the beginning giant ominous buildings in the distance but later in the game are a important feature of survival mode due to the unique loot inside them but honestly so much is possible in this game that im excited for the future chapters."
10241,it's good because you can  drive and fly. it's just good fun to me.

10249,"[b]Creativity: 9/10[/b] - There's creative ways to build vehicles and structures, even with logic, timers, sensors, pistons, and such. However, There's a few problems: I do hate that there's a temporary hitbox for bearings for painting, which is a waste of paint ammo in Survival, and Controllers needs improvents when activated and deactivated too fast, Sometimes it goes reverse to return on loop mode.

[b]Survival Mode: 9/10[/b] - Green Totebots, Haybots, and Farmbots. good balance, although, Farmbots needs to have super jump. It was pretty hilarious when a Farmbot fires a chemical blast onto the surface warehouse ceiling while it intended to target at me while I'm on a fruit/veggie container. 1/10: The annoying tapebots, so I put it on ""Easy"" Kinda feels like it's a balanced damage, reason is: I'm not great at aiming. [i]Please add a rewarding system the higher the difficulty. Chance to drop Garment boxes.[/i]

[b]Challenge Mode: 7/10[/b] I'm going to divide the rating with build mode and test mode: [b]*Build mode: 4/5[/b] Feels like a better Creative mode. Players can fly and create a maximum of 64 by 64 building blocks per placement instead of 16 by 16, but there's no way to create those giant piston arm platforms. [b]*Test Mode: 3/5[/b] Gameplaywise, pretty good. The only problem is a crash that may occur during reset.

[b]Multiplayer: 8/10[/b] It's good, but Sometimes, There's connection lag as a non-host. With that effect, When I place a toilet, I don't see that toilet placed, but the host can.

[b]Tile Builder: 7/10[/b] The tool is a bit confusing sometimes, the layers, the terrain, the items, the foliage. The item rotation information's messed up. Creativity's slow, but still possible.

[b]Overall: 40/50[/b]

In the warehouse, It was so tedious to remove both the Encryptor and the Protector out of the warehouse. After the elevator to the roof, I still can't delete them, but I can weld them onto a block. I still can't edit the Warehouse"
10250,da
10251,so much freedom
10252,reeeeeeeeeeeeee
10253,"A very attractive game, with regular updates that open up possibilities for us and new creations. Survival was a great game changer, because even after 100 hours on a map there is still something to do, but after getting all the resources it starts to get boring, but anytime you can start another map with new experiences and complete another story, decided by the actions you do, and the situations when you come across random red robots in the woods. I hope this review was helpful."

10275,"    Scrap Mechanic is one of my favorite ‚Äúsurvival style‚Äù games. The game‚Äôs mechanics are more powerful than Minecraft, subnautica, ARK Survival Evolved. Scrap Mechanic is more difficult than ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù Minecraft, but easier than ARK Survival Evolved.

YOU‚ÄôLL ENJOY SCRAP MECHANIC, 
IF YOU ENJOY:
‚Ä¢ Apocalypse/Raid style games
‚Ä¢ Challenging survival games 
‚Ä¢ Building LEGOs
‚Ä¢ Creative Designing
‚Ä¢ Customizing Vehicles
‚Ä¢ Grinding in-game materials
‚Ä¢ Beautiful Graphics
‚Ä¢ Off-Roading

DOWNSIDES TO THE GAME:
‚Ä¢ No arrow dynamics 
‚Ä¢ Driving is ‚Äúfull throttle‚Äù or nothing. The throttle is controlled by ‚Äúa button, not a trigger‚Äù
‚Ä¢ There is no ending to Scrap Mechanic"

But I always loved the premise of this game, and I had tons of fun making stupid shit.

I'm breaking my 666 hours to play survival mode (sorry Vic!)
Will update this when I have. Large ass file, 4gb holy shit.

"
10324,its ok i guess lmao
10325,"Very good game. The components and mechanical aspects are great. The speed of the game and the survival aspects are fun but remain adequately challenging. 

The single biggest flaw is the absence of tutorial levels to explain the purpose of various stations in the survival world. Yes its survival, you're fending for yourself but the lack of instruction is infuriating. 

The game would be much more enjoyable if a tutorial covered such things as:

 - Crate packing produce at packing stations 
 - Planning an expedition across the map
 - Cutting bigger trees and rocks and faster refining
 - Using the re-spawn bed properly
 - How to kill different bot types
 - Using warehouse keys
 - How to easily transport caged farmers

Pretty sure most people will find themselves trawling Youtube for videos of gamers who have (much more time on their hands than me), worked out what to do."

10367,yes
10368,A+
10369,"This game is almost unplayable at the moment. The game style is hinted at playing with friends, but the game can barely handle playing by yourself. You are not able to make your own server for it because they don't have that option available which is ridiculous. I can't make decent sized creations without the game being unplayable and lagging. It can be really hard to make a complicated creation because the more complicated it is, the more laggy the game is. Which sucks because that is what this game is about. For now the game can handle a small base and smaller sized vehicles. I would not recommend making any dock or ramp onto a base otherwise the game can't handle it. Yes the game is 'early access', but the game is 4 years old and these are basic issues that should have been resolved first. Hopefully in 4 more years they will have the basic issues fixed."
10370,great game
10371,"I can build tons of things, also the survival is awesome! PLUS I can play with friends, if I had any, but that's besides the point. If your thinking of buying this game then go ahead. The one complaint I have is there is NO obese cat :("

10391,help me
10392,I love the game great for beeing creative and stuff!
10393,"This game is a shining example of how early access can actually be a beautiful thing.  I started playing this game five years ago when it was just creative mode and dumped a few hundred hours into just building weird vehicles / houses and any other thing that came to mind.  Every now and again they released an update with some cool new functionality that everyone wanted, and it always built very well on top of the existing things.  

It's incredible to see how far this game has come, while still holding onto all of the things that made people fall in love with it from the beginning.  Unlike a lot of building games, I can still work on things that I made on a five year old version of the game.  All the blocks work fine, and I can incorporate new blocks just as nicely.

When survival mode came out, I found myself hopelessly addicted again and emotionally invested in all the things I was building / learning.   It looks like they finally added all the new things from Survival mode (like day / night cycle, WATER, etc) into the creative mode.  Now I'm taking the cool houses and vehicles that I made 5 years ago and setting them up in the beautiful new creative world with water and day / night.  My house is now a beach side property with a dock!  Can't wait to figure out how to build a boat.  

Seriously this is probably the best video game I've ever played in my life.  I don't think I will ever become sick of it."
10394,it's an amazing game of creativity and fun
10395,Very entertaining. Good for exploring your creativity.

10412,"There's a great deal to already like about Scrap Mechanic, with more on the horizon as development continues.

Scrap Mechanic has the feel of 'Raft' (comforting easy graphics - you don't need a 6 month or younger PC to run it) combined with the block accessorizing of Minecraft (and then some), with a sprinkling of Engineering know-how being handy, and a small helping of Farmville (the engaging side of it).  One of the most entertaining 'building' games I've played in quite a while.  There is a great community, with a number of Video posters providing content (and great ideas!) along with a very active community workshop in Steam for any sort of creation you can dream up.

Likes / Pros
The capability to create/build functional suspension and gearing on vehicles (not needed but awesome!)
Recordable physical actions (creations can change shape, come to life, open/close, raise/lower, drive/fly/float/dive, etc)
Multi-Player friendly - get your best pals together for a session!
Survival/Creative Mode are a blast - I do think Challenge needs revamping - take some ideas from all the content creators!
Good sized world to explore - items created are static, world items taken will respawn after a game day it seems and 'dropped' items despawn after time, allowing for clutter-free world.

Wishes
Static server capability (User created and maintained, but static for better multi-player involvement)
Better water physics - At least some resistance so paddle boats and the like would work.  Something tells me 'liquids' are on the list to get tweeked still, given the liquids used in game and how they can be moved around - and all the pipe pieces in game with no current function.
Ability to import/export blueprints in Survival. (Lots of ability for 'abuse' here, but it still would be nice to reload my 'own' Survival creations for easier creation, if I have the materials on hand to build)
More variety to the bots, with more specific bot AI for the various types (work in progress - bots just got a recent AI update)

Cons
Physics at times can drain FPS rate if 'thing go wrong'  (When they do, it's a panic to find 'what' broke and remove/fix it).  Not only things you create, but in the world if you leave things in disarray (lag can occur in specific areas/tiles if you left that area/tile in a state of ruin - say a wood building knocked over, with bits all sliding around not coming to rest).  This also gets better with updates.  (I feel like SM's creators should talk to Astroneer's creators - lots to gain both ways I think.)

Can't wait for more storyline, perhaps more 'quest' goals in Survival, etc.

If you like building your own unique, functional creations be they buildings, vehicles, or just artwork in the game world you are playing 'in' - then you should pick this up for sure.

10413,"I will not recommend my friends because i dont want them to get better then me
"
10414,play it
10415,this game is the best ever it super cool
10416,"I haven't played the game much for now so I can't really make myself a clear opinion on the game, but for now I feel like I've wasted my money. It's been 5 years since the game has been released, it is still in early access and still really empty. For now I've only played survival mode and it is the first time a game made me want to smash my pc in under 2 hours. You said this game is a sandbox ? A SANDBOX ???? Then why the hell did you put RULES to a SANDBOX GAME ???? 'Cause yeah there are f***ing RULES that prevents you from having fun in this game. Did you see the survival mode trailer ? Please look at the crops that the players planted. Do you think you can do that ingame ? Of course you can, if you want to get your entire base destroyed by a raid then come on go plant more than 3 crops together!!! The only other way to get food is to feed wocs (alien cows, the ONLY animals in the game, seriously) to get milk and EVEN DOING THIS IS DANGEROUS, cause Wocs are chased by ROBOTS. Yeah, I said robots. Like why would a robot kill an animal ? It's the most useless thing ever seriously. So PLEASE devs fix mob spawning, remove farming rules and add more things to the game that would not make the players feel alone and get them bored, cause the only other human in the game is a merchant if we don't include caged farmers."
10417,it is a good game
10418,"I've been playing this with my friend, and it's been quite a fun experience! Even though it's early access, this game is fun, and allows for a lot of creativity in the things you can make! Can't wait to see what's in store, I'll be keeping a close eye on this one!"
10419,best game
10420,"This game is very fun, and at first challenging. They really brought back the game with the new survival mode and I think they should add more to survival like a new location or a whole new island."
10421,this is the best game its so fun and you can build any thing and your can put your mind too and you can be creative

10430,"Hard to get into, rewarding when you do. If you can think of it, you can probably build it in this game, and on the heavy off-chance you can't, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of mods to mess around with. 100% recommend."
10431,"Need a semi-powerful pc. Need LOTS of experience, generally I'd call it a ""advanced version of minecraft""
If your looking for a builders game, definitely recommend"

10458,its really fun:D
10459,i like building with the mods
10460,is aight
10461,fun but hard it is like 4.5 star game
10462,E
10463,ok
10464,"In it's essence it's a great creative game, that hasn't been updated properly since march 2020.
Mods are what keeps this game afloat, not the actual core game any more and that's a bit of a shame. It feels like the studio doesn't put the effort in to develop it with any kind of priority.
They constantly tease and promise features in their Devblogs, but a lot if not most of the things they promise don't make it into the actual game! Not cool guys. Customisable weapons, fueling your vehicle automatically, new mobs. Promised yes. Delivered no. Go read some of the older ones, you'll be surprised. That is annoying especially considering the slow progression of it's development. I know it's a small team but I've followed them since 2016 and there is very little difference.

In conclusion this game is a creative dream, but a development nightmare, where are the updates?? I can't recommend it on the vanilla experience alone."
10465,Best game I have ever played in my life! Only limited by ur creativity! :)
10466,"Its laggi but its also very pro

10467,"I would literally anal the wok from this game, I am creaming just thinking about it. 14.6/19"
10468,"I had refunded this game before (a year ago)... and would do it again out of frustration of how this EA game is just as it was before. (just can't refund twice because of accumulated time)

This could really be a good game... interesting concept and gameplay... BUT it really has 'scrap mechanics':
- Useless world
- Bad animations
- Weird physics
- Little content
- Combat is boring and uninteresting af

SCRAP this one if you value your time!"
10469,e
10470,its a fun game

10472,yes
10473,idk
10474,pee pee poo poo
10475,It is good for players who like to get creative
10476,My opinion if you like mechanic games and physics or just grinding and grindy games this is the right game for you.
10477,Wanna be an engineer? play this its fun
10478,It lost its fun. I bought this game to experiment and make stuff. maybe im not a good builder or something but nothing ever worked. physics and block placement still need a bit of work as re creating things from real life doesn't work
10479,it gives you a free enviroment to let your creativity gor crazy
10480,very fun but can sometimes be confusing

10490,"I absolutely love this games open ended world and atmosphere, it allows for so much to happen, wish there was an easier way to get wax though."
10491,zsdafdsfs
10492,"Very addictive once you are passed the initial discovery, which can be frustrating if you do not seek knowledge from YouTube and other sources.

Steep learning curve if you've never played games like Minecraft.

Non existent tutorial system, all you get are billboards in Survival Mode and a short manual, which is better made and more extensive in Creative Mode.

Very interesting crafting system, your imagination and experience is the limit !"
10493,this is a fun game about physics and creation and believe it or not im not being paid to write this
10494,Good enough. Could be better if they added plane and wind mechanics

10520,awesome!
10521,"I think this game is very good. But, it is very old. Also, the devs don't add major features to the game anymore.Back when Survival was being announced and it had not come out yet there was no updates. Even after it came out the updates were slow. I think this game had and has potential but the Devs have taken it in the wrong direction. My favorite part of the game has to be creative. Because survival is really boring. I think this game has died a lot. Although it was fun I do not recoment you buy this game."
10522,"Really good.
No more needs to be said.

lol 69.2 hours"
10523,fun if you are a creative person

"
10537,"The game is great and extremely fun. The only down side, at least to me, is the freezing and crashing issue with the lift. When placing a certain creation on a lift, it crashes. I know this isn't a very common occurrence but it's still extremely annoying when it happens. Please fix this."
10538,Great game loved playing with friends! If you love building/mechanics this games for you!

10542,its pretty tasty
10543,fun and great game to play with or without friends
10544,"Gotta push out more content, why is survival still so bland and empty 5 years after early access launch? 
Mechanics of something nice is there buuut there are too many dead ends. Take notes from Valheim, make zones with meaningful progressions and reasons to build cool creations to overcome outside challenges (ie bots/terrain etc)"
10545,its great
10546,i play this game too much
10547,very cool game about a guy that builds cars and stuff. very cool
10548,very very very fun game

10554,its quite boring
10555,it good
10556,a
10557,"This game is for creative mode only.
Survival is an unpolished, laggy mess.
- Critical parts are missing (eg positioning block == gyroscope).
- There is no automatic tuning in the control system (you yourself need to set which jet engine with which thrust should work in order for the creation to fly). At first it seems funny, but when you combine this with the problem above, you realize that even if you succeed in setting everything up, the flight will not be in the usual form. And in survival it will be revealed only after several hours of grinding.
- There is no water physics (there is only buoyancy, but you cannot row).
- Very low optimisation."
10558,"Dude, spuds."
10559,aa
10560,This a awesome game!

"
10565,Its a good game you can express your  your creativeity to the max or oyu could wonder a and fight in survival mode
10566,"Amazingly creative game. Hands down the best in its field for ingenuity. I‚Äôve only played for about 85 hours, most of which have been spent running around not knowing what to do, but during those hours, I noticed the incredible amount of things to do. This is the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild for pc."

10575,Nice
10576,I bought this for survival.
10577,"All I have to say is that I love it, it's more simple than Trailmakers when it comes to physics and options but takes more detail into using individual tiny bearings and jets and controllers and wiring, so depending on what you want from an engineering game it's amazing, especially if you want wiring and even if you don't want wiring you can still use other peoples stuff, mods, spud guns, hammers, and spawners."
10578,"Its a great game! It teaches you about things that are similar with the real life , but if you dont have a friend to play with, dont buy it. All my respects for the Axolot Team,they did an incredible job !"

If you are moving from minecraft to scrap mechanic please check the PC requirements first, scrap mechanic can be a demanding game. I have a RTX 2060 and it works well, I can play on high settings at 2K without much lag"
10593,noice
10594,no rules
10595,if you'r creative its the best game
10596,"It's a pretty fun game, but the survival mode is okay until you die from getting gang banged 12 times in 7.2 milliseconds.
Or maybe die to a glitch? potentially you car flings up into the sky while parked because the wind?
Anyways stick to creative mode even though the devs took 4 years to make a garbage survival mode that was nothing to do with all the blogs they posted."
10597, a awesome game
10598,I crashed my friends world with a toilet rocket.
10599,Good Game
10600,yes
10601,"Pros - The game has great content now and is ever expanding.
           It's art style is both serious and funny at times, it's nice to have one that does both.
           Multiplayer with as many people as possible is a really fun way to play and other games might 
           discourage having quite as many people playing as you should in Scrap Mechanic.
           The creative is a great way to express your ideas with limitless resources, though I like survival better.

Cons - Multiplayer lags a lot at times (though a recent update to help with optimization has heavily remedied 
            this.)
            A few features seem a little bit buggy since the game is in early stages of development, though these 
            along with many other cons can be fixed with updates.

Overall Review - A game with a lot of features and even more potential with later updates, that provides a 
                           truly fulfilling experience to the player regardless of how many friends you play with. Scrap 
                           Mechanic truly is a great game and I am very excited to see what the devs have up their 
                           sleeves for future updates!"

10628,"PRO: Very interesting and unique physics, you can build very very complex machines. 
CONS: There is not a real survival mode, it is just a creative where u need to farm in order to build stuff; nothing is really a menace to you.
Optimization is a dream. If you build very complex stuff, your fps will lower below 10 fps on high end machines.
If you are on a multiplayer server are you are not the host we are talking about 2-3 fps.
Again the survival mode doesn't have much to offer, other than pointless exploring and farming; also the map is very small and once you build flying machines you can travel the whole map in literally 10 seconds.
""Ball bearing"" are fucked up: if you put too much force on any of those, his axis will start MOVING freely and the machine you are working on will glitch tremendously.

BOTTOM LINE: a very cool concept, not ready to be played, unless you are a casual player and don't spend more than 100 hours on the same game as this game will start disappointing you more and more as you master it.

10629,Good game
10630,"Fantastic game, the price of 20 euros definitely seems like a lot at first but you're getting a easily moddable game (all you have to know is the Lua programming language and the way the game works and you can fully mod the game) and you're also getting full creative and survival modes and a whole workshop of content.

10678,"I bought it when it just came out. A lack of content made me abandon it very soon until I took another peek and found survival mode. The grind for recourses and improving your quality of stuff to make gives you something to do. And it's a blast to play with a couple of friends. However, I do reccomend not going over 3 player severs because of lag. The game officially supports up to 5 but they still need to improve on that."
10679,i think its a great sandbox game and really deserves some credit

10693,"you shoud make it so that you have more clothing when you start!!

10694,id give it 3 stars because i kinda hate how u gotta get food like what if you run out of food in the middle of the game then you die then you try to come back with half food bar and thirst bar and keep dying in the process (that actually happened to me once) so im just gonna say that you should respawn with full hunger and thirst bar and that its not that hard to get food.
10695,Yes...
10696,"Played for a full day, and I just started designing slightly more impressive vehicles with logic and such. Haven't dabbled much in survival yet."

10698,its fun and creative
10699,is fun
10700,great game i wish my friends would play it. it really feels like the community is carrying this game right now though. i ust to watch a YouTuber who made videos of it back in 2018-ish and i can't tell whats changed in 2021 accept for maybe  a few new blocks and the survival mode but that might have already been there. i hope they add more to it going forward.

10714,fun
10715,"This game has a lot of potential, but in its current state i can not recommend it. The review is written solely from a Coop-Survival perspective. If you intend to pick the game up for its creative / engineering aspect, then some of the below may not apply to your experience. This is also gonna be rather long, and since there is an 8000 character limit i'll have to keep each point short.

[b]In General[/b]: Engineering can be a lot of fun, but is quite limited for how long this part of the game already exists. There are some obvious missing features / pieces, such as T-pieces for vacuum (inventory) pipes. There is also a highly limited support for anything but land vehicles. There are parts to make things float, and boosters which can be used for lift. However, getting these to move or even be stable in the air is not exactly something the devs seem to have put any thought into. There are some tricks (read: bugs) you can use to your advantage to make it work, but its not exactly a fun or stable engineering experience. 

[b]Ressource Cost[/b]: Stuff costs a ton (!) to craft. Meaning its quite grindy at times. Which in itself is by no means a downside, but it is very important to keep this in mind to understand some of the following aspects. 

[b]Destruction & AI[/b]: Bots will target players, cows or farms. More on farms below. Usually this means they ignore other things, except if they block their way. Sadly it happens decently often that a parked vehicle or a part of your base ""blocks their way"", except it doesnt really. This can lead to unnoticed destruction worth several hours of playtime. 

[b]Farms, Food & Ammo[/b]: As soon as you build a farm, it will be detected as ""Unauthorized Farming"". This causes a timer to appear, leading to a raid on that farm at midnight. On paper this mechanic sounds like a ton of fun! Except you need a ton of stuff from those farms. They are mandatory for your survival. You need to grow food, water(-food) and ammo. The food and water requirements of your character are also quite aggressive compared to other survival games. So you will want to either build a large farm and then have a day-off, or plant stuff every day to supply your needs. If you build a large farm, this also triggers a larger raid. Which, quite frankly, until midgame you have no hopes of defending with your sledgehammer alone. So you just plant stuff every day then, right? Yes. But this also means you will have a raid every night (a day is 24 minutes).

[b]Time Management[/b]: The raid timer implies a lot of problems. You need to constantly keep it in mind while you do.. anything. Who would want to leave their farm alone to do something productive or maybe some exploration, when the next raid happens in 5-10 minutes? It feels like you get absolutely nothing done. You cant concentrate on engineering, exploration or grinding materials needed for stuff you want to try out, since you either live in danger of starving to death, or need to prepare for the attack happening at midnight. This, again, can sound nice on paper still. If it was done well. You would slowly increase your farm size, build traps, improve your defenses and so on and so on. Except thats not how it works. It simply feels like you dont get anything done. You dont have time to farm ressources, you dont have ressources to build stuff, .. you are constantly treading water with minimal progress. 

[b]Upgrades[/b]: In survival you need to upgrade items. Which effectively means the things you craft are nerfed versions of the items youd have in creative mode. Which means.. well.. they suck. Pistons have a low range and are slow. Engines can only work with very limited bearings, controllers can only control one object at once, and thrusters are literally (!) so bad they cant move a vehicle consisting of only the basic parts needed for even a single centimeter. So upgrades are quite mandatory to get stuff done. How to upgrade things? You need construction components. How to get those? You can either find them in chests, or get them rarely dropped by any except the weakest enemies. Chests respawn, so thats good. Youd get around one per chest on average id say, and enemies have a 1/8 chance to drop them. So how many do you need? It varies. A piston, for example, requires 8 to be maxed, a thruster requires 10 for the first upgrade alone. So you need.. lets say quite a few. The point is, it can take [b]hours[/b] to get enough component kits for something you want to try out, and if it doesnt work it feels like a huge waste of time.

[b]Fighting vs. Engineering[/b]: The main focus of the game is supposedly engineering solutions to problems. Survival is supposed to create an environment suggesting you some problems to solve. However, due to the above problems (Raids, Upgrades, ..) you are highly limited in your drive to experiment around and engineer solutions. The game is not focussed on combat (you dont even see damage stats on weapons, but just about anything else from buoyancy to flammability of an item, for just about anything else). But combat is what it ends up being all about in survival. And you simply dont get anything done to help you with that, be it weapons, traps, or high-tier materials for defense purposes. 

[b]Exploration[/b]: The map is quite large, and honestly looks absolutely fantastic. However, you wont ever get to explore it. Why? For one there are the above mentioned problems. You dont exactly have time for that. Then there is the mechanics shop. It is the first (and only) location you reach after the ""tutorial"". There you can craft basic items such as your workbench, or a large-item-inventory you can walk around with or slap on vehicles. The problem with that is.. that the mechanics shop is the only place to get these. Your own workbench cannot fabricate them. So [b]everybody[/b] will build inside or close to the mechanics shop. Why not relocate later? When you eventually have enough ressources to do so, you already solved every challenge the game threw at you for your current location. So why would you. 
Exploration itself is also not a lot of fun. You cant carry a whole lot. And vehicles dont like forests. Eventually streets end (at least in my world) and you have to drive through a forest. At night this can be fun. Especially if you encounter a large enemy and it wrecks your vehicle. Have fun repairing it, carrying it back, or finding it again after running away. Did i mention there is no map? 

[b]Unloading Range[/b]: For performance reasons stuff unloads pretty quickly. This means your water pump or even workbench will only work while you are pretty darn close to it. Which causes tons of inconveniences and delays. 

[b]Watering[/b]: Every tile of your farm needs to be watered for anything to grow on it. You need to water once a day. You do so with buckets. For those who played Minecraft, imagine watering every block of your farm once a day with a water bucket. It is exactly that. Later on you can automize this, but you will manually water stuff for several ingame days, and it takes a truckload of time and it simply not fun whatsoever. Automation sounds nice? Yeah, except you will likely just look up a solution to it instead of engineering one yourself. Why? Because it took you hours and hours to get there and you dont want to waste these ressources, and dread carrying any more buckets. 

[b]Performance[/b]: The game initially runs fine. However, after some exploration or playtime it gets bad. Real bad. There are huge spikes in frametimes, so even if FPS may still seem decent, it will feel very stuttery after a while (esp. when exploring). This is not to imply that FPS will stay high either. After exploring for an hour or so, FPS for both players dropped from fluid and stable 144+ to <40 and remained there. 

[b]Server'nt[/b]: This game can only be played Coop by joining through steam. No servers whatsoever. Is this 2005?"

10748,i like it allot
10749,10000
10750,i love it
10751,Lot's of possibilities.
10752,"This game, it just, brings out my creative aspect, and you can load other creative things and learn from them, to make a super, over powered, base, and defeat the farm bots and, you know the saying to be or not to be, this is to be."
10753,It's a fun game a bit confusing at the start but once you get the hang of it its just.... AMAZING!!
10754,"New Survival mode is really grindy and suffers from unpolished mechanics (haha lol, scrap mechanics funny) but the devs keep just adding on new shit and don't fix the fact that Survival mode is just not.. fun? I'd love it if you could actually automate farming oil because having to spend half an hour to get enough oil to process into gas and then using said gas for like, 2 minutes of driving really sucks, also the new tier system for blocks is really bad because it's arbitrarily making the next steps cost more and more of a resource

Example: Wood T1 costs 15 scrap wood, gives 10, you need 15 for T2 and so on and so on until T3

The thing being is 10 T3 wood blocks is incredibly small if you want to build anything else with it and you need to wait about 5 seconds for each craft so you just stand there doing nothing because you have to manually pick up things and craft other stuff and there is seemingly no way to automate crafting

The fact the enemies can break blocks means you absolutely have to use the higher tier and tougher blocks because they seemingly break T1 blocks in two hits and god forbit you started planting crops because those fuckers come in swarms

Oh and the blocks past T1 look like absolute dogshit because for some reason they get futuristic-ish and look awful next to other blocks which means everything everywhere is going to look like shit

Levelling up engines and seats and stuff is another way of adding meaningless gameplay making you need to kill enemies in order to get one single resource to use for upgrading them when making the seats and stuff is already a hassle in the first place

Creative mode is fun though but the UI changes are also too futuristic for my liking, and the tier system transferred over to it so you have to use the ugly thrusters if you want thrusters to be useful because they decided to make the original thrusters suck ass, same thing with motors and seats."
10755,love this game
10756,it is cool
10757,much good game because yes
10758,hi
10759,i love this game i prefer creative mode but suvivel is just as good

10762,"
Summary.  
Played survival a year ago.  Left it a while due to too many mid-late game bugs and random crashes.
Fun new content. Yay.
Try again.
Same bugs as a year ago.  more random crashes. Poop.  
Rage quit.

TL;DR

Played this a year ago for about 150 hours.  Decided to wait for a while Because of too many bugs in survival.  Some are funny but others are game breaking.  For example. The dirt duplication glitch when trying to make an automated farm.  Physics not optimised when vehicle approaches multiple logs or stones on the ground.  This makes large mining rigs impossible to operate.

So a few weeks ago I noticed there were some very nice updates.  I was hopeful that the frustrations that caused my rage quit a year ago might also be fixed.   The updates like oil pools are nice.  But alas, the same game breaking bugs are still here!

So frustrating to try to build a creation that you imagine should work, but game breaking bugs like dirt duplication are still not fixed after a year.  Yes all devs want to work on FUN new content and nobody likes to do maintenance like clean the toilet.  But this game has become stinky for all the toilets that havent been cleaned for a year.

If you want to play a fun sandbox with wonky physics and try to build contraptions then try this.  but be warned. there are bugs that will likely never be fixed.  Early game and grind is fun.  Building creations to improve the grind is fun. (except auto farming)

The devs seem to be focusing on new content in creative mode and that might be just fine, (I've never been interested in creative so cannot provide a recommendation)

Cant recommend survival mode at this time.  Mid to late game is broken.

There is no telephone number where I can phone and talk to someone.  The online support is very difficult to navigate.  As a result I am very unhappy with the game and in particular, Axolot Games."
10803,Its a fun game and you can access tons of community creations. Also survival isn't that scary after some time.
10804,"I have mixed feelings about Scrap Mechanic. I is a fantastic game with great potential but it have been abandoned by its developers. It is in early access since 2016.

The game ofers a great experience to creative players. You can make very interesting cars, interactive houses and so on. The game design is gorgeous and everything fits well in the cartoony-robotic look. Unfortunately there is limited content to explore in the world and you can run out of new experiences quite fast.

It breaks my heart to say this, but dont invest into this game unless it gets some attention from the developers."

10822,Extremely well put together game!! Its open world and you can build whatever you want so whats not to like.
10823,funny physics go fucking brrrr
10824,Scrap Mechanic it's the best game ever i love it
10825,Nice game
10826,"There is the base of a GREAT game here (honestly it makes me really frustrated that steam forces me to choose 'yes' or 'no', since I think ti's a bit more nuanced than that. I think the current game mechanics for survival do need quite a bit of work, but I think there is huge potential for this game. 

As it is, I find some of the interwoven challenges to be degrading to the overall experience. The fact that starving/dehydrating to death is such a continuous part of most player's experience is, in and of itself, evidence that there's a flaw in the base mechanic. I don't think it should have to be assumed that the player will die very regularly should be a standard part of the gameplay (especially outside of deaths caused by combat'). This assumption of death then requires the player to create respawn points, which also then requires the player have access to one specific map resource (cotton)..... IMHO this just creates a very specific chain that doesn't lend itself well to the open world concept the developers are building. 

That being said, it somewhat pains me to have to give the game a overall negative review since there is so much done right. The building mechanics are fantastic. There's huge fun to be had just in exploring the physics and building all sorts of creations in the Creative Mode. But I do feel the limitations in the survival mode are sufficiently frustrating that it makes the net experience a negative for me."
10827,"Great game to test physics, and play with friends!!!"

10842,Kind of underwhelming tbh
10843,"boss i dont know what to do
"
10844,good
10845,Liked how creative you can be when playing
10846,this game is really fun and axolot has done a good job with the game and i cant wait to see what else survival has in store for chapter 2.
10847,Its a graet game

10851,"YES its a builders dream.
It's got so many different tools to make all things ranging from  cars to massive dinos.
It also has cameos for the game Raft!"
10852,ye
10853,haha glitches go brrrrrr
10854,It is great. I want to have friends but it is still cool
10855,I am seething
10856,very epic swag epic game
10857,just buy it
10858,my litle brother is obsesed with this game!
10859,minecraft but modded the crap out of 10/10
10860,2 things. Dont expect physics to be consistent and have fun
10861,so crative and also cool not too easy on survival mod
10862,It's a super good game
10863,i don't feel like writing i just recommend it
10864,this is a good game it almost made my pc explode now i have a new laptop
10865,HI
10866,Nice
10867,Absolutely great game. I am having a really fun time grinding and building with friends on our survival world.
10868,the servers are really really bad and its impossible to play with friends without lag but single player is good
10869,its a verry cool game. there are no limits in posabilites
10870,Extremely fun for the creative kind.

10872,AMAIZING Building Game. Best Game I've Played For A Long Time!!!
10873,"The gameplay is really good, and the building is awesome. Right now my only complaint is my inputs get stuck occasionally. it is acceptable while building in creative, but I don't want to use the public test for survival.
For regular play, i recommend sticking to the stable build. For testing features or new blocks, the test server is really cool."
10874,:D
10875,"It is a fun game, but you will need to look up some tutorials/get your mind working a little bit to make the most out of it. Steam workshop downloadable things also make the game very fun, especially with friends."
10876,building game and not trash
10877,One of the best games iv'e ever played!

10883,its fun
10884,Help
10885,"good






"
10886,This is a good game its relaxing and you can play online
10887,"Why does chunk loading exist in a game post-minecraft-era? You cannot fucking interact with anything you have built if it is built a considerable distance from you. 

Your water pumps will turn themselves off. Enjoy wasting hours making a fucking pipe network to have to stand next to it for it to work. I am 8 hours into the game with 4 spent on piping water, chemicals etc.

This is gamebreaking for something from 2015! You've had many years to fix this critical issue!"
10888,really good
10889,Fun to build things and mess around.
10890,amazing game . still an amazing game after 50 hours
10891,"the update does not work for me creater help
"
10892,"Scrap Mechanic is one of the best survival/crafting games I've played.

The building is second to none, with the ability to create some truly amazing constructs. The learning curve can feel steep, but simpler builds can prove very effective, and in building them, one learns the nuances of the system.

One area that the game lacks is in its end-game. Once you finish a warehouse/packing plant run, there really isn't much else to do, except try out different builds to accomplish things you already have.

With friends, Scrap Mechanic can be fantastic. Solo, you're likely to get some solid hours of entertainment out of it, especially if you enjoy challenging yourself to see what you can create, build, and/or automate. It's still early access, and the devs are hard at work adding more content and patching bugs."
10893,yes i recommend this game because you will never get bored and my friend is a gay
10894,Playing with friends is pretty good. The only downside is that the game can start tanking frames if you build pretty complex. It gets worse when there are more people in the game. I read that the devs have built this engine from scratch so thats probably where everything is still getting worked out . For an early access game its well worth the money for the hours you can put into it
10895,Good game but kinda laggy sometimes. But still really worth the money if you like building games
10896,"this game is perfect for almost everybody. There's a challenge mode for people who like problem solving games, there's a creative mode for the engineers and there's a survival mode. The building system is very easy to understand, there is so much to do you cant ever get bored with it. This is a very under rated game and the devs are always working on updates and bug fixes so there's always new content. There is also a huge community on the steam work shop were you can find easy to download mods and creations. i would heavily recommend this game to anybody."

10898,"I've played this game on and off for over a year.  I think it was better when it first came out.  For the last 8 months, when I play a multiplayer survival world, it ""Bug Splats"" or crashes.  The update in January or February 2021 fixed crashing but....  Lately, when I play a Creative Multiplayer game, the wheels on any vehicle I create shake violently.  I don't run any of these multiplayer games so it could be my computer.  I will try a single player survival game again but Uck.   Raft is a game by the same company and it works fine.  I like to play Raft."

10903,"This game is greate.The main part is creativity, building and logicaly."
10904,eh not the best
10905,its very fun if you are creative and think LEGO's are too expensive buy this and all of the mods are free from the workshop and no DLC there is also a survival mode witch is awesome i would say this game is a 10/10
10906,"It's very fun, and it is cool to see what others have made. Can get laggy at times if your computer isn't good, but is playable for the most part. My only problem is that sometimes the file for Warehouse floors can fail to update, leading to the player getting trapped in the elevator.
*Note: You can build on your lift in a warehouse, so you can use that to escape is you get softlocked like this"
10907,"good but the gmae hasnt updated
"
10908,its awesome ->-
10909,"wow, just wow. This game is great. I got a new computer and forgot my steam password for like 2 years, when I came back I was pleasantly surprised. The game design is, well, the best I've ever seen. There is no tutorial, other than a few how-to guides on the building mechanics, you are just thrown right in and guided by sparkles. the building is another amazing thing in this game, it's very complex, but very rewarding. recommend this game for any mechanical-minded individual who hates tutorials and loves building and foraging."

10926,It's a very good game that let's you create most anything you want especialy with mods the only problem I have is that for me atleast it got very laggy  when you build big or very complex things

11012,yes
11013,"The majority of my playtime on this game was way back before Survival was ever a thing, so that's where I'll be coming from in this review. One of my favorite things about this game was how free-form the vehicle design was, I would spend hours just designing crawler bases that my computer was far too puny to handle. It was also fun making cars for a purpose like harsh terrain transport and other methods that had no actual use at the time. I haven't played much survival, but it's bound to be pretty interesting."
11014,best game ever got my grandfather to play games again and he doesnt like sandbox games!
11015,"I highly recommend this game. It allowed me to spend hours trying to figure out the broken physics and glitches that makes this game so fun. I played it back when it was first released and couldnt stop, and now with the new updates it is 10 times better then before."

11023,"cool
"
11024," SURVIVAL: There is too much chasing your own tail. Its fun and interesting building machines to collect materials, but the combat is horrid. You need progression to make better combat. Your only weapon is a hammer and its just clunky to use. You have to defend from a wave of enemies when you try to make a farm for trading to get a better weapon and even then it can feel like a slog. If you like to building and just sandbox it this game will be for you, but if you are looking for survival progression I would pass this up."
11025,its a good game you can play greit for your kid or you youst give it a trye
11026,this is so good
11027,fantastic just fantastic
11028,I love this game
11029,Scrap Mechanic is a fun game to play. I found out about this game by ScrapMan please subscribe to his YouTube channel.
11030,yesz scrap
11031,???
11032,Its Really Good And Teaches You About Logic And Stuff Like That But One Thing I Think Could Be Improved Is The Raids In Survival Because They Lag And If You Have A Big Farm You Get Multiple Raids The Max Amount Of  Dirt For A Raid Should Be Raised By 1-2 So You Don't Have Something Like A 12-12 Or 13-13 Farm From Getting Multiple Raids
11033,"4 hours at time of review, this game is bladdy awesome mate, has so much content and so much potential, oh, and sooooooo many mods, its like minecraft met space engineers and said F space lets keep it terrestrial :P and wham bam thank you mam scrap mechanic was born, i love the graphics and the character movement and animations are also great its like playing a really good cartoon haha its quite simple to start but then gets complex and with the mods you can literally build anything, teh survival is also really cool and you can build farms and stuff too, the music and sound fx suit the game perfectly, i get some stutter when the game starts up sometimes and it has the odd freeze here and there but its being updated all the time, it has a dedicated modding community too, get the game, also they are bringing sers to it so you will be able to host or rent from a host which is what im waiting for :P but yea

Graphics 10
sound 10
mechanics 10
gameplay 10
stability 7
mods 300000

And before you say im one of the devs, no im not, im just bot fussy and i play the games i dont go looking for faults, i respect the devs hard work

Game devs like snail games though, they get no love from me, they develop a game with a good basis and then abandon it


Devs please dont abandon this game :)"

11052,EPIC
11053,i mean id say yeah this game is worth it but the survival mode is........................ empty but i wanna see the game grow get better and no i dont wanna see PvP
11054,Pretty good game I would say. You can't connect your ports in the game which adds packet loss so that suck for multi-player. Other than that the game is pretty good. They just need to add a game port so I can not have packet loss.
11055,"good

11059,Interesting and cool game
11060,i have been looking for a decent survival game and I think this is better than minecraft
11061,Imagine Gmod with a dash of Minecraft. That would make Scrap Mechanic
11062,I love how the physics are so realistic but are also easy to get your head around.
11063,i recomend the game because its lived up to my 5 years of expectations all though in survival i keep falling through the ground and sometimes i die because of it.
11064,yes. good
11065,play the game it good and is fun and is worth the money
11066,gazda
11067,"Very good, you should play it."
11068,Building everything on this game is fun!
11069,gg
11070,This game is what I have been missing for a long time.
11071,"Fantastic game, had a ton of fun so far and to think, this is still early stages. Can't wait to see what they add next :D"
11072,yeahh
11073,"""I'm stuck"".... right at the entrance to the ship, there is a yellow thing, with a dip in the ground and I'm stuck.   So I go to press the ""I'm Stuck"" button, because the developers after five years have probably had people experience ""I'm Stuck"" moments from the vast amount of other players, who posted on web / Reddit / twitter / Facebook, that they've been ""I'm Stuck""..... but no.... They haven't taken the time to put in a simple ""I'm Stuck"".

I have asked for a refund, hoping a developer will read this and finally add a ""I'm Stuck"" process.    As of latest patch yesterday, 30 March, still no ""I'm stuck"" button, that will just move a person mere steps away from their issue.

Disappointing."
11074,"Unfortunately, the spirit of the game is not matched by the body.

Scrap Mechanic's vision and aim for ambitious and creative builds is severely handicapped by performance and optimization issues. I sincerely hope that the developers focus on perfecting the core of the game rather than expanding the story."
11075,This game is amazing! what else can I say?! I can do whatever I want!
11076,fun
11077,i love it and i was born to play it and if anyone can survive in survival 10 level 10 raids i will fanboy
11078,A game that can be as simple OR as complicated as you'd like it to be. Truly blends some of the best survival crafting mechanics with ACTUAL mechanics. Would love to see them add aerodynamics.
11079,great to relive your creative side in this sandbox free world.

11086,goated on the sticks
11087,I LOVE the game! Survival is somewhat laggy :(. I would love it if you could make survival more easy on low end computers! Creative is very fun! I got the game yesterday and I love it so far! I made a little trophy truck as my second build and it was a little glitchy but it was fine! Thanks for reading!
11088,good
11089,"Amazing game! Love the mechanics, and general survival mode. However, would love to be able to do more with suspension. But every advanced suspension system I try creating, just turns into a suspension glitch. Other than that, I'll keep playing 'till I drop."

spicy physic engine"
11098,im bad at this in suv BUT GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
11099,I love it
11100,"its a fun game to mess around in, i mainly play in survival"
11101,"UPDATED:
At this point in time I cannot recommend this game. It is far to early to tell if the survival will shine or not. I would've asked for my money back but didn't realize I spent over 5 hours in the game and not in a ""I got lost in fun"" type way either. 

Stopped playing at 8.6 hours because it is not fun to die when getting attacked by 2 - 3 robots. And the inability to block, dodge or even restore health makes it even more frustrating. Will give it another try after a couple updates.

Things I don't like about the survival mode as of writing this are:

- No block or dodge. (All you can do is backpedal which is lame and boring. They should add a block that only works for 1 second then has a 1 second CD or something like that. A dodge with stamina might work also or in conjunction with said block but the block should not be a stamina based block it should have a CD. DO NOT make sprint a stamina skill nor should you make any other skills except maybe dodge a stamina user. It is far more fun to be able to run infinitely.)

- No Map (Not sure where I've been sometimes and would like to look at a map to see where to go or where I haven't been)

- Not enough weapon variety (I only have the sledgehammer and I know there is a potato shooter but that seems like it for weapons. Needs more variety of weapons and different attack animations.)

- World seems empty (As big as the map appears, can't tell because can't use a map to check, it feels very empty. An occasional cow or robot but nothing that makes it feel lived in or populated. Adding in a block/dodge could allow for a more populated world since you can now defend yourself instead of fighting 1 - 3 enemies and having to run away to regen health.)

- Needs more bag/stash space (Bags fill up fast and I haven't seen anything to upgrade my storage capacity. Would be a nice QoL addition IMO.)

- Not much to upgrading crafting bot ( I thought if I upgraded it I would get more items to craft but at level 3 it still has the same items. Checked online and it appears to only upgrade crafting spots, which isn't noticeable, and reduce crafting times.)

- Food does not restore health (If they are not going to give a block or dodge then food should restore health which it does not at this time. Food only restores hunger and thirst though I haven't figured out how to recognize which food helps with hunger or thirst more except through usage. Needs a tooltip for food IMO>)"
11102,good gam
11103,I really want to like this game but the lag on co-op makes the game literally unplayable. Won't be coming back until it's fixed.
11104,this good
11105,"This game is very good because it has creative and survival, giving people who like creative most things they desire to build (not just vehicles), and for survival players giving a sense of adventure and having much different ways of doing survival. The only things I do not like about the game is having some of the survival items not in creative and the survival map is not randomly generated (I understand how hard it is to do that but everything else is okay) They are also giving updates to the game pretty fast I'd say. Thank you for reading"
11106,"Its a game where you make a lot of stuff and this game makes me a lot smarter and you can do anything!!!!!

11117,"Not really the game for me. I expected a game like Besiege or Kerbal Space Program, but this is more akin to Wiremod from Gmod. Complicated as all hell. And the survival mode is incredibly lackluster, tells you nothing about what to do and where to go."
11118,"good game HOWEVER it crashes all the time, and it's not very optimized but better than among us 8/10"

11153,"I think this is a great game! There are a few bugs, and the physics engine cam be a little wonky and hilarious, but I think it's good. The only thing I think is bad is the lack of story (So far, it seems like new updates will fix this), and the lack of different ways to get resources. Want Scrap Stone? Go drill a rock! Can't find one? Oh well. Just watch out for Farmbots in denser forests."
11154,its fun

I can't advance in the game because I don't have enough resources.
I don't have enough resources because I can't go anywhere.
I can't go anywhere because either (a) I haven't grown enough food or (b) I've grown enough food, but now need to baby sit my garden so the robots don't destroy it all.
I could build automated defenses for my garden, but I need resources to do that."

11190,"Apart from the odd bug, it has a very well made physics engine which allows you to play around in a predictable and fun manner. For me scrap mechanic is enjoyable because of the creativity and physics, but it also has a survival mode to offer to those who enjoy that more."
11191,I like this game:)
11192,I Play this game since 2016 na i have 150h on it is fantastic i was hyped for survival ubdate. And i wasnt wrong the ubdate was fenomenal. (Axolot thx for all your work on this game)
11193,IS COOL
11194,Its overall a really fun game. The different variations of which you can do within the game are a real thrilling aspect to the game. Definitely would recommend this to others.

11261,its noice
11262,crashes my whole computer for no reason
11263,"Scrap mechanic is a game that I mostly considered simply a sandbox game at first, not unlike minecraft where you can do whatever you want in either of the two main modes. Creative or survival. Unlike minecraft, I found the survival gameplay quite enjoyable for a large amount of time. Unfortunately you run our of stuff to do eventually, but this is not a problem that I truly need to bring up as this game is currently in development as I write this with many new enemies, items, and locations having been announced. In addition, the game has a quite vast array of items you can use to create complex machines, vehicles, flying machines, and just about anything you can think of if you have enough ingenuity. I highly recommend anyone who loves sandbox/survival games to try this out for yourself. While it is a bit hard to start out due to the games quirks in both game modes, it is a really fun game with a really creative community where you can see what ca be done with the game. Highly recommend"

11267,its the best game ever true words not lyin buut it could use maayybe a beacon that you can search fpr what you want and it makes a beacon there but you have to upgrade the beacon wich is very expensive and it takes a loong time to get the stuff to make it in the first place

11279,"get the game its so cool, with hay bots,totebots,and the big red bots you can have big bases like me or small you can plant food and yeah so its really cool"
11280, I could very easily see this game taking up hundreds of hours of my life. First you start experimenting and those experiments play themselves over and over. I've barely done anything in the game and haven't explored anything more than building a shanty car and I've been absolutely amused. I spent 5 hours on the game and I've basically not even started. I can only imagine how much gameplay you can get out of it. It's really fun and a great investment in gaming.
11281,"just don't spend all of your money
"
11282,"good game

11283,"Great game, realistic physics. sometimes i get stuck between 2 objects and start vibrating really quick. this happens all the time to me in real life. I also often get stuck walking in one direction when i get out of a chair. this happens in game too. I often find that the hillside by my local auto shop has a bunch of steaks littering it. this is quite too realistic though, and it causes my computer to scream in pain for a few seconds."

11344,"After Clocking 100 Hours in this game i thought it was only right that i write a review.

This game is absolutely amazing, and with the help of modding a few files you can add custom crafts and change drop amounts of different things to make the game easier.

me and my friend have a multiplayer survival world and we have been doing this to overall make the game more fun as it can get a little grindy in survival but never the less i believe that you should get this game if you like any games with Creative aspects, Logic, and other things like farming.

I would also like to add that this game looks amazing but can get a bit laggy if two or more creations touch."
11345,nice
11346,"it s very intresting for someone with creative imagination and for explorers
"
11347,"Survival is grindy, but easily rewarding to those with a truly active imagination and immense patience. Creative mode is a better way to experiment with traps and contraptions, to better your designs and create legendary buildings that will help benefit your quality-of-life adventures."

11357,"Great game, saw it from yt vids and just kinda bought it for me and my friends so yeah its pretty fun, like all things it ofc needs a few update, but honestly its pretty good how it is."
11358,Bruh this game is so cool why would you not play this. Survival mode pretty cool! Not for my age cuz its so complicated but i still like it!
11359,"I dont like it so much is there a way to get a refund?
I have played 1.7h"
11360,This game is really fun would recommend it is good from biulding cars to people who just like making houses

11362,pretty epicness
11363,Hi
11364,l
11365,"This is a game with a wonderful building mechanic, you can make loads of cool stuff. It can take a bit of fiddling to figure out, but it's really quite wonderful.

However, if you're coming in for the Survival aspect, I recommend going elsewhere. It's not a particularly great experience, nor is it for the faint of heart. The creative mode and the building challenges are pretty nice, but this game's Survival is I Wanna Be The Guy levels of frustrating; Super Meat Boy levels of frustrating; imagine playing Dark Souls for the first time but, depending on the levels of unluck you have just run in to, you may be set right back to square one with little hope of recovering what you lost for potentially dozens of hours yet.

The survival element of the survival mode is one of the most extreme out there. Charming aesthetic aside, you cannot improve your health, you cannot give yourself armour, you have to manage both hunger AND thirst, you lose health if they drop to empty, healing drains them faster, and whenever you are outside of your vehicle - a monstrosity that you spend many, many hours investing hard-won resources acquired over many hours into - you die to the slightest gentle breeze.

Enemy difficulty:
The green cuboid bots are nothing. They are slow, make lots of musical noise, have a big blue light waving around above their head, and do little damage. They literally cannot catch you by surprise.

The haybots are middling difficulty. Get hit by them 4-5 times and you're down, but you can kite them relatively easily unless you have two of them on your tail, at which point they collide and push each other forward to you faster. If there's three it's more reasonable to run away. While they often make angry idle noises, there will be times when they will sneak up on you completely silently and get off a free stab or two on you, making you jump out of your skin in the process.

The tape bots will two-shot you. At range. With low-cooldown projectiles that travel quickly. While they're relatively rare, usually confined to one or two locations on the map, you cannot go in there with just your sledgehammer and expect to come out victorious. And even if you do have a vehicle, unless you have multiple layers of coverage around the cockpit, they will shoot off blocks and get a lucky shot right on your noggin that will slap you out of your seat, while two more come around the corner to finish you off. If you get killed, expect your vehicle to be lost until you make a better one to slaughter them all.

If you do not have a ranged weapon, and odds are you won't for many hours because the process to acquire them is convoluted, and you have to spend time growing the money to acquire them and then the ammo on top of that, the Boss Bots are death incarnate. Even if you are in a vehicle, they will shear off multiple blocks with every hit. They are often obscured by foliage, which is to say, they are sometimes hidden in the middle of bloody forests, but if you happen upon an abandoned city, they can appear there as well. If you encounter one of these, and your vehicle is not already running at maximum speed, if you attempt to flee - especially when you're off-road - there's a good chance you will simply lose your vehicle.

Survival in this game is grindy, involves visiting the same locations many times for respawning resources, and its difficulty and punishment are on the extreme end of the scale. You either win for scraps or lose HARD. I have gotten 50 hours of content out of this game, and I have enjoyed maybe 30% of that.

I have uninstalled this game twice out of rage. It is likely that this one will stick unless I go back for the creative or challenge modes.

ARK this is not. Space Engineers this is not. Empyrean this is not.

It is noted that, despite giving this game a NOT RECOMMENDED score, that is exclusively in the context of SURVIVAL for the AVERAGE PLAYER - if you are particularly masochistic, if putting up with this extreme level of tedium and difficulty truly does appeal to you, if the games listed above are simply TOO EASY for you, maybe this will slake your thirst for self-punishment. Maybe.

If you're going for the building aspect alone in the creative and challenge modes, those are also appealing."
11366,played it for a lil bit its ok
11367,it's a fun survival and building game
11368,nu leam irosit pe cele 200 de ore jucate
11369,"I absolutely love this game, i have 1000 hours in it.
It has so many cool Gamemodes and Features and Mods but theres one problem, its only for Windows and i had no problem with that since i have Windows installed on my mac via Bootcamp, but since im switching to M1 powered Macs soon because my 2012 Model isnt supported anymore and the new M1, i wont be able to play it anymore. I already read your statement to this issue and that you wouldnt make it for Mac but i hope your gonna change your mind since Macs are better then PC¬¥s by a wide margin now and cheaper so that more ppl can buy them.
Well, except 4 that its a good game"
11370,very fun
11371,fun and super fun. i think this is one of  my favorite games ever
11372,"yes i would reccomend this game to others tho it is very hard to understand and it will take time.






"
11373,love this game
11374,"this is one amazing game. One of many amazing games out in the world right now. the developers know what they are doing and they created this like 9 years ago. the sandbox allows you to really expand upon your mind and create anything you can imagine. There are tons of easy to download mods out there that can furthur encyhace the expierience. the survival is out of this world(pun intended), and really is an amazing experience. One thing that the developers could really work on is optimizing the survival gamemode. the survival gamemode can put lots of stress on even the most powerfull of computers. overall, this game is one t0 g9 up in the history books. but this game isnt history yet. the developers are contsitly working on this game to make it better. so many massive updates n the recent years have greatly improved the fun of this game to new heights. this game is grewing and is very amazing. you can make planes, boats, cares, plane cars, plane boats, plane car bots, battle car plane bnoats with massive nuclear homing missiles on them. you can make anything you imaghine."

11390,"I LOVE this game. I'm addicted its so fun to make mechanical creations fight robots and build houses, cars, and other buildings. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sandbox games. My only problem with it is its buggy sometimes but that's just 'cause it's in early access. I'm really excited to see how the game turns out when it's finished."
11391,i like :D
11392,It fun
11393,great

11396,cool
11397,"i really like this game but i cant seem to access the bot pods and i don't know if its because i don't have early access or something so if anyone knows how to help please let me know.

11399,yes
11400,"Seems essentially abandoned.  At least in the survival dep't 

Edit: No survival updates. Not worth the money."
11401,Excited to see new updates. I think this has the potential to be a truly great game with alot of staying power. As it is now its still worth the Steam price.

11437,it is very poggers
11438,"I love this game mostly because of the things you can create having no guidelines of anybody telling you what to build or make or how to do it. The game might not be the most realistic when it comes to graphics but, the amazing and hilarious physics make up for it i highly recommend this game to players with a large imagination and for players who like engineering vehicle or creations."
11439,its fun
11440,148 hours on this game loved this game loved the survival and creative. might want to watch a vid  for some things
11441,"i love it
"
11442,very fun but easily crashes on startup if you have a lot of mods
11443,fti.
11444,This game is good dont get me wrong. But I cant give it a positive rewiev because of the poor performance. I have a pretty good setup (rtx 2060 gpu and i-7 7600kf cpu) and this game crashes while launching sometimes and has maybe 40-50 fps at max. Disappointing.
11445,"imagine...... you throw up, but rather than being disgusted, you scoop your hands down and pick it up..... then play with it. This describes this game.

Beautiful Trash.
-mechanics broken
-physics broken
-no story
-no intro

if you dont mind tinkering, its not bad. but game wise, this isnt a game at the moment. its barely playable.

EDIT: --

yes the -- has changed my view on this game
if you know what this is -- you already know
but if you dont know 
These dashes -- can completely change the game
where you add them
and their purpose

I dont really do mods, so far most are junk due to the glitches people use to build their cars or robots and exo armor aswell.

I have tried a survival mod that is suppose to ""make the survival more rewarding"" that only works in creative.... yes i moved the files you are suppose to move.

However with all this said, i love games that have the godmode with survival aspects, so i can never die, but i experience the same struggle as someone who isnt in godmode, minus the survival aspects, cant die, so no food or water. However til i have a full understanding of the games mechanics fully, logic gates, pistons, controllers etc.... I cant give an honest 100% review. Im too much of a completionist and over achiever to give a very half assed review as before. Will edit again, when i have completed these things.

Thanks for reading this far.

Final Edit: after learning about welding, and how i thought this game was hilariously broken, the weld tool made some of my real world vehicles, actually functional builds even though they were insanely heavy, and massive.

with that said. I give this game a 10/10 for what it offers. 
pure unadulterated survival, but with a minecraft aspect of fun, just better graphics. The redstone is similar to the electric system in scrap mechanic. Its a small short learning curve, but its a great game overall."
11446,"good game
"
11447,"It is my second-to-first go-to game for a fantastic sandbox experience. The reason it is so high is because it gives players the ability to create almost anything they want, almost however they want. I love the ability to create not only bases, but vehicles as well. This is overall an incredible and fantastic game, and I hope it continues to be updated and worked on. I would absolutely recommend this to others, especially those who play Minecraft. Scrap Mechanic is a game better than Minecraft in the sense that you can create vehicles. However, it does lack the mining aspect. But with this soon-to-come update, that problem will most likely be fixed."

11461,is good
11462,it good
11463,"a fun resource collection and building game with some light FPS. It is still in beta at the time of my writing so the story line details haven't been finished, but feels like there is some room for an quest system to help guide some exploration."

11472,EPic game very good graphics not laggy at all very well optimised never buggy and multiplayer is very smooth.
11473,its kinda good i guess
11474,Fun game where you theoretically could make cool things if you were creative which I am not
11475,i think you should buy it but some people like me have lag issues
11476,Buggy mess. But a fun buggy mess
11477,it is a very good game especially for people that have lots of creativity.
11478,yes

11495,
11496,"Now that this game has new optimzation, I have new hopes for the quality of future updates. While the game still has its fair share of bugs and problems, it might just be worth getting now. I dont suggest playing without at least a couple mods. There are some great utility mods like the modpack and SM Interopt that are almost a must have."
11497,"This game is like Minecraft with creative and survival, but with better graphics. This is still pretty buggy and I got this from a friend so i'm not sure if its worth the money. Even though I said it's like Minecraft, its a lot more mechanical (joints, engines, etc.) I think its a good game, and you can even shoot potatoes."
11498,amazing game 8 out of 10
11499,This is a good game
11500,it is ffun and imersive
11501,Yes
11502,game good
11503,"This is a great game! I recommend getting the feel before playing multiplayer and survival and the challenge mode is a good way to do it. Now to talk about the devs... I think they will do the right thing with this game and get t fully updated, it will take awhile though to be done with all the updates. Chapter 2 will probably come out within a year from now and will be great.

(p.s. the edit is to rewrite my main gist of the review)"
11504,fun
11505,poopoop

11517,"not laggy, super easy to create and a great game to play with friends"
11518,good
11519,so i first saw this game years back when it was only creative mode and i thought it looked cool. and then when survival came out i watched that on youtube so i decided to wishlist it. eventually i got some money and i bought the game. so i tried it out and i found it very fun it is very cool to bea able to make almost anything in creative and survival is surprisingly addictive.but its not finished yet but i would highly recomend this game.

11560,Such great mechanics and the building is easy.  Your imagination is really your limiting factor as long as you are willing to grind out the materials to make what you need (in Survival Mode).  Would definitely recommend.
11561,this game coooooooooool
11562,"The physics works like the real and i like it. It is an unique game. I recommend it to people who are creativ and love to engineer. Multiplayer miss from the game, and co-op does not works as much as it should."

11611,"SURVIVAL QUITE DIFFICULT caps

11612,great if you have the creativity and patience to create awesome stuff. It's also good for the person who likes to download every creation and mess around with them. just don't try taking them apart. :)

11614,I think Scrap Mechanic is a very unique game it involves you to use your brain that is the reason it is a 10/10 unlike other games this one lets you be as creative as you like for example if you want to make a futuristic car you can it involves thinking however but anything you want to build you can because your imagination is in control.

11618,"pros - good game quite fun

cons - still in beta"
11619,"i'm not having fun with this. It's better played as a sandbox than a survival game. It took too long to do everything. Too many requirements to make a simple car. And it's not even a good car. The place is so big, but so little resources. The world is too quiet, I want to enjoy this, I want nice beat music with some voice over to keep me going. It's good that they provide some tutorials but the game doesn't really guide you to it, on the backstory, what you should do etc etc. It lacks information, music and slow gameplay.
There's no way to craft a weapon or upgrade to one that deals more damage. You can't parry or evade the enemies, only either run away or hit it, which also a turn off

Maybe there's some people who liked it, but not for me"
11620,i like it all
11621,Even though I only played six hours I can already see that this is an additive game and that I will be spending a lot of my free time on it
11622,really fun it need to be more calliging
11623,really good game with a massive modding scene aswell. you can make all kinds of stuff like carpet bombing planes and shit
11624,Fun game
11625,"Infinite Possibilities - Until You Hit the Skybox

TL;DR: The game is super glitchy. The physics are broken. It lags even on a fast computer when you make something even a little complicated. It freezes and crashes, sometimes the whole computer. Maybe good for messing around but serious gameplay is basically impossible.

So I got this game because my friends wanted to play it with me. I had fun making some cars and stuff but then I wanted to do something more ambitious. I tried to design a cannon using thrusters to propel a projectile. Problem is: the game's physics engine is EXTREMELY limiting.
Try to move something to fast? It will clip through and break. Try to spin something on a bearing fast? It will distort and probably break. Try to connect something (like a suspension spring) that's half-extended to another thing with the weld tool? Sorry. Want to control a piston to be able to stop at multiple points? no. Even when I used a popular glitch (potato guns shooting destructible blocks that transfer the momentum to the ammo) to design a gun, it would sometimes just explode or not shoot anything. I can't even aim it down, because when I try, the physics can't calculate the new angle and it just clips the ammo straight through the turret, exploding the whole thing! It's like a sandbox game, but creativity and complex design is just banned. Oh yeah, also it's super taxing on your computer. I have a ryzen 3700x (brand new with the motherboard as well!) and the game lags with just one of the glitchy tanks I made. The game also freezes and crashes. I'm making this review after the game crashed my whole computer (I had to reboot twice!). So unless you don't care about your computer killing itself, and only plan to make the most basic machines imaginable, this game will disappoint you."
11626,"Scrap mechanic is an game which rewards creativity and game sense.In scrap mechanic you build your own cars, planes.... through various tools and recources like blocks, chairs, connecting stuff.... It can be complicated if you don't know how it works. If so you can just watch guides online or read the journal you have ingame to learn.If you just want to have fun with creations that you didn't built, you can just download fancreations, most are really creative and tons of fun to use. Survival mode also exists which gives you the same freedom of creative but requires you to survive, farm and gather recources."
11627,super fun! allows you to use  your imagination.
11628,decent
11629,very nice
11630,"So, I've played this game since its initial release in 2016 and it was a fun game even just only being able to play creative for the past 4 years, (I've built very little in the time sadly) but I had been anticipating survival for quite a long time, I assumed they abandoned the project since the game rarely got updated and moved on, so I quit for a bit. But, little did I know what 2020 had in store for me. When I heard it was going to be released in just a few months, I was pretty hyped. Then, it came out. I was there on the first day of survivals released and I haven't stopped playing it since, It was a real step up from the original game, the graphics are better, the tons of new parts are awesome, and just a lot more too it. Its a lot of fun. Still surprised they actually finally released survival, many have waited a very long time for it and i'm glad they finally made a version they could release as an update. Alright, if I had to rate it, 9/10. Simply well its an awesome game, but spending 4 years just to fix bugs, adding very few things, and then finally releasing your most anticipated game mode after all that time? I still have no clue what took them that long. I hope they continue to work on this game, and that they won't make us wait another 4 years for a major update, but you never know, somehow it is still in ""Early Access"" which I find quite funny after it being released for a little over 5 years now."
11631,Needs water in creative which is coming soon yay
11632,This game is SO FUN! It is the first game i got on my computer. it is more fun with friends
11633,like lego only better
11634,It's awesome. Worth every penny even just for creative. Can't believe I didn't come across this game sooner.
11635,
11636,ive played this game since launch back when i was younger i stopped for a year or 2 but recently got back into it and i enjoy it alot
11637,is gud
11638,good
11639,one of my favorit games on top 5 ezy
11640,it good if you have a bad computer it might take i couple attempts to open
11641,Extremely fun game that has multiple game mechanics and mod add-ons.
11642,"yeah its good
"
11643,very good
11644,"amazing game
"
11645,"I love this game for the creative mode, not survival. But otherwise, the game's solid."
11646,its good.
11647,"This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. Even though it is still in late development at the time of writing it feels like a triple A game. They have done everything right, Level design is beautiful and detailed, telling a story of what has happened to this world without directly telling you. It is a beautiful game by day and a horror game by night, as you wait for your next attack to come. The enemy is very difficult but it is not frustrating. Overall this is the perfect game and a must have for anyone."
11648,realy good fun survival play through really bad hunger system
11649,This game can take time up but it is still fun to billd in.
11650,"do you like sandbox games?
do you like building things?
are you afraid to shoot your way over an uncharted territory in a random world?
even for an earlier access game, this is the kind of game you will enjoy just as it is. lots of freedom to build whatever you want and defend it."
11651,"I am a dumb person, and this game hurts my brain. Love it"
11652,yes good 10/10
11653,"Its fun

11657,Its a great sandbox game
11658,e foarte tare
11659,There are a few bugs but they are shadowed by the gameplay greatly. I am not a gamer but i love this game and all the different stuff you can do weather it is creative or survival

11665,"i really enjoy scrap mechanic for lots of reasons. 
1.survival, has brought new life into the game and is a treat to play, there is alot to do for crafting exploring and having messing around with Freinds. 
2. how ever the updates to take a while to be made, and online is pretty laggy, like old, old engine for scrap mechanic. ive had this game for almost 2 years, so if you dont mind axolot fixing the online issues and developement times. its a great game, highly reccomend"
11666,"Right, ok, ive had this game now for about a year (i got it before survival came out) and it has been fantastic, i love the creativity and the mechanics of the game are INSANE. I recently got heavily into the survival mode and i am loving it so far, the only bad thing that has happened is a farmbot scaring the life out of me whilst i was raiding some huts. i rlly enjoyed this and i hpe u do to, thx for reading!"
11667,76mchoi's Favorite Game Loves building weird vehicles.
11668,it is fun
11669,"While this game is fun [strike] and I do intend to keep playing [/strike] I cannot recommend purchasing this game in it's current state. The lack of building parts for creative (like there are no slope blocks) with how much of a grind fest survival is makes it dull. Tons of potential though, keep it up!

+38 additional hours edit: This game has some serious balancing issues"

11680,"Great game, enjoying the multiplayer aspect. Little laggy at time for non-hosts but definitely still playable.

Super excited for the cave update! I kind of wish there was some armor in the game to help against those nasty tapebots! The customization of building your own vehicles and contraptions from scratch is what sets this game apart from your typical survival games. Also wish there were more clothing items made for female characters :S Oh well. Minor details."

The gameplay feels solid and decently polished. The building is rich yet scalable for a new player while being late game challenging with all manor of circuits and creative options. I also have to say the developer's are really active and the love is really there!
Come and join the fun folks :)"

11752,i would buy this game because there is hours that you can play and never get bored
11753,yes
11754,"I've never really felt motivated to give a game a negative review but after having played this for nearly 50 hours I can't get over how close this game comes to being something great and it's incredibly frustrating. I played this game in co-op survival mode mainly and initially I loved it but the more you play the more you realise it's a completely hollow experience. You hunt for loot in broken buildings with the same layout and grow crops so that you don't starve to death while praying that the robots don't destroy your farm and then repeat, and that's the entire game. There is also very little direction given to the player and personally I feel like the majority of my play time was dedicated to just understanding what the hell you're supposed to do and what options you have available to you and then when you learn that there isn't much to do, you stop playing. The game has an honestly wonderful building mechanic that makes you feel like you can build and design whatever you like, but good bloody luck grinding for the obscene amount of resources you'll need while also risking the chance that a few robots might destroy something that took you hours to make in a matter of seconds because they got triggered by a beetroot in the vicinity. 

The longer you play this game the more obvious it becomes that it really is quite pointless and painfully repetitive, which is immensely frustrating because it has so much potential. Unfortunately though this game has been in early access for nearing six years now and there hasn't been a major update for survivor mode in nearly 10 months so it just feels like a waste of time waiting for the devs to balance it out/add meaningful content. If you intend on only using this for creative mode I'd honestly recommend it, the building can be amazing, but if you're considering getting this more for survivor mode like I did I really wouldn't recommend this game, it needs a lot of work."
11755,It's not fun
11756,hiiii.
11757,it is so fun to play. you can play with friends .
11758,You make things and it's cool. The gameplay's in the title.
11759,"This is a wonderfully creative game both on the players and devs part however it does require a decent computer, but I would highly suggest this game to all who enjoy sandbox games like raft and minecraft!"
11760,"idk i just liked the game
"
11761,Been playing this when survival wasn't a thing yet and I still like the game and the whole sandbox thing. It's also very fun to play with friends. A lot of bugs tho.
11762,"Playing survival with my brother has been really fun, and the building system is easy to get into but has the ability to be very advanced."
11763,gg
11764,i love this game so much and there is a lot more to come
11765,"I have played scrap mechanic for 100 hours now and it is definitely worth your time if you are creative minded, I have built many amazing creations in vanilla like ai cubes that battle each other, tanks that fire explosive barrels, and super off road cars that can climb mountains with ease, and that's just vanilla, the scrap mechanic modding community is absolutely phenomenal and tons of really interesting mods and creations come out everyday (I recommend trying out the modpack and the intelligentia mod). Quick disclaimer: this game can be fairly laggy and glitchy occasionally."
11766,everything is great
11767,its so fun
11768,"Lots to do
Tons to learn"

11775,Its a really fun game and i love how i joined this game from the begining and watch it grow so over a few years :D what makes me more excited is the new Dev blog with sticky tires and adding water to creative mode <3

11781,"great game, really fun. scrap mechanic and raft are definitely worth picking up.
the only downside which is worth mentioning is they take a really really long time to release content for both games."

11788,good game yes very exite for next update
11789,"I highly recommend this game to one who wants to build something and use it for some reason. Bad optimisation is bad side but its not that bad, it playable"

11791,This game is not start i can t play this gam about a pay money
11792,This game is good just took a while to figure out how to play
11793,"The description doesn't lie, this game is a creative paradise. An entertaining survival mode and an amazing creative mode makes fun endless. And when you're bored of playing alone, there's always multiplayer so you can annoy your friends with homemade nukes. Definitely a favourite of mine."
11794,best game worldwide
11795,"very nice. if you dont play scrap mechanic, you're weirdchamp"
11796,"This is my favourite game since I started using steam over 2-3 years, and it is very fun! Overall I love this game."

there are some bugs, but the game itself is great
9/10 would recommend
i nearly have 1000 hours too, that shows you how much i like it
"
11811,"Once I got the hang of things and learned how everything works, it's really fun. You can build anything, many things are built to make the grinding easier and then those builds are rebuilt to make it better. Lots of inspiration for bases and builds to be found online too. It's been a long time since I had a game that I wanted to fire up the second I got home from work."

11820,yes
11821,ez addiction
11822,gimme my money back :.(
11823,this has to be the best open world builder/survival game i have played in a vary long time and i hope other people will buy this game to play and have fun creating there own wacky vehicles or downloading things off of the workshop to crash your game or break all physics and have fun trying to survive in the land of the farm bots.
11824,i mean if u want a survival/sandbox game  this is your best chance of it. even though its on early release i only encountered 1 bug and nothing game breaking its a bit on the grinding side tho
11825,its a good game even though its still in beta
11826,"Played for couple hours. Now i have a farming obsession.



10/10"
11827,it is a good game i you have over 8gb of ram but if you have anywhere over 8gb of ram you will be fine
11828,"I do NOT like this game. I wanted more of a survival story aspect, but it's kind of different... More sandbox style smash em up game. Kind of like those LEGO games I guess."
11829,gdsgfdgf
11830,Nices Game finde hatt noch viele Bugs aber macht trozdem spa√ü w√ºrde mich freuen wenn diese gefixt werden ;)
11831,yes
11832,"Game is very fun but can lag at times on single player.  Sometimes game takes about 6 minutes to load and sometimes the game loads right away with the same saved game.  I'm not sure why it does that.  The computer I use has 16 gigs and a beefy 6 gig gpu with i7 cpu.

Another issue is when I put a vehicle on the lift it can cause the parts on the doors to become solid and not move.  I have only played about 20 hours so the game is fun but there are some glitches that should not be on a game that has been in EA for a couple of years."
11833,Its enjoyable. Survival needs some further development.
11834,best game ever no cap
11835,"game dosent work half the fucking time

11841,very good lots of content
11842,yeah its pretty good tbh
11843,"Really fun, I truly hope they continue development to enhance and expand on what they have already.  Also, I hope that they find a way to speed-up the development process a bit.  Definitely worth the money IMO!"

11845,Fun
11846,"yes yes yes yes is good get is good get game good good 

laggy with friends tho sometimes"
11847,YAY
11848,no better game for imagination
11849,"started playing the game and got very excited since i saw a lot of videos on it, for only a few moments and then the game crashed, I then played and crashed the game many times after this but was still enjoying it through these 15 minute gaps between crashes, I then later discover that it was never the game but micro stutters would easily crash the game, my stutters was the graphics driver crashing then quickly fixing itself so I thought that when watching videos on youtube it was normal, in total great game if crashes check for general micro stutters"
11850,GOOD GAME
11851,this game if super cool
11852,it good
11853,its good buy it
11854,"it's fun ,  does need a lot of work still though, but high potential ..."
11855,FFFFFUUUUNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!
11856,Good game but not very fun without friends having the game
11857,"i like the game,"
11858,"The game has a lot of potential. 
Now we need more objects and new mechanics,it's also necessary to totally revise the survival mode which, in my opinion, for how it was made is way too boring."
11859,"Developers don't appear to care about their customers, let alone fix major bugs that actually prevent the game from even running. Many users are still getting black screen hangs on startup, fresh installs or not, and the developers refuse to make any communication about it."
11860,its very fun without modding and with
11861,perfection
11862,Great Physics Game!
11863,"It's rubber bandy and poorly optimized, hosting is a nightmare and you can't get further than one chunk away from other players. Hit boxes seem to be shifted in every direction from enemy models aside from center. Things disappear into the world and chests pop in and out of reality, often with their contents missing. 

That being said, survival is amazing and I love it."
11864,"(Game got gifted to me so I checked ""Got game for free"")) Very fun and addicting. Enjoy the Survival mode too. Only thing they can really work on is their multiplayer but other than that its a great game!"
11865,"Yes, definetly, for anyone who likes making weird crazy contraptions, or the apacalypse, i can recomend.
ive been playing since one of the eiarliest versions, it just ggets better with every update"
11866,very nice
11867,Very great for anyone who likes being creative.
11868,"This game has so many parts. You can probably do anything you set your mind to. Worth it for sure, but I like Stormworks: Build and Rescue a lot more. Check that out if you are looking for creative games."
11869,its very good
11870,"good game, gamerzzzz"

11872,ez
11873,good game
11874,very cool
11875,fun. first bought the game like 3 years ago when it was just creative mode. kinda disappointed in survival but ill still play the game. its most fun with friends.
11876,creative
11877,Its very fun but the only problem with it that I had is when activating console commands my game wouldn't start a world. So I fell like there should be something in the settings menu or when starting a survival world to turn on cheats.
11878,blarmp
11879,"awesome game, you can build whatever you want, play online (is a little buggy), and try to survive in survival mode only complaint is the physics at times sometimes buggy sometimes not."

11886,gud game should play
11887,it has many good features and you can download mods.
11888,"i have been wanting this game for years and i finally got a pc for Christmas and it was up to expectations the new survival mode was great and creative was fun though i wish you could use water in creative

Edit: Never Mind they added water in creative"

11894,AMAZING... endless fun
11895,good
11896,Great game overall. There isnt a main objective but the game offers a bunch of stuff to keep you busy. I only hope they fix up multiplayer so when my friends join the world they wont randomly lag out

11898,good survival game
11899,Very disappointed...will not work on the iPad after purchasing. Absolute waste of money
11900,IT IS SUCH A GOOD GAME. Just as good if not better than minecraft.
11901,"It's a good game but needs some tweaks and creature comforts before its a great game

1) Needs a pause button. I don't want to risk death from a random Haybot every time I pee or check a web article.

2) SOME level of navigation, a fixed beacon at the crash site would be enough. And NO the logbook isn't good enough, because what happens if as a new player you forget to grab it? Now you can't find your way back to the site and are forever locked out of that feature. (yes this is my current state, tried to have a friend join so hopefully he would spawn at the crash site, but it refuses his connection).

3) When I put something in the quick bar it should be somewhat static, what I mean is if I have 2 stacks of 10 corn in my inventory and corn is on my quick bar, it should stay there until there is no corn in my inventory. Not just until one stack is spent. 

Overall a good game, and with time will get more comfortable to play."
11902,it good
11903,"This game needs allot of work. It's very difficult for a new player to know what to do and how to do it. I am very surprised to see this game have a Overwhelmingly positive review rate. As the current reviews seem as tho they are created by bots, that steam has not band. Reviews such as ""this is the best game"" by artfreak0287 or ""sae dfg sgbeasg asdfaf QFSADF fS ASD q"" by Pablo escobar and lets not forget ""ywsz"" by Palmster.

Why early access? You may ask. Perhaps its because they can constantly milk new players for cash while paying for good reviews on a game that hasn't changed much in the last couple of years.

I can't currently give this game a recommendation until it fixes the in game knowledge of what I need to do to play the game. I shouldn't have to rely upon a wiki to play such a simple looking game."
11904,its a great game if you ask me. plus if you check the hours ive spent on this game i think youll see ive had it for a while
11905,its fun as hell!!!
11906,this is the best game
11907,"I love the game, i like the sandbox style game play. The only thing i really wish for is: For there to be an established global server where people can host games and link up with players from around the world. That way all Mechanics could speak with eachother and join ""rooms"" worlds"" etc. TY

11909,Absolutely amazing game will recommend to friends
11910,A game which is really good...its has a lot of similarities to Minecraft but the fact that is has proper gravity is cool also the ability to make things that actually move...
11911,game good
11912,It is a really fun game!
11913,"The building system is a little clunky and not as streamlined as other blocky sandboxes, but it just works for the game to give building a good physical feel and gratification to it.

There are three gamemodes, Creative, Challenge, Survival, and all include multiplayer.
 Creative is your standard open sandbox with limitless blocks and tools, build your dreams, and the environment itself is quite nice with plenty of areas and variety.
 Challenge is a limited sandbox with a goal of some sort and pre-chosen amounts of parts to play with per each level, perhaps a good teaching tool for the game's mechanics and a solid head-scratcher.
 Survival has a mix of exploration and combat, as smacking trees, robots, and loot boxes is your first source of materials and food, it's also the game's main form of collecting outfits for your mechanic. However it soon evolves into a wave defense and hauling game as you protect your farm from nightly hordes of robots and deliver the crops to use as currency to purchase powerful weapons among other things.

As of now, the game is pretty solid, though there's more that can be done, like adding symmetry mode to building and other QoL stuff."
11914,Probably the best game ive ever played

11926,i like scrap mechanic because its a building game were you can put your imagination to anything you want to build but i want a spud rocket launcher and more bots. and i want one two three four five and six way vacuum pipe. and i want more stronger bots that can destroy anything in there path. from bomb master 77

11929,"this is the best survival game that i have played. i love the fact that when you farm, u have to defend it. this game is super easy for people that like building. in the shorter sense, improved minecraft."
11930,this is a good game
11931,Gameplay is for the most part solid. Learning curve isn't extremely bad unless you want to do something like create a calculator and honestly I believe this game is worth it's price as you will get a lot of hours out of it if you love vehicle sandbox or even survival games. The only unfortunate part of this game is creations don't seem to interact well with each other as if 2 complex creations that are separate get close enough your fps will drastically drop. Aside from better optimization this game is great for being creative.
11932,very good game for mentally ill people relaxing tbh  radio slaps and goes boots and cats

I love it. I had fun builing big buildings and wonderful cars back then, when only creative was a thing.
Now with survival this game is even better. I love playing it alone, and with friends.
I can definitely recommend this game to people who tend to be creative, think logically, want a bit of survival and defense and love exploring."
11945,"Absolutely Wonderful. You can literally do anything, worth the price; if not more. I've broken every bone in my body and have transfigured into a liquid state. please help. 10/10"
11946,"I enjoy survival crafting style games. This one here is fun in many ways!

Be creative and test things. There are plenty ways to create vehicles and even bases. 
The controls are smooth  all though there are a few things that may need tweaking. ( I still am learning)
The devs are keeping up with it. Improvements are in the works and even more content. 
Maybe some of the mechanics should be uh.. dumbed down for people like myself who struggle with the more intricate builds. but still love it and well worth the money I paid to get it. Hours upon hours of fun."

11962,"780 Hours in, 4 bases, 8 vehicles, 12 flyers -tons of fun.

I love that game, although there is not much more to do after 700+ hours of gameplay, I play it almost every day to improve my base or build something new and fancy in my world.
It got me so hooked in the beginning that I played 16 hours in one day just to finish a project :-) 
It has some bugs but nothing that is too fun-killing and the Devs work on it and also include suggestions from the community.
I highly recommend this game if you like base building, some action and a game not only focussed on killing things."
11963,"yes, yes its good"
11964,m
11965,Fun game and can make a lot of stuff in the game
11966,"I hate how there's no neutral option. I love creative but survival is a let down, no point in being creative. Oh you want to build a wall around your base? DON'T BOTHER! The bots are a let down. No hordes of bots like in the trailer, just 3 little green bots. Traps are useless because its better to just shoot them. Bases are useless because having 1 plot feeds you enough and prevents raids. Vehicles are useless because they give you a beacon to the main point of interest early game. Its not even more than 10 meters from the ship anyways. Overall survival is not challenging but creative is fun."
11967,"gud game planning on 1,000 hours"
11968,its fun
11969,Not enough FPS

With a amazingly designed game and a Huge mod community, this game is my most played game by far. You name it, They made it. They also recently made survival mode which is equally as fun as creative. 10/10"

11985,its inda fun if you have friends
11986,"After playing over 800 hours in this game I have some good and bad things to say about this game. (more information at the bottom of this review)

Main Things to note:
- The game has 3 modes: Creative, Challenge, and Survival Mode
- Great building mechanics (Allows for very interesting creations)
- Somewhat stable early game survival mode
- Over hundreds of building parts that allow for complex creations
- Tile editor for custom (creative) worlds 
- Survival has a decent world size but could be larger
- Decent community around the game
- Does have some multiplayer capabilities 

Notable game breaking issues currently:
-Multiplayer is very buggy and unstable if you don't have good internet. Creations will act differently and fly all over the place if you are not the host and are connected to someone.

- The game has bad optimization for middle and late game, and for most players, this causes much frustration and limits creativity because you need to change and optimize your builds.

- You can't have creations with tons of bearings because it causes the game to lag a ton and the bearings often can't hold weight making mobile bases harder to do.

- Automating is not very possible as of right now due to how the game loads areas and how stuff is not movable in the world. 

The game overall is okay with its really good building mechanics and survival aspects but building bases is a nightmare sometimes and for many play styles it's not as feasible. The developers are also not as transparent about bug fixes and crucial fixes. But overall this game has so much going for it but it has a long way to go in terms of updates and optimizations. I can't recommend this game until many things are fixed, changed, or added. 

If the developers also read this: please create a Q&A site where people can suggest features and report bugs, it's a very large nightmare to report bugs and it's very unclear where bugs need to be reported, the bug reporting on steam twitter and email is hard to track and makes it harder to see how many people are experiencing the same issues. 
I can provide an example of a decent bug reporting site from another game I play if asked."
11987,Kind of confusing at the start but by watching a tutorial or two it is easy to figure out.
11988,good
11989,Its fun.
11990,"good

11996,"current review is primarily for survival mode; the world feels empty and randomized in a way that nothing is truly interesting and everything is annoyingly far away. crafting is grind-heavy, progress through the world slow and there is no map. there's hints of a story but no clear objectives. 

i think the main appeal of the game right now are creative and challenge modes. the vehicle building is somewhat fun, but in survival it takes a lot of very boring work to get enough materials for even a small basic build.

game is in early access and i intend to play more, review may change. but that's my first look feels."

11999,NO GOOD :(
12000,s
12001,"                        -I'M ONLY HERE FOR SURVIVAL-
Scrap Mechanic a wonderful game but lacking in survival mode content. Still fun? yeah sure... but you'll wish there was more reason to build things, or explore. The same 4 or so poi's is not very impressive, and the warehouse (the endgame raid poi) is a crash fest slog right now in multiplayer. There isn't many game mechanics either (no leveling or perks of any kind cept for upgrading parts a few times), and not much for interesting loot either.
 
Make no mistake about it, this is primarily a builders game, and I can appreciate that, but why even build in survival if there isn't much reason to? 

In a game about building
the best strat
is to not even build a base

Who wouldn't just use the mechanic shop as a base? It's immune to all attacks and large enough for whatever you want to do. By the time you can make enough sturdy blocks for even a small secure base, you probably already done everything you cared to do and moved on from this game. It takes a really long time to get enough metal to even make 1000 metal 3 blocks and keep in mind this game has very small blocks.  You'd probably exhaust all the ember on the map to make a base even as large as the mechanic shop and this stuff doesn't respawn (along with trees or mining nodes). Indeed, the game is doing a lot to inspire me NOT to build in survival mode.

It doesn't help that making complex machines is confusing and not explained very well ingame. I would LOVE it if the logic gate ui had a question mark button you can click that lead to a page with a faq of sorts of various design goals. Such as ""how to make a repeat function for cannons and more"" or ""how to make a water cannon rotate with controllers"" ""how to make a flying vehicle you can actually control"". 
Nope, instead i had to use youtube... Which kinda killed my interest in making complex stuff. I hate sitting through a 30 minute video to learn about a 30 second problem. 

CONCLUSIONS OF A MAD FOX-
The lack of weather in this world is befitting how little there is going on. And I found myself a nakid fool when I built a boat with propellers that didn't actually propel my raft anywhere because the game apparently can't do that yet.

I love scrap mechanic, I see the cool update coming soon, but I think I am going to wait a few years and hopefully come back to a much more robust sandbox. You might find it silly that I would buy an early access game like this and then complain, but it's valid to show others where the game is right now. What to expect NOW if you buy and play today. I am fully aware it will get updates and fixes.
I am glad I played it now because it was still really fun for a few days (it's soo nice looking and delightful!), and I get to see how much it changes in the future. I like what I seen and I have some faith in this project even though it appears they work very slow on this game. GO TRAIN HARD DEVS! You got a great foundation to work from.

In the meantime...
Strongly recommended to people who love to create machines. Survival fans can get some fun too, it really depends on how much you like to create. Had a mostly good time and will come back in a few years. =)"

In short get the game only if you have extremely good hearing or some sort of external amplifier connected to your PC."

12087,"Very boring, somehow still early access since 2016. Map is empty and survival mode is challenging but in all the wrong ways. I regret playing 8 hours to not get the refund"
12088,"Short version: low development speed, a lot of unfixed bugs on outdated engine, hidden DRM, no community interaction.

So, let me get in detail about my game review. I own it for about 5 months. In this time there was only a single update! Dont forget, this isnt a single indie project. It is a firm with multiple fulltime developers. Yet a single person will advance his project faster than this, having only 1/1000 the resources (time). The only update it had was a tiny one, addig an item and some tweaks. There are mods made faster with lot more content.

Next point, the bugs. There are a lot, yet they dont get fixed. To make it all worse, the games runs on an antique 32bit engine. Mid 2000s was the last time I saw a 32bit PC. Like you may expect, the performance of the game is poor. Using 32bits, it lacks a lot of precision too, which is fatal for an physiyc simulating game.

Lets tackle DRM real quick. The game cannot be played offline. In a 3,5 year old post Axolot claimed, it was a bug. 3,5 years later, still no fix. We can only assume, this DRM was intended. And this brings us to the final point.

They dont give a damn about the community. Like previously said, they stated 3,5 years ago, the DRM was a bug. That was the last time they interacted with the community. They made 2 big threads for bugs and suggestion. Those threads are full, no response from Axolot. Thats not how you develop a game during early access.


Check again in 5 years if the game is finished and out of early access."

The game's engine is powerful enough to realize most of your ideas and gives you tons of freedom to create but it lacks in some departments like suspension mechanics . Overall doesn't matter if you play the survival mode or stick to creative mode, you're going to have lots of fun and feel extremely satisfied when your intuitivity is rewarded with a working machine."
12130,"its amazing
"
12131,"This game is amazing! I have tried out so many engineering games where you can build all sorts of machines and contraptions and I personally have always found that they are over complicated and honestly too confusing to actually enjoy the game-play. Not Scrap Mechanic, this game has the perfect balance between fun and legitimate physics and applications of engineering. 10/10 now I need my friends to get this game so we can do challenge mode"
12132,Awesome game
12133,i do recomend this game it is fun and worth the price i have played the game alot and i am looking forward to playing more of it
12134,"Its a amazing game! I sadly refunded it so i could get a game that ran better on my potato. Little did i know that i could optomize the game to run multithredded. Big brain lol. But get the game! Even if you got a potato.

I have rebought the game and it is 20 times more playable now.
Would recommend"

12138,lol
12139,Like how you can actually use logic to develop automation. Wish there was more in-depth control for the logic though
12140,is nice
12141,"i like but you should make women have no cloth they would be big hot and i would wank off to this game every day and my lads UwU
"
12142,It expands childrens ( all ages 5+ ) Creativity and lets them explore from a wide range from cars to planes or even rocket ships! I would recommend this to all ages that wont break the computer screen when they mess up a keybind :)
12143,it was fun
12144,"supper fun w frends a little hard in the begging

12155,e
12156,"it is  a cool game you should play it
"
12157,good scrap
12158,"Imho compared to other survival games like the forest, minecraft, space engineers and valheim this game falls very short. 

Contra
- overpriced
- grind is too heavy and doesnt't motivate: you barely need different ressources or parts but mostly early game resources in masses and it takes too long to farm them

Neutral
too many pre-built structures which killed the atmosphere for me a little

Pro
sweet graphics and 3 game modes


Cheers"
12159,good
12160,you should buy it if you have a creative mind ;d
12161,Good game

12169,THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12170,e
12171,its so so fun
12172,Creative easy to learn but you need to spend time on it. Great with friends.
12173,"good except when your friend makes you download it, validate it's files, move it to your ssd, and then ditches you after 5 minutes"
12174,needs controller support for people who can not use a keyboard properly
12175,GOOD.
12176,"Fun game in every way. Buy it. Also watch some tutorials unless you have a friend who knows how to play the game.

12178,Idk why tf this has a survival but it‚Äôs fun making rocket ships
12179,Ya it's a good game.
12180,cause
12181,"I don't know where to start with this game. IT'S AMAZING, the Dev's are always accepting feedback from the community on ways to improve the game. i was playing before the survival update and even then it was fun. once the survival update hit the game only started getting better and better from there, if you like Minecraft creative and survival but want to build more than mine and want the red-stone to make up everything you create wile being 8x's harder. then this is the game your looking for. i can sit here for hours on one creation trying to figure how how to improve it or make it work, or make a better farm defense to keep my blueberry's safe. i never run out of things to do or to build. i have gotten the farthest you can go in survival mode so i'm now just waiting for the new update, even then i can use creative mode. good game would recomend."
12182,awesome game play. just fun to goof around
12183,"very fun
"
12184,"Po
       tato gun!:)"
12185,"very fun and creative to play. Can have some physics issues with larger creations, but that's avoidable"
12186,"The Creative mode is just a slightly better than the beta creative mode, but the new survival mode is just AWESOME!"
12187,Boom. Now i good mechanics
12188,fun but kinda hard to learn at first
12189,cool
12190,very good and fun with friends. very high skill ceiling in how good you are at building

12192,Good Game! Survival has tons of potential to be a very good survival game!

The survival is really cool, there is bots too so watch out!
Hope this helped you"
12197,ol;l;l;l;l
12198,the game is cool but survival is a little hard you just need to find the right path
12199,its fun and creative
12200,this game is epic
12201,"This is a game I just keep coming back to. I've always been in love with robotics so it's right up my alley. I haven't tried the survival as of yet (because I prefer the freedom of creative) but from experience I really enjoy messing around and creating whatever comes to mind.

7/10. Good, nothing especially wrong."
12202,Fun to smack my freinds with potato guns and sledgehammers but otherwise this game is boring
12203,This is a good game i played it for 50 hours and i still love it i would highly recomend this game to other people.
12204,"its awsome there are endless posibilitys

12209,"rough around the edges, minimal story if any, but the core gameplay works and is interesting. not bad, but id wait for a sale if youre sure you want it"
12210,if your into game with building aspects and love survival this is for you.
12211,"IT IS STILL BUGGY BUT FUN

12212,"minecraft better

12213,great just can't think of anything to add
12214,"Building, exploring, creating, survival.  All around fun game.  Play alone or with friends."

12220,"good, nice good good"
12221,Good game
12222,"Pretty good, though it does feel kinda grindy sometimes. I love exploring the map, for some reason finding a bunch of ruined buildings that are almost exactly the same apparently is appealing to me. Fun to play with friends, but not so much alone (but that could just be me). It would be nice if they added more hairstyles and maybe an upgraded version of the hammer for noobs like me who like melee and don't want to only attack Big Reds/Farmbots with a gun they fail at aiming XD"
12223,"ibil ;lasrs
"
12224,"This game is absolutely amazing! The building is fun and the pace of the game is wonderful, you dont get rocketed through the game and it is not super slow. The challenge mode is great for teaching you some easy tricks for vehicles and comtraptions. my only complaint is that the game audio is too quiet (I have the program maxxed  and the settings all maxxed)"
12225,"i'm addicted. This game's amazing. Totally worth the money,"
12226,Yeah this game is good *you look at time played*
12227,I like it!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! :D"
12235,"This game is very fun for a group, but DO NOT buy it if the people you intend to play with are on the other side of the world. The game has no dedicated servers, so you will be experiencing a lot of lag and d-sync if that's the case."
12236,the blue robots destroyed my car :(
12237,the best game ever
12238,stuck on the loading screen. it had a bunch of useful tips for when i can finally play!

12243,Good game with mildly glitchy physics engine and mediocre multiplayer
12244,this is a good game
12245,I love this game and it is malty player
12246,"The game is crazy laggy in co op with my friends, or course I the host never experience this unlike those who have joined the game. Id say thats the biggest issue with the game right now and if resolved would really help with the popularity. besides that love it"
12247,no map. only flaw
12248,pretty fun would recomend
12249,"This game is a true creative masterpiece. Build a car, test it, diagnose any problems, fix them, and make it look good. If you aspire to be an engineer, you may want to experiment on this. I do very recommend this."
12250,Very fun and creative
12251,Great game! Easily worth 80 dollars can
12252,"An excellent game that has afforded me the boundless fun of creating whatever my computer can handle in creative mode and spending countless hours exploring and building my way through the survival world. With so much to offer in terms of building mechanics, logic, and overall parts selection, I feel the game has near limitless potential. While I can't speak to connection issues or lag on the multiplayer side, for a solo gamer, Scrap Mechanic is a must."
12253,only play cuz my down syndrominc brother plays all the time
12254,"This game is amazing!  From cars to motorcycles, to even ExoSkeletons!"
12255,Good

12257,i cant stopppppppppppp
12258,Fun game
12259,"Plenty of good stuff to do provided you like blocky building.
It can get pretty difficult in the later stages if you play alone but it can be very rewarding.
With further updates on the way to flesh out the survival side and improve the story this game has plenty of potential.
It is definitely worth giving this game a look especially at the price they are charging at the time of this review."
12260,i luv this gaym
12261,"Hey stop that, you're playing the game wrong!"
12262,cant even play survival any more. just wasted 20euro
12263,"I really enjoy the tools and freedom to create things to solve problems that arise naturally as I go about playing the game! 

When I needed a lot of wood to build an awesome base, I had the kit to build myself a tree harvesting vehicle which was fun to design and use. Once I had my base built I was onto the next challenge that came up! Can't wait to spend more time in the game and see what else the developers have in store!"
12264,cant eat corn bad game
12265,this is about creativty and fun
12266,it is a very fun game in my opinion

I have over 1000+ hours in this game, its spent mostly trying to fix code or getting the game to work correctly.

Do yourself a favor, and skip this game."

12279,"This game is great, though some of the creations i try to make, the game doesnt handle well, and will drop to 10 fps,  which makes the game unplayable,  which is disappointing.  So as long as you dont get to crazy with what you make, you will have a good time with it.  Unless im doing something wrong idk."
12280,fun to play but not so fun if alone i would reccomend playing with a friend
12281,"This game is so much fun! It is a great COOP game. My perspective: It is Creativerse on steroids, man!"

12283,"DONT CHANGE RESOLUTION

Worst mistake of my life

I know I know you can change it back by deleting some settings file in directory of a game, but the problem is my potato of an PC can`t handle scrap mechanic, so I play, well I tried to play using GeForce now service, changed resolution and softlock myself from playing right in game menu (I changed it higher then my laptops resolution, in window mod, mouse doesn`t hower past laptop screen)

Overwise very good game was looking into playing it for a long time oh well"
12284,It is a lot of fun!
12285,"Game needs a little work but room for alot of content, this could be the vanilla version in 10 years of a really epic MMO IMO I see alot of potential here with this crafting style !!!!"
12286,Pretty much if you can imagine it you can build it with maybe 1 or 2 tutorials and you have what you want would recommend if it is on sale but it's ok to buy it if its not.
12287,I love playing this with friends. I also stream with them and it was awesome. We laughed and had so much fun. You can do almost anything you can imagine. I would highly recommend
12288,"This game is awesome, it really lets your mind elaborate, but at the same time lets you adventure and have cool experiences."
12289,Its very fun
12290,I Love this game! only thing I wish that they would change is that you can share the unlocked garment with your friends in the same server.

12304,"thought it was going to be something like 3d factorio it's more like banjo kazooie nuts and bolts meets slime rancher
"
12305,"I really don't know what to put for this review, honestly. I enjoyed the game a lot, despite the lag (apparently having the absolute minimum system requirements isn't a good way to play, [i]what a shocker[/i]). The bugs are annoying and easy to find, but they rarely ruin the fun
I most likely won't play this game again and I don't recommend it to those with weak computers, but it's an amazing sandbox AND survival experience!

Edit from later or whatever:
After further consideration (and another play of the game), I have decided that this is an amazing game. I love it. Please, if you can, buy it (if you haven't already). The physics may be a tad inaccurate sometimes, but it just adds to the experience. It may be a bit laggy for certain computers, but it isn't [i]too[/i] bad!
Great game, buy it."
12306,"A MUST buy for anyone who likes engineering. This game has mechanics and ideas that I honestly can't explain. You can makes planes, cars, and even helicopters! Seriously buy this game."

12315,i dont know if this goes to the creator but i would like if you added weather  and if you could make this an offline game because if it was offline i would play this game 24/7
12316,"easy to make stuff
"
12317,"PROS: 
Great game for anyone with a semi or very creative mind. If you played with Legos as a kid, you'll love this game. Great for people who want a calm game AND great for people looking for a less-calm game. While you can simply stick to farming or exploring the VAST map, you can also fight small-medium-large size bots or defend your home (If you choose to have one) The only limit to your build is your mind. As big as you want, as fast as you want, whatever color, etc. Also it supports single and multiplayer.

CONS:
After about a week or so of game play it got a little repetitive fore me as it is very possible to do everything in the game and you'll just be left with farming. That last sentence will have little-no meaning after the DEVLOG update coming soon, which will be adding a lot more. If you're expecting to find animals in the game, don't expect too much. The only NPCs in the game (as of now) are robots and a cow. Basically, don't expect to find birds, bears, fish, deer, etc. As well as this, there is no option for difficulty. It's ONLY what you'd expect ""normal"" to be.

OVERALL:
Highly recommended. I love this game and can't wait for future updates. Remember while reading the review, this game is EARLY ACCESS and hasn't been completely finished. In the future, maybe animals will be added, no one knows yet."

12359,its realy fun and you do cool stuff build break an alot of other stuff.
12360,"I have 300+ hours on this game, it's so addicting and I highly recommend taking a look at it."
12361,"Revised Review: Still Rubbish, not as bad as earlier, don't buy

The reason I had nothing to work with is a HORRIBLE idea of HIDING THE BATTERY AT THE MECHANICS SHOP. You have to go hunt for that thing (Hint: the super-important piece you need is hidden in soda can building #2, and there're bots guarding it). Even with that battery, and the actual crafting unlocked, the game is still incredibly frustrating. The physics engine is trash, combat is infuriating, Survival is a constant cycle of starve and respawn because growing food is just that damn hard. That cooking bot is a waste of resources; it doesn't help at all, because you'd need most of the types of veggies grown to cook anything, which you have issues doing, as growing anything in any number causes your base to be the constant target of enemy spawns even after you give up and decide not to grow anything. 
Farming requires water, which means your choices are spend a small eternity constantly running an incredible distance between the mechanics shop and a body of water with frickin' BUCKETS, or go through an incredible number of cycles of starve and respawn to set up some kind of automatic water system right next to the body of water, and resign yourself to either extremely long and slow walks constantly attacked by enemies to relocate your crafting stuff to a new base by the water/farm, or resigning yourself to constantly walking between your farm and your crafting, leaving one or the other open to constant harrassment by enemies. 

My frustration has peaked - I'd request a refund if I could. A waste of hours and money.

Original Review
Absolute Shit. 
Combat is clunky as all hell - the ""hay"" bots are frustrating to fight one-on-one, and INFURIATING to fight more than one at a time, or in a building, or with no good sight. You WILL die. Constant dying is how you clear anything out.
The vehicles are no faster than running on foot, and WAY harder to control. Plus, the physics engine is absolute SHIT; build anything that's even slightly as wide as it is tall, and you WILL end up flipping ... on FLAT GROUND. Anything complicated? Forget about it.

I ran a survival mission, and while this can be fixed, it's absolute SHIT. You get ONE master battery, and you'd better not use it on the ship (that you have to do to get the log and waypoints and such), because if you do, you can't get the battery back, and you need that to get the mechanics' shop running. With only the ship, you can only make ""scrap"" parts that are complete trash, and there aren't that many options or features. There's no way to store parts except for dropping them on the ground, and there's no way to spend parts. After several hours of wandering around, dying 20+ times to massed robots trying to find a second battery, my frustration is at max."
12362,"this game is great! creative anyway. you have a wide arrange of parts at your disposal the creative mode is great, survival not so much the beacon update definitely helps. the next chapter looks like it's gonna make my review irrelevant."
12363,love it
12364,yes
12365,"this game is truly something ingenious, as it allows for simple constructions, but you can quickly gain new skills, allowing for advanced machinery, warships, auto balancing heli's, tanks, AIs, ect. it also promotes complex thinking and problem solving, as well as just being fun. if you need some inspiration, just go into the workshop and download some stuff to mess around with. mods are almost required to make more advanced things, as the god send mod known as 'the modpack' adds math, advanced sensors and engines, and other things. i have played over 600 hours, and got my moneys worth plus quite a bit. very good game"
12366,MMM

12375,"Its great

12376,it is very grinde but fun
12377,"Well, I had to write an excellent review of this game. In this game, only your fantasy limits you. If you want to build a car, build it. There are also houses here - my favorite in this game. At home, this is the coolest thing in this game. (in my opinion). If you want you can build a WHOLE CITY. But unfortunately, in this game, you can't make a NORMALLY FLYING HELICOPTER without any glitches or crutches (or you can, but it's not certain).
The game also has a survival mode. Survival is interesting and good enough. Now you need to plant vegetables, grow fertilize and make sure that robots do not demolish them, make craft bots, build a normal car for moving and transporting boxes with vegetables or fruits, and exchange them with a merchant for weapons or seeds. And then the moment came, you bought the coolest guns from the merchant, got ready to go to the nearest station and they kill you with two hits. finding an elevator is a VERY BIG PROBLEM
Well, you have already reached the last floor, took all the loot, return home and are glad that you have downloaded the base of robots. In principle, this is where the passage of survival ends. Thanks to AXOLOT GAMES for this great game."

12382,"its a damn good game BUT don't play with people from other countries. it lags too much then its no fun

All it needs is dedicated servers"
12383,"very good
"
12384,I love this game specially because I've been playing it with my girlfriend and she loves it too! We just hope for more decoration items because she loves decorating our base. I've been playing this game by myself before I get to play with her and I really love the survival mode I'm looking forward to more updates in the future!
12385,"its really fun with the other updates!! i recomand playing for about a mounth or 2 to get the hang off it
"
12386,Best game i've played
12387,"47 minutes played. At 5 or less minute increments. I have looked all over the web to fix the crashing issues. I have tried repairing the files, reinstalling, checked Reddit for help and every website/forum I could find. I like the little bit of the game I have played but this is just down right sad. No way for customers to contact the company and get a real answer and Steam wont do anything to make it right. If you're lucky and didn't get the constant crash, I hope you enjoy the game. For me, I hate it because I want to play it but nothing works for me."

12395,"its vvary good

i ove game"
12396,"well, not necessarily. creative is great. survival? when i play survival, i ask myself one question. why? why am i playing this, what that i can do here is fun, and is it worth doing everything else to get there? i like building things to do things, because the only limit to efficiency is your own design, but getting the materials to build things is painful. especially when you just built your farm and don't have good defenses. maybe it's worth it for you. clearly, it's worth it for many people. i don't know. creative is worth it though, worth full price for me, especially with mods."

12421,"requires semi good computer but it is hard to hard well,yes"
12422,play it and see
12423,"It's very bare bones right now with some very frustrating mechanics.

I had a collector filled with metal and a Haybot killed it within 15 seconds not only destroying the collector but the full load of metal it was carrying. 
Needs some attention on such things as it undoes the hour or so you spent gathering. 

The haybots do way too much structure damage in the first place forcing you to build an entire fortress out of metal and finding creative ways to kill them or have everything you have created in your entire play time destroyed in minutes.

The games core mechanics are extremely fun and offer endless creativity it's just a shame the difficulty of survival is not a whole host of monsters and events but a small handful of very frustrating robots that target your buildings and machines."
12424,its so funn

12427,"Whilst I appreciate that ""Early Access"" games come with some bug and issues that are still to be resolved.

I have yet to experience a Game where the graphics are as polished as they are in ""Scrap Mechanic (Survival)""... cough cough.. 

The Game was released in 2016, still in ""Early Access"" in 2021... Maybe that should have told me all I needed to know...
But from reviews and videos online and on the Steam Product page, this game should have been a winner for me.

I enjoy farming/construction games like ""Ark, Survival Evolved"", Terrarria"", ""Oxygen Not Included"", ""Minecraft"" to name but a few of this genre of game that i have amassed well over a 1500hrs of playing time on..

But this game just seemed to fall short in every aspect.
[olist]
[*] No Native Controller Support
[*] No Instructions /Tutorial for Survival
[*] Poor Character vs Enemies level balance at start of Survival
[*] Complete lack of information or help in or for Survival in actual game.
[/olist]

And yes I did go through the Tutorial at the start of the game, but that only shows you how to construct vehicles and machines. 
What it DOES NOT teach you is ho to construct the basics like, your first weapon or gun hell anything that actually might help defend against the enemies in Survival.

Of the 8.5hrs I have played, I spent 1.5hrs on the Tutorials, about 30 mins in the ""Sandbox Mode"" you have every item and all materials at your disposal, so not very helpful to learn anything. and then the rest of the time in ""Survival"" running round and getting killed time after time after time with no idea on how to even make a new weapon so that I might stand a chance against the enemies.

After being killed for what feels like the 50th time, re-spawning with only 30% Health, Food and Water. Then have a distance back to my ""rotting corpse and items"", further than I can travel before I die of starvation. 
At this point I finally decided to say F**K IT and ask for a refund.

Whilst others have ranted and raved about this game saying it is great.... I cannot agree with a single one of those reviews.
My experience has been one of major frustration and annoyance at the lack of information or help with just the basics..

This game could have been Great... In fact it still could be a great game just not at the moment and not without a lot more work to resolver some major missing items. Though the fact that it is still in ""Early Access"" 5 years after its release date Speaks for itself.

12432,Awesome game lots of cool things to do in this game survival mode and creative mode both a lot of fun  you can build whatever you want.
12433,this game is the best i just wish they would increase the amount of blocks you can drag and place at once.
12434,It is a good game i like it!!!

12436,Sure why not
12437,"IT IS SO BAD
"
12438,its good but i farted
12439,this game was definitely worth the wait but not as good as sea of thieves that has more content LOL
12440,"Lots of fun but definitely better to do multiplayer!
"
12441,"While I don't have many hours, I think you all know how easy it is to review a survival game. 

At the start of the game you are greeted with ""Challenge Mode, Survival Mode and Creative mode"". just to be clear, this review was written with survival mode being the core game mode in mind. I do however have a little input on the Challenge Mode. 

Challenge mode: These were fun little trails that kinda helped aid the players on how to set up vehicles and control them at the beginning (I only got to like challenge 8 out of 30 or something like that). While they were decently fun to accomplish, what caught my eye was the ""work in progress"" community challenge steam workshop. Down the road players are going to be able to make their own creations for the world to play and that's going to be really fun.
---
Survival Mode: Within my 13 hours with still more to come after this review is written, I've had boatloads of ""Sandbox Fun"". By sandbox fun, I mean it was fun screwing around with the game mechanics, trying to figure out what blocks do what and everything in between without looking up guides or ""best ways to get ___ "" videos. Now that kind of experience isn't for everyone; the game not holding your hand could be intimidating for a lot of people and could ruin the fun. At the start, there is 0 sense of direction and with no objectives or quests, you really have to make the game your own. 

At the start, you emerge from a crashed ship with a big open world. They start you with your essential tool, the sledge hammer and greet you with breakable chests to kinda get you into the mix on what to look for. After that, its all up to you to make your scrap mechanics story your own. There is a Health Hunger and Thirst bar which are easily managed if you put effort into it. The loot in this game is very random and could go 30 crates before dropping one carrot so starving in this game is really easy. I had alot of problems at first with the games food system till i realized how important plant farming is. Make sure you guys get focused on that before giving up on the game it changes everything. Growing crops triggers a defense mechanic; a wave or two of random enemies will come specifically to break your farm up since the enemies consider it ""Illegal Farming"". Once your food situation is in order, the game becomes a breeze. From what I've experienced, combat is dull with the sledgehammer being your primary weapon for some time but you learn quickly that combat isn't supposed to be what you are looking for. This is a tinkerer's game, someone who loves to experiment while having to do a couple of survival related things in between. The highlight of the game for most people I'd assume is the vehicle creation and intricate electrical work very similar to redstone, just less messy. Vehicle creation has to be thought out, not just mashed together. Weight matters both in blocks used to create the car and whats on top of it as well. With multi engine vehicles being a thing, its possible to create a nearly endless amount of vehicles in different shapes and sizes if enough thought is put into its design. 

Well, its back to my workshop in game for me, hope you guys like the review! Get the game, within 2 hours you will know if you like it or not. Steam refunds never disappoint."
12442,"I'm bad at it, but making stupid shit is fun."
12443,"A quirky and pretty building game that even after 4 years EA release is apparently little more than a creative mode physics sandbox. With bad physics. And almost no building parts.

The ""survival"" game feels like it's designed to be a story mode, but without any story. The ""robot attacks"" that were advertised are just a couple melee mobs and can be avoided entirely if you just plant your crops far enough apart. You can plant more crops to buy a potato gun, that's literally the entire progress ""tree"".

The ""challenges"" game mode forces you to use very specific parts. So specific that there's almost no creativity allowed in the solution. Just not having restrictions and letting people do whatever would have been so much more fun, but nope.

I'm bitterly disappointed I decided to spend 2 hours hoping challenge mode would be fun after realising how bad survival mode was because now I can't refund it."
12444,op
12445,"best game on steam so fun very nice calm and relaxing 100 out of 100 would buy for the great price.

12449,"Game is really enjoyable, fun, relaxing and unleashes your creativity. Those are the pros, but there is huge issue with this game. After you play for some time, game save gets corrupted, and there is no way to reload it, problem is since i remeber, like 2016 ppl were reporting that, and in 2021 issue is still there, what the hell devs ??"
12450,mmm lag gud
12451,"a really fun co op game i am playing with my friends all the time
"
12452,fuck yes
12453,"I have never seen a survival/building game with such a broken progression system.

The survival mode suffers from two major problems:
[olist]
    [*]Components are atrociously expensive to craft (and upgrade).
    [*]Most of the resources have to be harvested by hand.
[/olist]
What I normally enjoy about building/survival games is that you start off collecting resources by hand, but slowly and steadily build creative and smart contraptions and machines to automate this, increasing the production up to the point where it is completely automated.
Not here. Crafting recipes require many components that have to be constantly gridned manually. You always have to roam the level to collect beeswax, seashells, oil, component parts, etc. for every single component you can craft.
The most simple ranged weapon cannot be crafted at all. It has to be aquired via trading which requires a vast amount of completely ridiculous resources.

Besides survival and creative there's another mode that sounded promising to me: Challenge mode. You have to build contraptions in order to reach a certain point or complete different tasks like transporting a box somewhere. Unfortunately this mode is also incredibly bad designed. You only get a fixed set of resources (so you cannot be truly creative) and in multiplayer all players work on a single contraption while sharing the resources.
How cool would it be if all players were free to build a vehicle on their own and compete to complete the same challenge? Certain resources, such as thrusters, could simply be limited or forbidden for certain challenges.

The core mechanics are fine, I guess. The only gripe I have is that all vehicles feel janky due to the physics. Building airborne vehicles is horrible. It requires you to physically attach buttons and switches for every thruster group (pitch, yaw, roll, ...) and bind them to the 1-9 keys on your keyboard. In fact almost all community vehicles use the suspension-glitch to magically stabilize the vehicle. An official ""gyroscope"" component would have been a much better solution."
12454,if u creative
12455,"A little hard when in early game, but as soon as you get used it, it really takes off. 10/10 for the survival mode, really awesome!"

12489,"Horrible do not buy. Why?

If you're buying this game for survival dont. Its just 2 weeks of gameplay where you cant build what you want because the parts are so fucking oversized and you get to drive around a tiny sad world which is about the size of a minecraft pocket edition alpha world then when you're done playing the sheer 2 weeks of gameplay you can download mods which just add new parts you can use in the sheer TWO WEEKS at most 1 month of gameplay which you can skip most of the gameplay very easily and cut the 2 weeks to like a few hours. And then when you're done playing the game you get to wait YEARS for the devs to add a like 6 days worth of gameplay (Cough cough survival chapter 2 cough cough) and if you join the SM discord server you'll just get kicked because one of the mods is a tyrant who will get mad at you for not giving them the customer service smile 24/7 and refusing to be a doormat.

And if you wanna buy this game for the creative building dont do it. The building is crap. The music is quite nice but overall the game is terrible and as another reviewer described it ""This is one of those IN THEORY games. IN THEORY its a sandbox game but your only choice is making huge SUVs due to the ungodly scale of parts."""
12490,"Very fun game- it's still in beta so I'll update my review as (if) issues get fixed. 

It's basically a simpler, more forgiving space engineers. The core game concept is solid: acknowledge a need > create a vehicle or structure that helps farm for what you need > improve the design until it stops > explore and experiment. 

Multiplayer is a drag due to EXTREME MULTIPLAYER LAG. The game lags solo as well, but even in a blank world the multiplayer lag is too severe for some gamers. In an eclectic gaming group of 6, 3 will find multiplayer unplayable. 

Very promising game, but paying $20 to participate in a barely playable open beta earns ""not recommended."" 

Review will update if experience-breaking elements get fixed."

There's a 'grindy' resource gathering element for those who like that and warehouses to raid for those who like a dungeon style fight. There are still quite a few things needing to be polished and optim,ised"

12532,"This game is excellent for amateur engineers, model-car-makers, & people who just generally want to screw around. From cars to tanks to hovercraft to planes, basically everything is possible. And with the thousands of community-made mods & creations, even more everything is possible! There's also a survival mode that's updated every 2 months or so, & a challenge mode where you can make & share your own challenges, or play challenges made by others! The only downsides are that if you don't have a GPU, high-quality graphics settings & overly-complex creations will slaughter your computer, & it is still in development, so not everything will always work properly, you've got to be patient sometimes. But yeah, other than that, easily the most fun game in my library!"

12551,The best game to play with your friend. I would recommend to people who make ideas in their head and want to build them. Amazing mods and creations. BEST GAME EVER!
12552,very fun game. great workshop creations and the survival is amazing
12553,"great game, but multiplayer needs fixing, the lag and netcode is unbearable"
12554,it is a great way to show your amagination
12555,good game.
12556,poger
12557,NERD GAMES
12558,its a fun game to play from time to time.
12559,"This game is really cool but the glitches are a bit much.
But that dosen't take the fun out of it."
12560,SO FUN!!
12561,best
12562,[i]Kinda good I guess...[/i]
12563,really fun defenetly will say as my fave game
12564,big drill on car be like dfgyfsgfksygfsksgf rocc bhfbvajvgevaf rocc bdfskrvafak rocc kagfakagfjad meeaatal ooo shimy
12565,this games is a very good game it just need some more tweaks for the survival side of things. but over all it os a very good game
12566,"its a great game, its a really good way to bring creativity to life"
12567,E X C E L L E N T  !!!!!!
12568,"Super fun and complex game, creative is fun for a while but survival is where most of your hours go. Requires some searching online to figure things out, especially when you first start, but eventually you start to find things out. If you can play with a friend, than its way more fun"
12569,"This game is seriously good. Sure, there's a ton of bugs, but its still in early access, so just deal with bugs, its a epic game, the survival is kinda hard, but the creative is awesome, especially with mods for creative, sadly its harder to install survival mods than it is to install creative mods, well at-least when I last checked.



As a side note, some of the bad ratings are because they don't understand how to play, its as simple as searching up scrap mechanic survival guide."
12570,It is a very good game
12571,love this game its stupid and amazing with multiplayer i recommend
12572,very fun but can be a little confusing at the start so i would recommend watching a few starter videos.
12573,ok
12574,very S C R A P
12575,I cant get a normal car to work
12576,"At first when I bought it I was very excited by the creative sand box nature of the and the fact you can make vehicles.
Well after playing creative for hours, it got old. The updates kept on coming with new features and mechanics, that is expected with an early access game. Well what really changed the game, is when survival got released (Yeah I know the challenge mode was also there but still). Finally years of waiting came to a ""conclusion"". I would recommend this to anyone wanting to play creative/survival sandbox games. I hope Scrap Mechanic gets even better with more survival features and also creative parts. One thing I would really like is a dedicated server with physics calculation and objects fixed."
12577,its really addicting to try learn how to build more complicated builds
12578,"great game

12579,wow this so much fun i made a pizza ria

12597,Its fun
12598,"cheese
"
12599,"Look, this game could be so much. But the Devs are really ruining every part of it. They ruined mod support, they ruined many parts of the game that people like me use every time we play, for no other reason other than they dislike how we play a sandbox game. I dont recommend you buy this aging piece of junk. Every part of it is dying and so are all the communities soley because of the Devs. It had so much potential but alas its all wasted at this point. So dont spend your money and wast many hours like I did."
12600,awesome disien
12601,It a good game
12602,"I LOVE this game,i get to push my imagination as well as my skills in the survival mode, but im still waiting for the update that allows you to take stuff from warehouses, but the game is still fun doe, highly recommend for people who like to build things."
12603,yes
12604,quality game i do so say you should get this game.
12605,"this game is aids i had to buy my nana a newe loife ssupport machine it crahsed sig jack_-xL a yiuser of thus platfopr spawned a p,ane the siue of a fucki g polabet"
12606,It is a fun game that can either be pretty simple or very complex depending on how in depth you get with the mechanics and with your vehicles/machines.
12607,WOOF!

12619,amazing game. would reccomend to everyone. also how do u get the spud gun thingie????
12620,"IT GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GET THE GAME
"
12621,"The game is really nice and intriguing , especially the survival , spectacular graphics that do not require powerful video cards . But the program closes too often and crashes for no reason. Please solve, I don‚Äôt want a masterpiece like Scrap Mechanic to be ruined for this."
12622,"it is a great game,go play it."
12623,"your mom:)
"
12624,This is well worth your money if you like building actually even if you dont it can be fun to mess around with steam stuff and if your friends also have to it becomes even funner (Rating:999/100) i was not told to reveiw this high by anyone this is my own thoughts
12625,Scrap Mechanic is a very fun survival/creative game. You can build many things including Cars/Houses/Robots/ And much more. Survival mode is a grind for sure but with friends makes a whole new meaning to fun. If your lazy on creative dont worry you can grab creations from steam workshop made by other gamers.
12626,good game
12627,"I am too simple minded. Workshop is fun. If your brain has wrinkles an shit, have at it. it's well done."
12628,"this is a very creative game and lots, lots, LOTS more is yet to be added"
12629,"its a good game
"
12630,Pack my butthole.
12631,"Amazing, simply amazing. Lots of stuff to build and to think of. With the mods for this game I'm sure you could do anything"
12632,its a really good game
12633,good game
12634,I like this game because it gives you many possibilities of what you can do within it. It also is really modder-friendly because parts of it are open-source. You can really get creative with near endless possibilities.
12635,"its good and bad
"
12636,its fun
12637,THERE WAS SOME BUGS WITH SURVIVAL BUT VERY GOOD GAME CONSIDER BUYING
12638,"It's fun, but still in early access and for good reason. There are very few if any bugs I've encountered so far, but it's severely lacking in game explanations of how to do stuff and where to go for survival mode, but Survival Mode was only recently added.  Survival Mods also require changing files manually, which is inconvenient, and you can't revert to unmodded unless you made a backup or re-install the game. I highly recommend the subreddit or the discord if you need help finding what to do."
12639,"Very fun game, alot to do and customize. Almost like adult Legos"
12640,scrap mechanic allows a lot of creativity and with mods there is a bunch of stuff to just mess around with.
12641,very very fun you can make anything
12642,yes very tree
12643,Did not like it only played it for a day do not recommend it
12644,IT IS VERY POG

12647,really good game 100 % would recommend
12648,its just great
12649,"Even though Scrap Mechanic is still in development, Axolot games are rolling out updates that are mostly all HUGE and GAME CHANGING all the time! Not to mention the long awaited and AMAZING survival update! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes building, or likes cars, or likes building, or- well i could go on forever! But really, if you like Minecraft or Trail Makers you should buy this game. Plus all of the community made mods are awesome and have so much work put into them. Amazing game. BUY."
12650,great game
12651,"pretty good. development is glacially slow, however."
12652,lol
12653,it is a vere fun it dos not have a gerinde fill like minceraft dos
12654,Love It!!!!!! Very Addicting and can't wait for more to come out for survival!
12655,Good and always will be üëå
12656,Its really good mostly survival mode becuse you dont have everything right away.
12657,"mechanic that uses scrap.
Smart game."
12658,if you are an explorer or just like creative freedom this game is for you to do what you want but yeah i recomend
12659,amazing game >:)

12665,"great game, keep up the good dev work
"
12666,"This is a great game if you like to get creative, or like the feeling of progression. I've had a lot of fun with it."
12667,"its a very noice game but they can work in new bots like maby a scrap bot that scraps your builds.and there should be a good robot that attacks other robots there should be a robot that trades somethings for food
there may also be good mods you can add... also its super fun
"
12668,yes
12669,ye
12670,This game good
12671,"Hilarious fun, Absolutely recommend to anyone that enjoys the sandbox style game and building/driving vehicles"
12672,amazing
12673,Love this game it seems like there is always something to do
12674,"it is awsome
"
12675,Its fun and creative mode is fun you can make anything and experiment
12676,"its honsetly great but can get a bit boring 
"
12677,E
12678,"Has potential but now it's not really playable. Performance is terrible as soon as you start to build stuff. Anything that moves destroys the performance and pretty much everything moves. Not sure if the Devs are trying to fix this, can't find any info on it. To bad, this game could be epic."
12679,"not a terrible game but still wouldn't its boring there is no goal no story no real targets of any kind just running around a cartoony map with not alot to do, its a shame really raft by the same folks is such a good game in comparison"
12680,"yes
"
12681,amazing game worth every penny
12682,COOL GAME IF YOU LIKE BUILDING
12683,scrap mechanic is a really cool game with loads of fun features to play with friends
12684,"Very fun game, unique graphic, and really fun to play with friends. I highly recomend this game."
12685,YES THIS GAME IS GOOD OK
12686,"This game has incredible potential and is exactly what I've been looking for as contraption builder. BUT, the development is incredibly slow and is held back by numerous bugs and engine issues. I don't think the devs are listening to the community regarding what we actually want fixed and instead add random things nobody asked for (like limited bed use). Many of the bugs like pistons, suspension, bearings and slippery terrain make playing the game frustrating. These issues have been in the game since I started playing and have never been addressed."
12687,"For all the multiplayers that want to play this game with friends and go big  --> Dont!

My problems are pointing towards survival-multiplayer only, didnt played single or challenge mode (long enough).

Game in current state is a mess
-its lagging
-client will have no fun time
-client & server sync problems
-rubberbanding
-u will lose parts and whole vehicles if u play long enough.
-the larger the base - the stronger the lag

All those mistakes would be ok, cause its an Early Access game, but the lack of solving those problems hurts me.
There is no communication going on from the devs.
They pump out new stuff slowly, but wont fix the big issues the game got.
Just start to talk to your community, please dear devs!

If they move on with that kind of politics the game will be and stays unplayable in multiplayer sessions.
i would like to <3 the game and im willing to give it a positive review, if that kind of stuff is getting prioritized.

Hope this helps some people.
(english is not my first language, plz dont blame me for my typos :>)

12695,Such a wonderful game
12696,"Very buggy, but unique visual style and gameplay make this a pretty fun game for me"
12697,"Pro:
 Machines.

Con:
 Needs more in-game  tutorials/hints/guides (Ex: There is no fire extinguisher to put out fire on electronic devices, use water buckets instead. Put out the fire to active your first 'crafting table'; Items can be built on the ground/car instead of storing them into chests)

12729,Gets boring within the first hour
12730,"this is sooo much fun its minecraft, human fall flat and others alike all combined into one game i love creative mode where i can just do whatever the hell i want"
12731,"Cool game with some fun building mechanics that allow you to get pretty creative. As for the survival, don't play this if you're looking to make a massive base as you would in Minecraft. The game still has some problems with handling large structures. Otherwise it is a pretty enjoyable survival experience that will hopefully have a more full endgame soon."
12732,Scrap Mechanic is a fun game. Just survival isn't that good.
12733,"This game is really fun. It requires you to think quite a lot about how you want to design your car so that can be tricky for some younger people wanting to play. I have 8Gb of Ram and it usually runs smoothly with the absolute lowest graphics settings, and it still looks decent. I havent personally used the online multiplayer but I have seen videos and it looks great. If you own a higher end PC then I definately reccomend this game. There are few things that are annoying apart from the lag. One thing I would like to see implemented is that there are blueprints that you can spawn from the lift made by Axolot that each introduce different parts amd how they can be used etc. Something that would be able to help get started with the mechanics would be cool. Would definately reccomend."
12734,eeeeeeeeeeeeee its very good but i do not like how short the days r
12735,This game is good it just gets a little grindy at times. 9/10 would reccomend
12736,Very fun i like creative survival is fun also. both can get laggy
12737,this game is so fuck cool i cant stop playing it and it has a workshop too that makes it cooler
12738,fun
12739,"Awesome game if you like building things and fighting bots, just wish they would sort out the glitching and crashing issues."

12748,"this game is great you can build anthing. great for any one.
"
12749,"Great Game, easy and fun once you learn the basics"
12750,"Me and a friend had seen, built and killed everything and were bored out of our minds in 2 days...

I love building, but the possibilities are not even nearly as endless as some people would have you believe.  There really aren't that many parts to play with.

The world is endless repetition.  You never get a sense of where you are because everywhere is just the same handful of structures over and over again.

There are only 2 buildings that can be considered dungeons, and the only loot to be had after spending hours successfully avoiding all the aim bots and reaching the top of these incredibly long-winded warehouses is an unsatisfying clothing customisation or 2.

That trailer literally shows EVERYTHING this game has to offer.  there are no surprises. The big red robot at the end that looks like a boss? just a standard mob that you will see all the time.  there are no bosses.

I feel guilt for convincing my friend to buy this shallow shell of a game."
12751,king of not responding
12752,it gud and fun
12753,"I love this game.  The machine and vehicle building is really well done and, if you are mechanically minded and patient enough, you can build just about anything you can think of.  You can even build things that likely weren't intended, like piston engines.  The survival mode right now is a little empty as far as quests and progress for getting supplies can be a little bit slow, but it makes the creations you make all that more rewarding.  I'm looking forward to the content that has yet to be finished, but as is, it is still a great game that only has potential to get better."
12754,You can make sans fly to mars soooo
12755,Wow! Love this game!
12756,it is so good there is a grind but not to much
12757,good game

12759,great game
12760,.
12761,if your looking for a fun game this is the game for you
12762,amazing although u gotta put in the time
12763,epoic gamer download
12764,"I'm 31 hours in and I still haven't unlocked the first basic beginner spud gun. This game's survival mode is an exercise in tedium and expects you to toil for hours without anything new to keep your attention. The creative mode is incomplete and lacks many things from survival mode that I would have liked to use and prototype for my survival mode; such as soil, plants, water cannons, etc. The sound design is odd; most developers would like you to hear the sound effects and music the game has to offer but apparently that wasn't a concern here... I have everything cranked up to maximum volume, and with headphones on, and hear practically nothing.

Bottom line is it's just not fun as it is and the only thing that made it fun for this long was when I played with my friend and made silly things to knock each other over. Which can be done, better, in Gmod.

It's a shame really because the art design and what it's trying to do is interesting but the survival mode mechanics dilute everything to the point that I don't want to play it. There's a lack of tools and respect for your time.

[h1]Edit:[/h1]
Alright, after getting [i]*a weapon*[/i] the game gets a little bit better but still doesn't turn to something great in its current form. Defending your farm becomes boring as brain-dead robot AI get stuck on the fence I built around it and allow me to lazily plink away at them.

Finding new ways to build vehicles is fun but prohibitively expensive in most cases, and it's usually easiest to build in the cheapest way possible which means plenty of manual grinding for you, of course. I don't find creative really fun to play around in because there is no goal... though survival is almost as bad there too.

Finally I get to a warehouse with a key obtained from one of the giant red robots (The game never explains anything you need to do outside of the bare-bones basics) and the interior is *devoid* of loot and filled to the brim with ""Tapebots"" which demonstrate the worst AI can be programmed to be. [u]Pixel-perfect split-second sniper robots[/u] -- and get this, one hit from a potato they shoot at you does *55* damage, and that's IF THE GAME DOESN'T BUG OUT AND HIT YOU TWICE WITH THE SAME POTATO, [b]KILLING YOU INSTANTLY[/b]. People say the way to counter this is to put a bed on your vehicle so you can respawn next to your body however far away from your base you are, but I counter that with saying I shouldn't have to do tricks to make up for faulty game design.

This game has no respect for you and your time, and no payoff for the amount of grind it asks you to do. There's nothing in it right now; I looked up what loot could possibly have been worth that warehouse and it looks like you get pineapple and broccoli seeds -- more grinding farms to get boxes of produce to unlock a shotgun and gatling gun potato cannons. I consider myself to have seen all the game has to offer and it's unfortunately underwhelming."
12765,h
12766,Yes
12767,"They need to help me win cuz its always killing me in this shit of a game and i dont think that is nice i think that you should like get a jub GIT GUD
Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.

SRY FOR BAD ENGLIS"
12768,"its creative and you can have a lot of fun with it but you need to be warned that you need a powerful computer to run it.
And also the workshop stuff is fun too."
12769,niceeee
12770,"Sadly i have to admit, that every person who tells you not to play this game in its current state is probably right. 
I had much fun and will play SM again, but! after Performance-Updates, which might never come looking at the speed of development.
So now i also tell you of my experiences and my story with it and why i do not recommend Scrap Mechanic (in its current state!):

I love complicated physics-based games so a friend of mine told me: ""Try Scrap Mechanic"" I did. 
Starting in Survival with no plan at all i foud myself lost. What to do now? You stand infront of a burning space ship, a trusty hammer and lift at you but nothing else. Try ""H"" for help. Butt he ""Handbook"" is a farce. Tells you 2 or 3 things that are self-explanatory, but nothing else. So i tried my best on my own. 
Said friend gave me some advice what to do first. ""Look for the Mechanic Shop, the game really starts there"" I did.

After 2 Hours of searching, traveling, looting (my inventory was filled up after 20 minutes) and permadieing of Hunger / Thirst i finally reached the shop with the giant neon-wrench. I dont even start explaining about Master-Batteries and how to find them - the game also didnt explain it. Or anything so far. 
Finally able to build a ""Craft-Bot"" the game began. I looked up some advice in the Internet and on Youtube - might play the game wrong after all. I did, obviously.

So i started playing it right. Building my first car, started looting, always microfarming to not trigger waves of bots, finally eating and not always dieing i got on my way. What to do with all that freedom? 
Harvest Resources! So my next target was to build an Harvester, a great contaption with drills upfront that purely hammers stone. And my FPS. And so the drag began. 
I hold on for about 160h of gameplay. Got tips from the net how to reduce lags, did it, it helped, except of farming stone (one of the main parts to get Metal and Stone, obviously) But where is the point in that?

The game is not really able to support more than 1, sometimes 2 creations that move on the same time, especially in Multiplayer. No, i dont play on a potato. It strongly depends on how small you build your creations and how good you are in not using suspensions for the most part. Bearings glitch all out as soon as you move too fast and flying is not possible except you use glitches to stabilise your vehicle. 

So i left the game for now. The Performance is absolutely gross, the Bugs and glitches are gross. 
There is no such thing as real physics, air-resistance i.e. or dynamic lift, there arent any wings in the game. Water has like no resistance, so trying to build a boat? - good luck, it only works with trusters, like everything not earthbound. And they eat fuel! But if you have to much onboard - you¬¥ll sink.  

Scrap Mechanic could be a great game, really, if there weren¬¥t all thos tiny problems, that form one hell of a big problem. In the current state i therefore have to not recomment it at all. 
It CAN be a great game, but looking at now nearty 5 years development i am very much disappointed of the state of the game.
To be revisited"

And just the same I find myself building crazy suspension for cars and wild inventions!
I love games like this, and this one is so simple yet effective It's amazing.. Ty Creators!"
12775,the game is good for learning enginiers as of myself. you can make endless creations. you can build rockets castles and monster trucks.

Nice game overall, good creative mode, well implemented survival. Glitches can both enhance the game (suspension glitch) but also be a nightmare all at once depending on what you build. I would suggest waiting for a sale before buying as it is worth playing, but not at full price."

12799,Survival: Amazing Creative: Amazing. That's all I need to say.
12800,The game has so much potential and makes a great time for hours. Learning to play is even fun! Just remember to learn how to build in creative before you play survival. It helps! love this game to bits.

12812,"Scrap Mechanic is a fun and well-made survival-crafting-engineering game which does a lot of things right, but I'm giving it a thumbs down for two reasons: 
1. The grind is absolutely terrible.  There are not very many milestones to advancement, but to offset this so you don't just get to the endgame right away, each milestone requires dozens of hours of resource harvesting and running back and forth.
2. The game gives the impression that you can build all sorts of wondrous contraptions, but whenever I try building something really interesting, either the physics go all wonky when there are too many moving parts, or the game just doesn't let you build things that way, so you either have to temper your ambitions or keep trying alternatives until you find something that sort of works."
12813,fun
12814,Highly Recommended. This game is extremely fun. I love how it mixes both survival and engineering into one game. Most other survival games have primitive tech but not this game. I can't wait for the next updates.
12815,"Truly a sandbox game, if you enjoy making vehicles of any type and using them this is the game for you"

12835,"This game is a lot of fun if you like creating things and exploring a large sandbox sort of environment. I've been playing off and on for a year and I'm quite enjoying the gameplay and build features. Being able to utilize these rotation editors for bearings and pistons are pretty nifty, first time playing a game with this type of free building for vehicles. Def recommend everyone to check this game out if you like to build stuff and just mindlessly explore."
12836,"I never write reviews, but this game deserves thumbs up.  Can't say enough about this game.  Well worth the money. New updates on a regular bases. Bravo!"
12837,my favorite game ive ever played i highly suggest and i dont have a high spec pc
12838,scrap mechanic i s a very good game it has a lot of fun stuff to do in creative like build go underground with ur lift and make bunker in survival its good but sometime it crashed when you load the game in or when u try join friend but anyways its got lots of mobs to fight bosses and warehouses to raid however they should respawn once u done all of them well u can do em again but when chapter 2 comes out i think they will do somthing about that cause they are adding new bots underground bioms sticky wheels new drills and stuff and im exited for it but  i dont know when it will come out sadly but has to come out this year!!!

12844,"If your interested in mechanical engineering, are an engineer, or just want an interesting game to play I would definitely give it a go, I would probably wait for a sale though, as most people probably wouldn't play the game for too long after purchase."
12845,"it is basicly minecraft but better
(and the phisics engine is not super buggy)"
12846,amazing game. worth every cent
12847,Valve time updates. EA since 2016.
12848,YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. either survival or creative! both modes have lots of detail. my favourate part though is you can make anything and publish it to the public for anyone to see or use any published vehicle you want! the game also can have custom key binds.
12849,"Starting off, the game is very difficult when i first did it. Nothing tells you what to do or where to go this game does not hold your hand or even tell you how to play majority of the game. Now starting off at the ship your job is to explore and gather resources to build. What it doesnt tell you is that next to you ship in the same area is a farm to also teach you how to grow food. It also doesnt tell you about the raids if you plant too much.

Besides all this though once you get the hang of it and get your first spud gun the game becomes manageable and you can focus on building and creating, before the gun however it is a grind and you have to force yourself to continue to play when you die from both starvation and bots gathering up on you suddenly. I would definitly recommend this game with a side note that say ""Go in with a goal of the item you want to build the most"" as thats what i did. The progress is slow but so much rewarding."
12850,"This is a fun game but there is one issue. 

MY BAG GOT STUCK IN THE WALL

9/10"
12851,"cool

"
12852,"After years of being in ""Early Access"" the game is still not there. What you see in the trailer happens after 9 hours of exhausting grinding and that's all. There are no other enemies, no other weapons, no other situations. What you see is what you get, plus an incredible amount of senseless grinding.
Awful to say the least."

12894,its a good sandbox game
12895,"Although I am garbage at this game and quit for half a year after some robot smashed my truck it's still a fun game.(Edit: This game abruptly stopped working and keeps crashing whenever I try to launch it, so much for giving it another shot :("
12896,"This is fun to craft things and play with physics, and I saw the opportunity to use this to teach my kids, until I struggled with bugs like the ""suspension glitch"" which make things not behave as they should.
I passed at least 4 hours to search and figure out how to counteract the issue, and it ends up in over-complicated stuff which is NOT fun.
So until this is fixed, it's a no go.
EDIT: 50+ hr of game play later: Well Considering it's a game (and not a physics simulator) and also that the last update still improved a bit this and even added a slider to change the physics quality, I was mainly frustrated originaly because my first creation in the game encoutered the ""suspension glith"" without knowing the existence if it? Later I saw that this is probably the only glitch I had in the game, and you can take (complex) measures to counteract it if you want. 
Now I have to says that I like the pace at which the survival is going, not on the side of grinding ressources but more on the side of discovry that we push further and further as our ressources allows us to build better vehicles. There is a lot of trials and error and surprise discoveries for instance when I discovered that some bots don""t like water. or when you discover ostages, and then much time later you find where you can bring them for trade (setting them free)"
12897,it is an arsome game asspeccaly for those techy and mechanicy guys out there.

12913,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE AVOID THIS GAME

For a 4year Early Access this game looks beyond saving, Developers have likely abandonded this, i expect nothing from the updates being a 4year project that has this many problems and so little content. 

Multiplayer is horribly coded, the lag my friend experiences over local lan or nearby internet has unplayable lag. Poor optimization AVOID if you want multiplayer, we barely built anything and the lag made the game unplayable. We frequently play differennt and far more intensive games without issue, there is no excuse here.

The survival mode itself is also pretty trashy, the food you need to gather and the advanced recipes you need to gather are pretty dumb, when you begin to starve its death -1hp per second and your too slow to have a chance of finding food anymore its basicly death, the AI is annoying, 2 hits your dead and they are everywhere, the npcs also attack the plants and animals that spawn leading you to nothing to find nearby as they have butchered them all off.
There are lots of pointless items floating around, you cant harvest them, they are *Aesthetic* they have 0 value. This game is honestly not fun, unless you want to build vehicles in single player, because your friends will experience lag that makes building impossible, this game isnt worth it
The concept behind the game isntbad but the execution ofthe idea is poorly done.
It unfortunatly took too long to figure out how buggy and shallow the gameplay is otherwise this would be a returned purchase, it is not worth even a sale price avoid"
12914,"This game is hard at first but once you get the hang of it is so fun!! You can be creative and build anything you want. Tanks, Airplanes, trains, and even simple cars and MORE!! I highly recommend this game! How ever you have to be smarter in this game. you have to know some stuff like angles,precision,and degrees but if you know all that its really fun!!"
12915,"its a great builder/engineer game with automaton logic. 
Fun little survival game, open world.
After 200 hours of building a base and making many creations.
The game began to lag.I found the limits of the game from a building perspective. 
Early access. I had a lot of of fun. There should be a bright future for Scrap Mechanic!"
12916,it is very fun but can be laggy if you do not have a strong pc
12917,i dont own the game but steam thinks i do

I just love the enemies and overal story/style.
Got it on a discount and absolutely don't regret it!"
12919,"First thing to note: 
The most developed feature is Creative mode. Survival mode is there, and is still being completed and receiving fine tuning.
If you like games like The Forest pick this up with some friends. The building is far better in this for my tastes. Plus the art (part, buildings, concepts etc.) are fantastic, and i hope with some polish it can really shine.

12940,hi
12941,"I have been playing this game and watching it on YouTube for a long time and I've always loved it, and I hold this game close to my heart. Now that the devs are working harder than ever, this game just keeps getting better. I thought survival mode would never come out, but when it did, it was SO worth the wait! This is one of the best games Steam has to offer and it keeps getting better."
12942,"I very much want to love this game. It seems like it has a lot of potential and creating various contraptions is fun. However, despite the game having been in EA for nearly 4 years from what I can gather, the performance issues of this game make it practically unplayable. 
Fans of the game say you just have to build things in a specific way to avoid death by FPS, but that completely defeats the purpose of a game where the main draw is to create. There are plenty of other games that manage creations just as complex without the massive hits to FPS and multiplayer lag. Even the Warehouses (the main ""dungeons"") are basically unplayable due to constant ( every 1 sec like clockwork) drops in FPS. 
This isn't a hardware issue either, i'm running the game on a GeForce GTX 1070 with Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz (12 CPUs), ~2.2GHz and Memory: 32768MB RAM.
I get that EA has hiccups, but the Devs need to show that they're willing to address existing issues that affect the core playability of the game otherwise it will never be a product worth buying.
"
12943,"This game is a promising start to something that could be spectacular.  I find that the updates to this game seem to be very small and I hope there is some significant updates around the corner.

The creation part of the game and the survival aspects are extremely enjoyable but the game seems to be lacking in true goal oriented depth ie. more variety in enemies, lootable area improvements (think rust monuments) and an end goal.

I look forward to where this game goes.  I just hope it gets there soon!

Oh and I feel that the game would benefit from some physics improvements."

There's tons to do, with a huge map to explore, stuff to craft, things to build with the stuff you craft, etc. Me and my friends have created trucks, cars, buggies, even a flyer! Next we might build a boat with a functioning motor. I've even learned about logic gates and controllers. The grind is real but just gives you time to talk with your friends. :)"

12992,If you enjoy sandbox builders then you will will like this vehicle based game.
12993,"I love the game and I feel like it has a ton of potential. There are some things that I don't understand about the game or even dislike, despite playing it for over 1,000 hours. However, I love the idea that you can do almost anything you can think of with enough imagination and logic behind your imagination. 
The pros to this game: 
You can play with other people which I personally love, because after a while of playing by yourself, it gets old relatively quickly like with most games that are solo. 
You can create a lot of things, and the idea's that I get are almost endless. In survival, you always have something to do, even if you don't exactly have a good idea of what you want to build, you can always do upkeep with your base or whatever you happen to need. 
Cons:
The physics can be a little squirrely sometimes, and the random little bumps on the road as you drive by sometimes drive me up the tree... sometimes literally in game, and while that is an interesting characteristic with the game, it can get kind of frustrating, especially if your trying to get away from one of the big red bots that are chasing you down. 
The logic behind this game in some areas kind of sucks. Let's take water for example, you can't drink water that you get from the ocean or a chest or something. Granted, in real life if we were to be technical, that water would be contaminated and would more than likely harm us, which is where you need to introduce a filter or something in my opinion. 
Idea's:
I notice that in the recent updates, the damage that the bots do, is minimal. I honestly prefer to have them do at least a little bit of damage to make things a bit interesting. When I'm talking about damage, I'm talking about bots attacking other objects and doing little damage, the damage that the mechanic gets is perfectly fine in my opinion! Just the bots attacking objects is a little... uneventful sometimes.
Another idea, would be to make it to where damage is inflicted onto your creations whenever you hit something. So... let's say you run over a haybot, that will do a little damage over time to your vehicle depending on how durable it is. Or if you ram your vehicle into a tree, depending on the speed, it could completely destroy your vehicle. That's something that I would really like to see implemented!
Those are just some ideas of mine. However, I would like to note something that's been bothering me. Whenever you run out of fuel on a gas engine, it locks up. I feel like that shouldn't be the case. Especially if you want to have a hybrid power train on your vehicle. Please, make engines coast like they normally would when they have fuel!"
12994,"so much to do very fun
"
12995,Good game but still in development..
12996,GOOOOD
12997,love it
12998,"GREAT GAME, has a few minor bugs, only really noticable after over 150 hours of game play so i doesnt really affect anything negativly but more so positively because some bugs are quite funny"
12999,awesome
13000,I could see someone who likes to build and create wacky contraptions enjoying this game. I like it.
13001,"Lots of fun and some really amazing tools to let your creativity and imagination run wild. The survival mode has consumed my free time of late even as a solo player, and I hope they keep adding to the game mode because it has even greater potential. This feels like Fantastic Contraption and Minecraft had a beautiful baby and gives a nice change of pace from other games I play."
13002,I LOVED IT
13003,"The game is great, it runs pretty smoothly, even with mods, and I have only one complaint-when in first person, your camera never tilts left/right in vehicles like planes, helicopters, bikes etc. 

Other than that, the game is very good, and the reason of someone's lag maybe too high graphic settings, or many creations colliding wioth eachother."

"
13062,im in love
13063,Good
13064,"Pros:

Co-op 
Build what you can imagine
Survival mode 
Can spend countless hours building and feel achievement

Cons:
LAG LAG LAG
more you build seems to lag your server. 
You need workshop mods to get shaped blocks
Game has a lot of bugs
Game isn't stable with more than 3 players
When building large vehicles the steering looks like its bending or falling off. 



Overall it was a stretch not to recommend this game. It has so much potential but its lacking in some polishing. Yes its early access , And i hope the devs do fix the stability and overall glitches I've experienced. As a avid co-op/building enthusiast I would strongly suggest waiting on this."
13065,"ok my turn

13066,This is the best game!
13067,i can crash the game with my friends
13068,ITS GOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

13070,if you like engineering and building robots this game is for you. its super fun and you can do so many things
13071,"
to play scrap mechanic you need creativity and a basic understanding of the game but after that the game is a wonderland of creativity and bringing your dreams to life i think anyone with a giant imagination like me would love this game if you dont have a imagination then you can still admire and have fun with other peoples builds."
13072,"This game in a few words: glitchy, fun and awesome. The game is amazing and you have no limits outside of your imagination! The game is still in developpement, but it only makes it more fun as new features keep coming in every 3 months or so. And each of the modes is really cool! challenges comes with fun levels and the ability to create and download more, Creative is the oldest, yet it aged well with the possibility of doing whatever you want! but the most amazing to me is the survival mode, with fun gameplay, an amazing world and the many original ennemies. Certainly one of the best sandbox games out there."
13073,Has game breaking bugs in survival that will delete hours of gameplay and force you to delete your save.
13074,"This game will suck up all your time like a vacuum pump, and you will find yourself spending potatoes to defend your potatoes. I know that doesn't make sense if you haven't played the game, which is why you need to get on board as soon as you can.

Blueberries, Woc Milk, drills and 8 wheel stone harvesters. You'll get hooked as I was, I'm sure."

13108,Great game if you like sandbox survival! Highly recommend if you like to play multiplayer as well. This is a very chill fun way to spend some time with a family friendly adventure as well!
13109,Pls help i one time just get up to the game.

13110,great game
13111,"Buy it if you like to build.
The survival portion is on the weak side to be honest. It has it's fun elements but survival mode is little more at the moment than a super grind. Enemy AI leaves a lot of be desired. It's still early access so hopefully some of this will be addressed. Enemy raids can become tedious as they force you to break away from collecting the resources you need far to often, and then end up being taken care of in just a minute or two. Other than getting the game breaking (but very fun) potato guns there is very little to work towards. That is fine for some people but I really find myself craving something that encourages me to move around the beautiful world.

Now that I've gotten the negatives out of the way lets move on to the things the game really excels at. The building is super fun once you've got the resources. There is a huge learning curve, but that is part of the fun.  The game looks great, and for me it is one of the more stable early access games on the market. The world is , and the characters the occupy it look great. While the enemies are for the most part too easy for my taste you still have to fight them in most cases. By that I mean that there aren't a lot of easy ways to glitch them on the environment for cheap kills. 
Overall I enjoy the game, but it's not something I can really binge on. More players really helps with some of the more tedious aspects. All negatives aside I am still really excited to see what future updates will bring to the table, and I can highly recomend it to anyone looking for a unique, and complex building system."
13112,amazing i love playing
13113,this game is full of fun stuff and amazing things on the workshop of scrap mechanic go play it now but remember not everythings free
13114,Personal favorite game
13115,what you can create in this game is crazy as long as you can think of something you can probably make it. Excited to see what this game has in store in the future.

13154,"It is a mirifical and glorious game, is  perfect: creative, survival and funny :)"
13155,a very great game for kids/adults
13156,"I was long waiting for a game like this and I absolutely love it :) I mostly played with singleplayer survival  mode. 


What I like the most:

- Building and automatation has a purpose. You do it for fun, but you also need to make your travel, mining, farming, defense etc. efficient. Building is easy and there is a nice pace of evolving through the game

- I really like the mood and the story behind the world.


Improvement opportunities:

- CUSTOM KEYMAPPING - How is it not developed already!? You either use the driver seat (wasd, but with specific constraints) or use numbers. You can't even name, or colorcode the buttons. This makes it very uncomfortable making anything off the book (and that's the main point of the game).

- There is no way to change gears while you're driving. There should be.

- It feels like the game is designed to make mainly ""carlike"" machines, and they work great. I just wish you could build a proper boat (something more realistic than a bubblewrap brick with thrusters; a boat motor would be great, and watertight cavities too); or a proper plane (flying consumes way too much fuel and very hard to control). They both can be done, but not worth to do it. You're more efficient with a basic car anytime.

- Better programming parts: It would be great if a controller could send an on/off signal too. It would be great to have a memory cell which keeps it's state. 

- I wish there were more places to explore, more bots to defeat, more survival-like challenges, more reason to build machines for :)

- Basically there is a workaround for everything, but too often the basic solution is the most efficient. I built a huge gun turret, but the basic spud gun is a more efficient way to kill farmbots. I work on a grenade launcher; mostly for fun, because growing two buckets of potatoes is way easier than the controlling it and making explosives.

13163,Great Creative! Great Survival!
13164,"So my friend introduced me to this game and i love it 
It like minecraft but cool item and more fun"
13165,its great its like minecraft but technical and more challenging and building bases in survival is a lot harder cause the blocks are smaller but then again that lets you detail it more there is also more to offer to get spud guns you need to farm and rescue the traders twin brothers which there are a unlimited amount of i think
13166,"Took this by chance, and have no regrets! Highly creative, co-op fun, well designed and built for a game in still in progress! Just awesome!"
13167,this game is good
13168,This is a fun game.
13169,"It's a fun game and since i Love survival games this fits really well into my life, of course there is the occasional bug. But what's a game without bugs? Anyways i do recommend those who like either a challenge, To live off the land, Or those who are satisfied by a simple drawbridge closing smoothly. I don't recommend however to those who either have little patience or don't like games with no end. 5 stars would recommend to other survivalists out there."
13170,hi
13171,It's pretty fun. Not gonna lie.

13174,this is fun with friends
13175,yes
13176,eng ye
13177,U can build smth. But is u try to find a story or may be some objectives in survival u will fail (boring really). Also playing with friends is one big issue (unstable and buggy).
13178,I love the game and its really fun to make stuff and i am so glad that they made survival mode
13179,good
13180,pretty good game
13181,it is great
13182,Great construction game. Building mechanical device its a delight almost as frustrating! But i enjoyed every moment!
13183,"Rarely do I write any reviews, but I felt this game needed mine.  From a creative standpoint your options are pretty unlimited and you can get crazy with building vehicles and bases.  The graphics and physics are pretty good but performance needs some work.  I have found that bizarre things cause frame drops like double-wishbone suspension in vehicles and elevator's in bases.  Sometimes frames will go from 60-> 20 because you didn't place your vehicle in the spot it likes.  Similarly if you get a raid coming to your base with more than 20+ monsters it tanks your frames.  You see this reoccurring with dungeons as well where your game will stutter hard and can get you killed before your game loads the potato flying at your face.  I hope with this next update they address performance issues that occur like this because the game otherwise is really good.  I also hope they add more angled pieces and more tires to put on vehicles as well.  The Devs seem like they actually care and listen to their community so I'm hoping they see this.  If you like building and survival and driving, this is the game for you."
13184,Its really fun you can be really creative.
13185,noice
13186,"Optimization to the finest. Yeah, I'm being sarcastic. Game contents wise, it provides so much mechanics, many parts, designs, and engineering capabilities. I love playing this game and creating vehicles, traps, and other etc. Although, few things about this game is that the graphic isn't going to wow you, It only has a handful of monsters you can encounter(Most of the times, only two), and worst thing possible is the laggggg. 

Holyyy coowww this lag is real. In the first 12 hours of the game play, you won't feel much of lag at all. But everything falls apart when you start creating your vehicles and tools. There are so many components that you could do to make this game fail on you. Bearings, Suspensions, Pistons, Wires, you name it. Once you have 2 to 3 complex creations like a minor, sawmill, you will know if the game mechanic is failing or not. Because, the pistons literally go crazy and will stretch out your creations, suspensions will give up all the sudden, bearings will not move for you, frames will drop down to 5FPS. I will tell you that my rig is beefy. 

so, here are some pros and cons of this game. It's very clear. I will be listing the stuffs that I didn't mention up there as well.

Pros:
- GTA like Ragdoll physics for your character and monsters. It can be funny in some situations. 
- Good amount of interactive parts to mess with. 
- Lots of good potential Engineering. 
- Game doesn't have ""tutorial"" but It's easy to grasp on what you need to do.
- Devs made good item crafting system where you can kind of customize how you want to work it out.
- Multiplayer is good and simple 

Cons:
- lag
- lag
- lag
- lag
- lag
- I'm serious. It will drop your FPS to 5 occasionally and 10 FPS very frequently. 
- Crafting food is very lacking
- Just a handful amount of different monsters
- Anywhere you go, your views and scenery look the same. Lack of biomes

If it wasn't the lag, I would put hundreds of hours into this game easily. I just hate that I need to create a new world because of the lag in my current world. Although, the game devs need to expend on crafting different variety of foods and stuff."
13187,Dah
13188,I would recomend this to any real mechanics or builders. you can show art and mechanics in many multitude of builds. when it comes to real life this game has tought me mroe about engineering than school has. 10/10 would recommend and you should get it.
13189,Very fun game. But there are some bugs that need to be fixed.
13190,at first the game just throws u in and says good luck. but as u learn to play the more u wanna play and before u know it hours gone by and ur still playing

13197,"Awesome game you can build what ever you want, you can try survival mode, or you can play challenges in challenge mode! I would recommend you try this game. Its awesome."
13198,Was in an unplayable state. Textures just didn't load properly and it seems like a lot of optimisation is needed. Will update this review when full release drops to see if things have improved.
13199,Best
13200,"I like building games, so I figured I would enjoy this.
As it turns out, I am. the game could use some quality of life features like not having the time only inside the logbook, and the mobs being pretty hard in groups until you get spuds."

13213,"this game is very fun, and if you like minecraft, you will probably like this game as well"
13214,"This game is amazing, especially survival mode, but there are is way too much lag when I load my game. It takes forever to even load in and when I do, it takes a long time for the textures to load. Also, sometimes I start to teleport/lag around every few steps I take and sometimes it gets very close to the verge of crashing. Except from that, the game is wonderful and i would enjoy if there was less lag in survival."

"
13219,so god!
13220,though buggy at times this is a very good game
13221,"I enjoy playing this game. It's a fun survival game which can be played in single player.
Creating your own tools to manage your resources, survive and so on is amazing.

I recommend purchasing this game if you like Minecraft with Nice Graphics and more in depth 
gameplay + creations and so on. 

Watch some gameplays. E.g. ScrapMan and KAN.

Pros:
1- Nice Graphics
2- Very performance efficient (Up to a point of course ""Very wild creations"")
3- Very little bugs (Most bugs are known and can be avoided)
4- Easy creation building and controls
5- Great community and even a more amazing Steam Workshop

Cons:
1- Driving feels like you are on ice (The driving mechanic is bad) however you get used to it,
but it still is annoying, feels like your traction is 0 all the time and also your car is jumping left and right (wobbly)
2- Survival needs more (Enemies, tools, bases, places, terrain) Still really good, but we always want more :P
3- No understanding if enemies will spawn next to you or not in survival (how does it work?) I still don't know but I seem safe, so all good.
4- Mods and modded items ruin the game (I personally only like Vanilla for all games) So be sure to think twice before diving deep into the Steam Workshop and mods

I recommend this game and I guess my cons are more (would like to have) than actual problems."
13222,"I wish I could vote neutral, the game allows you to do pretty much anything you can think of, from complex suspensions to fully automated farms, it's really enjoyable with friends , but the game can't handle either of those 2.

I started a save with 4 friends and we made our home base at the mechanic station (like everyone else lol) , game was running fine, things were going smootly but then every one wanted a car, when they were simple and didn't had many things (not even a suspension) it was ""fine"",  but when we started to progress in the game it started to lag, and it never stops, only get worse, at first it was pure fps drops, then some rubberbanding , now we reached a point that suspensions simply stop working all together and contraptions starts having seizures even on top of the lift.

I wish the dev team could focus more in optimization before adding more stuff into the game."
13223,scrap
13224,its amasing
13225,"I love this game, axalot really knows what they're doing with this game. The physics bearings and pistons allow for so much creativity with your builds, and every game mechanic has so much thought behind it. Farming isn't some boring waiting game, you have to focus on protecting your crops and defending them with walls or spinning sawblades or maybe even spudguns (if youre rich enough). Farming brings out your inner mechanic, it compliments creativity perfectly. And this isn't even the final version of the game. If you're on the fence about buying this game i think you should make the purchase, the graphics are great gameplay is great replay-ability is great, you can pick up stuff from miles away for some reason and that's great, when farmbots get hit by moving objects sometimes they ragdoll which is great, and you get to shoot stuff with potatoes. its great!"

13235,"Start with the bad: Updates are slow, still no mod support, and bugs take a while to be fixed
The good: There is no other game that offers the survival and creative experience of this game. You have nearly infinite possibility and if you already enjoy other sandbox style building games then this is the game fore you."

13267,"Update 2021-03-17
New content comes out way too slow. Cannot recommend as a product.

Original review:
There's an okay base here for co-op. Very grindy and unrewarding singleplayer experience. Mods may or may not fix that in your case, so a cautious recommendation.

PS On that note: wait until official mod support is included for Survival! Workarounds break."

13278,great game would recomend :)
13279,"Scrap Mechanic is a fun and neat little game. While I do generally recommend the game, the following are some gripes I have with the Survival mode, being an avid Survival game enthusiast. If you want this game for Survival, read ahead to make your decision.

- First and foremost, whoever thought the ability to revive your friends should be inaccessible until mid-game is a complete loon, especially when you have to travel so much and so far to get the materials in the first place. To elaborate, the only way to revive your teammates is to make an expensive cooking station, then make a ""Revival Baguette"" which is a one time use revival consumable.

- Food and Water is a hassle. Do yourself a favor, farm as much corn as possible and... no you don't eat corn silly, only cows eat corn! Place all your corn in front of one cow, go take a bathroom break, and then horde as much milk as possible. No cows nearby? Just starve or dehydrate over and over, especially if you're just hanging around base. Oh and want to drink water? Too bad, water is undrinkable for some reason. Everyone hydrates themselves off fruit juices and udder suckling.

- The raid system is absolutely silly. Especially early game, there's no way you can defend a farm perfectly from a raid without cheesing it somehow. Just throw down 9 crop plots and use those 9 plots to bump you up in between milk chug sessions.

- Combat is dumb, just taking shots at each other until someone falls. I get that most of the late game content involves guns and what not, but you have no easy access to that early game and have to rely on the attrition based combat. There's no dedicated dodge or block.

- What happens when you take your truck out looking for something like Ember or Cotton, then get blind sided by a robot? You spawn back at your spawn point with 1/4 Health, food, and water. Good luck getting back to all your stuff if you haven't stored a liquid tonne of milk.

The over all idea of the Survival mode is a really great concept, but the mechanics either fall  short, or are so far from what would be considered standard that it can easily get frustrating. The game is much more than just a survival game, but seeing how the Survival gameplay seems to be at the forefront now, with sandbox and challenges just there now to add a testing, learning, and sandbox environment. Because of this, I will mark this as a ""Do Not Recommend""."
13280,
13281,dfag
13282,fun but its need alot of fixes
13283,i boi and pe me get sad boi :(
13284,survival is cool

13287,Very Fun
13288,ye
13289,Almost 500 hrs in think i might a refund... Great open world building game! cant wait to see whats coming in future updates!

13312,"Overall- Worth the money. You can play for hours in creative just building things and testing them. If you ever played that free Xbox 360 game ""Banjo Kazooie nuts and bolts"" this game has the same feels. Perfect game if you have an engineering mind and like to be creative. 

Survival was difficult for me at first, without instructions or a tutorial. I relied on Youtube to help me figure out the tips and tricks. There is also no difficulty option which can make it challenging for new players. Food and water are the hardest things to come by.

13328,If the devs deliver and add the things they say they will... This game will be incredible. It's already quite enjoyable.

13336,O
13337,its a really fun game and teaches u alot only thing i dont like is where the sprint and crouch button its to far for me to reach with my little fingers
13338,"The game has a lot of promise but can't be recommended in it's current form. Survival Mode is very bare-bones with very little challenge and is incredibly poorly optimized. Playing multiplayer (as the game is advertised) is not recommended because as soon as you have more than 3 vehicles (even basic, uncomplicated builds) causes the game to lag to the point where it is almost unplayable."
13339,early access so not a ton to do but if you like mine craft or no man's sky give scrap mechanic a try
13340,Very good game.You can build what you want.I like it! 5/5! :)
13341,"Yes this game is great! When you first start playing that is.... Game breaking lag, especially when playing multiplayer, ruins the experience. This game needs dedicated servers for multiplayer. After putting 100+ hours into two worlds, both worlds stopped spawing the enemies making it impossible to get some parts. And creations had to be limited while playing together to not crash. Couldn't really build a real base because it made too much lag when near it. Warehouses caused the game to crash a lot. I believe having a dedicated server that players could rent to host their worlds would solve a lot of the game breaking lag."
13342,"it good

13343,The game's great! I've loved it since I started playing!

13347,good game but it hurts my brain
13348,I like the gameplay and how much different creative ways you can build things.
13349,"Game is fun, the first few hours,
Then, after you build some stuff and advance a little, it plateous into the same stuff, rinse and repeat, over and over,
collect loot, survive, build a vehicle to do a specific task, then collect loot and so on...

Lacks some depth and stuff to do after a while."

13359,"enjoyed it with friends, I recommend it if you like building things"
13360,The game is just everything I wanted to do in Minecraft and voxel type games. Which was to design and create my own vehicles. It goes far beyond what I would want out of engine to create those things and even keeps the whole process very comprehensive. I would highly recommend if you've ever wanted the same out a game like this.
13361,"The best survival game ever, the game‚Äôs graphics are insanely good, even for a low ram pc, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good survival based game, and the creative mode just makes the experience more interesting.

10/10 stars for me"

i really want to like this game but i just cant"
13363,"This game hits that itch that other games just can't hit. that itch that means you made something someone else couldn't have even thought of. I think about how cars actually work when out on the road all the time now. The game has enough fun parts working that there is hours of fun to be had, even without an end in sight."

13373,"Alright, buckle in. This is an adventure of a review.

It all started several years ago. Early 2016. It was about a year after I had played Space Engineers for the first time, but it was not what I was looking for. Then, I had played Medieval Engineers, and I liked a lot of the mechanisms it had. I thought it was a cool idea to build functional machines rather than simply building structures like in Minecraft. But that game was filled with bugs and other struggles using the axles and joints, and has long since been abandoned.

Sad that it wasn't what I was looking for in terms of quality, I started to search for something similar.

A cute game popped up in my feed. Scrap Mechanic. It looked like EXACTLY what I was looking for. It looked like had new building mechanisms than I had ever seen before in sandbox games. It took two months of deliberation and debate on whether or not this early access game would be worth my money. Spoiler alert: [spoiler]It was. [/spoiler]

In humble beginnings, Scrap Mechanic had one play mode and one purpose: Creative Sandbox. And boy, it did a pretty okay job of it! The physics were very good despite being hilariously buggy. But what it did best was build machines. Basically any machine you can think of, you can build it. From complex fighter jets to simple little go-karts, silly looking robots to basic computers and simple games, [b]all[/b] of it can be created. At first, there wasn't much to do with it. Then they added explosives, so you could blow them up. 
The game wasn't perfect, by any means. It was a medium-sized, enclosed map or a flat, empty enclosed map to play in. There was no water physics or aerodynamics, and very little in terms of cosmetic variations. There was no destruction of objects. There really wasn't much to [i]do[/i]. You had to get creative to get beyond a game devolving into ""me build car and drive into you car"", and this is where the content creators and mod makers come in. This game started early with a dedicated community of youtube content creators. I have enjoyed many hours watching Scrapman and kAN gaming, and neebs gaming is another good one. The game has had endless content added my mod makers. They have added features like water and all the physics that goes with that, aerodynamics, every shape of block you can imagine (made out of any material you can imagine). I can't describe it all to you, because the scope of how much content this game can have is well beyond my feeble human consciousness. Other than that, the game relied entirely upon the creativity of the player to have any content. Until, of course, they started teasing survival mode features, and thus, the wait for Survival had begun.

Updates came sparcely, sometimes with several months in between. They added very little content and rather infrequently. They slowly stopped maintaining their own website. After a couple of years, the developers finally released a new game mode! Challenge mode.

A game mode, that I had no idea was coming, and didn't even ask for! That you could essentially play WITHIN THE SANDBOX MODE ALREADY. Challenge mode added a few extra things, most notably the giant orbs and switches that go with them and a couple different block types. These were only available in challenge mode. A mode that is not the mode that I have been waiting for. A mode that took a lot of time and effort to implement, when I thought the team was hard at work on Survival mode (I am sure they are separate teams and I know more hands does not always make work go faster, but I was angry so please forgive me.)

Challenge mode is actually really cool though, it's great to have a timed system in place where people can undertake your creative endeavor of a challenge without breaking any rules that you would probably try to enforce on creative anyway.

But it still left me wanting survival mode. More waiting. More silence. It was such a long and painful wait. Especially seeing other similar games go from an idea to a developed game, like Trailmakers, Raft, and other games which I cannot think of names right now because they are less memorable than these titles.

Eventually, YEARS later, Scrap Mechanic survival mode finally dropped. I eagerly installed it.

Boy, was I disappointed. It was a horrific buggy mess. Everything was poorly optimized, everything was buggy, and some things just didn't work like expected. It didn't have some features that were promised, such as customizable spud guns. It began to overload your server after about 10 days of playtime, making your framerate degrade forever and ever until you were fed up with playing on your server you worked so hard to build. I stopped disgustedly and didn't play it again.

...until two days ago! And boy, was I impressed! So many bugs have been squashed and wrinkles ironed out, they have corrected a lot of supply balance issues and optimized the heck out of it. It still has some issues of course, it does get pretty heavy in calculations when a couple of very complex machines collide, and I am still waiting for customizable spud guns. Heck though, it's what I was waiting for!

Now I find that I just [b]can't[/b] wait to play! I love building machines, the progression is fun, and the survival mechanics are good! A few things that bug me: Burgers don't quench my thirst, where's my custom spudguns, and why the heck is there no way at all to drink friggin' WATER?

Overall, definitely yes. This game has endless content and the tools necessary to let your imagination run wild. 

Thanks for listening to my life story revolving around Scrap Mechanic. 
Sincerely,
Kevin

13377,is fun is good and just check it out
13378,it is very fun
13379,"The game starts off okay, leading you to collect things from several boxes that are from a plane wreckage although once you do that. That's all there is to the game giving you a hint on what to except for a book that tells you how to use contraptions that you don't even know how to build. The game gives no sense of direction on what to and doesn't even provide a proper to tutorial on how to do stuff. 

I played for a total a 15 minutes, roaming the map not knowing what I am doing or where I am going. If a game can't explain to me how to properly play the game without pulling up a guide on the internet then it doesn't deserve my money."

13392,"For the sandbox survival game it's not bad! I would recommend playing this game you can play with friends and build anything like a rocket toilet,house,anything! for $20 it's not bad but I would recommend wait for a sale or something"
13393,"i like the freedom
"
13394,"It wouldn't load.

13403,aaaaaaaaaaaaa
13404,it is very very good
13405,"This game very entertaining it is very very very fun i 100% recommend this game and it's good in every way, And worth every single dollar!"
13406,"I have yet to play the creative mode but I can say the survival mode is pretty good. This game runs well but sometimes there a quick lag spike here and there. 
This game is worth the money if you can catch it on sale and if you have people to play with. 
I don't want to compare this game to Minecraft but I find it hard for this game to be as fun as Minecraft can be in solo play. 

I got this game because of the somewhat redstone like logic gate system that the game has and the fact that the game is supposed to use a custom game engine due to the fact that the developers got tired of using the OGRE render library. 

I see that there is a modding community but I have yet to get into it. 

I would buy this game if you can catch it on sale but I will not lie and tell you it has anything special that you can't find in some other crafting games."
13407,"Very good game, it takes alot of time but once you have the iteams to make the things you want its very fun"
13408,Its really fun and i'd recommend

13425,"Crashes a lot, but still a good game!"
13426,GREAT GAME
13427,good
13428,"OK, I like this game don't get me wrong, but it has a few issues. The main 2 I've seen is loading issues, and at least for me, it overheats my computer really quickly. Also, Survival mode can be incredibly annoying with how the hunger and thirst bars are programmed. They go down really quick. For the FPS and loading problem, the game crashed when loading multiple times, and when loading in the game lags a ton and and large machines also makes the game heavily chug. Finally, the overheating issue. Every computer is different, and my computer has 3 fans. After around 30 minutes, my computer gets incredibly hot and gets in danger of overheating. 
Tl;dr- Scrap Mechanic is a fine game, but the optimization is very poor. I'd wait for more updates."
13429,Worth it af
13430,da
13431,"I dont really like it, got boring really fast"
13432,super fun and creative!
13433,"a perfect game for creative persones
"
13434,"Epic game, but we need more story. games cool and its fun creating vehicles. but i really like the survival mode, but after you get the different guns you expirience you don't have any more objectives so i whould like more weapons and upgrades and more different warehouses or new ware house like buildings and more crops, but its still really fun and its a great game.

8/10"
13435,i love this game so much i want to play it every day
13436,"good game despite being still in beta and nowhere near full release
"
13437,"Excellent game! I started playing it with a friend in survival mode, it's super cool, we never got bored, and I spent hours playing it. I recommend it because you never get bored, I mean there is always something you haven't done and it's magic :D Great work from the dev team and one more message : keep up the good work !"
13438,Overrated. The game isn't finnished
13439,very epic pog game from a youtuber with 21 subs LETS GOOO
13440,very good :)

13443,"the new updates have really breathed life into this game. could still use a bit of work here and there, but the multiplayer works great, and the adventure is there. more history would be fun too!"
13444,Been playing this game for 4 years love it would recommend
13445,its good
13446,"awsome game build anything survival is great and creative is great but some might say glitches are annoying... i dissagree i love glitching around and bouncing around the map and flying and spegite mechankics

13447,Yes
13448,great game mostly survival
13449,download this and if you dont kow what to do ... mmm ... GO LOOK ON YOUTUBE !!!

13451,its good
13452,I AM ADDICTED TO THIS GAME!
13453,FUN
13454,You can release your creativity like no one's business.
13455,just dont fight farmer bots
13456,The vehicle/machine building is really cool/fun. The survival aspects are decent but not amazing. The combat could use a lot of work as it's pretty basic and kinda annoying. Had a lot of fun playing survival with my wife!
13457,"Good game, very fun to play, highly recommend."
13458,"I would give it a 4/5
1. It has great design.
2. The game play for survival still connects up with the creative game play.
3. There are aggressive robots, and it ties together with the lore perfectly
4. It has nightly raids.
The one thing that could use touching up is;
It has a high amount of grinding for a small reward, and the nightly raids are extremely tough for a solo at the start, and even in mid-game before getting the spud gun."
13459,yes
13460,nice game
13461,it gud
13462,epik
13463,good

13470,"Really fun game, reminds me of garry's mod with the wiring and stuff. i hope to see more of it, and more you can do. hoping for more optimization for it as well."
13471,"Very entertaining, it keeps you engaged 100% of the time, can't wait for new updates!"
13472,i wish we had turret guns

13476,"i like this game a lot
"
13477,"9,5/10"
13478,great 10 out of 10 perfect
13479,"This game can be challenging, but it is so much fun! Some of the enemies can be annoyingly tough; however, beating these enemies is a reward in itself. I struggled with figuring out how to build a vehicle at first, but once I figured it out, it was much more enjoyable."
13480,good game
13481,nice game and hyped for chapter 2 survival
13482,:)
13483,i loved it all
13484,i love this game cant wait for the chapter 2 update i want mineing so bad please dev make it happen
13485,gvfygfvgyjfgbbftrgfdgfx
13486,THIS GAME IS A GAME AND GAMES ARE EPIC
13487,Great game!
13488,"Before I ever played, I watched videos on Scrap Mechanic on  YT channels like Scrapman, Kan Gaming, Camodo Gaming, Moonbo, Durf, and John Bane. Even then I knew this game was right up my alley. 

At this point I've got over 250 hours in the game and I LOVE IT! Exploring the world, trolling the bots, coming up with new creations to solve problems, it's all so much fun. If you're into building games I'd highly recommend this."
13489,"It's an interesting game where you can hardly get bored. The overall experience is great but there is also a downside: the game can get laggy and glitchy
"
13490,Amazing just amazing the've made this game exceed the bar
13491,swag!
13492,"This is the best game I have ever played, you can see from my nearly 1000 hours over the past 4 years that this is a very enjoyable game and I can't rate it higher. This game is a game where you always learn new things and the first 5 or so hours of playing should teach you a lot. I wouldn't start a survival until you are confident you can. Another hing about survival, there is no over powered material or item like in other survival games, to make stuff you need a range of materials, I have 200 days on my survival and I havnt got the spud shotgun yet, this proved that survival is a slow paced gamemode and easy to beat"
13493,super fun to play with friends great physics for vehicles and things
13494,Good.
13495,just a great game for messing around great price point everyone should give this masterpiece a try
13496,nice
13497,best game i'v played on pc
13498,great game just wish the robots would stop take my wheels of my car
13499,Game is super fun and really addictive. Hours pass playing this game especially playing with friends.
13500,"Kewl game yes

13501,"this game is pretty good, build car mess up fix it, repeat"
13502,highly inventive and fun to just figure out.
13503,its a good game
13504,looks good executed poorly
13505,good game once you learn how to have the game work for you it is a blast
13506,This game is probably one of the best creative sort of building games i have ever played the engineering is awesome the building in this game is amazing and the survival mode is so fun to play and create your materials and the fact that you can play with friends is phenomenal.
13507,BEST GAME EVER
13508,Great game!
13509,gg
13510,"good game
"
13511,this game is amazing if you like creative/engineering games you will love this
13512,i played with a friend it was so funny
13513,So far it's pretty cool!
13514,This is great with the suvival mode and all the new challenges
13515,"They royally screwed this game up, which is probably why they're working on raft more than this. They need to stop working on raft and finish this game. Maybe take some inspiration from My Time At Portia, something other than this mess. 

Huge learning curve. Nothing is really explained or intuitive. Tried playing with my niece but she just got bored of it. You're stuck with a hammer until you sprint miles to find this guy who will trade you guns, or until you find this base that helps you make things. Had no idea I was able to pick up certain things until like 2 and a half hours in. There is no icon that says you can pick it up or how to, so you're left wondering which is which. The main items you need to build your vehicles have to be bought or made at certain bases, and you are unable to craft them. This is different level of ""Not hand holding"" to the point where it's just boring because you're spending hours trying to figure out how to do simple crafting. Just nonsense. Not sure why they took this approach. I was looking for something like My Time at Portia."
13516,Good game
13517,wee woo
13518,I LOVE THIS GAME
13519,i love this game
13520,very good game just wish i knew how to join my frends
13521,good game
13522,DER
13523,good game
13524,very epic
13525,good
13526,takes awhile to figure it out but once the do its a lot of fun.
13527,"The idea of the game is very nice and relaxing, but it also seriously need some reworking. My friends and I constantly have to restart the server due to increased lag and FPS drops during one hour of gameplay. My framerate goes from 120 to 40 after a while. Also, the lag is sometimes so unbearable, that we cannot even move.

Also when we reached the elevator to the warehouse, we placed the key, went in and guess what. Nothing happended. The elevator looked like it moved, but it never did. It was stuck. We never went into the building. We missed out on everything. Just because of this broken elevator. We tried multiple times through restarts by glitching ourselves out first. Yes, cause you can do that. And they still do not work. When we tried to return home, we could not even move due to the lag. And before you comment that my friends network is bad; it is decent. 

I think the lag comes from the immense amount of ""bot legs"" lying around. We find them almost everywhere. I am not a game developer, but I suppose a way of clearing these can be implemented in some way.

We still do a lot of goofy stuff and the gameplay is not bad at all. We do not however see much reason to enjoy a game where movement is so limited due to lag and the fact that the elevator we were so exited about, does not work.

I understand that the game is in Early Access, but things like this make it almost unplayable."
13528,"gud game, apofe

13529,game go brr
13530,"The game is not very intuitive, but once figured out it is actually fun to play."

13536,"Wanted for years, not dissapointed
"
13537,You can learn logic with this game and use your creativity an strategy.
13538,good sandbox game
13539,Good game still after all this time a bid laggy. But i do injoy the game is made and what we all can do. 2 player makes it all a nicer game to play in my opinion.

13551,get it just get it
13552,been scrappin for way too long...
13553,"My problem appears to be No DirectX 12 support by Scrap Mechanic? But I wouldn't know if that's not the case, since there is no support for this game...  I hope that Steam and 'Scrap Mechanic' are enjoying the $20 that they stole from me!"
13554,"good game
"
13555,"i was gifted this i havent seen any major bugs and its really fun 
"
13556,"well it has been on my wishlist for a while now but i finally got it
"
13557,Fun with crazy crashes
13558,"Has great cartoon graphics and survival crafting open world coop appeal but the game has no fleshed out multiplayer and relies instead on friends list invite only for anything cooperative, which I think limits the attraction for a title that combines these genres, and why I wouldn't recommend the game for anyone looking to play with strangers on a public server."

13562,DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
13563,Very buggy game
13564,Awesome!
13565,OK
13566,fun gameto play with friends
13567,"Seems like a great game till you discover most of your builds, very simple builds do not work which is caused by the poor physics. Want to build your own custom suspension and logically built steering? Nope!!!! Your vehicle will float in mid air and flip over or simply not turn, ever! Want to make your vehicle or chair spin like a SpinTop toy? Just add two blocks and a barring to a small shock and now your vehicle will turn like a tank on speed... Build a simple car and drive it near another simple car? Watch your frames go from 100+fps to 12fps or in some cases, CTD. 

Till the dev fixes the shock glitch/exploit, Do Not Buy. If you do not care and this issue is of no issue for you, then i say its a fair buy on sale but you will have to use exploits/glitches to get many builds to work and avoid simple builds that do not work."
13568,e
13569,"the most fun I have had in a while a nice creative game, without a boring survival mode"
13570,Great game. Unlimited posibilties
13571,bc yes
13572,"This game is really amazing and fun to play. I would not say that people who don't have much of an imagination should buy it. What you make in this game is limited by your imagination and the tools you have, with the edition of mods you have near unlimited tools, now all there is to test is your imagination."
13573,"this game is a blast to play. we have made several cars, by reusing the same wheels every time. still figuring out how everything plays, but it is a lot of fun to build little machines and explore"
13574,good game
13575,","
13576,The use of controllers and logic gates allows for some pretty cool inventions. Add mods and there's a looooooot you can do here.
13577,
13578,The best games I have seen for some time
13579,"Played this when it was still in early access/beta whatever. Was already a very fun game to play around in creative and build stuff, but I recently started playing again and the survival aspect of the game is really well made and gives so much more value to the game that I already enjoyed."
13580,"So I think this game overall is fun to play, it has a few things left to be desired for development, but it is still under development so I'm sure those things will come as time passes. 

My only con for this game so far:
- WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A BRIGHT WHITE LOADING SCREEN WHEN YOU OPEN THE GAME HOLY GOD MY EYES ARE BLEEDING. 

Look devs, I'm cool with CANCER loading screens, but 30 - 60 seconds of my eyes being assaulted it too much. Please fix the load screen."
13581,So fun you can download mods and make it even funner
13582,"this game is wicked
"
13583,"IT GOOD!
"
13584,NICE GAME
13585,i lick the creative comunity
13586,"Putting 70 hours into this game I recommend getting it. There is so much to do and its so much fun doing it. Its a great game with a friend, sadly I dont have any lol so the solo experience is pretty fun too. It does have some issues with frames drops when you have a lot of creations or items scattered everywhere so keep that in mind!
Game Rating 10/10"
13587,This game is good you should buy it i am not forcing but if you feel like you want it buy it have good day.

13590,The game is still in early development but the contents is already great i can't wait for the future potential that this game shows to finally pay off
13591,"Very fun, i love that their isn't much instruction, your just kinda, THROWN in, fun game. intresting controls."

13604,because yes
13605,Had this game since I could remember just waiting for survival to come out before I played it and once it did it was fun for a bit. I know they have a small team but they are working on it and all I can do is wait for more updates and content
13606,This game is great what can i say but 100% worth I go by the 1 dollar an hour rule i got this on sale for 13$ me my wife and my buddy were caught up at least 3 nights in a row till like 3 am it will suck you in and you will ask for more you can tell they have some cool plans for the future and a lot more stuff they want to do so buy it play it enjoy it support it and hope it keeps growing so you can come back to new shit :D

13617,"So far, there is zero direction in the game. You spawn in, you have a burning ship, I guess you are supposed to put it out? So you do, and it doesn't do anything except extinguish what little light you have. Took about 20 minutes of nothing but running between the lake and the ship to put them out. After you get bored doing that, you notice a sign that says you can farm. Some random text appears about it being unauthorized, and a long countdown started. I figured it would be when the shit is done growing, but nah robots spawned and destroyed my 12 crops. epic. Robots drop circuit boards, which you have no use for.

After running around for about 10 minutes, you come to this building with robots and a couple chests to loot, along with a master battery. OH. Ok you need to put it in the ship to power it. Maybe I was supposed to put the fires out idk. Put the master battery in the ship, you get a log book. Finally, a way to track what you are supposed to do. You powered the ship- next thing to do is go to the mechanic station... Queue 30 minutes of running, only to find out you need the master battery. Kill me. Run back to the ship, 30 minutes more. Can't take the master battery from the ship..... Kill me. I don't want to spend any more time running, so after looking around I realized there's actually a crafting bench and a lot of other stuff on the ship, if only there was indicators for it, or anything. 

Craft a seat, two wheels, an engine, and by then you have exhausted all the materials you got from over an hour of exploring. Trees are annoying and slow to hammer. Even more epic, you need to get a certain kind of material from robot arms, which is incredibly slow to obtain. After being faced with the shortage of materials after the time spent obtaining them, and not wanting to walk another 30 minutes to get more, I remembered I could spawn robots if I planted food. Planted some, timer appeared. 15 minutes of waiting later, three bots spawned, and gave me nothing I needed.

Faced with walking another 20 minutes to find some enemies or closing the game, I chose closing the game. Simply can't force myself to play any more."
13618,q
13619,"quite hard to learn, but very fun once you get into it!"
13620,I love this game. Very educational :)
13621,...
13622,"-Generally a good game, the survival is a little too grindy for my tase (but thats up to you)

BUT: 
-It need some serious optimization with lag produced by not connected entities.
-And the lag in multiplayer (as the one who joins, not the host) when you move to far away from the host is not great either.

Still recommendable, if these points get taken on in some future patches."
13623,"this game is like minecraft, without the blocky mobs, players, npc's and your builds. i will ask you this mojang, can you refine ores?"
13624,defsfesw
13625,m
13626,Super fun :D
13627,This game is pretty good solo but even better when played with others as many hands make light work.
13628,"it good game
"
13629,yes yes veri gud
13630,Nice idea and I like the physics. But why does it use 200 f-ing Watts of power?! That's a third of what a microwave uses to make popcorn! It's 70 degrees hot! ( I have a RTX 3060 Ti )
13631,its class
13632,"The game was updated and finally stopped overheating my computer. All the modes are good, but grabbing a couple of friends and screwing off together makes it so much more fun."
13633,Love it. Amazing game
13634,"cool game
"
13635,This game is sick! Good game but sometimes the physics can be a bit weird when its into multiplayer... But other than that you should buy this!
13636,I need more shapes!!!!
13637,its just awsome
13638,bang bus go brrrrrrrrr
13639,I don't like how the tape bots do more damage now tape bots are these robots that have an arm the shoots tape. but other than that it's really fun like Minecraft were you can build anything but there is MORE like logic gates and bearings Minecraft does not have these things so i think scrap mechanic is better.
13640,The game is great and I love survival but I just keep glitching through the world as soon as I run and need to wait for ages to die just so I can continue playing.
13641,"i've played the game for 327 now, 478 h on my other account. I've bought the game for each of my family members and they love it! Worth every cent it costs!"
13642,love the game but hate that when you stop or park your car or truck your build slides unless you weld it to the ground or put it on a lift
13643,epic idk
13644,IT IS GOOD GAME
13645,this game is worth the money 100/10
13646,the mechanics of the game are grate
13647,"Scrap Mechanic gives you so much Freedom,
you can build Pretty much anything and with Recent Updates to the Survival Mode the Game is just getting better"
13648,I have no regrets purchasing this game. Surely love it :D
13649,"Very good game, May take a mfew mins to understand But great Game!"
13650,Very good game!
13651,.
13652,"if you have a lot of patience and you are good a machanics and stuff like that then you could probably make a lot of realy cool stuff 
"
13653,Yes
13654,iss littttttt
13655,yee haw
13656,Still in early release it's be very enjoyable to play.  If you enjoy building games this is really well done so far.  I can only imagine they'll add more and more to the game as time goes on.
13657,"Nice sandbox survival game with cool building and mechanical aspects. Lasts for a while and is fun in multiplayer.
Currently very unstable with low fps and intense rubberbanding after you build a few vehicles.
I recommend but also stay away from big building or anything similar until it gets optimized."
13658,"the game is very fun
"
13659,nice
13660,every thing
13661,"Great game!  I love playing this especially with friends, the only negative i have is that some items are not accessible in creative but are in survival.  This game is great for a wide variety of people, and it feels great to play. the game has evolved A LOT since the days when I watched it on Youtube, and i do not regret deciding to buy it today at all, even in its early access state. 

Tldr: Great game should def consider buying

Reccomendation:
If it's not on sale you should definitely consider buying.
If it's on sale its a great purchase to make."
13662,soo fun with friends but the multiplayer is poorly optimized
13663,honestly i downloaded this because i saw that scrapman was having fun and this is indeed very fun
13664,"I love this game, once survival came out i put 50 hours in it on the spot, however once i tried multiplayer out, it was virtually unplayable for the player joining the game, the rubber banding was awful and it was impossible for the other people to drive any vehicles. Give this game a couple of months, up to a year and maybe it will be worth playing. Really a shame, the game has a loading screen with 2 people a male and female, yet what i did know was that the female wasn't able to move, drive, or play the game in survival.

(If you want to do creative with friends, the game runs perfectly fine, but survival does not)"
13665,Robot
13666,Great Game with friends
13667,this game is AWSOME!!!!
13668,honestly its a perfect game! but how do you fix the one glitch where i fall through the map or my car vanishes?
13669,.
13670,Great but thare is not crashing  ur pc bc u placerd to many bombs
13671,"good, only dislike is not being able to crash your pc with bombs"
13672,I liked all of the freedom to do what ever i want
13673,"Its just interesting. Great game to play in free time, but can get a bit hard at points. Like if you die over and over, then you lose your stuff, but you can't quit to cool off unless you know exactly where you stuff is."
13674,great game for just messing arround in creative or the survival is prety good too
13675,"Great Game, good community . Time for Moded"
13676,"it's a good game, really not as buggy as some players are making it out to be."
13677,It is good
13678,"I love this game. It's amazing, however there are some issues with it.

Pros:
Everything functions how it is supposed to, the devs are super nice. There really isn't much that can't be bad about the game so far

Cons:
There's only 2 bad things here, first off multiplayer is LAGGY.  I have never seen this kind of lag off a simple game like this, Raft even has better connectivity than this. Second thing here is mod installment.  I saw previously the devs supported modding by having mods go on the workshop, but you still had to do some funky file editing to make these mods possible.  The developers are going to have to step up their A game if they want a bigger following in terms of their mod area and muliplayer capacity.  We only have maybe 4 people on at a time and it's rough as it is, we don't have mods but we have changed some functions such as how many totebot heads spawn since they produce so much lag being placed in the world.

Overall this game is great, but the lag from multiplayer and the inability to easily install mods hurts my views on it.  Would I recommend this game? Absolutely, but I would leave warnings like this when I have to, it's not a stable game and the devs should fix that before taking it out of Early Access."
13679,this game is great and theres so much to do with all the different blocks and other things. The posibilitys are endless
13680,scrap mechanic is amazing
13681,Keeps crashing when I start playing.
13682,pretty fun
13683,ya it good
13684,its really fun
13685,it fun like minecraft and it is creative game but i just want survivel not to be lagy
13686,"Its a pretty good game but There needs to be more stuff in the game, PLEASE add More items pzzz>>
"
13687,great game
13688,Progression feels painfully slow and the in-game sound is far too low.
13689,i love survival
13690,o ma gaaaaaaaaa so epiiiiiiic love scrap mech love axalot love raft epiiiiiic
13691,very good
13692,Fun game and all. but the lag destroys it. as soon you start playing with bearings and pistons it's dead
13693,yaat
13694,mindblow: the game
13695,Only play with friends. Game is fun but lacks end game content.
13696,mmhm
13697,"Amazing game, challenges your creativity a lot. If you can imagine it, you can build it. I would seriously recommend playing this game to any creative players out there who play stuff like Minecraft."
13698,It a grate game with some fun mechanic and freedom
13699,"This game is amazing and its execution is great! It gives you a chance to show your creativity (while having none) It may have bugs here and there but its amazing anyway! Try it out :D
"
13700,good
13701,its way better than trailmakers!!
13702,"The idea behind the game is good but as i mentioned in a lot of games this also lacks optimization, the game has enormous lag spikes out of nowhere and the updates are slow af.

I did not play this game in a long time but i'm not surprised with the updates"
13703,This game is something else. It feels like Raft but on land. It's incredibly addictive. knowing that you could possibly build something that works so freaking well. I've build many vehicles and I think I've piqued but then I get an Idea and make something even better. There is honestly no limitation on what you can build. Crazy fun game especially with friends!
13704,Great Game!!!  Like Minecraft kicked up a notch!!  Very fun!!
13705,"I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It starts out simple, walking you through the basics of building your first creation, and lets you go anywhere from there, with the only limit being your computer's power. From the most basic of wheeled vehicles to the most complex of flying aircraft, this game handles it all. Factoring in the ""Logic Block"", programs can even be created. I have found that the basic ""And"", ""Or"", and ""Nor"" functions actually help not just in this game, but also in the real world, providing an amazing educational value in this already amazing game."
13706,"really enjoying the game.  the building system in this game has a lot of possibilities and make me wonder how crazy these inventions can get. 
Resource gathering is pretty balanced. There are times I wished more robots would spawn because I am too lazy to go hunt. But like many survival games. its a problem that gets solved in the late game after you get better equipment.

My only complaint is that there is no way to host a dedicated server. We have a spare PC for Server hosting purposes. But are currently forced to have a friend leave his PC running while his character stays knocked out.

I am currently waiting for him to return from the store so he can re launch because his game crashed, and we got booted out :("
13707,it s fun
13708,"Overall is a good game to play, it can exploit your creativity potential. However, the downside is it does not have a complete water physics as I could not operate my DIY boat on the water."
13709,n
13710,"I got bug so many time
"
13711,e
13712,"hmmmmmmmmmmm yes
very good game. i have played 350hours"
13713,it rlly fun
13714,this is just yes
13715,Could be better.. But good
13716,"great game, can have a laugh in challenge mode, can create cool new things. i do find the bots attacking the farm a interesting and fun concept but can be annoying when you start with no food and need the farm. 
needs more content though as its currently just a farm and build cool new toys to keep farming. missions or unlocks, progression of some kind would make the game alot more fun and worth continuing to play"
13717,look at my hours that explains
13718,dawdada
13719,yeehaw nascar brother.
13720,"can't gift this game to friends in usa, ( i'm from canada)  stupid AF crap."
13721,"Great game in general. I have been playing even before they introduced an inventory, and even through all the updates, it has only gotten better.

11/10"
13722,very good
13723,"Extremely fun game if you are into this sort of thing. And by ""this sort of thing I mean testing yourself, pushing yourself. Toying around and see what does/doesnt work and then making adjustments to fix it. And even if you know in and out how something works you can go completely off the rails with a creation and make a pointless cube that spins out of control and bounces all over the map just to make yourself laugh. 

The only downfall to this game is the survival mode which is no doubt fun in its own right but I have come across too many crashes, too many bugs that just ruin the experience. And there's just flat out nothing to do in survival except just that, survive. I know that sounds like a no brainer but theres nothing else to it and its a limited size world. In essence what im saying is that if I want to play a survival game with creation elements, Ill play minecraft because exploration to me is a big deal.

Note: The survival world is large [i]enough[/i] but not infinite. And maybe thats just me personally feeling this way but it does affect my feelings on it regardless.

All in all this game was something I knew was going to be fun but didnt know just HOW fun it was going to be.

9.5/10"
13724,verey gud fus.
13725,i love it BUT WE WERE PROMISED CUSTOMIZABLE SPUDGUNS NOT SPUDDLING GUNS AND SPUDSHOTS I WANT A SNIPER SCOPE ON MY SPUD GUN
13726,it is rile good
13727,very fun and funny me and my freinds had a right laugh
13728,"This game has a lot to offer.  The game is really fun and pushes you to the max.
The game also supports modding which introduce so much to the plate.
I really enjoyed this game, hope you do to.

13735,After the survival update.This game is epic.
13736,I LOVE this game. I reccomend if you want a game that reminds you of playing with lego as a kid. I will buy my friends this game so they can play with me. I only have 20 hours played but so far I am loving it.

13738,lots and lots a creativity involved love it :) <3

13759,A fun adventure + building game!
13760,very good and interesting game. Looking forward for  updates to survival mode
13761,"I really enjoy this game. Its nice to kick back and play with friends. I don't like the early access excuse for games to be released unfinished, but this game has a lot to do in its current state and knowing that there is so much more to be added is great. There is a couple lag issues when loading areas, and depending on your specs it will vary on its intensity. 
One tip I have is to not waste your scrap metal. Spend it on the bare minimum until you have a working car and drill because it will feel super grindy having to find, kill, and refine dozens of bots and you could have saved hours.
8/10
"
13762,"Very solid game
"
13763,give this game another couple months to year and it will be great.
13764,Big Epic Game
13765,GREAT!
13766,Super Fun!
13767,i love building robots
13768,It is very easy to learn and it is fun to play.
13769,"This game got boring quickly, id reccomend not buying."
13770,"There is so much to say about this game. positive and negative.. 1) with this game, you can basically do anything. but in vanilla i could say otherwise. very few iterations of blocks, like, scrap wood and wood block 1 make sense, but the only upgrade between wood 2 and 3 is there are metal supports, and it looks like garbage. that is just one example. another thing is that the paint tool isnt that good. you cant get a good orange color, or brown color. there should just be a color slider or something where you input custom colors with color codes. 2) Survival mode ruined the game, but also helped the game. One of my favorite mods, which adds more wood blocks, is COMPLETELY glitched because of this update. it seems like all of the good mods were abandoned by the developers. but survival gave this game a nice character customization system. except for the fact that you have to unlock stuff in survival just to get an outfit that isnt torn up and looks terrible. unless you want to run around in your underwear. then you can do that if you dont like clothes 3) lag. it doesnt matter how good of a pc you have, this game is gonna lag. too many bearings, too many controllers, etc etc. its really difficult to make a good car with custom suspension that doesnt completely glitch out when driving on land. because when you have too many bearings on your creation, things will LAG. A LOT. and also, its really annoying when your game lags because you have to vehicles collide. you cant have a truck and trailer haul a vehicle without running at 20fps. its a good game, but there are a lot of things that need to be fixed. it is ""early access"" so i cant complain that much."
13771,"good game
"
13772,would recomend
13773,"it's fun, and survival is fun as well"
13774,"This game is a mix of fun and frustration ( and a lot of it ) ,  Is a nice game with great potential but is kinda abandoned by the dev team ( hope the new devlog changes things )

The FUN part :
Start your farm , gather resources and build your vehicles ,exploration, get your first potato gun and kill your first robot boss.  

Building all kind of vehicles , engines controllers and logic gates open the doors to a wold of creations

The FRUSTRATING part.

In almost a year and a half the game barely received any significant update.
The grinding is terrible ( got better now as clams have more drop , engines don't consume so much and you have oil fields )
The cities are a complete letdown , one empty building after the other , no significant drop ( if any )
The warehouse , a never ending maze with robots that can kill you in one hit ( sometimes after you open a vent and have no time to do anything ) your backpack with all your stuff can disappear leaving you empty handed ,  also no significant drop.
There are zones in the map were your vehicle vanishes under your feet and re-appears 100 mts in front of you ( very fun if a boss is chasing you )
Your world can crash into an unrecoverable file. ( make a copy every time you play )
Game also crashes from  time to time ( No I don't have a potato PC )
You cannot destroy or turn into raw materials stuff.
You have NO MAP , recently devs added ""the signal"" that is pretty much a device the size of a refrigerator and is very useful to mark locations but not to put it on a vehicle or boat."
13775,Very good for people who like machines. A good game to sit back and chill to.
13776,Nice
13777,"ITS AWSOME

13778,its da good kinda and not bad

13787,t
13788,"Very Fun, Good game lots of fun to be had. Little hard to start and get use to but once used to that great game."
13789,"Great game overall still a lot of bugs to fix and optimizing to do but what do you expect from a game that is in early access? 

Survival mode

Again great game i love creating vehicles to do work for me in survival. It's everything it looks like in the videos and more! Does require grindy work but after you make things to do stuff for you it's a lot easier. Finally, it helps to research things to figure out what to do and how to do it.

Creative mode

This game is super fun to make vehicles in, you can always add more features to everything you make. In creative you can design things to build in your survival worlds or make things for the fun of it. The possibilities are truly endless.


final thoughts:
Great game, amazing developer team can't wait for the next update! completely worth the price."
13790,Very good game. There is a lot of stuff to do and discover. The only problem I have is when you import big creations they tend to be very laggy.  Overall a very good game though. 5/5
13791,"while detail is important for good creations, it is a great game to just do whatever you want to do"

"
13812,"Getting lost while finding stuff to bring back with you because you haven't built a beacon is survival games for me in a nutshell. I still need to get better at base building but thankfully I don't have to. You see making stuff that moves and functions out of all the scrapped stuff you find in the world is the name of the game. There may not be a whole lot in exploration but at least there's enough stuff to do to keep you busy. I have not finished the game at all as you can tell. But I know when a game is good. If you can restart your save to try not to forget the battery this time, and still have fun... It's a good game. Fun is all that matters. Just watch out for the lag. That's the enemy of fun. But fun can overpower it sometimes."
13813,"I have played this game a lot on my second account and I have to say quite an amazing game still in 2020 however there looks to still be no tutorial in game so you have to watch either youtube to learn or try your best to learn it yourself

However when you do fully learn the game mechanics it is a very fun game solo and with friends

13819,"For the price this game is more then worth it! The FPS sure drops when you get too many or too big of creations in, Also one minor complaint is that doors are annoying to make its not a simple thing you need to use multiple things just to make a door but its minor, Honestly my most favourite part about this game was the creative mode it was just fun to mess around with things and when you add a couple of friends in the game it is super fun!"

13875,"This game has a lot of potential for a cartoony survival game.  But I am left wanting to build so many things.  There is a huge grinding curve to get supplies.  The NPCs are overpowered.  It takes a lot of farming to ""earn"" money.  yes food products are cash in this game."

13900,"Boring. There is only two things to do in game - farm and protect farm. Only handful of mob and less minecrafty.
Game is also broken and empty. Its as if it combined factorio reduced it to 20% took minecraft reduced it to 20% took all those farming simulator and reduced it to 20% and  poor attempt at Garry Mod and rest mixed bag and failed at all of it.


Maybe when they add more content it will be good. This is not scrapmechanic its FARM Fight the Bot mechanic."

13918,good but survival mode on game is cool too i love this game :D
13919,"SCRAP MECHANIC IS AWESOME

Only 10 hours or so in I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! This game is a fantastically well made Minecraft-like building game, I don't have any issues with this game other than the obvious lag issues when you load MASSIVE workshop builds. This issue is partly due to my sorta average computer and also the fact that I was trying to load hundreds of thousands of blocks. Other than that minor issue which won't apply to the average player this game is awesome, the new survival mode is very fun as you evolve your vehicles slowly and it doesn't feel like a grind especially if you have a friend with you. This game has  a very fair price in my opinion and there is all sorts of challenges and updates to come. After you get bored of the core game after a LONG time, you can even install mods and configure certain new items into your builds. This game has been immensely improved over the past 4 or so years since I first watched it, this game clearly is a very good game for content if you own a Youtube channel. Other than that I don't have many other opinions on it.

TLDR: very fair price, so much to do and mods to add if you get bored (somehow),  the new survival mode and challenge mode provide many nice singleplayer experiences along with multiplayer if you want, hours of fun a little laggy if you try to load in some workshop items."
13920,i love this game even though i have only played it fort 8 hours but it will take soome gitting useto the new controls but overall i think that scrap mechanic is a good game
13921,"Its really nice to play this game with friends, It lags a good bit with others tho. The more stuff added to the games makes it harder to run so i hope multiplayer gets better soon."

Now, it has a survival mode that's not even good. It's a shame because it used to be a really fine game, honestly. Now, I wouldn't recommend it for 20 euros, it's really expensive. If anyone wants to buy it so bad, I would suggest him to wait for a big sale or something."

13992,I think it's a game with a great future but the reality is different - I bought this game for myself and my son and once we installed and he joined me the game crashed (host) within 5-7 minutes. I initially thought to get a refund but decided that I will wait 6-12 months and will try to play again.
13993,"is game, is fun"
13994,"this is a very cool game. I saw youtubers like Srcapman and Kan Gaming play this game and it looked fun, and interesting and it was funner than I thought it would be."

A bit annoying at times and a little buggy but not nearly as buggy as some other games I've played. Feels pretty polished for an early access title, and I feel that whats here is definitely worth $20.

14062,"I have not played this game for a while because I did not know that they had a survival mode, I tried it and I was surprised at how fleshed out and the complex survival mode can be. I recommend this to everybody who wants to use their brain in a creative way and feel rushes of dopamine when you horrible monstrosity of a creation does exactly what you want it to do. And you can share your disaster of a pretend vehicle with your friends! If you have any!

New wheels, the current wheels in the game are cool and do their job, but wider/larger wheels would let people make larger builds (Monster trucks especially) 4. DONT make vacuums shoot TNT, it removes the creative aspect of the game. 5.Add oil tanks and lighters, the flammability of blocks is almost never taken advantage of, and making it so I can light nearby blocks with a weak flamethrower (weak so it isn't too OP, as i said, ruin the creative aspect) would be cool, and give us things like flaming catapults! That's what I have for ideas"

If I ever win the lottery, the first thing I'm going to do is buy these guys out and hire more engineers so they can overhaul the physics engine.  This game could easily be the next Minecraft IMO"

14124,"This game have loads of potential.

(machine goes brrrrrr)"
14125,Yes
14126,"This game is... acceptable, but I wouldn't recommend it in its current state. I'll update this review when I find the game has changed.

Much of the content is unpolished, we get infrequent updates(blog posts and actual game updates), and many mods got broken at 0.4(survival release).

Positive things:
1. The concept of the game and the execution of the basics of the concept
2. Mod support
3. Blueprints
4. MULTIPLAYER
5. Physics glitches(sometimes funny, often annoying)

Negative things:
1. Severe lag when medium-large creations collide
2. Physics glitches(sometimes funny, often annoying)
2.1. Sometimes, things traveling fast enough with high enough momentum/inertia can glitch through other parts of creations.
3. Mod support keeps getting broken
3.1. Few high-quality mods exist
3.2. Mods keep breaking
4. Survival mode took way too long to release and is VERY unpolished.
5. Survival mode doesn't support mods, creative mode worlds can't be infinite

Keep in mind that this review is about the current state of the game, it's not intended to hate, and will be updated when I find it necessary.

Edit: 0.5.0 released, which hopefully should improve creative mode by implementing some creative mode features. I don't have the time to mess around with the new features, but when I do, I'll update my review if I find it necessary."
14127,"LOTS of issues, but Early Access be like that. Still very annoying to try and play. Controls stick, Bad collision, buggy physics, and survival mode leaves you off from the start saying ""What am I even supposed to do?"""

14138,"Before the global update, which is associated with the addition of a survival mode, I played this game for over 100 hours, But after it came out I played this game For a maximum of 2 hours I believe that the graphics of foliage and grass were completely sold.
Despite the fact that I play at medium settings, everything floated in the game and I stopped it I like even the appearance I just want to return the old optimized graphics.
Well, if you have wanted a game for a long time, then those changes that were added in the recent update will not seem strange to you, and therefore I recommend this game and put 8/10 for gameplay and 6/10 for graphics."

14144,good game
14145,very cool
14146,its fun
14147,"Survival mode is quite fun as it is totally up to you as to what you wanna do. Also, there are many mods that help make it not so grindy."
14148,"If you like creative play, this is awesome"
14149,yes
14150,this game is one of the best games ive ever played! you should buy it! plus i want other friends who play the game ;w;
14151,great game
14152,yes
14153,"this game is even ok but why is there so much lag when you read it then fix these bugs, but the game itself is fun."
14154,very good :)
14155,Great game its a more technical minecraft but a lot funner.
14156,"too boring single, You should buy this only if ur not a fortnite kid or a antisocial, wait thats the same thing. Btw good game"
14157,"Super fun game, a bit hard to get stuff to work but when you do damn you will love it"
14158,perfect
14159,if you like minecraft but want more freedom for making vehicles and other things then this is tha game for you
14160,love it it. the mechanich function like a less complicated redstone but a much higher usefullnes
14161,"Ok, we need to talk. 

Why can't I eat the corn? Are we some special race of things who are allergic to corn? Why can't I drink from my bucket of water? Am I Gwyneth Paltrow, so the bucket is below my standards, I would rather die than drink from it? Cows explode into confetti, ok I'll accept that. It's realistic. Robots that shoot potatos, I understand being shot with a potato would hurt, but why does it kill me in 2 potatos? Why does the potato robot have the aim of the top snipers in the world? 

Why?"
14162,"While Scrap Mechanic is an early access game, it is arguably already more polished than a large number of AAA games. The co-op multiplayer nature of this game is exceptional, designed to be enjoyed with friends, and the survival is both challenging and not overbearing.

I am excited to follow updates to this game, and hopefully see the development of a story line and where this can go."
14163,Good game and fun.
14164,use your imagination! i recomend this game for all early mechanics
14165,This game has bad grapics and lags way to much this is not  a reacomended game
14166,If you don't trie this your gay
14167,I LOVE THIS GAME
14168,ITS SO MUCH FUN
14169,i would not recommend it because i haven't really got much into the game but over all its great plus not that many people are into my interests.
14170,cool game
14171,Loads of fun.  Huge world with lots to explore and learn.
14172,very pog and relaxing game fun would play for 50 more hours but this revive is boring so byeeeeeeeeeeeee
14173,This game is so Awesome i waited so long for survival and now i can play survival mode.

14182,THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTIVE
14183,VEry gUd
14184,"The concept of the Game is great, and I want to love it, but i can't.

TLDR; Takes forever to get resources, and creating vehicles that are not low end and wheel based are beyond the grasp of a younger audience, while also complicated enough that most will not find the creative freedom that they are looking for.

     The survival mode is very limiting when it comes to resource management. By itself, this isn't the biggest issue. I've played plenty of games where grinding was a necessity. The problem comes in when there is Garry's Mod's level of difficulty when trying to create advanced contraptions. realistically, the only vehicle that will work in this game is one that is based off of using wheels, or from someone who is willing to put hours into making a vehicle and has a greater level of comprehension regarding physics and mechanics.

As much as I hate to say it, unless you are in the 1% of players, You will not be able to build what you are dreaming of, or even something of a greater than mundane level in survival mode."
14185,"funner with friends, haha car go brr"
14186,very epic poggers game
14187,Great creative game
14188,Simply amazing. Both creative and survival are equally great. The idea of building wacky contraptions to kill robots is great. I just simply cannot explain how great this game is. You just need to get it and find out for yourself what amazing fun this game is. As you can see from my time played i'm simply addicted to this game. 10/10 - Masterpiece
14189,soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun
14190,IDK it is fun
14191,"It's a very good sandbox game, and the survival mode is awesome too! Recommended"
14192,Just a great game in general
14193,"decent game, gets a bit boring after a while probably not worth the money but anyways."
14194,its GOOD!

14202,idk
14203,gyigig
14204,"It is a great game, with a lot of potential - but there are still some quality of life updates left before it's really a masterpiece. As it is, the creative part of the game is pretty great - but survival can still be pretty unsatisfying for some people, since there's no real alternatives to progress in the game; Making a farm, building a base around the farm, and working your way up to better weapons is the only feasible option: if you want to be a nomad or a scavenger then you're out of luck... for now."

14210,"i just got this but i dont want to give a reivew but other wiys its super fun
"
14211,the game is good
14212,"This game is a Masterpiece! It took a while for survival to be released but I was playing before survival came out. The physics are a little weird sometimes but can make for some really funny co-op sessions. The overall game is amazing. The graphics are nice. The Possibilities are endless. Community content holds some unique surprises and the game even has mod support! Creative allows for amazing creation building, however some survival and challenge parts are not in creative. In challenge mode you can test your skills to overcome challenges both by the devs and by the steam community, and in challenge builder you can create your own! In survival you must survive in a world of rebellious robots designed for farming using a large amount of items and contraptions to aid you. Overall I rate this game 10/10. Thank you everyone at Axolot for making this charming game!"
14213,"it a  fun game so ceck it out
"
14214,oof you can make weird things like betwoot car and toilet mobile
14215,make car and go brrrrrr
14216,"This game is a world of things it got so much thing it sooo good 


Online:The online mode is so fun when you and your friend play to gev you can build and fight (pvp and pve)


building:The building is grate you can make what you want it so fun and you can make planes cars helis and more



Thanks for taking your time to read this review it was no a long one but a good one for what i think is no need to update well still update for you game to get beter."

14223,"I like this game.
"
14224,"it is a lot of fun. It certainly helps to do the challenges first and read the handbook, but it is totally doable even if you are not the most prolific gamer. The world is fun and exciting, survival mode is appropriately dangerous (but not totally devastating, since you get your stuff back. That is always so frustrating in other games....) 
It totally challenges you concerning the mechanical builds, but even if that is not your thing you can enjoy yourself a lot. Best played with friends!"
14225,It is very good. I would like it if tape bots won't hurt so much.

I wish I could refund this game, it sounds really good on paper but if you actually try to build anything more than a simple machine it just breaks the whole game.

Could not recommend to anyone."

It's a Sandbox Survival game where you can fight robots and build structures and cars. I've been playing it since before survival mode, and I can tell you that it's gotten even better than it was before and before survival it was amazing, now it's better."

14254,It a good game and enjoy playing this with my nephews. It feels like a good game but still feels not complete (what it is not). I think it needs a bit more interaction with others in multiplayer. Be cool to have competing teams against each other. Still got to learn a lot about it as well.

14276,survival is gud
14277,nice
14278,"Only good if you hack the game file to remove the shity always online DRM.

my internet is dogshit, and I bought this game for the SOLO play when my internet is failing, which is very often.

But nop, the dev made this game to exclusively check every minute or so if you are still connected to internet through steam, otherwise it just kick you out.

I want a refund but cannot get one, even though i only have less than a hour of gameplay because i bought the game a long time ago.

yep, can't play if you dont have a stable internet.

very disappointed in the dev, being forced to play a torrent version of a game you purchased because the torrent version actually fucking let you play it.

You are not stopping piracy, you are promoting it you dumbass."

14290,"Scrap Mechanic is an interesting game. You can create cars, houses, or basically anything you want in this game. This game also has a workshop where you can download other people's builds and use them in your game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to build stuff like cars or robots."
14291,this game is good could use some crass updates but all in all its a great game
14292,"it is like minecraft on steriods 1000000000 x better

14293,10/10 very great game
14294,i love this game the farm bots and iv'e been playing this game for a long time and there's only one tote bot that's disappointing but i rated this game for one reason i think Axolot Games should add what happend before the robots went haywire or what is was like with the farm bots
14295,Pog dwarf sim 7/10
14296,very nice
14297,"this game is very good
"
14298,"I. Love. This. 
But please remember that this is an early acces game, and i personally experienced some bugs like my entire vehicle randomly going through the ground, getting thrown out of seat and getting launched to skybox for no reason, and the craftbot screen on the model looking fine i one orientation, but completely broken in the other orientation, even though the list doesn't go on.
But because of this, I still recommend, like ScrapMan said, that you should make a copy/ backup your world before every play session so you don't lose your world forever if a bug throws you out of the map or something.

I still Enjoy playing it SO MUCH though, and if you are wondering if you should or not buy it, just do it. It has so much content already, and its not even halfway through development! and price will probably go up when chapter 2 comes out so yeah just do it.

but in all honesty it's really fun, and it's worth the money"
14327,"Such a excellent game freedom wise. In creative mode you can do whatever you want, with no restrictions at all. 
I like how i have access to other creators builds and how you can share your own creations.
This game can really spark your imagination!
From the sandbox mode to survival is amazing. vast majority of building objects that let your imagination run wild
Totally worth downloading.
The only issues i have ran into is excessive lag in multiplayer with two or more creations getting too close."
14328,"--Before Survival Update--
Overall, Amazing Game. Modding Community Is Great, Many Billions Of Unique Possibilities To Make Things, I've Had Many Many Hours Of Fun With This Game. Wholeheartedly Recomended, Most Everything Is Solid And Waiting On Survival Mode!

--After Survival Mode--
Changed Menus Made Them Worse. Changed Characters Made Them Worse. Killed My Most Played Mods. Multiplayer In Creative Now Requires NASA Grade Computer For Everyone To Even Exist. My favorite Creations Were Killed By Controller Connect Errors. Many Mods Completely Different And Worse. Overall I Would Never Recommend This Game In It's Current State, They Tried To Make It New After The Update And Ruined The Charm It Had."
14329,"i have been playing this game for about 2 months now and im already being sucked into the game its so fun! 
great game and i recommend it to everyone!!"

14347,thumbsup
14348,"It very gud.
"
14349,"In my opinion, this game is extremely overrated. I'll try to break my reasoning down in a few organized categories- 

No end-game (and overall lack of content):
Everything in the game is accomplished through the same 10-20 resources (the only ones in the game). You will essentially have access to every single resource right off the bat, so there is no character progression whatsoever. In minecraft, for example, you need certain resources to get other resources. Wood -> cobblestone -> iron-> gold / diamond. In scrap mechanic, you have a sledgehammer, and that is what you will use to do everything there is to do. Played survival with my buddy, and we realized after an hour and a half, ""this is all there is. We have done everything there is to do, and now all that's left is farming wood and metal for forever to upgrade the integrity of our blocks."" 

As an afterthought, I'd like to add: there are only three enemies in the entire game. Two basic robot mobs, and a boss-like robot. They're all on land, and all have an extremely limited move-set. The sea and sky are completely desolate. Nothing to fear, nothing to find (except oil and glue), nothing to explore.

No specialization:
The idea of the game is cool, but it doesn't do anything well. The building system is nice, but not even close to being on the same level as, say, Trailmakers. People who say ""if you can think it, you can build it"" here, have obviously never played that game - it is far more friendly, in-depth, and versatile. If you want this game for the ability to make cool contraptions, play that game instead. The crafting system is cool, but there isn't nearly enough content. If you like the survival aspect, and want to make a cool base, play minecraft. There's leagues more content to enjoy. 

Very buggy, and abandoned:
The game is plagued with bugs, and overall seems abandoned. Nothing major has been added since release besides survival mode, but that comes as a given in every other game available today. The devs are working on other projects. Every so often they tease their next release, but don't add anything substantial - maybe come back in another five years and see where it is."
14350,good game to kill time with
14351,"Fun game really fun game. Let's get into detail
Pros:
-Really cool creative gamemode(could get boring if you don't have any mods)
-The New Survival gamemode comes with great updates and is a new idea when it comes to survival gameplay
-Really cool community, can help you build or find new ideas for your survival/creative world
Cons:
-Game could get really laggy when using mods in creative and in survival it gets laggy when leaving refineable items on the ground that may cause you to lose your save :[
-Some moveable interactives such as pistons and suspensions, can glitch and crash your world or lose your build

Overall the game looks pretty nice depends if you like the cartoonish style. The more updates that come in survival render the survival mods that can help you pretty much useless, and that is a great thing because you won't need to worry about installing the mods. Great game 8.4/10 let's see what new updates await us. And this game is better to be played with a friend ."

"
14361,Survival mode is getting better all the time
14362,really good would recomend
14363,nice
14364,"If you can get the idea, chances are, you can build it. Cars, rockets, tanks, boats, and much more can all be made the way you like, as simply or complex as you want. Think Minecraft but with the addition of movement in your builds.

With the ease of creative modding via the Steam Workshop, it makes the game even better. Countless custom parts can be found on the workshop if you need something more specific. If you need a break from building, you can also explore what others have created and try them out for yourself, maybe even brainstorm and mix it up into something even better.

Survival Mode makes things even better. Gather resources to make a vehicle or three and explore the insanely large randomly-generated world. Make some special vehicles for hauling resources, mining, exploring, flying, or even make a tank to hunt down robots. Loot giant ruined towers for better gear to upgrade your stuff. Make a farm for food supply, and then defend it against limitless waves of enemies. Find unique and awesome landmarks as you venture further out. Automate resources and crafting, build a huge base, and much more to come with Chapter 2 coming soon. And I haven‚Äôt even mentioned Survival mods yet, like 00Fant‚Äôs mod that practically doubles the game content."

14392,Yeetus
14393,all of it
14394,Its very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14395,it is fun and exciting
14396,its honestly a good game you could spend so long making things and not even realise it
14397,"I have owned this game for a week now and understand the general concept of it. For anyone looking for more sandbox and survival games, this is one to be remembered. For those of you who have played Minecraft, this should't be too hard. Keep in mind, this game still is in Beta so there will be some glitches.

Pros:
- Works like real life with all the parts (ex. Logic Gates, Controllers, Wheels, etc.)
- Easy to understand. I would recommend that for you first time playing, try to find a first time tutorial for survival. Once you get the general idea down. It goes VERY smoothly.
- Has a lot of content. As you can see, I have already played this game for 40 hours. (I just got this game last week) 
- Offline OR Online. I feel like one of the most unique things about Scrap Mechanic is it's direct connection multiplayer worlds. There are no public servers but if you want to play online YOU yourself will have to host the world directly from your internet alone.

Cons:
- Does get a bit laggy for low-end computers about halfway through your survival experience. (I do have a bad computer right now and am planning to get a faster one.) Once you put a lot of parts, especially moving ones, into your game, it starts to drop frames rapidly.

That's about all I have to say for this game for now. If you are going to invest in another game, this is one that I would defiantly recommend!"
14398,"I would recommand this game 100%. Well made game with infinite possibilities that goes along your imagination! You need to be actually really smart to build good transportation and well made tree cutter etc.!! Of course there's some bug and crashes it's an early version don't complain about bugs just help the creator fix them! worht the gold for hours and hours of playful time. i'm dreaming about the day that it will be 100% released!! <3
"
14399,is the best game ever
14400,"Really early access, therefore not much to to, unless you enjoy a sandbox game."

14424,Lag Mechanic
14425,it is a great game a bit laggy but I guess it is still early acses
14426,[h1] GOOD GAME [/h1] needs a breffy pc tho still worth it
14427,"It's an good game because it has driving you can build houses, and bases it's an good game to get"
14428,One of my favorite games
14429,"      As of review time I have put close to 300 hours into this game, and for a good reason. I bought this game back in 2016 when survival was still a concept, I played the game only to build because I had no idea how to play. Though the game supplies a manual in creative mode, it only explains basic things, such as basic assembly of a vehicle. I find that the learning curve can be insanely difficult for new players, and the only advise I can give is to go on the internet and watch some youtubers or tutorials.
     Survival mode, having been delayed several times, was long awaited and very much worth it. After a first look on launch day with a friend, I had no idea what to do and spent a long time doing nothing. I wondered around the map and found almost nothing [SPOILERS AHEAD] Until I saw the gigantic glowing wrench.  I then slowly progressed and still understood very little about the mode, learning as I went. [NO MORE SPOILERS]

So...

Pros:  

Enjoyable experience, extreme margin to express creativity.
PVE combat inside the survival mode.
Farming, and resulting action. 
Map editor, without any file shenanigains.
Amazing modding support, through outside sources and steam workshop. 

Cons: (keep in mind some of these are bugs and will eventually be flushed out from the game)

Bad loading times for lower end systems, but runs great.
Badly Optimized for graphics, with limited support. 
Lots of stuck glitches, with few solutions. 
And heres the heavy hitter, HORRIBLE learning curve, new players will have close to no idea what they are doing for the first 1-5 hours of gameplay. 

"
14430,I WANT WATER IN THE CREATIVE WORLD NOW!
14431,"Good game! 
Great for those who enjoy building things, building and testing vehicles and contraptions.
Good for those who enjoy general survival/crafting/combat games though the crafting is the focus.
I like it a lot and some of my favorite games are 7 Days to Die, Ark, Minecraft, Borderlands."
14432,Scrap mechanic s great and funny game but there is one issue that makes me angry every time playing it and thats the FPS drops every time you have on the ground more than 10 item deposits game starts to get extremly  laggy
14433,"game very good

14434,"very fun game

14437,JUST PLAY THE ISLE ITS BETTER!
14438,its pretty fun i don't have a great review but i'm to lazy to type a good review
14439,"this game is super wack. 

you need food to stay alive longer than 5 minutes,
growing food takes longer than 5 minutes.
your crops get ruined by robots in half a second.

result, you just die from hunger every 5 minutes over and over and you literally cant explore at ALL.
then when you die your drop all your stuff where you died, by the time you go get your bag your going to starve again.

this game has potential but the entire premis of farming is so unbalanced it creates the most unenjoyable experience ive ever wasted 20$ on."

14449,"Great game super fun. Just wish there was some feature to let you place things where you want too.
"
14450,"The game is pretty much in a permanent alpha state.  Expect extreme lag, multiple crashes, no quests, little guidance and for some people, the inability to even start the game due to poor install procedures.  There is no tech support, and the closest thing to help you will get will be either the Steam discussion boards where strangers try guessing a fix, or a very poorly maintained Wiki page."
14451,good but buy it on sale

This game (more so in creative mode) gives you the opportunity to let your imagination soar as you create virtually anything!

14496,This game is great and personly I think anyone who like to make stuff or build I would recomend this to them.

6 1/2 : Add a button in your helicopter with hands so that it can now show middle fingers- check

7. Build a  completely unnecessary underwater monorail system in survival - check

8. Sitting on a toilet which is attached to a maxed out thruster and launch it into the air just to loose the thruster (and toilet) while midflight and search it for 2 hours in survival mode - check

9.Build a automated Haybot harvester, go to sleep , come back to play and have massive lag since 200 robot arms are distributed over the floor -  check

11. Build a working snack mashine in survival - check

12. Go on a exploration trip to scrap city by car, forget to take the bed with you to set a respawn point, die and spawn in your base  on the other side of the world, pick up another car to pick up your car, forget the bed again , die again , spawn again and walk on foot to scrap city to pick up your two cars- check

17. Sacrifice 140 hours of your life and build a huge ""Hogwarts PvP Riddle Map"" which has like 15 downloads in the workshop. Be disappointed for weeks. Forget about your lifetime waste and come back from work just to see Scrapman released two entire Youtube Videos about  your creation. Then get 3000 downloads - check

Buy this gem of a game, harass your friends to play it with you and have a fun time plus space for endless creativity. 

Last but not least i have one advise for you, yung engeneering god : Start with creative mode and get the basics before you start with survival."

14534,good game
14535,"yes
"
14536,"Just started my survival world, you should DEFINITELY spend maybe a few hours in creative to learn things if you havent spent numerous days watching scrap man videos.

My checklist so far:

Build base at mechanic station and think your gonna spend hours making searching for a better place: done
Find that a 1 minutes drive from your mechanic station is what you think is the perfect base place: done
Build your base on the peninsula that's near an autumn forest, hay field, burned boss biome, desert, and not to far from rocks: done
realise you dont have chemicals and still cant find any 30 hours into the play through: done
Build a mining car: done
Build a looting car: done
copy scrap mans base: done
make a flying vehicle: donen't
not die of hunger every 5 seconds cause you keep growing potatos: donen't
get a spud gun: done
get a dressbot: done
get some rad outfitS: undone only (got team tomato merch and it is in no way rad) #TeamCarrots
have a tier 6 raid: nope (only have enough plots for a tier 4 with potatoes)
Make an early game raid defense: done

so yeah im ok at the game, have alot to do, Ill probably edit this and add to the list when I have 100 hours very addictive, grindy and pretty fun game.

14542,would/ have recommended this game. Very enjoyable gameplay for whats been added so far. If your new to the game I definitely recommend watching some youtubers play as it will greatly help you to see whats possible in this game.
14543,gud game
14544,Pretty good and fun. specially with friends. I only wish there were more enemys and bosses. Also the one thing i'd love from this was would be a story mode or just some lore to the game (the survival version).
14545,its amazing and will only get better

That being said, even with next to endless mods for this game there are still a lot of limitation to this game. My friends and I have a whole list of things that should be add as stock to give the players more options, instead of diving though the endless listings off mods. Any who iv had a mostly positive gaming experience."
14549,hom
14550,A good survival crafting games..
14551,"i love thus game
"
14552,"Overall I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Maybe it's cause I started with Survival, which could not more clearly be a second-class citizen game mode, but... most of my experience with this game was FRUSTRATION.

Engines default to on, which means that if a bot destroys your drivers seat your car races away at top speed.

There is virtually no useful guidance provided to the player.

There is no scaling of production for most materials, or at least, if there is some down the road from where I am now, it does not come soon enough. All your early materials must be manually harvested and they do NOT spawn with enough density relative to crafting cost.

I had to resort to cheat codes to obtain Cotton, because I could not find a single cotton plant in the biome it was supposed to grow in. It is needed to build both a Bed and a Driver's Seat, essential items in game progression.

The time it takes you to get back up from being knocked over is longer than the time between bot attacks. This means that if you, like me, jumped out of your car at the same moment as its seat was destroyed (see first point), and got run over by your own car -- you will then be beat to death by bots with absolutely no opportunity to stand back up. Fun!

Running back to your car after dying in some stupid way is a common experience. Because you respawn with low hunger and water, and without your vehicle, getting back to it is a matter of quickly finding food (the only source of this is either farming, which takes forever, or finding a cow to feed corn to to get milk) and then running slowly across half the map. This can be resolved by building a bed in your car, but good luck finding any frickin' COTTON to build the bed with.

When you farm plants, you need to just... stand on top of them to prevent bots from attacking. There's no way to like, notify yourself when your plants are under attack, so you can't even walk away to work on your car without losing your crops.

You can't drink water. You CANNOT drink water. You can carry water in buckets, or in an item called Water (which resembles a little container of water... like... say... a water bottle). You can only drink milk, which you must obtain by feeding corn to cows. Do the devs not know what milk is primarily composed of? Anyway... want to at least start some agriculture by herding the cows or something? Well, good luck getting them into the same place. At least Minecraft has a leash item.

Overall, maybe creative mode is fun -- but I no longer care to try it."
14553,"Nice game, but you can't play offline. So if you bought the game and for any reason you need to play without internet connection, you have to crack it! Nice work devs, brilliant"
14554,The game is very well thought out and is a great game to play. Do I understand it all? Nope! Am I a pro? NOPE! Do I like it? Yes!!!!! I would love it if you could find food easier but eh. win some and lose some.
14555,good
14556,good game
14557,its probably my favorite game on steam maybe at all and i have only played a few hours i have had a lot of fun with this game and i hope it gets popular
14558,its fun
14559,awsome
14560,Very fun building game and is very relaxing and fun with friends.
14561,"(The playtime is around 50 hours outside of Steam)
The review concerns the survival part of the game, which is the only interesting part for me.

I have to give the game a positive review for it's fantastic physics. I can't imagine a game where you build completely custom physics contraptions and vehicles which doesn't glitch out like crazy or act in weird and intuitive ways. With this game, while the toolset is limited, it seems to work quite intuitively.

That being said it's clear the survival mode lacks content. There is no real motivation to build more that an auto-farmer and some vehicles. This is poorly compensated by an absolutely extreme grind. Getting the materials you need can take hundreds of hours of pointless grinding. Luckily the game files can be easily modified, so I increased the drop rates of most materials by 2x, then 5x and finally for some of them even by 15x as I realized the game wants me to grind more and more for the simplest upgrades."
14562,great game
14563,Yes.
14564,Not what I expect but it might be what you like
14565,great game but you will need a good computer

14580,"Very fun and grindy game.
The only issue I have is that the map is just too small, because I constantly want to continue exploring."

14585,its a great survival and creative game where you can make all kinds of vehicles form air to land to sea.
14586,"Started out amazing, then ran out of food and they raided our farm kept dying over and over while we prepared food, then we got used to the mechanics and went back to being amazing! XD"
14587,"Theres still a game breaking bug that traps you in a warehouse elevator. I was really enjoying the game up until then, but this glitch is unacceptable. I'll definitely change my review to positive if this gets fixed."
14588,its good for creative people
14589,Great fun
14590,"If you want to build all sorts of silly contraptions, it's a lot of fun, especially with friends.

My #1 complaint is the physics aren't that realistic. I Spent an hour trying to build a boat only to realize that the propellers had no effect on water(they just spin in place without propelling the boat forward), and I needed to just use thrusters.

14624,"Generally it's a good game, devs continue to provide updates and it's been getting better with time.

Multiplayer is very spotty though, movement is calculated on the server, so moving on another person's server can be very laggy and in some cases just unbearable."

The game has an practically infinite amount of content if you have the patience and creativity to explore your ideas. The new survival mode enhances this to even further by giving you goals to work towards. It becomes critically addicting if you have someone to play coop with.  This game is just amazing and I would gladly pay double the price, it is now, especially since it's still getting amazing updates. 

[b]If you love exploring and learning interesting game mechanics, get this game.[/b] If you just want easy fun it will not last very long for you."

14652,The game Scrap Mechanic is a very fun game to play with friends however single player survival is pretty hard to survive but it leaves a challenge! The cool guns with potatoes for ammo and a fryer for fries is just so fun to watch and hit hay bots. The Vehicles you can make are so into detail you could make them just how you want to a tank all the way over to a dump truck you can make what ever you want. The Vehicles are by far my favorite.

14659,Incredible game!!
14660,"[h1] It's really hard to like this game, as awesome as it conceptually is. [/h1]

There's no other game like Scrap Mechanic with the sheer level of possibilities a few pistons, rotors, and control blocks give you, which is why I continue to begrungingly play it, but I've come very close to completely quitting because of the game breaking glitches. I'll list some of the most annoying bellow.

[b] My TLDR is: Buy Scrap Mechanic if you want to support a game that is like no other, incredibly creative, has loads of mods, and is genuinely one of the best gaming experiences I've enjoyed (in Beta), IF YOU CAN TOLERATE THE GLITCHES. If you can't abide by the glitches bellow, don't even think about it. They could learn a thing or two by upgrading to Bethesda's level of glitching. Which is why I'm not recommending the game right now. [/b]

- In survival mode, the game completely freezes every 1-10 minutes for several seconds, or until you alt+tab away and back to it. This wouldn't be so bad if everything else on your screen(s) didn't also graphically freeze.

- Rotors and pistons can't handle a lot of weight without breaking, then immediately fixing over and over. This leads to a lot of clunking and occasionally broken machines (that can easily be fixed through usage of the lift).

- There are SEVERE lag issues in both creative and survival mode. It seems to depend on who is hosting the game, but if I join a friends creative server, nothing works. Blocks can't be placed, pistons and rotors break, entering and exiting seats takes forever. 
Survival starts out virtuallly lag free when hosting, but gets progressively worse until you are forced to restart the server to continue playing. Generally, you'll be around 40 FPS until you get to around 10 and need to restart
Survival also lags considerably during harvester bot raids. To the point that you're f*cked when a large wave hits. Also, why would you send 30 harvesters to attack a lone mechanic?!?! Did they even playtest this? 

- There are no warning signs that you're near the large red harvester bot. And though I've only seen one, they seem to spawn in the wierdest locations. One popped out of a forest I had drove into and nuked my vehicle. Would have made sense if there were warning signs like the trader has around his shop, or if there were a high level raidable building around.

- Mining and harvesting trees are very tedious and would be insanely easier if the buzz saws and drills did their job. Instead the hit box for both are smaller than the 3D model, which leaves pieces of wood or metal touching but not being cut by these tools.

- Forget trying to kill bots with your vehicles. They run from buzz saws or drills (which is annoying because they seem just fun with getting rammed at mock 5) which somehow makes them invulnerable to damage even if you're moving faster than they're moving away from you. Running them over has a 70% chance of knocking them prone, and a 30% chance of outright killing them, unless you're travelling at top speed.

This above list could probably be several pages long, but you get the point."
14661,yeah thats a pretty good
14662,gud gam
14663,"over 100 hours in 2 weeks of owning, would buy again
"
14664,This game is awesome! I do wish that the survival mode would have released with a bit more. And that the devs would release content a little faster. But this game is definitely worth the purchase. There are a lot of things they plan to do with this game that I am very excited for and cant wait to mess around with. The devs are pretty quick with bug fixes and seem pretty easy to reach through their social media.
14665,"This is the best survival game i played in my life ,congratulations for Axolot"
14666,poop
14667,good
14668,can bug splat some time a really good game still
14669,Yes.
14670,"This game is really fun and creative.  That being said, it can be boring and monotonous at times, especially in survival.  I would recommend this game not as a finished product, but as a changing and growing game.  The developers are very active and give many updates.  This is a game i will gladly recommend to anyone."
14671,45q3te
14672,"Very in-depth game. Fun to create machines part by part and see how they work. Sometimes how they don't work lol
"
14673,"an absalute ***** star game. graphics are amazing, the gameplay story is amazind. i only wish the water in creative update would come faster"
14674,Amazing game!
14675,"[h1]Great game for creativity and wacky creations.[/h1] 
Survival was released this year and has completely changed the game. Although this is early access the game is already very developed and the community is great. The base game is good (especially with new survival features), but it's made even better by the creations and mods from the community. One mod I would recommend is ""The Modpack"", it part additions, especially it's advanced logic and math systems are key to any good creation.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=881254777

Would highly recommend for creatives, survivalists, base builders, logical geniuses, anyone really. Great all round game and I can't wait to see what comes from it in the future"
14676,would i recommend this game YES why well it because one you can build anything and if you have a creation that and you want to see how good it is in survival you can in the new survival would. i love this game because i like to build and when i first played this game i was new to building stuff but the more you play this game the better your creation will get
14677,Devs suck
14678,Meh
14679,yes
14680,"Absolutely stunning, epic utilities, selection, and possibilities for creativity in such an expansive sandbox, and all with extremely fun and interactive multiplayer, Steam workshop, modding, along side all of the consistent and great updates!"
14681,yes
14682,"This is, first and foremost, a game about building crazy, intricate contraptions and it already does that well. If you like messing around with vehicles and overcoming strange limitations with shear intellectual tomfoolery, this is the game for you. You want to program shenanigans? This is where you do it. Ignoring COMPLETELY the burgeoning mod community, this is a delightfully fun contraption creation game. The physics is wonky in all the right ways. The robots are simple to outwit until there's twelve of them. You've got plenty of resources, until you want to build something. You think you know how things work until you need that one extra feature. This is a learning game and it does that beautifully without even trying.

If you want ""survival"" go play raft, which also an excellent game. If you want to cram thirteen logic gates into a throttling system and then have an epiphany and figure out you can do it with six, a couple timers, and a piston on a controller, this is the game for you. Its a house that unfolds into a sawmill, that turns into a drill with a bot catapult, oh wait that's too laggy! ...But the controller wasn't necessary! ...And I can use these three cacti to make a laser sight! ...And then you SMASH! ...AND IF YOU ADD A DUCK!

HAVE FUN!"
14683,great game
14684,"great game, the art direction is cute and gameplay is fun"

14688,"Awesome game that is a complete mess. Eventually, your framerate will drop so low that your playthrough will end in lag and frustration. Up until that point it is a very entertaining and worthwhile experience."
14689,Great game for building vehicles that are either practical and well designed or completely stupid and fun.
14690,"Its a good games. I play the survival gamemode alot with my friends.
"
14691,"good
"
14692,its fun
14693,"It is a game in which you can build literally everything: from a Starship spaceship, to a giant moving spider or a wind turbine, it really puts your creative thinking to test."
14694,Both gud
14695,no comment
14696,Nice game and fun
14697,i love this game! it's a grinding but still very fun game. you can build giant vehicles both simple and very complex and i would love this having a some kind of multiplayer server you could join because i am lonely and my friends doesn't like this game and this game is not like the others try it
14698," this is the best game ive ever had

"
14699,"hard to learnish, but watch some youtube videos and youll have a greata time"
14700,It's a nice game for creative people and their friends.
14701,"good game
"
14702,cool
14703,Somehow they are able to making building innovative vehicles real easy. It is a lot of fun to experiment with builds in this game.
14704,good game over all but i want more content but the reson why i got this game is that i wanted to play with my friends as this all so being my first game i think its a graet game to play with friends  and family so yes i would sagest the=is game to other players.
14705,Good.
14706,"Very good game!
I play it a lot of the time"
14707,"i think this game could inspire childrens imagination along with creativity and puzzle solving would 
tell other gamers along with anyone else to buy and play this fantastic game (no im not a bot if you were wondering)"
14708,its so addicting
14709,"Great game, tons of possiblites"
14710,its a bulding game its bery cool and phicicle
14711,This game is amazing!
14712,THIS IS A GREAT GAME AT A GREAT PRICE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES BUILDING THIS AND OR SURVIVAL GAMES BECAUSE THEY ARE WORKING HARD ON THE NEW SURVIVAL MODE AND THIS GAME IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY.
14713,..
14714,"Even in such an early stage of development, this game is great. Me and my son started playing when Survival Mode was released and we have both enjoyed it immensely.

The game gives you the freedom to create any contraption you can think of, with engines, wheels, thrusters and even logic gates! You can then use these creations to explore the world and forge your own adventure. Although there is little in terms of story or direction, there is a lot of content hidden away in the world and plenty of challenges to face. The game can be played solo but I definitely recommend playing with friends.

The only negative I have to mention is that the game can get quite laggy on co-op. The game is still in development, however, and this is something that the developers continue to work on, but ultimately, it's not exactly game breaking and the overall experience is still great."
14715,great game
14716,I liked it
14717,Needs to be optimized BADLY other than that the game is awesome
14718,Very Creative
14719,building
14720,Long story short; Strongly recommend this game. Way better than the newer copycat.
14721,"Nie ma wiele t≈Çumaczenia, niesamowita gra, niesko≈Ñczenie wiele mo≈ºliwo≈õci."
14722,It's fun to play with friends since the survival came out. If you are solo I do not recommend.
14723,Boring at the start of survival but gets better over time.
14724,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING WOULD TOTS PLAY THIS IVE GOT AN IDEA FOR YOU THOUGH IF YOU COULD PUT IN SHOVELS SO you can pick up dirt to put on wood/any block because then that would be cool
"
14725,good game
14726,its good
14727,its fun
14728,yay
14729,goood
14730,this was a wopnderfull game
14731,"get the game, very fun"
14732,"when I played, I was bored and locked in a basement. So being locked in a basement for 6 months only lead to one thing. Creativity.. And with this game, you can make anything you wanted. I enjoyed it the most, because it was a way for me to learn how transmissions worked, how gears worked, and how engines worked. All because I replicated them in this game, and I've heard the survival mode is great. But what I would like to see is a no sky limit boundary. And for you to maybe go in orbit, or at least seem like it.. Cause it got so boring when you built these huge rockets, and you spend days making the launch pad, and the rocket. Trying to control all that power, and you finally do, just to find out you slam against a sky barrier. Life sucked that day, but the rest of it was great. 10/10 am gonna play again"
14733,This game is fun if you want to build stuff. Otherwise might not be for you.
14734,"Very fun, although difficult to make something that looks good. Logic is hard to understand. 9/10"
14735,This game will make you feel both like an idiot and a genius at the same time.
14736,"Epic sandbox game, have also survival that is... interesting. And a challenge mode!"
14737,"I enjoyed it a few years ago and it has gotten a lot better ever since, especially with the survival update. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to be able to build contraptions or just vehicles. Except for the fact that there is currently no real story in the game I really do not notice that it is still in early acces."
14738,"It's a little rough still, but there's a lot to do in this sandbox game. No long-term goals yet, but perfect if you just want to chill and devote a few hours to building vehicles and forts."
14739,"I get distracted easily, so the survival doesn't hold my attention for a very long time. Creative, however, is awesome. I love building crazy stuff like a house that turns into a car, and the tools they added over time just make it better."
14740,speed
14741,mmmmm yes
14742,Great game. Beware of loose physics objects !
14743,"This game is amazing. even though it isn't finished and has some bugs, it feels very polished and is overall an amazing experience. I would recommend this game to you if you like designing and making things, but also enjoy survival games. The ability to make versatile creations like cars and drills is amazing, and feels great when combined with beautiful graphics and well designed enemies"
14744,"pretty good
"
14745,"Amazing game, fun to play"
14746,I have no idea what I'm doing.
14747,"very

14748,great game!!! im really bad though you should definetly try it out if you like redstone in minecraft or just like minecraft
14749,This game is a great way to engage in creative activities in building machines
14750,been there since day one the game has gotten so much better since wish the creators well
14751,"A game that's trite and true. A game where people can create, learn, have fun with friends and set off on an adventure!"
14752,Becouse of Kan and Scrapman maybe some times Mooombo :D i have spend 228h in this game :D thank you guys for lot of fun
14753,Definitely the best sandbox game ever
14754,only limited by your imagination
14755,"LOVE THAT GAME!!! You can build whatever you want in a big open world, great graphics. I particularly like the cartoon style and with the robots in survival that come to your base. The only thing is that it's really demanding for your processor... But anyways, BIG thumb up to the developers!"
14756,It is a great way to spend your time! thank you
14757,its fun
14758,"The updates come slow, but they are on a great track and have the basic gameloop down quite well. This game is fun as hell. Absolutely recommended."

14774,"It's one of my favourite game, but i have some complains:
-pleese add some body armour,
-pleese restore the eating T pose, it was one of my favourite features"
14775,"Good game! It can be played both in the sandbox, creating incredible mechanisms, and you can play survival. There is a workshop. The game continues to develop, and to be honest, being a sandbox, it was super, but the developers do not stop there and develop the game, they have a lot of ideas in their plans!

14776,Amazing game!
14777,Definitely a must buy if you have a group of friends you like to play games with. Also fun to play for solo people if you enjoy the insane building mechanics.
14778,YES
14779,too much grinding
14780,Scrap mechanic is honestly one of my favourite games and has been for many years. The experience is immersive and there are endless things to build and explore. 10/10 would highly recommend.
14781,"This really creative game is great. You can do anything or... almost everything, well u can do anything if u have the IQ level wich i dont have :DDDD but it is really fun when something unexpected happens like ur cars starts rotating at high speeds and yeeeeeets into the sky :DDDD it is really good with friends!"
14782,"Loads of fun, tests your ability to think about complex logic, def thumbs up"
14783,great game but need frequency update
14784,EPIC
14785,"You can use suspension to break the physics engine, perfect design, 10/10"
14786,MINDNUMBINGLY BORING
14787,"This is one of the BEST crafting game that I have ever played.
Build all you can think.
Amazing if you play with your friends!
Enjoy it!"
14788,AMAZING!!!!!
14789,"Oh. My. GOODNESS! I love this game! I'm a huge fan of the way you can make things, survival is a challenge in the late game, and creative is super fun. Building and wiring stuff is easier here than any other game I've ever played, and even someone who's never played can pick it up easily(ish)."
14790,very noice with friends
14791,"Really a fantastic creation system. Base building has been done by many games by now, but Scrap Mechanic specializes in vehicles and machines, and does it very well.

Survival mode is a fun survival sandbox in its own right, and give a purpose and direction to your creations. Production and harvesting can be built, increased, and improved by your own ingenuity, rather than unlocking levels or tiers.

Probably the most fun I have had in a game this year."
14792,"This game is legit addicting, my brother and I can't get enough of it. Especially sandbox mode."
14793,One of the best survival games i have found and would recommend to any one looking for a different survival experience!
14794,its amazing if you have a good Computer
14795,fun
14796,it is a great game for peaple that like to create things
14797,verry nice my friend
14798,.
14799,"Fun, Better when you have friends."
14800,"I've only played for 17 hours but this a little, fun addictive game I like to play."
14801,i cant explain how good this game really is five stars recaminded
14802,yes
14803,Nice game
14804,"Good game for those who like to create, build, and and experiment"
14805,Building weird contraptions is fun
14806,"This is one of the best open world sandbox games I've ever played, and they're still adding new and amazing things.  It has proven itself to have loads of potential for the future."
14807,"Fun game. I played it a bit with my girlfriend. Reminds met of gmod wiremod combined with survival, farming and funny looking characters."
14808,yes
14809,Its graeaatd
14810,"An amazing game, love to build in creative and make whatever the hell I want. Also, workshop is amazing.

But I must say, the survival mode sucks beyond measure. It's horribly unfun to wait 15 seconds for crafting and have to scavage for everything. It's seriously out of line with the ethos of creative mode."
14811,dis game  sucks it is horrible
14812,"This game is amazing, keep up the great work."
14813,smecher
14814,i recommend
14815,This is the best game for creativity
14816,good
14817,"Greetings,

I may not know your name, but I know why you are reading this. If you're like me, you enjoy creative building, physics, survival, challenges, mild combat, and strategy. This game has all of that, and [b]I would highly recommend this game[/b]. It's like an extension of Mine Craft, except better! You can create things from a static house, to a transforming vehicle!

There is a creative mode with no limits where you can build things and post them on the workshop for others to enjoy, a challenge mode with problem solving challenges that will aid your building (you can even create your own challenges and post them on the workshop via the Challenge Builder), and a survival mode. This survival mode is by far one of the best I have ever seen. There are no limits (as long as you can get the supplies).

At first, I have to admit, survival mode was a little boring when harvesting resources. But that has changed due to many implications such as [spoiler]the oil ponds found in the desert[/spoiler]. And the game is only getting better!

Right now, there is a little bit of a story, but there is an update coming out that will add a ""whole new chapter"" to the story.

Here is some content, but be warned, spoilers. [spoiler]Crashed ship, Ruins, Mechanic Station, Trader, Warehouse, Second Crashed Ship, Evil Robots: Totebots, Haybots, Tapebots, and Farmbots! In addition, there is a farming mechanic where one can plant seeds and water them (there are basic water mechanics in the game such as buoyancy) to make them grow. There are lots of materials to harvest such as trees and rocks. My favorite part about the game is that once you get something, you can get something else with what you just made! (Ex: Destroy Haybots = Get Scrap Metal = Get Craft Bot = Get Real Metal = Get Drill = Destroy Rock Deposits = etc.)[/spoiler]

Also, no two worlds are the same. Creative mode is completely randomly generated (but one can use the Tile and World Builder to customize their Creative world). Survival Mode is partially randomly generated. I don't know how, but even though the biomes are randomly placed throughout the map, the story always fits perfectly in with it, so no two experiences are alike, but if you are stuck, some things are close enough that you can look them up.

In your survival experience, you can use [spoiler]Garment Boxes[/spoiler] to unlock different outfits that you can use in any game mode! How cool is that!

Lastly, it's multiplayer! So you can play with your friends!

I would highly recommend this game, and there is a lot more to it than what I have mentioned, but I don't want to give it all away.

Thank you for reading, and have a great day."

14825,Very good game
14826,"Very disappointed. Game stops working as soon as you've build a few complex structures in Creative. It was fantastic when it worked, but after 28 hours of gameplay, the game got laggy and eventually wouldn't load anymore. Unfortunately at that point when we started researching the problem it became clear it is a known problem, but you will only figure it out when you've played the game for several hours and of course now we're told by Steam that we've played the game for more than 2 hours. 
Don't get me wrong. It's a great game when it works, but what's the point if you can only build a limited number of structures. 
Tried everything, changing settings, reinstalled the game several times and our hardware is certainly up for the task and run games like Ark without any issues. 
Sad to say that Steam support was unhelpful. 
DON'T BUY!!"
14827,Challenge mode OP
14828,just a good game

14863,"I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an extremely creative, challenging, adventurous, fun game. I love this game because it forces me to use my mind when it comes to any thing you need, or don't for that matter. please go check out this game you will love it, for many reasons."
14864,HA
14865,this game is the best sandbox I have ever played and the new survival mode is my favorite mode
14866,I honestly think this game is amazing. Every little detail about it is spot on.. problem with it however is the fact that there are no servers. They advertise the game to ve played with friends but having one person host a server has so many problems. You can only olay when the host is online. Or like in my case he stoped playing all together losing all my progress in the game. I really hope they add servers quick or even make the ability to hire servers an option.  I would not recommend this game to anyone wanting yo play with friends its a waste of time. But if your keen on solo play go for it no problems
14867,Good game to play with friends.
14868,this game can be fun at most times and is funny

14871,good

"
14873,"You may have read a review recently where a group of 4 friends played this game together and only 1 person decided to keep playing while the others quit; I am the one who stuck to the game.

As the game is right now, it's a mixed bag but has a lot of potential. I will list out what I found fun about as well as its problems.

Pros:
1. Crafting machines is awesome! (emphasis on the vehicles and stuff you can build). They have enough components and interactables to pretty much build any sort of machine you can think of. Anything that can be picked up by your character can be attached to your creation (I personally strap the heads of my enemies to the front of my car any opportunity I get)

2. The game has a whole lot of concentrated personality, let me explain what I mean by that. There aren't a lot of unique npcs/characters at this moment but the one's that do exist make me chuckle. The trapped farmers, craft bot, cows, and cook bot all made me laugh when I first discovered them. (I won't spoil the surprises but how they act/move is down right hilarious) I'm really hoping they continue in this quirky directions. 

3. The world is vast and has a lot of things to discover if you're doing a blind playthrough. With the size of it all, it's impossible to avoid building a vehicle to explore it all. 

4. The game looks clean and has good aesthetics. The buildings and environment all look pretty good.

Cons:
1. From someone who has done a blind playthrough with a group of friends, this game does not hold your hand in any manner. Me and my friends we're completely lost on what to do for a few hours. At the beginning, the only thing the game shows you is how to do is farm and make a basic car. There is no quests/objectives to guide you through what the game has to offer. (I promise you the vehicles you can craft later on will not be a janky as the tutorial car you make with the low-grade components)

2. Some things are not very logical. Why can't I just drink bottled water or eat the corn I harvested? Without any in-game directions, you'll just have to do a lot of trial-and-error to see what you can and cannot do. (or be like me and look up guides when I feel sick of being lost)

3a. Base building in this game is atrocious. Imagine trying to build your own home but only with lego pieces. All building pieces are way too small to make a base! (Recommendations to the game devs: introduce craftable walls/floors because making homes with those cubes would take ages) 

3b. There is no craftable lights in this game aside for those nasty yellow-tinted headlights. (Because of this poor light, the nights are extreme eye sore if you decide to light your base with these headlights) 

4. I hate the grass in this game, you can't get rid of it and I lose things it it all the time especially after fighting multiple robots. (I've had to reduce foilage in the menu because it was getting really annoying)

Overall it's fun game but still in early access (it really shows). it seems like the devs are doing a good job adding good QOL updates (they just recently added beacons and oil rigs). It difficult for me to outright recommend this game as it is right now, but it has the capability of being a really solid game. I have high hopes this game will be great."
14874,goooood
14875,"Game is lots of fun. Great multiplayer, as well!"
14876,Fun Game play it alot
14877,"it is age appropriate, fun, easy and has adventure/action"
14878,This is fun game that you can play with friends. Browsing the steam workshop on the lift for creations is really fun!

14883,this game is awsome its price is worth it you should buy it

14885,it is a fun game I recommend it
14886,No
14887,Great Game enjoy it
14888,GOOD
14889,"hello, I think this game is a really creative game and I recommend this game to others."
14890,My dog died while playing this game
14891,Dont get me wrong its a fun game but theres many bugs and glitches that ruin the game
14892,FUN
14893,.
14894,"Amazing game, would 100% recommend and have not seen any ripoffs of it"
14895,A fun way to just mess around in creative and a great adventure in survival
14896,"I dont understand all the positive reviews, this game is one big bug... and it has been like this for years"
14897,A fun game where you can build practically anything you can imagine in both a creative environment or in a challenging survival mode. Well worth the $25 I spent on it. My only complaint is that the survival mode is light on content. But the game is still in development and gets regular updates. So not much of a complaint.
14898,Since the Survival finaly takes form the game is worth again to play. I am so happy to hear finaly about it
14899,"Scrap Mechanic, a survival/building game, I enjoy playing this game. However, I despise this game for a couple of good reasons. 1. It does not run very well, the developers used a custom engine which runs horribly. They could have used a better one like unreal engine, unity, etc... 2. the updating on this game is very slow. Most of the time the developing for this game is inactive and there is a long span between updates and this will probably go into full release in approximately 3-5 years, or probably more."
14900,Everything is very good and i loved this game but. On my computer this game is crashed ... i played in this game 31 hour. Now i download this game again and i think every think will be good . THANK YOU !!!
14901,yes do like
14902,"best game PLAY!!!!!!!!
"
14903,its good. like minecraft but kinda more moveable
14904,The most telling thing about this game compared to other early access games is that they made creative mode as a full game FIRST and now are developing a survival mode ontop of it and making increasingly great updates to the game that never feel too few and far between. 9/10
14905,"everything about it is cool
"
14906,emag dug
14907,it good
14908,"cool and cool game i hube trealmacers i free
"
14909,GOOD
14910,"I have put way to many hours into this game.

Amazing game would buy 10x again."
14911,"alot of good things to say about the game, but the whole factory thing ruins it. dying over and over again to aimbotting tapebots , lagging the whole time. almost unplayable. was given to me so. there you have it."
14912,"Absolutely abysmal, There is NO 18+ mature content anywhere in this game. That's right, you heard me right, ZERO, ZILCH, NADA. Absolutely no sexual scenes to be found anywhere in the game, not even ecchi scenes. The closest thing to mature content that I could find in this game was the mechanic calendar that you find in the ship which is only good for about one nut and gets old after that. This game promised too much and delivered so little it's appalling that big game companies think they can get away with this. It's outrageous and absurd the amount of disappointment I feel and how much it has ruined my day. 0/10 would not recommend this to a fucking amoeba. Worst dating sim of my life, I want my money back."
14913,dope game hella fun with friends
14914,its super fun
14915,it game it fun that it
14916,"This game provides a unique creative environment with multiple areas to explore, combat, etc.  The only aspect that would be great is if there were more types of areas and buildings to explore.  Otherwise this game is fantastic fun, especially for what creative things you can come up with!"
14917,fffff
14918, wOw
14919,its fun
14920,i like this game never get bored of it just i recommened to everyone who will buy it its will be more fun to play with friends and not alone
14921,.
14922,"This is one of the better open world survival craft games that is all about, if you can think it you can probably build it. I would definitely recommend this game to people. The enemies in the game are kind of what makes me not want to play the game, mainly the Haybot, they attack very often and do loads of damage. When multiple are after you, just RUN, and try to pick them off one by one."
14923,fawdawsawd
14924,"Great game.
it has its bugs and glitches but in general its probably the best game for people looking to build vehicles and contraptions"
14925,"funn game with alot of fooling around, not much to do exept creating and harvesting and surviving but still lots of fun
"
14926,w
14927,its really good.i love playing it
14928,very good game uwu
14929,it is nice
14930,COOL
14931,pretty fun survival game
14932,Pretty fun game to play with friends except when the game crashes. The workshop for this game is amazing and makes the game so much better when you just want to mess around and blow things up. Make sure you bring some patient once you launch this game.
14933,it amazing
14934,goo
14935,ya
14936,"an amazing game,it inspires me to build lots of things.I truly recommend this game for everyone."
14937,"I just started to play this game and was enjoying it, I was able to build a small safe place to protect my stuff, and then they did an update and changed the fact that the robots just bash everything and destroy it. Before if you worked hard and built things with the strongest brick, which took a lot to make them, you would be safe. They changed that and the robots break even them away so there is no way to protect your stuff, everything you spend hours, days, weeks building is just easily destroyed. Do not go on a walkabout to explore anything, if you are not there to defend your stuff when you come back it will be destroyed. My idea of fun does not involve continually rebuilding what I worked so hard to create. BAD ROBOT BAD GAME!"
14938,verry fun :D
14939,"enjoy everything about it
"
14940,yes
14941,"great game but please PLEASE fix water pumps. they are randomly causing input lag especially for clients when they can no longer pump water. i'm not sure how to replicate the issue, but allot of people are having the same issue, picking up the water pump causes your game to almost instantly go back to normal.
this is really starting to get frustrating. my friend and I have stopped shortly after the release of survival because we had no idea what was causing the lag, we had hoped it would of been fixed by now. please make this a high priority fix! it's causing people to leave their save games and start new ones"
14942,fun with friends
14943,"This game is amazing, It's my dream game and u can do whatever u imagine!
THIS GAME AND THE CREATORS NEEDS MORE CREDIT!"

14947,"I'm not good at describing games, and what exactly I like and don't like about them, but I do indeed like it.
It controls well, and looks pretty great. I have to play with lower graphics because my laptop is a potato, but even then it still looks beautiful. It's pretty relaxing, and fun to play in my opinion."
14948,"I like it. Make stuff, have fun, survive."
14949,good
14950,The devs finally made fuel farming easier. I was about to give up on this game because it was such a pain swimming for oil. The game is absolutely awesome for single player and multiplayer games.
14951,great game
14952,I've played 69 hours (nice) and it is a great game but you might want a beefy computer.
14953,IT IS GOOD

14961,"Great Game, has alot of stuff to do you will never beat it there is always more to do"
14962,"Is nice ""Heavy"""
14963,"this game has both mechanics, iq, and creativity. anyone can enjoy this game because there is a aspect for everyone to love in it."
14964,Build cars and bases and smack evil robots. What more could you ask for?
14965,YES.
14966,"Haha game crash go brrrrr

Although, it is a really good game to play sandbox (its the only thing I have played in it) I also like playing multiplayer with my dad
The price is probably a bit too much, that's why I got the game at a halloween special 33% off
"
14967,Amazing game must buy
14968,"The idea of the game is very good but as somebody who only playes the survival mode, I have to say that the game has so many bugs and you play wtih solid 3fps half the time. Especially the Warehouse is completly broken. Even if you have more that one digit fps, you get instantly two shot by the bots which never miss. It has a lot of potential but still needs a lot of work!"
14969,i have no one to play with
14970,Good game not finished but is getting a lot of updates.
14971,it is cool
14972,Very cool
14973,"Scrap Mechanic is a game that I have played for quite a while, and I plan on playing it more. First of all, most things in this game are a challenge to create, even more so in survival. I have played this game for more than 100 hours and I have just now figured out how to create a steadily flying machine! With creative mode, pretty much anything that you can imagine is able to be created. All of the modes are extremely fun to play multiplayer as well. You can get many things from Steam Workshop on here as well. Most of the mods work well with the game as well. With survival, I would recommend it to anyone who likes close combat, with ranged coming in later game. Now, I'm not really that kind of person, but my friend really enjoys it. Overall, I think that the cost is good for a great game, and anyone who is creative and wants some fun should get it and enjoy it. To anyone who does get it, I hope that you enjoy it, and figure out how to use the game mechanics."

14994,"I've been enjoying this game far more than I think I should. It gives me the ability to tinker about, build random fantastic contraptions, and wander around the world while trying not to get my üí© split by farmbots.

It's been particularly fun, thus far."

15047,"Scrap Mechanic is unique. Me and a friend of mine bought it the day it came out and we had so much fun learning how to play the game and staying up late building stupid shit. I've since moved on but I still play with other friends, often with mods to fill out the slight lack of blocks or items in the game, survival mode was alright, worth waiting 4 years for? Probably not but I still like it. :)))))"

15063,"these mechanics and physics are spot on - you can make some very creative stuff! try out the OG mode to get an idea of what kinda cool stuff you can do before testing in the survival mode
"

15077,play it
15078,"Overall, I would say this is a good game.
I have not gotten to the ""lategame"" yet but so far I have been able to figure out (with my friend's help) how to do all of the basic stuff. If there is something wrong and you say it to the devs a lot of the time it seems like they at least consider it. I have not done that, but time and time again they add requested features making this one of my favorite games. The devs make it for money sure, but its not like you can purchase stuff that will change the ingame experience. I personaly would say that this game is made for the players, not for the devs.
Please exuse me for spelling half of the stuff in this wrong it has never been my strongest suit."

AND I LOVE IT"
15095,"Having reached the 2,000 hour mark, now is a good time to make a review. This game has a lot of potential, unfortunately there are MANY issues with it currently. Mostly lag, crashes, bugs, and multiplayer.
1: Lag. Generally, this game runs well, until any of the next things happen: Too many bearings, too much suspension, vehicles get near each other, complex creations, spawning something large.
2: Crashes. There are so many ways I have experienced to crash this game. Too many bearings, too many suspensions, leaving a creation on a lift for too long, breaking or painting ""certain"" parts. Basically, your game will crash at some point while playing this game.
3: Bugs. Bugs are very prevalent in this game and many were caused by the recent survival update, however they are slowly being fixed.
4: Multiplayer. The multiplayer in this game is somewhat lacking in features, ie. kicking people and what not, and is also very buggy. Players teleport or lag in position all the time especially in large/complex creations.

Summary: Good game with a ton of potential, but many bugs and crashes and issues."
15096,it fun
15097,it gust the BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15098,It is a FREAKING good game!

15100,it's cool
15101,"This game is such a great game, and I have loved this game ever since I discovered. It and I have played it for quite a long time. This is a great game to play with friends, where you can create, have fun, and just play on your downtime or a game to play any time you feel like it. This is a game that I love and I thank the devs for making suck a great game. I truly feel that scrap mechanic is one of, if not my most favorite games that I play. And so I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a great survival game, creative game , or a game to just mess around with or play with friends and build. Thank you and I hope you like the game if you proceed to buy it."

15112,"It's seen a lot of improvements, and seeing as it is still in early access, it has more quality content than expected. I'm not the most creative person, so I don't like a lot of the things I build, but it still seems like a good game. I feel like after a while, the game sorta runs out of steam and loses pace, but there are clear goals and objectives to work to. Solid game."

15152,lots of fun
15153,"it is a very creative game, its fun to learn mechanics and how things work"
15154,"2022 upodate:
This isnt a bad review, I just cant recommend it at the moment due to instability/crashes.

I am running a Ryzen 5900x+RTX 2080+32GB rig which plays this game with flying colors, however, the experience that hurts this review is the consistent crashes. I got to play less than 15 mins then crash, another load and 5 mins crash.

The game is love of labor for sure. You are limited to your creativity. You can do the simple farm, craft, repeat, or you can go all out and make tanks and robots to farm, transport, or to do your bidding. I can only recommend this game if you are extremely in need of a game to burn time. If you are looking for a polish experience or somewhat polish, wait for another 2-3 years when and if they decide to come out of alpha."
15155,This game is like Minecraft because you can build whatever you want but there's more techinical things like with building a car and such.  the creativity is the same like in minecraft which i wish that they could take all the good stuff from this game and put it into minecraft.

15166,"Fun game. It's like minecraft but with cars.  Straight forward ""redstone"" gizmos. Can be very laggy once you live in a world. Also, don't build mono rails or anything to do with pistons or gravity... the game will not like that at all."
15167,Love the variety of creations that you can make!

15175,"Vanilla is already good enough, and modded is even better. A game with a lot of capabilities, so many that even my imagination is not enough for making 0.05% of the possible SMALL creations, it's full on worth it for such a great game with mod support. (also i have more computer memory space then i will ever need) My dad bought me this game so i got it for free."

You can try to survive or doing challanges.

15183,Now slow down there champ and give this a quick read. Amazing game and it has a lot to offer but the devs are too busy working on raft to bother. its been almost a year since survival came out and warehouses are still unplayable (a massive chunk of the games content). Just go play raft and wait until they decide to actually make this worth the money. Still a great game dont get me wrong. Just needs work... a lot of work. Hire more people or something axelot please
15184,"because scrap mechanic deleted my mods it is cruel

15202,"i love the game its so fun
"
15203,i played it for a bit and its ok
15204,The game is really fun and I enjoyed playing it with my friend. Once you get a little mid-end game the big problem is that the game starts lagging and crashing because too many things are happening. Our hardware and internet aren't the problem because its well over the recommended settings. I hope the developers fix this issue so me and my friend can continue playing. For now ill have to stop playing because I can't even load the world anymore.
15205,god
15206,ge
15207,so much fun sometimes you get a really bad lag spike but other than that the best game i own and survival is the best game mode in my opinion
15208,"
YES"
15209,Scrap Mechanic Is an AMAZING GAME.
15210,You can be so creative in this game survival you starve too fast though.
15211,A fantastic game!! The games only limit is your creativity. Make anything your heart desires in either creative or for a challenge you can play Survival. Still a WIP but worth every penny.
15212,nice game
15213,my car is stuck under the terrain near the lake near the mechanic station
15214,a realy good game
15215,is fun
15216,"I have played have Scrap Mechanic for almost 2 months and I absolutely love it!
The game has so much freedom where you can let your creativity go wild.
There are also great mods to make it even better."
15217,great game good to play with friends
15218,"Probably one of the best vehicle builder survival games out there right now. Well made interface, very fun visuals, tons of flexibility and depth with construction. 200% worth the price. Still early access, so will likely only improve from this point onward."
15219,It is very fun
15220,"Disclaimer: I've only played the Survival mode single player and multiplayer. (EDIT: This is before the beacon update and I have not revisited the game since)

I find myself mixed because, although I had a decent time with this game (and will be coming back to it from time to time), there are a few issues with it that make it really hard for me to recommend it.

Pros: 
1. If you can think it, you can build it. The creation system is a blast and getting to mess around with it is one of the best parts of the game. I would put it ALMOST on the level of Minecraft in the sense that the game gives you a ton of tools and your only limit is your imagination on how to use them. 

2. The world is MASSIVE! You could run for many in-game days and never run into your friends if you feel like it. 

3. The game doesn't punish you TOO hard for dying, which is a nice change from other survival games. Some people might not like it, but I appreciate it. You lose your stuff and get sent back to a saved respawn bed, but you can get your stuff back or have a friend revive you with the right sandwich. 

Cons:
1. It is SO easy to get lost in this game. There's no compass, your friends' names don't get larger/smaller depending on your distance (so it's hard to use them as points of reference), and there's no map. Sometimes you can create markers for yourself in the form of random objects, your death bag, or try to reference the road, but something as simple as a compass/map would've solved this issue. 

2. The game is very VERY janky at times. I've been able to glitch myself underwater (oxygen meter will disappear), crashed out of the game multiple times in the same play session, objects will overlap sometimes randomly, objects disappear off the map once I turn around, the game lags HEAVILY (albeit randomly) in multiplayer, and my players will spaz out sometimes while driving. I'd say about 70% of the time the game runs fine, but that 30% is enough to be extremely frustrating (especially during battle).

3. Some things are just not intuitive. Example: I have water I pulled from the pond...why can't I drink it when I'm thirsty or water my plants directly? Why do I need to build a vacumm pump for that? If food can just heal your thirst and hunger, why have thirst at all? Why can't I eat the corn or potatoes? In the beginning, there are no directions. I often found myself just completely confused with absolutely no idea on what to do. 

That's typical in survival games, but in games like Raft and Don't Starve there is a sense of progression (open the menu, ""Oh I need to build this first...oh hey there's the next thing...how do I get it...oh like that! etc.). With Scrap Mechanic, my friends and I ran around for almost 3 hours completely lost. Two of them were turned off by the game, I was mixed, but one came back and loved it. 

Overall, I think if they made some minor fixes, cleaned up some of the glitches and jank, then the game could be phenomenal. Judging the game for what it is, it's hard to recommend it. Judging the game on what it COULD be, it has a ton of potential especially if they added a goal/story/endgame. Because I'm so mixed on it I can't personally recommend it unless you REALLY love the genre and are a patient gamer."
15221,"really good game easy to learn
"
15222,"good game 10/10
"
15223,Its fun
15224,"This game is a must have for any open world adventure lovers. Even on a lower laptop this game runs smooth. You may need to lower the visual settings but it doesn't take away from the game atmosphere at all! I will be purchasing any and all add on material possible here, hopefully we can get some!"
15225,"its like Raft but exact opposite. No bounds to a single chunk of space like in raft:your raft. you can explore the sizable chunk of land(toke me around 70 to 80 minutes to drive around the whole island without stopping in a very fast  and stable car of my own creation). Now going inside the island is a whole different can of worms, you are also not restricted to that island since you can swim away or by a raft of your own creation to other smaller islands that you can use as bases if you want away from the main land. Construction elements a very similar to Roblox but with very easy interface that you can catch on the fly. there is a bit of a First Person Shooter element to it once you are tech advanced enough to go raid places that are infested by holstile robots of different levels of dificulty. stakes of loosing your items or your game progess its almost non existant since it very respawn friendly. Very fun game to play especially with friends. Rated E for everyone due to the respawn mechanic ""knockout"" and instead of guns they are potatoe shooters. The character cosmetics are comfortably varied and give a sence of pride to them because you cant buy those but find them by chance or by raids. Obviously this game especializes in making you do your creations giving you very nifty tools and making you do some resource managment in order to progress in the game. Im liking it better than raft only because its more my line of gamplay personaly."
15226,"i LOVE scrap mechanic!! you might, too!"
15227,"It's a wondeful and creative game that i think meny people will like if they give it enough time it's a wonderful game that takes a litle bit to understand!

A solo thanks to the devs for survivel!"

"
15240,If you like funny and a relaxing game you should buy it. There is many things you can build its only your imagination that sets the limits of what you can build. And if the game is getting boring just download a mod or a vehicle from steamworkshop.
15241,Beautiful game and creative
15242,yeah solid
15243,lol
15244,it fun
15245,Its very creative
15246,"Its a sandbox game where you can build all sorts of vehicles, challenges, bases, whatever! Although you might need a good gaming computer for this because of the survival update completely updating the graphics. Or you could just, y'know, turn down the quality in the settings for better performance, whatever you want to do"
15247,it good
15248,I love and enjoy the amount of mods and functions of the game that make it fun and enjoyable but also have the touch of rage quit that makes it fun and enjoyable for everyone of all ages. You can team up with your friends on survival or go solo on challenge mode or have a peaceful creative game play solo or with friends.
15249,i loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove this game

15256,Jag kan inte bygga
15257,i have sacrificed 200 hours of my life to this
15258,fun game to play by yourself or with others
15259,
15260,its a good game but mine broke but still! its a really fun game
15261,"one of the best building games if not the best.
the reason for that is the fact taht you can build anything you want from building to vehicles."
15262,very fun
15263,"This is indeed a very good game. It IS very fun to play around in creative and create amazing stuff, or just weird and funny creations. 9/10 could do some lag improvements with large build and some more corner and just general shaping parts"
15264,great
15265,this game is so cool
15266,This game is very cool. You can build a lot of interesting machines! You can also try peoples creations from the workshop.
15267,"1: Spend 2 hours creating a machine on a lift
2: Take machine off of the lift to test it out
3: Game engine can not handle the machine you created and the game instantly hard crashes
4: Get forced to restart your computer
5: Lose the machine you spent 2 hours creating because you didn't have a chance to save it
6: Repeat multiple times until you finally get tired of the game doing it every time you play

A game that exclusively revolves around building contraptions SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THEM

I should also add, this happens on a freshly created Flat world with only the one machine and my PC is pretty decent."
15268,"Very crafty, makes you keep your gears rolling when thinking and planning custom builds."
15269,shit
15270,"Great Game, I love it."
15271,mhhh
15272,I really enjoy the game im just wondering when the devs will putt everything in creative including the gataling gun and the shot gun.
15273,epic
15274,Awesome Game.
15275,becus
15276,"If you have not yet purchased the game, be warned. This is not a survival game, the new update is pointless. It is a mock/bad version of the worst game ever made (fortnite).... Yes I said that. Yes this game has good features, you can try building cars. Not easy, the mechanics/physics are impossible to get the hang of. And really just don't try flying. The game should have never added it. But this review is to just say the ""Survival"" update, is more of just a run around bashing thing with an axe for an hour then quitting after you build your first car."
15277,This game is an amazing blend of survival and being able to create the things you want to create.
15278,"The game is fun but Survival constantly beats my computer up. Creative runs fine with few bugs but Survival needs some serious optimizing. I am past the recommended specs (everything but RAM) yet it snowballs, maxing out my graphics card. DN why. Good game overall just a bit laggy for certain computers."
15279,"The net code is terrible and creates tons of input lag for players who are joining the host's game. Worst of all I cant find anything about them fixing it, tons of people have the issue and it is repeatable. I have read that it is not their code that they are using but free net code given away by valve. Even if this is true it is not an excuse. If you are going to sell coop as a feature and don't do it right it just ruins it for everyone and should have been sold as a single player game."

15296,this game is so much fun you have so much freedom building things
15297,"Very good game and very fun to, but i have been having minor problems with the game because it has stopped working i know it is not my PC and what happened was that i placed a duck on a bearing on a table and if i stand on the table a run into the duck it starts spinning really fast and then i ran into it so much that my game technically did not crash but the screen went blue( it was not the cashing screen because i could open the ingame menu) i could hear the sound of wind and not much else now when i try to load any game it does not work so i am unsure of what to do  i have restarted my pc and everything)"
15298,fun and creative very easy for new players
15299,W3
15300,"It's like minecraft but more for adults. The building can be basic or very complex. If you can think it you can make it. The game could use more of a tutorial for the complex building components. All in all i love this game and they should put it on all platforms
"
15301,needs more to do
15302,ive played 117 hours yay
15303,NICE GAME
15304,Its cool fun to play with multiplayer and just Kid friendly i guess

15308,its fun exepept for survivle but fun
15309,outstanding
15310,gud
15311,lol
15312,"I think this is pretty much an abandonware at this point, or at least it definitely feels that way. It's a great concept, you can build fun stuff, even things you can't build in most other building games like working suspensions, etc. It gained a lot of popularity, the community is/was strong, and it would be so easy to make it even better with regular updates that add features, fix bugs, enrich/complete the gameplay loop and keep the community engaged. But no, the devs decided to kill it, because why not."
15313,awsome
15314,"At first the game was great... but the physics in the game breaks down if you build too much or drive too fast.. also there really is no point to the game. The building is great but there is no end goal, and the factories you have to clear are super buggy. Honestly the only thing to do is build great creations and hope the game doesn't glitch out too bad. Single player is ok, but if you bring a friend into your map its unplayable for them because of the glitching. There are no multiplayer servers and it gets boring playing alone. The devs had a great concept and great ideas but its like the gave up and quit developing... I had such high hopes for this game but i have been utterly disappointed. unless they release updates and fix this, don't waste your money guys..."
15315,ok play iy . hey shuty up
15316,"A fantastic game with a tremendous amount of potential, but a very disappointing developer. At the current rate of development, survival mode will be complete some time around 2026. I don't care if Axolot is a super small developer, even a single person should be able to keep up development faster than this."

15329,"Very good, i havnt tried survival, but very good"
15330,"The game is broken, don't waste your money on it, mine started threwing errors after about 3 weeks of playing, i asked for a refound but steam didnt accept it because i played it for too long, so bassically now i am stuck with a broken game and without 20 euro which i could spent on something better than this garbage, thank you steam and Axolot games."
15331,"COOL
"
15332,good
15333,Very good
15334,"A fun survival crafting style of game that is made by the same studio that created Raft. While the crafting and farming portion of this game is enjoyable and has a lot of fun experiments that you can explore, there is still some aspects to the game that should be considered putting in, i.e replanting trees or regrowing trees. Other than that, quite a good game to play."
15335,I love this game because it is a calm cool  game and the PVP which I love from other games like minecraft and it is like minecraft exsept the bolcks are smaller and there is more of a simulation.
15336,"Even as is, this game is incredibly fun if you're a creative type who likes to build contraptions! I can't wait to see more from this game in the future."
15337,"Needs maps or way points. 
Pain in the arse when you cant find your way around"
15338,LODGIC
15339,no poo poo
15340,Love the game very fun with friends
15341,"Okay, So if your reading this or considering buying this game i assume you watch Scrapman or kAN or any other scrap mechanic youtuber, if you dont then its most likely that a friend has told you about this game or maybe you just came across the game randomly, either way this game is one of the best games ive ever played, its a fun Multiplayer Sandbox game and if your bored of being alone making vehicles, add me on steam and ill hop on with you! your doing a disservice to yourself still reading this and not pressing the ""purchase for myself"" button!"
15342,It's worth it.
15343,"Played 2 hours on a survival world. Could barely make a contraption that moved. The base seat only controls 4 things, so steering was downright awful.  Walking would have been faster.  Get too far from your crashed ship and die? Too bad, gotta walk all the way back to your stuff.  Want to make more advanced stuff? Must not have found the guide for that. Frustrating to play for 2 hours and not even see signs of how to make further progress.

I'd be okay if there was some sort of tech tree and I could see what I needed to do for progress, but there was nothing obvious, and no in-game hints.

Also, what's the point of having beds for spawn points when you can't pick up a mattress and use that?

It seems like it could be a fun survival game, but jumping into it, I did not have fun, just frustration."
15344,"Fun crafting, farming, building, exploring, upgrading, mob hunting, time consumer!"
15345,build yes oh crap add suspension
15346,its epic
15347,bad
15348,"Loved it, bought as a gift for my GF and now we play together exciting game I love that it doesnt feel easy. There is no ""Auto win button or gun"". Everything you build is yours, your responsibility, your design, your work. IT's hard but satisfying and worth it."
15349,"Among all of the vehicle building games I've played, This game is the most polished and fun. The physics in this game are very unique when compared to everything else on the market.

My opinion of this game was very different when it first released and it felt like there was not very much to do having only creative mode to play with. However since the survival update I've been hooked on this game.

I look forward to Scrap Mechanic's future and if you are someone seeing this game for the first time I 100% recommend you give it a shot!"
15350,metal metal metal is all you need..
15351,q
15352,"Really fun
"
15353,Great game love survival
15354,"Pretty fun game, kI would just say to make it easier to mod survivial."
15355,"Fine and fun game. Haven't played survival much yet, but creative is enough to recommend. If you don't like terraria because of its graphics, this is the best alternative imho."
15356,Yes.
15357,very good worth the money!
15358,"Its a fun legos type of game with hours of imagination fun. I do hope more interactive aspects are added to the survival mode.

EDIT: They need to fix the base problems with the game ( Vehicles that slide all over the place, same bioms maps, same few gardening options) instead of calling it a features for Chapter 2 (slime wheels). That really strikes a nerve with me and makes it really hard to enjoy ""just the base game""!"
15359,"Very entertaining. There are many creative community creations and mods. The game is very enjoyable, and you can make anything, without limits, whatsoever, all because of their unique building style. I would recommend buying after early access, because as of now there is very little game play in survival. Creative and challenges mode, however, seem to almost be complete and hold most of the game play. Overall I would recommend, however it sadly isn't worth the money right now so wait for a sale or for it to be fully released before buying, but my hopes are VERY high for the full release, the creators are setting up a very strong foundation for the game!"
15360,Great game!
15361,One of the best building/survival games I've played!
15362,"Great game, but has a very bad bug that makes the game almost unplayable. At some point in the game it constantly crashes. for the first little while you open the game, it runs fine. I'm not sure if the crash is caused by to many blocks being loaded or what. It gets worse and worse until you have to relaunch the game every 30 seconds. Is there a way to fix this?"

15387,"Good game fun but the survival mode it quite hard, and there isn't a lot to do in this game besides building thats why i would rate it a 7/10"
15388,"This game is great!! In Chapter 2, will I need a new world or will the Tiles change in my Old Survival World?"
15389,yes
15390,"Scrap mechanic is a crafting survival game, utilizing a unique ""Lego Bionicle"" -ish technique (similar and bit oversimplified version of Space Engineers ) to bring about vehicle crafting. And to be honest it's doing it pretty damn good. 

The problem though, that this is the only thing the game has.
But let us not be too hasty about the review, lets look at why all the other parts of the game make it pretty worthless.

The first impression you get are rather positive, you start out with a bit of crafting tutorial, on ""how to make your first vehicle"". It teaches you in and out on how to make a vehicle with 4 wheels that can and will actually drive. Kinda fun, but you'll probably switch to the anticipated ""Survival Mode"" not even half way before finishing the entire 10-hour tutorial. (There is no campaign, Survival Mode is all you get).

First impression on survival mode is also pretty positive. You start out, gather resources, game teaches you how to craft, farm, scavenge - for the first 1h of survival. Until you finally unlock all the possibilities and see all the stuff you can craft/upgrade etc.

From that point, game turns into nothing, but grinding. Over half of the resources are only obtained by grinding. You go underwater and farm supplies on super slow movement speed. Or you scavenge one building after another from random building (only up to 10 variations of them). And hammer packs of two variations of bots (similar to how volcanoids work, except you're armed with your basic hammer till endgame, where you finally get a gun). Here's when you realize, that game simply has no story and no exploration aspect in randomly generated empty world with nothing but repeating prefabs.

Farming aspect is super bold and grindy too. You have to simply put a seed into dirt, water it (by grinding to river or building over complicated sprinkler system, and wait for 6 minutes). There are only about 8 types of stuff you can grow, initially you only have access to 4.

Moreover, once you settle with your ""first base vehicle"", you realize, that you can't really do much customization to mechanics, because system is oversimplified.

Some comparisons to other crafting games:
- Scrap mechanics is like space engineers, with everything oversimplified towards Volcanoids, also the universe is similar to volcations, empty grassland, with random structures and scattered resources.
- Subnautica has more complicated crafting schemes, but does not allow crafting of vehicles from scratch (for the best), but it has the rich story and exploration, that scrap mechanics doesn't have (At all. I mean it, no story, no exploration).
- 7 days to die - can't even compare the depth of crafting, 7dtd has multiple crafting stations, resulting in more than 1000 recipes, buildings have complicated structural integrity to add stability to building, over 300 different prefabs, lots of different biomes, lot of different enemies, injuries, armors, weapons, boosts etc. While Scrap mechanics like 50 recipes, no structural integrity, around like... 10 prefabs, one biome, no injuries, 4 types of enemies, no boosts, no armors, 4 (1 most of the time) different weapons?
- Satisfactory/Factorio - nothing in common. Scrap mechanics has no automation at all. Both games have horrible fighting system. But even so, Scrap mechanics beats them to it, having even duller fighting system.

To sum up, the idea is not too bad, but everything, except crafting your first vehicle is made half-assed, or even worse.

15391,yummy game but need more fun
15392,still a bit buggy but awesome creative fun.
15393,Very fun survival mode. Will be even better as updates come along.
15394,Its   in   built    but    still  its   so    heavenly   good
15395,Great game overall loved seeing this game evolve from the first day it came out I definitely recommend this game if you like building and exploring a vast open world
15396,its a good game but will be better once they add support for survival mods (instead of injections aka manually replacing files)
15397,"nice

15398,very good

15400,you can do fun things it this game i would recommend it for everyone.

kinda sad"
15402,"This game is pretty cool











































please leave my family alone"
15403,"It good
"
15404,"Great sandbox game. Not too hard to learn, EXTREMELY FUN!!!"
15405,I really like this game it can be fun to design things and make cool builds. Or if your like me you can take everything from the steam workshop which has a great and active community.
15406,Only played the game for 8 hours and have stopped playing it. But would definetly recommend for people that have friends and are creative. A bit sad review but thanks for reading it :D <3
15407,"noiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"
15408,"Reminds me of My Time at Portia, with more physics/engineering-based crafting (and no NPCs).   Multiplayer is a blast!  Awesome water and light effects, which is rare for a game that doesn't focus on that.  Randomized environment means unique rocks, trees, hills, lakes, mountains etc.  Doesn't have that, ""every tree looks the same"" problem.  Well polished game for still being in pre-release.  Extremely fun game, well worth the cost."
15409,totes yeet yo
15410,"IT WAS FUN BUT AFTER 29HOUR IT WOUNT STAR BECUASE OF A BUG THAT KEEP CRASHING ME GAME, PLEASE FIX BUGSPLAT BUG SO I CAN FINALLY PLAY THE GAME AGIN

"
15411,I has like game?
15412,"I like building transportation and more in the game. I like the base building survival type games. The game 7 Days to Die is my favorite game of all time and I see some great potential here. I already like what the game is and the dev is still adding more. If you like lego blocks and motors and such, you might enjoy this quite a bit."
15413,"incredible game, amazing graphics and environment."
15414,Its good making game ant thank god this game have mods
15415,"Loved screwing around and doing random crap, would love to see a bit more work done on optimization rather than content, as we don't really need more parts to do more stuff, just less limiters such as lag."
15416,This game is epic if you want to build stuff
15417,"Damn this game is addictive! Base/defense building games are not something I'm usually into, but Survival Mode keeps you engaged with new ideas and trying new things out!  There are a ton of YouTube vids out there so you can see what others are building and making happen, so there's a ton of stuff to try.  The number of things you can construct with a limited number of items is surprising, and you quickly realize that the complexity of your builds are almost unlimited!  The first time you build a vehicle that not only cuts down trees (or mines rocks) and not only picks up the material but processes and refines it opens up new vistas as building resources become easy to collect!

It surprised me that the game has been out as long as it has (over 4 years as of this writing) but the Devs are responsive and there is a steady stream of updates that make the game better and better!  Be sure you select the test build in the betas section of the game properties to get the good stuff!

10/10!"
15418,Very secsi game
15419,ree
15420,yes
15421,"I was honestly avoiding this game for a while because of the lack of content; however, even without much to work for right now, the designing and niche vehicle requirements for the tasks that you do have to complete has kept me coming back. I can't wait for further updates to come."
15422,I likes that this game is very adventorous and fun. i disliked that if you play with someone else and he is the host then its very laggy.
15423,Great game. Love it! You can do so much more than most creative/building games. The wiring in this game has so much possibility. Only problem i would say is that it can be a bit laggy but that's probably because my PC is not the best. If this game keeps getting updates it might actually be the perfect game.
15424,it's good to play with friends and have fun :)
15425,Alot of work needs to be done to survival just spent 7 hours making a car and its still not finished survival is way too realistic and buggy after the 7 hours of me making the car it went under the map total waste of time
15426,"It's a fun little game, but it needs some polish and optimizations."

15428,Addicting fun. :)
15429,"I'm sure it's better with friends, but I just didn't know what to do with myself solo. I apparently spent nearly 6 hours in the game, and my greatest accomplishment was a wonky car with crooked wheels that could barely move. 

I eventually found a proper garage with more advanced crafting options than crooked cars, so I went exploring for more materials to craft with. I filled my backpack exploring, couldn't find my way back to base, died, my backpack full of stuff despawned, quit, uninstalled. 

At no point during those 6 hours did I have much of an idea of what I should be doing, I didn't feel like I was making meaningful progress, and I didn't feel like I was particularly having fun. Hoping they polish the game up so I can revisit and revise my review."
15430,nice
15431,lol me make car go fast
15432,gud gem
15433,goooooooooooooooooooooooooood
15434,"I'd say that scrap mechanic is a good game, but survival isn't all that great yet, there used to be a thing where the enemy robots would'nt be able to break certain durabilities of blocks, but recently they fixed this so that now anything can break anything and can cost you huge amounts of resources, also the bot AI might be quite primitive since basically they take always a direct path towards you and attack any blocks in front of them which i must admit works fine but they can't calculate any path which allows them to avoid bashing blocks and therefore saving time, or can't apply any other tactics to entering like taking the weakest point in a wall and focusing damage there until there is a hole. this review might be outdated since i stopped playing about July because it became less fun when i got a spud gun, so the devs might have done this stuff, but this game has been in early access for 4 years, when games like raft which was developed by redbeet interactive who helped in this game and is doing great with raft. I understand that programming a whole 3D video game where the player has the capability of placing blocks and detonating bombs and killing bots with hundreds of particles in play is hard, very hard. but if your are going to make an amazing game like this one or raft, you might want to focus more on it. also just for valve corporation here: can you please add spellchecking to discussions and reviews when you are typing them out? thanks. 
BTW Axolot sorry for saying all this about your game i loved it but it got a bit less interesting after getting a spud gun, also i will still recommend this game since it was pretty good."
15435,"very epic played this for a long time and now ive upgraded pc, the expirience is even more enjoyable"
15436,poggies
15437,pay to win and kinda boring

15442,it is a great game for creative kids.

15445,very very fun
15446,1/10 too early access.
15447,little limitation to what you can create in this game. interesting learning curve to it with its mechanics
15448,there is a lot to do in this game and you can pretty much build anything. It does has quite a few glitches but they are still updating the games and also still adding new features. if your thinking about buying this then do it. its really good
15449,Only problem is optimization and crashing
15450,You can build a door

15454,"is a nice game
"
15455,"Here's some recommendations for updates to the game.
1: Never have the player run fresh out of gasoline or batteries for their fuel powered and electric cars.
2: Make it way more obvious if someone's attacking you from an angle where you're not looking.
3: Add reward mechanics for surviving waves of robots that detect unauthorized farming.
4: Allow the player to have full information of all parts required in recipes or in trading.
5: Show number percentages in health, hunger and thirst bars.
6: Change the fertilizer functions so they can be used 4 times before one of them vanishes into thin air."
15456,"yes indeed it is fun
"
15457,its a good game it would be a very recommended game for some body who likes Minecraft and Fortnite.

15459,Its cool game with free map

15461,"For starters, I just need to get this off my back. Now, to be honest. I have to say. I think that there are many games on the market that are great and amazing and good and really good. But, to be honest, my thoughts on this particular game are much different than of other games. this particular game, to be honest, has many features and technological advancements that tickle my fancy. there are many games on the market that, to be honest. i think this game. there are many. full diagnostic  investigation. get. thaat. dope! where da hoes at? 5/ stars. another one. where the. periods . at."
15462,Well good game graphics like creative and survival while writing this I have played for 69 hours was waiting for that amount of time to write this

15473,"Low frame rate, glitchy, too many bugs at this stage. It has potential."
15474,"Hey guys, i need some help, every map i create after getting to some point, like after spud guns and a truck with 7 or 8 collectors, the game crashes 5 min after starting, like first it crashes softly and suddenly the game just stops working, and it happens every single time and i dont want to create a new map when i already have most of the things i need on this one. Do you guys know how to fix it? My computer can run it smoothly, here are the main specs:

15502,"This is geme, like lot"
15503,"fun
"
15504,"So far this game has a very neat concept, and excellent game play mechanics. I think the survival update has been a really good feature added to the game to go along with the already existing creative mode, and I believe it has a lot promise if new content and mechanics are added within time. It is hard to make a sole judgement of a game when it is still in pre-release, however for being in pre-release I think this game has been excellent and I really am looking forward for future updates to expand survival!"
15505,it good 10/10
15506,"AMAZING
"
15507,"this game beat out minecraft for me, *still love minecraft though*"

15510,"The whole consept is great
"
15511,Good game if you like building
15512,ye
15513,is good
15514,One heck of a game! Tons of hours of fun. The creative outlet it offers is endless. The survival mode can be a lot of fun but takes a little bit of time to get to where you can really enjoy what scrap mechanic has to offer so I feel like most of the people looking for that survival experience might not stay long enough to really enjoy the automation of trivial tasks and building of interesting contraptions for all sorts of different things. Defense of your farm comes to mind. Gathering resources and traversing the world are two things you will start wont to get better at by creating new interesting machines to fit your style and needs. It has its draw backs don't get me wrong but its a solid game for the price.
15515,CUZ THIS GAME IS AMAIZING
15516,its good
15517,"A decent survival game with a somewhat aggravating building mechanic. Don't get me wrong, things work as designed, but it's more about trial and error than anything. The combat is my least favorite part of the game, I wouldn't mind the nightly enemy raids if attacking didn't feel so clumsy at times. Good enough to fuck around with friends but if you're looking for a more coherent, plot-driven type of survival game I'd look elsewhere."
15518,how open world the survival mode is
15519,its just great and versatile
15520,great game love it but it crashes
15521,A TOUCH LAGY AT TIMES BUT IT WAS FUN TO BUILD STUFF WITH MY FRIENDS.
15522,"Its a really fun game and i really do enjoy it... Although.

It has an extreme amount of bugs and the updates are extremely slow.
Although i can understand why the updates are slow so thats no issue.

I dont play much survival so i cant say much about it tbh although creative i have played allot and ngl it can be a tad bit funky at times.
Sure you might have allot of fun in creative i too enjoy creative however theres lots of times where it gets abit stressfull and borderline annoying when bugs, game flaws (Such as polygons getting stuck), lagg, etc. Makes it harder or just impossible for you to do certain things. 

On singleplayer it is quite fun although multiplayer almost does not exist.
You see you can play multiplayer sometimes however you will prob notice the game does not enjoy multiple creations in multiplayer and connection issues is a big issue aswell. Id say multiplayer and lagg are prob the two main issues.

The modding community and community in general in this game though is prob one of the best parts about it.
Lots of mods that all add extremely helpfull and cool stuff. No one is really toxic wich is always a good thing.

Building in the game is well fun and theres allot of things you can build. The map in creative is quite small though so creations such as planes have a very small area to fly in. Other then that though you can really get creative in the game and make some crazy stuff.

Tbh if i could i would rate the game in between yes and no. If you wanna try the game out i recommend you to do so.
If you like it you like it. Personaly for me i have a love and hate relationship with the game. (Although i dont literaly hate the game)

Now obv everyone has their opinion this is simply my opinion and no dont take it as hate cuz it aint."
15523,i built a mech so that's pretty epic
15524,everything
15525,is gooo

- Addictive automation options (loving my automated farm).
- Exploration and teamwork.

15530,"Price is worth it! constantly updating and doing an extremely good job at it, to the Devs: I really have no complaints, this is an amazing game and I've had very little issues, and this has a lovely community with amazing builders, please dont let this game die out"

15553,"Scrap Mechanic fits nicely the survival/building genre with an added spin on it with machines and robots.  I bought and played this with a friend. We started with the challenge mode (40 levels of increasing difficulty) and enjoyed it for a few hours, but got bored with the level design and vehicle construction.  Even though the levels changed, it felt as though we were doing the same thing over and over again with only moderate changes.  
So we tried the survival mode next.  It learned from other games: scattering harvestable items and chests, dropping your item bag upon death, and mobs that spread at night.  We got bored with this, too, though it may just be out attention span.  But, regardless, it didn't capture us immediately, and we felt like we were forcing ourselves to like it."
15554,"This game is very fun to play by your self or with friends. I love how you can create/build whatever you want. I highly recommend this game for who ever is interested in it. This game represents creative, challenges, and even survival. I recommend beginners to play the challenges to learn all the basics to the game. The game can be challenging but it is a really fun game to have fun on. FYI if you play with your friends, make sure you have good internet or it will be very laggy. Hope this helps!"
15555,good
15556,"Very good game! However, one important thing would be to multiply it! I‚Äôm missing a gyroscope from the game that‚Äôs in Space Engineering. I would imagine this with a third type of steering wheel seat that is needed for a flying structure. We would connect the Gyroscope to this. When we sit in we would see the crosshairs forward. From that moment on, the gyroscope would move the structure to move the mouse. Of course, gyro's strength, sensitivity, could be adjusted. Camera rotation by holding down the Alt key. This is perfect for Space Enineering. If you had this opportunity here too, it might become the best game! Flight stabilization is currently an unenjoyable, inaccurate labyrinth. With buttons and delayed movements, one quickly falls into it. He goes for a carriage ride on hills in the first steps, but after a while one desires more. For more serious flying structures. It‚Äôs just an idea for improvement if you want to bounce really big, upset people and become a big favorite. The possibilities of the game are uniquely good in my opinion anyway. What I'm missing, I wrote, would throw a lot at it!"

I bought this game when survival was announced, i enjoyed the game up until got the warehouses. everything felt good and fun to play up until then. the warehouses are the end game but they are WAY over balanced in favor of the ""workers"" getting two shot is really fun.  its even more fun when you round a corner to 3 workers and get instagibbed and cant get you gear back.  after almost 60hrs in the game it was actually enjoyable. but some SERIOUS balancing needs to happen before i return."
15609,Awesome and innovative game play with a wide range of self-made creations. With an open world and endless possibilities. Really looking forward to the updates to see how the story-line unfolds . . . . .

15652,"What i liked about this game is that its cheap. In this game you can do WHATEVER your heart desires but it wouldnt be easy, you kinda gotta practice since theres physics and gravity, and theres a survival mode!"
15653,"This game was really interesting. I will say that you should have an interest in engineering or something along those lines to really enjoy the game. For me, I wasn't the biggest fan of the game. I have few friends who like engineering and would recommend to them!"

15769,"This game is the best. If you can think it build it. No weapons? No vehicles? Build them, anything you can imagine, anything is possible, everything is possible. Want to fly your fav movie spaceship? Cruise the roads like road warrior? become the next leader in mass farming, logging or mining? or just create the next uber robot grinder? It can all happen here, and it's a very cheaply priced game for what is being purchased. A very awesome stable game. Very fun. Can't put it down. Enjoy."
15770,good good
15771,"This is good, very good."
15772,amazing

15775,"great game, love the freedom to build"
15776,Its a Really Good Game But its lagging and its freezing it wont respond
15777,"i love this game it is so fun expeshuly the new survival mode if only i had someone to play with that wood make it better
"
15778,"Aside from the very poor update schedule, this game does one thing wrong. Like all the other ""be creative"" type games, it offers great tools to be just that. And then they have a ""survival mode"", which is why I bought it. 

The problem being the game does not offer a lot of ""problems"" for you to creatively solve. There's only really 3 things you'll ever need.

Build a stone harvester, build a wood harvester and build a transport vehicle for the veggies you need to deliver. 

If you're extra fancy, you can build an automated watering/fertilizing machine. But that's it. Nothing else is ever needed. Sure you can build airships and rockets and whatever else you can imagine. But I can do that in sandbox. In a survival mode, I want to be presented with problems I can then solve with my creativity.

No game in this genre really offers this, and I hate it."
15779,yes i made a car woooo
15780,i love it because you can have your creativity run wild but it would be cool if there was a browsing system for online
15781,great game. love it!

15787,Recommend to everyone that likes engineering. If you are thinking of buying this watch videos first.
15788,"After 20 hours of survival mode, farming and grinding. I experience my first warehouse. The Tape bots do too much dmg, and yh sure they take 1 hit to kill, we are not all 360 no scope twitch aim shroud pros. After a few deaths, i get the gist of the 1st floor, and make my way up to the second. upon entering i see a an alcove/vent opening which may hold some loots! (YAY) sadly no loot, and on my way out, i get completly stuck. No jump, crouch or any sort of movement gets me free. So my options are limited to starving to death and come back up. Upon respawning and moving towards the lift, i notice all the tapebots outside have also respawned. This causes a few more deaths as my potatoes are on my body on the 2nd floor of the warehouse. After many attempts, i finally get inside and make my way to the 2nd floor. I go to the marker where my dropped stuff is and its spazzing out behind the wall and I cant retrieve it. it moves back and forth behind the wall, im praying the wall will spit it out. I start to starve again. I hit ALT F4 and uninstall the game.

Game is fun, lacks balence, no map/compass (got lost for 2 hours) I feel like the survival mode was just slapped on top of the game just for the sake of having it.
Reccommend waiting for updates to play survival."
15789,bald
15790,i like the creativity aspect
15791,This is a GREAT game although I only have 40 hours so far I can already tell I love this game it is super fun to play and it can be played on almost anything. So basically yeah I recommend this game a lot.

The mechanics can take some getting used to and can be challenging to a new player going in blind but once the basics are figured out then the rest if the game is fine.

100% if you are creative type you should check this game out!"

Will set this game down for some months to let development happen.  Be aware that your saves can be easily corrupted, and stay out of warehouses."
15836,"Really good. You can build all kinds of great machines, like mechs, wind-up toys, car lifters, and more! And if you're not in a creative mood, there's bombs to fuel your destructive needs. The community has many creations  and mods to share, so definitely give it a try!"

15921,"Woaw as a patch update you have done something to your coding because nothing works right. Bearings go whatever direction they want, tires and engines do what they want, this game is working toward the boneyard.

vvvPre 2021vvv
As an early access game I am very happy with what I am seeing. Very excited to see where the creators and developers go with this before the full release.

UPDATE
Game used to be fun granted it still works in its current state as it was left with its somewhat stable physics if you set it to advanced. Not sure why or how but the devs have decided the little news about development approach is best for its community, while the entire community is going back and forth at each other over whether or not the devs are still working on it. Seems like devs have zero care for their community, develop things that make the community go ""You went that route?"" (Like stupid clothing articles that do nothing for hit-points or protection in the first place. The game is under developed and behind as far as its community is concerned. I had high hopes for this game but with the lack of information I guess we can deem this a lost cause..."
15922,"another incredible game that is worth the money, if you find this boring fast you might have adhd or something i mean this thing gangsta as making rally cars n shit so much fun 9.69/10"

"
15924,gg
15925,"Its super fun and creative, could spend hours, a little demanding though"
15926,"This game is brilliant.

But at the same time it is also broken. When you go co-op everything you do ( and I do mean everything ) makes it lag
and ""bug"" out. There is no minimap,so navigation is harder than it needs to be. I feel like a minimap would be a great add!

The gameplay is solid. You feel like some of the bigger poi`s lack in content while still not presenting a ""clear"" goal of what you need to do. You tend to forget why you went there in the first place! ( Well,I did ) 

Is has truly great potential. But for every positive it`s easy to find a negative. Rendering this game one of those you want to play,but choose not to.

If it`s on sale. I recommend picking it up. I also feel like soloplay is the better alternative for now. Hopefully they can mend this matter asap."

15963,would't recomend if you have't got friends to play this with as i died alot on my own and there for got bored till i played with my blayt friend then it was fun
15964,amazing game to let creativity flow and build what you desire
15965,"Neebs Gaming made it so fun to watch that we decided to play for ourselves! It's really cool! We even specialize, like one person makes the cars and the other takes care of the farm, etc."

15967,I enjoy playing this game especially with the amount of creativity put into it.
15968,This game is amazing
15969,yes very
15970,A fun game to try out.
15971,words can not describe he fun I had when I launched the game

15977,"I really like this game and I am glad that developers are still hard working to make game better. I am glad that they repair problem with being stucked between objects. But there is still one big problem and that is lagging for guests (Joined players) of game/server. I will be glad if this game was developing after early acces too and adding interesting features to improve our playing (like: more clothes; interactive parts; variegated shop, enemies and buildings of maybe other types of looting and with different obstacles; map; improve underwater world (caves; creatures; treasures; buildings) and maybe add some interactive parts for submarine-types); lot of ""upgrading-phases). Thanks a lot for a great game with big potential! I had lot of fun and I believe i will have much more!"
15978,"Hello everybody looking in this rewiew :)
I will start of with pros.:
-Very good game design
-Intuitive build system - easy buiding, but you can build even complex creations
-Finally survival
-Possibility to change clothes
-Easy modding (It isn't so hard :) )
-Often updates
-Good price
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the cons:
-You need very decent computer to run this game (I have PC, that accepts recommended requirements)
- [spoiler] Yes, there is survival, but no ENDING to it [/spoiler]
-Scrap parts aren't in inventory ( without a modification )
- [spoiler] Bots AI is sometimes stupid [/spoiler]
-No map yet ( navigational map )
-Doesn't work on Mac OS and Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, there is alot of pros. and a bit more cons. (The cons. aren't too bad, the only one bad is the OS support)
Final Rating:
Gameplay: 9.5 / 10
Building: 10 / 10
Modding: 7.8 / 10
Requirements: 7.4 / 10 ( if you use the worst graphics, you can run it on standard laptop )
Fun: 10 / 10
Limitations: 7.9 - Your PC

15979,spud gun go pew pew
15980,great game
15981,"This game is very fun and well thought out. Playing it and building things really works your brain in a way that a lot of people don't get on a normal basis, that is one of the reasons I love it! I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes to work with mechanical things or tinker on stuff. Great game, its a must have!"
15982,I love this game even tho I'm not that good at it. I am leaning and it is a fun game.
15983,its a really good game
15984,its an amazing game and i was able to make a crazy ufo with no expiriance
15985,"i love this game already played it for 20 hours
"
15986,fun
15987,"I think this game is great, it takes a little while to figure out how to build. You can play it with friends if you want, or by yourself. If you can't build, you can download builds from the steam workshop. Also, most bad reviews are because of game being laggy. That is completely fair, but it's enjoyable as long as you make sure you don't have a lot of creations or bearings in the world. The physics engine isn't the best, but it is still fun. There's also some bugs but most that I've encountered haven't made the game worse. The native mod support for this game is really nice, it comes with a modding tool as well. I haven't tried to mod the game myself so I'm not sure how hard it is to create one, even still there's a ton of good mods out there"
15988,its decent i guess
15989,its fairly decent
15990,ff
15991,"For everyone new to the game! I will explain what scrap mechanic is about
an how to play. Scrap mechanic's creative mode is about building to the limit an creativity.""You can invent new invention's in creative or test out survival blueprint's"".Survival mode is a game mode where you have hunger an thirst an a health bar.Like many survival game mode's scrap mechanic's survival has enemy's these enemy's are robots.Scrap mechanic's survival is where you‚Äôre stranded on a faraway agriculture planet where the Farmbots working the fields have gone haywire. With your tool belt tightly fastened, there‚Äôs only one way to survive: using your quick thinking, creativity and a wily knack of turning your surroundings to your advantage!
Now to how to play WASD for controlls crouch is ctrl an run is shift right click to remove 1 block an hold right click an drag to remove multible the same goes for placing blocks i to access your inventory. You should use the mechanic's handbook in creative for a more indepth explanation!
I'm sure the Devs hope your gameplay is best."
15992,fuck ya play the game seviviols beter pro tip play with 1 to 2 players canting you get food set up another pro tip tomats and carts only give you a good amont of ether food or water go with bits they fill up both anther tip is don't make scrap wails tip to make the rigler weels there you go now get your ass playing or face the ratj of the mechank
15993,you can beat up bots
15994,great game
15995,"My creativity has been unleashed. Scrap Mechanic, you know what I mean and that's why I'm not going to spoil the game for people like me who like scrolling through the reviews. BUT, there are a few things I have a problem with that mean I would make this only a 4-star rating. If you fix the following, the game will be practically perfect: 1. When I want to mess with the game (I do this a LOT), it lags like hell and I usually have to end the process ScrapMechanic.exe. 2. This isn't something you have to deal with, I just trolled you; there's only ONE thing you have to change, and that's the lag from certain things like models from the lift and when we make too many super-fast spinners. Fix that,this would be a 5-star rating. I don't have a beefy PC, so please fix this! And I've only played seven hours..."
15996,good
15997,its fun to play
15998,"love this game! so glad they released survival, use your imagination in this game and go wild!"
15999,Decent game although me and my friends got bored after playing for 25hrs total. The survival aspect of this game takes too long to advance.
16000,Bruh like u can build thomas the tank engine if u want
16001,"decent game. allows creativity in many ways. you could build a car that turns into a box on the press of a button, or even a working calculator. 

My only issue is with ground collisions and suspension. occasionally, you just glitch into a wall or through the ground. sometimes, your vehicle decides it wants to mess up collisions and violently shakes to the sky limit."
16002,its good
16003,its very good
16004,"Crafting, and fighting robots. what's not to like?
The free-form build whatever you can imagine is so awesome. Want to build a car with 20 wheels and 5 engines, go for it. Want to build a perpetual death machine with spinning arms, saws, and drills, go for it. =)"

16015,very great game played since 2018 i recommend playing it
16016,Roughly 16 hours in and having fun. Crafting gets complex and things aren't labelled well - so you're comparing recipes to one another by looking at pictures. ...and a lot of things look similar. Improved inventory labeling and naming would be a good thing.
16017,"the new update for survival is great at surface, but made the game so laggy its unplayable. 

the hours i spent are from the older versions..."
16018,good
16019,Its ok i guess
16020,yes
16021,"scrap mechanic is the perfect game if you ever played with Legos and thought to yourself. i wish i was a Lego guy/girl but the Lego games are too linear. literally build anything you can dream up with patience, knowledge, and skill any build is possible in this game.

my only con is that its a PC monster, the bigger and more complex your builds get the more you'll lag. survival leaves me wanting a bit on that front as you're constantly building more to make a more and more secure base and then when it gets attacked the bots drop the frame rates pretty low. this is easily shadowed by the fact that the game is literally only limited by your imagination. keep dreaming and keep building"
16022,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
16023,I PLAY IT WITH MY FRENDS AND WE RALY ENJOY IT

16039,because yes
16040,its fun but a little hard to get the hang of
16041,its good because in survial you can join freinds and help each other
16042,This game has the occasional performance issue but that's to be expected with an early development game like scrap mechanic but the gameplay is so worth the occasional frame drop definitely worth every penny
16043,"I waited almost 3 years for the survival update and i say worth it. It's kinda grindy, but the number of things you can do is infinitive. Great game, I recommend it!"

16055,i think this game is fun because i have always liked the engineering type games. sometimes i get so in the game next thing i know hours went by
16056,10/10 survival mode is the best
16057,"its a game
"
16058,I love this game its a lot different from other games I have And the warehouse is the tricky part and one of the hardest features in the game and I now like killing farm bots even going solo just keep shoting your gun and boom and Quite takes some time to build a good base over an hour for me to get a basic little base so lets watch out for the next update!!!!!
16059,gg
16060,Awesome game. Love it.
16061,Great game but takes a bit load up but otherwise amazing game.
16062,meow
16063,"This is not just another typical boring survival game.
If you can think it you can build it.
Flying, Driving, Boating, climbing, hover, the list goes on and on and even on.
Forget about the old school games like Ark and medieval building/survival rubbish.
This is the future of games the possabilities are endless they really are.

100/10 Great game"
16064,"Really good game. Lots of stuff to do, and so creative. Great game I recommend!"
16065,nice like it
16066,its really fun to play and it cost money its worth it tho its so much fun to play and you can play with friends and there still coming out with the best updates ive seen yet
16067,A lovely game for when you just want to relax and create. The new Survival mode is also great for when you want a challenge in your creativity.
16068,38qy7dfsr3hb32tvyh
16069,I thought this game would get less laggy after it got out of beta but i just recently started playing it again on a better pc than i used to play it on and it is even worse. I don't recommend you buy this game even tho i like the concept of the game; the sad reality is the game physics are absolute trash
16070,i love this game!!!!!
16071,"A fun, cheerful, creative experience that doesn't bore or stress you."
16072,"i recommend this game to people who like building things survivle and to people who like looking at what other 
people have built"
16073,It is an okay game if you like bulding than this is a game for you but I dont care for it
16074,this game is best if you want to be creative and are into mechanical games

16081,yes
16082,this is a great game that lets you really enjoy the extent of what it means to have limitless possibilities. 9/10 its so much fun
16083,nice game
16084,"Fun and easy to get into. You can play creative and build vehicles, structures and more!"
16085,Amazing
16086,Pretty boring unless you have like 2 more people to play with.
16087,yes
16088,Good:)
16089,"although has some bugs, I haven't found any other game that allows me to make as strange and wacky creations as this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to start a tank fight, create flying toilets, make potato miniguns, create a calculator, or construct a machine that smacks players into the void"
16090,best game of mechanical creativity
16091,its a great game
16092,good game hade lots of fun
16093,i like the game over all just the crashes are not very fun to deal with. I would recament you have a strong computer or laptop
16094,yes
16095,it is not as fun if you want it you can get it but i don't like this
16096,havent played it much but is a nice game to have fun but with firends is the best way to play it

16103,Good Game.
16104,yes
16105,its a veary fun building game its SO SO SO fun
16106,i love the way you can build anything in creative and it can move! now with survival im going to be playing alot more but havent played yet.
16107,"While this game still needs a bit of work with some bug fixes, I really enjoy the freedom to build and explore whatever and however you choose. The game is varied enough and challenging enough to keep things interesting."
16108,"this game is very poorly optimised. when you spawn in a large enough creation, your frames drop and physics break. the survival mode update was delayed so much and even when it was released it was not worth the wait, and is also very grindy and boring. in the vanilla game you can only bind things to your hotbar so planes and other things are very hard to make. i could go on and on with these problems. if it has some updates i might change this but its just not worth the cons at this time. overall a meh game with friends. just get trailmakers if you want a game like this."
16109,yesa
16110,it a great creative building game

16120,This Game is so Fun!
16121,"I bought this game in 2017 after watching some Youtube videos about it and tested it. 
I really didnt like it as I wasn't very good at building machines,
But with the addition of Challenge Mode and Survival Mode I find Scrap Mechanic very enjoyable.
With Challenge Mode I learned to do different types of vehicles for different situations so now I understand better what to do and when.
And with the Survival Mode I dont have to worry of doing shitty vehicles as I do what I can with the materials I have.
So today I give this game a 9/10 
This is subjective as I would like to get more tutorials on the game but I know that there's people that wants to explore by their own."
16122,survival is very interesting.
16123,"the visuals in this game are GORGEOUS!  and it's fun as hell.... until you start to build.  the building UI is a gong show.  you can't tell how your part are oriented without a TON of camera twirling; you basically rotate until the parts seem to line up... then hope and click.  the logic connexions are very easy BUT the UI, again, is horrible.  HUGE dots cover all the parts so you can barely see what you're connecting.  in Survival, the stack sizes are ridiculously tiny and so you are CONSTANTLY going in and out of your inventory (which is generous, thank heaven) and dragging stuff into your hotbar (yup, only one).  so... if you can handle those major hiccups, this is a really fun game."
16124,"I made space ship
"
16125,Your a Mechanic that likes Scrap
16126,"This game is a lot of fun. Think Raft x Minecraft. It's still in beta so there are bugs, it lags and crashes sometimes. But if you can get past that stuff it's a heap of fun. Currently playing a survival map with a few friends and it's so much fun! A better way to invite friends to your game, and less lag when playing with others would be amazing. But overall, its super fun and a really creative game."
16127,def recomend it to custom builders like me where you can build your designs however you want
16128,Very decent game. It has potential that is still being used. Very easy to pour hours into tinkering.
16129,good

16134,"for me, i watched neebsgaming play this game and i decided to give it a try and man i should have started with this game ages ago, i defenitly recommend this game to anyone"
16135,"I love this game until 200 hours and the game started crashing due to bad optimising, i was building a mansion with truck a helicopter and at least 20 item chest then i put one of the fishes in the pond near my house boom end of game, couldn't get it to work after that so i had to loose everything and start again wounded lost my truck and it had indicators and stuff lol so so wounded! but 200 hours is more than I've got out of any game so far it really was so much fun couldn't leave it alone just got a bit disheartened after loosing my stuff.I thought whats the point! but at 200 hours i can safely say i had my money out of it which you cant say about a lot of other games out there 30 hours in and the customers irelevent thanks for a epic game hope it gets stronger its addictive and id recommend it all day long even though i lost my truck with indicators and stuff lol <3"

The truth is I LOVE it, and I get so sucked in I don't even realize how much time passes by.  I liked it so much that I bought a second license on another account so I could play this with my kids (they love it to!)  I haven't even played survival or challenge mode yet, I have just enjoyed creative mode!  I can't wait to see where the devs take this game."

I tried reaching the devs multiple times but they never reached back / fixed the issue. Luckily it got fixed at some point at least. Anyway, love the game, I wish the devs loved it just as much as me."
16148,This game is amazing. im not saying this becuase i was payed or something. I just love this game. Ive wanted to get this since it firsdt came out but when survival hit i got it. This game is fun when im just by myself or wehn im with someone.

16173,This game is pretty fun but it whould be more fun with friends :(
16174,"this game alowes me to put 134 manican hands on a car, id say that this game is pretty cool"
16175,"Absolutely Fantastic, I can see such potential with this game. A nice slow steady start and a gradual build. It's satisfying on so many levels. I'm eager to truly explore the building potential. I'm about 5 hrs in and I can't put it down. I'm not sure what sort of difficulty the computer NPC bots will offer as I progress, but they're well balanced as of now. I highly recommend."

16182,"A game with a satisfactory satire story about a Sunni Islam family living their lives as Infadels in Shi'a Persia. The family must avoid secret police to stay alive in their daily lives.  Just as the story begins, the father, Bashar, is drafted into Iran's militia, Hezbollah to fight in the Syrian Civil war. 2 Weeks after his unit set off from your small village, news arrives the transport your father was on was struck, and all the militia inside died. Now, your mother, Salouni must juggle her personal duties while also grieving her husband, as well as take care of you, the player. As you grow older the player must make decisions about whether they let fear overtake them, and employ the likes of radicalization and revenge, or live a the peaceful life, taking care of your now old mother. The climax of the story leaves players on the edge of their seat, with 3 seperate endings including: escaping Iran through the straight of Hormuz by boat, being shot in the Syrian desert just like your father, and even a secret third ending! 10/10, amazing game."
16183,great

16203,"As you can see, I have over 100 hours in this game. I would say the game is a good game overall, but for my personal experience, I don't enjoy survival games without friends. For me, friends are 90% of the game's content and happiness it brings. With the time I've played with my friends, I would say it has lots of stuff to do, and is an amazing game, both Creative & Survival"

16213,Amazing game I've had it for 2 years and not many problems but I built a small tank type of vehicle and it crashed my PC giving me a blue screen with a sad face which is not idle and this has happened more than once. Like I said great game I have fun playing it but In a creative blank world with a tiny vehicle and it crashed my PC I mean that has to get fixed. Out of 10 I give this game a 8/10.
16214,"l I hate this game üòÖ Things that can really FU the framerate are the watercontainer, lots of barrens on a build and logic gates. Mostly for the people that don‚Äôt host. We lost one friend on the way because the game got unplayable for him the bigger and more complex our builds got. This is my new Minecraft üòç We Exchange the save trough Dropbox so everyone can host the same savefile and play when they want."
16215,Bing Bong
16216,I really love the game and how technicle it is
16217,"This game has huge potential. A physics based survival/engineering game offering unlimited creativity. There's not a lot you CAN'T create in this game. Cars, Boats, Planes, Robots, Mining Equipment, Houses, Weapons, can all be completely custom built from the ground up. The building is intuitive and feels incredibly gratifying, transitioning easily from building and testing your creation. 

The survival aspect is very fun (You can stage raids AND get raided), but it is still clearly incomplete. After establishing a home base, a garden, building your first few vehicles, getting guns, and going out on your first raid, the game turns into a cyclical grind-athon. If you want to build anything out of high-quality materials, you'll be spending hours doing the harvesting. This repetitive portion of the game will likely be fixed once a complete story has been added to the game, so I still completely recommend Scrap Mechanic. Just know, if you are buying the game to play the survival mode, it will only stay interesting for 15-30 hours. I am anxiously awaiting more updates. 

Pros:
- Unlimited creative potential
- Physics are fun and intuitive
- Wicked fun in multiplayer
- Gameplay is tight and responsive 

Cons:
- Survival is Incomplete 
- Big lag with more than 4 players
- Grind-athon
- General early access bugs (Not much of a con)"
16218,Fun but takes time to learn.

16224,"Good, but updates and communication are very rare."
16225,I really like this game
16226,I think this is the best game I have ever played on steam but it does have a couple of glitches in the survival mode and Is definitely worth it I rate 5 stars. If you are creative I would suggest getting it.If not this game is not the game for you.
16227,"Great game, love what they did with it, 9/10, could use some multiplayer optimizatios"
16228,good
16229,Little rough on the survival yet but getting better with each patch. great game overall even then.
16230,great game. fun and creative once you've learnt how to play. and even if you havn't  downloading other peoples creations from the steam workshop can be just as fun.
16231,"its pretty cool, just make sure your computer can run it"

If you want to buy this game for its creative nature and building mechanical things, get stormworks build and rescue.
If you like bright colors,  have fun watching camodo gaming and sucking on your pacifier."

16291,"They are short. I hate short people. except me, I am the exception, the Sigma of society."
16292,"It's immense fun... Until it crashes. And it crashes quite often. You'll know it happens when it freezes once and lets you play for another second or two before becoming completely unresponsive. And it only does this on a world with more than 3 creations, If I start a fresh one with just a basic vehicle it's fine. It's once I build more (I'm constantly experimenting with vehicle suspensions, and aside from the offroad suspension glitching out and yeeting my vehicles into the air it's generally fine) that it becomes unstable and freezes up. Also it would be nice to be able to enter worlds with mod parts that have been removed from the community pages. That's incredibly annoying, putting in many hours creating a base and vehicles with mods only for them to be removed and all that work is for nothing since I can't load into the world anymore. That needs to be fixed."

16328,"|: Axolot has made a false-claim about ""occasional-crashes"" and: has a terrible-communication-ethic. :Particularly with pissed-players like me. :So, I have two-accounts; ~800-hours in Creative and: second-account is strictly-survival=~1094.8-hours over ~31-d, ~6h, ~12m. :~5-days-ago I lost all of that when the game crashed CONSECUTIVELY ~5-times within the span of ~10-min. :All of those crashes where accompanied by a Bug-Spalt-window, which I sent in the reports. :When the game became stable, started working on addition to my-second-base, CRASH! :This time NO Bug-Splat-window, I have not been able to open that file since.

If you lose something you needed because you died, suddenly it takes four hours to retrieve it turning this game from a building game into a running game.

16352,"This game is very cool especially in survival mode. Although, it takes a lot of materials to build, it is still really fun to play and create your own machines to become more efficient and faster."
16353,"""I have continuously reached out to Axolot about the mound of faults of this game with absolutely no-comprehensive-correspondence-back concerning a solution. For the record, I have over ~4000-hours of play-time between ~two-accounts, so I know exactly what I'm talking about. Before I began, let's review some of the SHIT I had to deal with playing this PAID-FOR-GAME; 

The Beginning;
~1: When Survival released, I opened a new-Steam-account and purchased the game again. I wanted to start fresh with just a Survival-Character, aside of this main-account. While I was at my base one-session I got a weird-glitch, then super-lag, then noticed  had like ~5-Hammers and ~4-Lifts in my bag, that I could not delete, because you can't delete TOOLS or drop them, you can only transfer it to a chest! I begged Axolot for weeks about that issue. They finally addressed it, somewhat. To this DAY I still have a extra-lift on LogI.Q.-Tech's-account hidden in a damn-chest in a Haybot-facility. Sorry, ~TWO, because my buddy, had the same issue and dropped his lift in world.

~2: Crashes;
The game has always had potential to crash, however before the major crash, I got more weird-glitches. As I was driving during one-session, my entire-car VANISHES while I'm driving and during this session, I had over ~6-crashes in a ROW! The nail was put in the coffin, when I was working on a mobile-base, I went to add a block to my creation, CRASH! That game has never opened since. We are talking a massive-base, mass amount of work, along with ~10-vehicles, GONE!

~3: Persistent and Mounting-Faults; 
I was pissed, still pissed about the loss of that world. So, I start a NEW-WORLD, with LogI.Q.-Tech. This is where it gets just unacceptable. I got one-massive-farm-base near the crashed-ship, and built another full-farm-base near the Mechanic-Shop. This base has a total of ~7-farm; ~4-Auto-farms of which ~three are continuously-running and ~3-Semi-Auto-Farms. I'm working on the base, I go to place a block, and my ENTIRE BASE, pops loose from the ground! This drops my frame-rate to ~1, and it takes my near ~TWO-HOURS to the base in the correct-position. This occurs ~5-more-times, once during an upcoming RAID!
This made me totally stop adding any more blocks to that base, so it's sitting unfinished because I don't know if the damn-thing will pop loose. 

Mounting/Compounding-Faults;
~A: Rock-Node-Faults; 
When mining certain Rock-Nodes a very-annoying and time-wasting-glitch will cause your wheels to flop-outwards, creating a situation where you vehicle bottom-out, resting the chassis on the ground and can't move. To add the lag/frame-rate-drop created when mining rocks and trees is just terrible! What should take minutes, takes hours. The cause of this is there are multiple-copies, in certain sections of the rock, fused within each other. For sample, if you sheer of a section of rock and start drilling it, an exact-copy of that section will pop out, still leaving the same section. There can be up to ~three fused-copies within a section.

~B: Piston and Bearing-Faults; 
 Piston are one of my favorite contraptions, but they are also the most susceptible to serious, serous-faults. Piston have a tendecey to pulse without warning or in other words actuate/extend with tremendous force constantly and with complex-creation this can cause major-havoc. This explosion-outward of the Piston can force parts its attached to to fuse with other structure-blocks, making a serious conundrum, forcing the player to nearly dis-assemble the set-up to free-it from the rest of the structure. 

~C: Dis-Lodging of Structures from the Ground; 
As I stated earlier, this happened numerous-times with LogI.-Q.-Tech's-farms, and ~yesterday this happened again on this account! This seems to happen in certain locations. The cause seems to be blocks on the structure that are below the ground or anything on the structure that goes underground has the potential to dis-lodge the entire structure. 

~D: Random Player Dis-Mounting from Vehicles; 
This fault is the most annoying of all. If you drive in Survival at speed, meaning at a nice-clip, my vehicle will completely vanish, I will fall to the ground, the vehicle will re-appear an roll over me, HARD and fast. This is a CONSTANT fault and only happens when at high-speeds. Whats curious is that when this happens, all the wheels will be turned when the vehicle re-appears, and soon as you jump back in the seat, the correct. 

~E: Switch and Logic-Setting-Faults; 
When you place a switch and you leave it on, it should stay, ON. However with this game, and it is sooooo random, guess depends on where the switch is placed, if you leave a switch ON, and then log to the Main-Menu, log back-in, that switch will be OFF! Repeater-circuits, those commonly used for firing Spud-Cannons, well if you are using that bit=AND>NAND>TIMER>AND to flash a light of whatever, if you log to the Main-Menu and log-back-in the repeater will be in a glitch, flickering wildly! The only way to stop it is to cut the switch set to it or re-connect the gates. 

~F: Lag or Frame-Rate-Drops; 
This claim that you can build anything is a straight LIE. Oh you can, but get ready for massive lag or frame-rate-loss, which will affect your play experience. This is common with driving large-creations, or driving near large-creations like a base, will cause one of these faults. 

: Conclusion; 
This game has been in BETA on Steam since ~2017 and when you look at the core, nothing has actually been accomplished. Axolot is asking us to PAY for a BETA-version that they treat as a FULL-LAUNCH-TITLE. How you ask? The base game, Scrap-Mechanic: Creative was basically complete before Survivals introduction. The game should have come out of BETA ~two-years ago, released as Scrap-Mechanic with Creative and Challenge-Mode. Instead, Axolot is taking advantage of Steam ultra-lenient BETA-policies. These faults I have listed are persistent in both of my-accounts and I have created a hub which contains video-documentation of these faults that Axolot refuses to address.

16390,"its a good game and will keep you in the fun zone for a long time look up a few things to build when your board.
with the new survival update it has gotten better good job Scrap Mechanic developers."
16391,"its a fun creative sandbox game
"
16392,Very fun
16393,kinda bad game ngl
16394,"i fix shit
"
16395,very awesome game i love it everything you can do in it very awesome
16396,
16397, ghfgfdkop
16398,it is
16399,Its a great crafting game!
16400,Awesome
16401,"survival is great, and so was the original"
16402,its awsome you can let out your creativity
16403,fun
16404,its a awsome game from free building the only issue i have is bags despawning in surviaval
16405,Today I've played for 100 hours. What can I say... that was a tiring day.
16406,Very good game I love playing it only one problem I can't play creative mode every time I try it crashes the game I don't know if it if because of the newest update or what but that is my only complaint
16407, A
16408,adFFF
16409,"Game has no business having lag spikes like this even in early access, seems to load textures direct from disc instead of caching them in ram like any other game would rightfully do. Also for a game about building creations and neat structures, it doesn't take much to cripple the game at all..."
16410,yes
16411,good game. it very good
16412,Best game i have ever played on steam besides among us i would recommend this to any one looking to create and and build all a good game and verry fun.
16413,"Great game overall, but it can use some work. I've had a lot of lag and rubber banding in multiplayer, that is non -existent in singleplayer. Also, the framerate drasticlely decraeases when two creations collide."
16414,I have been enjoying this game very much.  a few updates would make it even better.  perhaps a discoverable map or at least exposing a map as you explore the world.  4 out of 5 for me.
16415,the game
16416,yes but would be nice if there were more help to the game..have to you tube to find anything on what to do and there is no darn map 0_0
16417,the physics are great and you can make anything  also with chapter 2 coming out soon the game will get better as it updates
16418,i enjoy the game but you cant play it offline
16419,Very good game
16420,ITS FUN AND ENJOYABLE AND SOOOOO PEACEFUL
16421,"nicw
"
16422,its fun because you can make almost any thing you want in this game
16423,idk
16424,I love the Game mechanics and The creative freedom but the game is hard to pick up and it is missing some things in the tutorial like how to weld multiple points on the same creation.
16425,yes
16426,it is really fun to mess around with your friends and try to build cars and houses and machines and other stuff so basically it is a very very very very FUN GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16427,"Best game ever!

How I healed the word after continuosly crashing after world load in test branch:

1.) Resign from the beta program and let the game update to normal version.
2.) Start game and load your world. In my case the time was frozen and it was early morning so I could go out and make wood all time long. But when the time is frozen, there are no additional bots and no loot
3.) Re-assign to the beta programm and select the test branch. Again let Steam do the update.
4.) Start game and load your world. Everything was fine then.
"
16428,Now its even greater with survival 10 star game
16429,very creative way of building
16430,i am mechanic
16431,
16432,"You crash land on a farming world. The local robots have gone rogue and hate anyone, especially if they are growing food. You'll have to protect yourself while also building up a stockpile of resources to build sweet vehicles and bases. Both of which you'll need to continue to progress and get even more resources. Eventually you grow large enough to be able to go through dungeons of sorts to get the endgame items. Along the way you'll have met many friends, most of which are alien cows, and discovered a new love for building."
16433,its just so good
16434,good
16435,this is a game where you can beat up robots and make robots to help you or just build things and you can also do challenges made by other people and you can play with other people that are your friends i enjoy this game
16436,its a fun game and you can bulid what ever your want 1 out of 10 more like 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 out of 1
16437,LOVE IT EAT IT CHEW why do i say things
16438,YES
16439,mmmmmmmmMMMMMMmmmmmmMmmmmmmmmmmicrowave
16440,yes
16441,Play it. It is good game.
16442,Very pog Ok
16443,"Many years later and the game is still lackluster. The core of the game is building, but for that it is lacking the most basic features like copy-pasting parts, symmetric editing or even an undo/redo option. Story is almost non-existent and I could not find any goal to work towards. This game is best suited for creating dorky YouTube videos."
16444,fun with people meh by yourself
16445,mhm
16446,ScrapMan
16447,very good game also check out games on youtube if you want reccomendations so just watch the videos and thats where i get my games from so yeah anyways download and comment if you did aswell as comment how good it was to you i think i will get notifications so anyways go subscribe to jelly kwebblecop and slogo crainer and nathie aswell as ctop and churu idk how to spell it and yeah go sub i assume only youtubers get games for free and i will consider those people youtubers so yeah comment if you are a youtuber and if you check the box that says that you got it for free comment if you did
16448,yes buy it
16449,"GOOD
"
16450,Bus
16451,too glitchy to be fun.
16452,"Great game.....but would be awesome if it has it's own storyline....crafting and exploring without any mission kinda meaningless....no NPC and boss to fight.....without all these, this game will be another on-off kinda game...."
16453,Yes
16454,"it is a free world game, you can download basically any mod you want,"
16455,I liked multiplayer but thing's i didn't like is if u join ur friend or if they join u when u or they walk it's kinda buggy and every time u hold a some type of drink or food they t-pose
16456,"its good
"
16457,"lots of fun, a small learning curve at the begin but it is worth it especially when you get to build amazing creations like hover cars and boats."
16458,yeye
16459,I think it is good but it needs better optimization
16460,fun
16461,yes yes
16462,"its great, its fun, and its all around amazing i love the main aspect of creative, the world generation  however the game is kinda hard for me to run and i have a intel 8th gen core i5 cpu and a gtx 1650 gpu so i would only recomend it to those who have a good rig"
16463,yes i would recommend this but if you have a slow pc it takes a long time to load and is kinda laggy just letting you know but this is a great game i love it
16464,"I think that Scrap Mechanic is a really fun sandbox game. If you want to play one where you can build any mechanism you want then this game is for you. I feel like survival mode is a bit hard, but it is also fun. I would definitely recommend this game to others."
16465,iz gud
16466,This game is epic
16467,this is an amazing game strongy recommended
16468,i cant unistall the game because i hid it and now it is laggy
16469,"similar to factoriio, but different
this game is not for the weak-miinded"
16470,I liike the free flowing gameplay
16471,its so fun u can bulid ANYTHING
16472,"hours of work lost cause this pile of dog shit crashed, dont know who made this but they are evil"
16473,ITS GOOD
16474,its hard to make cars but raft is way beter
16475,"Creative is a blast.
Survival is confusing.
10/10"
16476,"Neat.  Lots of nifty stuff to make, invent, etc.  They need to make the world more interesting and varied (it's not currently) if they want to really get going with it.  Maybe have a reason to have a very sturdy base."
16477,Loads of fun building stuff with my son.
16478,.
16479,"Super amazing, just get it"
16480,"used to be beter

edit; the game now sucks, don't waste you time or money with this terrable game. it used to be better but then the devs started to add unneaded things and ended up ruining a game that used to be perfect.    :("
16481,Cool game if you have a good imagination or like running around doing various tasks
16482,its good
16483,Best game ever
16484,Very fun
16485,"This game is simply amazing. Definitely worth the money. Only thing that could be a lot better is the physics as they are glitchy, and the bugs. But other then that this game is simply *amazing* :O"
16486,Killing robots while having a shake and lamenting about the lag after couple hours of gameplay but stil play the same world anyways for many hours after. fml
16487,sweeeeet game and soo much fun!
16488,Its always not responding.

16494,great game lots of fun
16495,"Fun game, kinda a niche game tho"
16496,An engineer's minecraft.
16497,fun to make anything you can imagine to kill robots or move you at light speed but there is a grind
16498,AMAZING GAME
16499,great game to pass time lots to do
16500,"amazing it is still in beta and the graphicts are amazing too i love it
"
16501,good
16502,gayest game on earth
16503,confusing but uhhhhhhhhh
16504,"The game overall is a lot of fun and I would recommend it but since the survival update, the game runs on multiplayer pretty badly.
When I host, Scrap Mechanic runs @30fps lowest settings.
My friend hosted once and I got well over 100-150 on low and the MP is pretty buggy."
16505,its a good game just make shure to weld big projects down to the ground to stop lag
16506,e
16507,"survival is lit, 4 years later its still being supported"
16508,Very Fun Game xD
16509,Its a great and fun game

16512,EEEEEEEEEEEEEE
16513,haha
16514,10/10
16515,this is fun game for all ages but dont bring your small child to play it
16516,great game honestly
16517,p
16518,"Mmm, oh so sweet."
16519,"yikes. 

I love this game."
16520,"i love this game
"
16521,ITS AWSOME
16522,"
"
16523,"amazing game. the survival lags out my computer tho. even then, the creative mode is so so fun. just dont play with a slow computer."
16524,"Good fun, needs more development to keep players involved over time"
16525,"this game is great but one of the things this game needs really bad is some way to navigate, like a mini map or some simple markers that can be built and placed
Edit: thank god they finally added a beacon"
16526,fun? yesssssssssss
16527,yes
16528,This is a fun game.
16529,yes
16530,"Scrap Mechanic is a game where your only limits are by a lack of imagination. If you take your time to learn the mechanics behind building and design laid out in the in-game Handbook, you will watch your creations and contraptions come alive! I recommend learning in creative mode first and prototyping before you set out to play in survival. 

Once you learn the basics, having a general idea of how you're going to build transportation, resource gatherers, and implementing automation, you should dive right into survival. 

Here you will awake from impact presumably from your spaceship that is engulfed by flame and debris. Now thrust into a farming planet with rampaging, psychotic farm bots whose only goal is to inhibit all forms of agriculture; you must venture forward. You will notice remnants from a once-thriving community here, but where have all the gnome inhabitants gone?

It is up to you now to explore and survive.


If you love tinkering, farming, base defense, and building- this game is for you!"
16531,verry good a bit bugged with water sometimes but asome
16532,"the game is a lot of fun, and I've spent a long time playing it. However, I have 1 big issue with this game. The game will sometimes run at 200fps on the highest settings, but sometimes on the lowest settings I'll struggle to get 10fps. Looking at my resource usage, my cpu sits at about 20% and my gpu sits at about 1%. For reference, I'm using an i7 cpu and an RTX 2060 SUPER, and 16gb of ram. Surely this should be adequate? I assume this is an optimisation issue, but it makes the game REALLY annoying to play. At times, it becomes completely unplayable. I would still recommend the game as it is a lot of fun, however this issue is pretty annoying and might put some people off."
16533,good game
16534,McFuck yeah
16535,good game with a friend
16536,i'm not gonna lie i've only played the survival mode with my friend and it was incredibly painful to play

16545,This game is awesome i always had a good way of playing with legos and this game reminds me of that experience so i am sure this game is always my number 1 game i like to play i recommend this game to anyone
16546,"Good game, easily moddable. DO NOT BUY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A POWERFUL COMPUTER. Your processor should be way above the recommmended(at least i7)"
16547,i would like a de coupler mod
16548,is good and fun

16552,Much more possibility and attention to physics than i expected at first glance. Very fun and creative. I will be playing this for a long time.
16553,scroop machoonic
16554,Build a plane and a tank if you're up to it..
16555,clocked in at 100+ hrs and the game decided to freeze every time i log in back to my world!
16556,Great game with new survival mode!
16557,Cool Sandbox Game...
16558,it is so simple but with complex stuff to make
16559,cool can be laggy

16568,great
16569,I will never regret spending my money on this game!
16570,zsfgvSDDfggv
16571,i played way back when it was first launched and it gets better and better
16572,ive had my eye on this game for a long time the gameplay has always peeked my intrest all the crazy stuff you can build and the intigration of mods make it so fun to mess around with whenever i have free time
16573,this game is really fun i really think you should play this game
16574,It's a great game if you are really creative and love mechanics. It's worth the money
16575,If you have a bad computer it may lag it but very good game.
16576,dis is a veri gud game
16577,Not bad
16578,thujnrujgfdncmbnhjn good game with friends

16585,Keep lagging around on multiplay!
16586,good game
16587,beep boop
16588,Its a really good game i can build anything
16589,"idk
"
16590,scrap mechanic is great!
16591,"I have 3,000 hours on this game, and I'm STILL not bored (Especially after survival came out). In this game you can build almost ANYTHING: Cars, Planes, Monster Trucks, Helicopters, Rockets, Dragsters, ANYTHING. Except, as of typing this, there isn't water in creative mode yet. BUT, if you want to build a boat, you can just make it hover or fly! You can make just about anything with thrusters: Make something go faster, make something fly, give something the ability to drive up walls, its great! The only problem is the physics and ""glitchyness"". if something is to heavy, it'll just... well... go through the ground. Then it spawns back above ground, and goes through the ground again. But the ""glitchyness"" can also be the fun part. The glitchess can be REALLY funny at times, or they can be used to make things spin, or used to make something SUPER stable.

TL;DR: Great game, definitely worth it. Weird physics though.

Update: They added water and stuff. YAY!"
16592,i lovoe it
16593,fun game
16594,"As a wise person once said, ""sandwich""."
16595,"few bugs and annoying glitches, mainly vehicles clipping into the ground, some frame rate issues intermittently, and a few other minor bugs.   But over all nothing game breaking and has been a ton of fun, look forward to see more work done.

it does have a lot of placeholder text and certainly still needs a lot more polishing, but the potential is there for so much more and is already a blast with freinds"
16596,Fun. :)
16597,"Trying to like this, but so far it's boring and mundane and not fun.

yet another inventory management game."
16598,awsome game
16599,car go brrrrr
16600,"Im not a best mechanic myself, yet a builder for sure, i am very enjoy playing the building structure and blocks. Definitely suggesting this game for all!"
16601,yes
16602,"I absolutely love this game. I like the fact that it has survival and creative modes. The mode I prefer is survival as you search around for resources and have enemies. I would definitely recommend this game, for all ages and all levels of gamers."
16603,boringgggggggggg
16604,"+,5‚Åø√†¬¢‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨"
16605,gucci
16606,"Fun game 7.5/10

don't forget its an ""early access"" game"
16607,amazing
16608,yes awsome
16609,"horrable
"
16610,You can build a transformer.   10/10
16611,It's very fun. Worth the money.
16612,"nice game 10/10
"
16613,"So i got this game a few years back, cant remember the exact amount. When i got it i was quite dissapointed. There was a jenky creative mode, and thats it. Now coming back to it i am more than pleased with my purchase. This game has had continued developement and im quite happy to throw hours into it and realy get my inner engineer go wild. Will suggest to buddies. Keep up the good work guys!!!!!"
16614,"Play=Yes
"
16615,ITS SO COOL i got this a month ago and i love it
16616,Have played this many times. About to get into it again after so long
16617,goog game
16618,yes
16619,"survival update made me want to play the game 24/7, it looks so sick!!!!"
16620,just try it its awsone
16621,Good game but latest update with different engines ruined it.
16622,a fun game
16623,"The game is good, the graphics too, but one thing that is annoying is that there is no night in creative mode so lights are useless in it. the night in creative mode should be able to get turned on/off if it gets added. I got a suggestion to Axolot games: add the survival map as a choosable map in creative mode with all the assets,bots ect. exept that it is in creative mode so you can build whatever you want in a ""survival"" map without the requirement to search for materials,food ect. Anyway Have fun Mechanics!

PS.(to Axolot games): mabe add mod support to survival mode."
16624,Please add survival world builder! make it work just like the world builder we have now!
16625,"okay
"
16626,Fun
16627,its just that you can build everything you want
16628,"Because it helps you with creativity, and imagination. 
"
16629,"better than Minecraft.

1. you can make a lot more items/blocks

2. the world is all that i know is endless plus its not cubed

3. there always working on it the just did an update with ~12 more items unlike Minecraft that release ten blocks every 5 months.

Minecraft is fun don't get me wrong, its just boring even when you get a new update.

i rate scrap mechanic 10/10."
16630,i is good and i love it play it ok ok ok
16631,"Everything is amazing, some things need work but good game"
16632,thumbs up
16633,"If you can think it, there is a way to make it happen in this game. The survival is fun and will keep you want to see what new sights are just around that next bend in the road."
16634,Great game if you are very creative and love building things!
16635,Totally recommend it its worth the sandbox and multiplayer gameplay.
16636,PLAY IT OR ELSE
16637,vary fun
16638,great game recommend highly graphics are pretty good not the best I have seen but everything else brilliant
16639,"Good Game, Fun to create what ever you want! And the new Survival Mode adds water! 
Comment date / review date: 13th September 2020."
16640,Game just Amazing. No More Words
16641,this game is super fun to play i recommend this game
16642,"Fun game so far, especially for early access. Nice art style, good mechanics (no pun intended), and rich environment. The only downside so far for me is the lack of instruction. You have a help menu, but you're still kind of in the dark when you first start and inventory is a bit limited if you're a hoarder like myself. However, with that said, exploration is key I'm really enjoying what there is to offer so far.
"
16643,"Hammer and shoot potatoes at robots, farm food and ammunition, and build to your hearts content to make useful (or not) vehicles and structures in a comical world. Also, a surprisingly good multi-player experience."
16644,Pretty good game and concept would like to see more building blocks instead of having to download more mods and maybe a better damage system to objects everyone loves explosions need bombs!!! and destructable blocks
16645,"Really a great game, I was hyped for Survival but its not really that good. Creative is amazing though but it has some issues:

1) Unstable worlds, saving, game - Have had many worlds corrupt due to random crashes, Also had a world i spent a lot of time on where the buildings were still here but i couldnt walk on it, use it or interract with it.

2) Playing on friends worlds - If their PC is slightly lagging, you will get teleported around contantly, or if they are in their inventory or the lift you also get rubberbanded. Its kind of annoying.

3) The most buggy physics i have ever seen - Make a object thats decently large, your stuff will jump like its having a seizure. You also abselutely cannot go fast, tried to make a launching train but it jittered up and down constantly.

But that doesnt mean its a bad game:

Its a really interesting game and just my type of game. 100% the best Mechanical Sandbox game. Has so many good features and a big community with a lot of mod developers. I absolutely recommend.

16647,its a shame
16648,yes
16649,MOST FUN GAME EVER
16650,I like this game
16651,just chrashing cuz my pc otherway i recomending it :D
16652,its okay
16653,"awesome game, you can build everything you like as long as you harvest materials. the grind is real yo"
16654,Yes

But I need more reasons to create holocaust murder machines.

16664,Scrap mechanic is a must have game. i got it last week and I didnt know it was missing in my life until I played it for the first time. 100/10
16665,AMAZING!
16666,I have no clue how I have that many hours on this game.. that should say something
16667,"so laggy, do NOT buy it until it is in full release"
16668,"Me and my one shoe are ready for some action! Love the variety of building options and what you can do in this game. It's totally addictive swingin that big 'ol hammer around to smash stuff. Like the scenery and mobs. I appreciate that it's a bit different from a lot of other games.  That being said there is quite a few things that need some tweaks. Character options are pathetic  and most of the faces for females are not even female faces and look absolutely ridiculous - and not in a funny good way either. The multiplayer would be great if it wasn't so laggy and glitchy. Not being able to play UNLESS your on together is aggravating. You are forced to create multiple worlds so you can play solo with one and with friends on another or even a few different ones if your friend made the world because you can't enter it without them - GRRRRR! I don't want 3 different worlds to play and have to grind out the same stuff in each one just to play with different people. That takes the fun out of it. Make a solo mode so players can actually progress on their own. Trying to grind out supplies, farm 
 and fend off multiple enemies alone just sucks. Your inventory fills up too fast and exploring is damn near impossible since food/water depletes too fast. Having friends to play with makes the grindy parts go quicker and more fun but alone - meh. And for Pete's sakes get into the 21st century with your key binds and control options. I'm lefty and NEED to change key binds to play. I try to pick one of my thumb buttons to move with and it auto changes it to shift + alt + lmb. WTF is that nonsense? That's not what I chose and no way am I going to have to press 3 different buttons at a time just to move forward. Come on guys! It's been MANY years since I haven't been able to customize my controls the way that's comfortble for me. All in all the game is fun if you have friends to play with but I am still on the fence as to whether or not to recommend to friends  with all of the issues still lingering."

16670,Super fun game to show your creativity!
16671,this game should be a guide in every engineering based university
16672,yes

16675,its 100% sandbox untill challenge mode other wise u can make what ever u want
16676,l
16677,I recomend the game for all. You can be realy creative and you can buld.
16678,"when i am starting the game it crash
 
pls do something

Thx for Fix"
16679,"This game is so fun, it never gets boring if your creative enough you can stay working on a project for a year. The work shop has plenty of mods that make the game one thousand times better! Also, the survival is a whole other story, you have to protect your base form raids, figure out how to defeat the boss, and lots of more stuff."
16680,"um this game is very fun and interesting.
but have very serious problem. that's a ""FPS DROP""
this problem had the same problem when the game was first released
( touching the suspension and bearings results in a tremendous reduction )
i really hope this problem is solved quickly.

16681,i liked most of it but when i tried out the tile editor and click on help to see how to do things it keeps getting permanently stuck on that screen and i can't do anything (also the tools aren't 100% perfect either when i want to sink the ground there is no tool for that only to increase ground height not decrease) survival was hard to figure out because there is no help to tell you to continue and move down the area until you hit a road then continue on that road to a shop and get the things there it is a fun game though just needs some little tweaking (mainly on the tile creator thing and it keeps getting stuck on the help screen so have to force exit and go back into game they need to add a way to leave help screen)
16682,yes good niceeeeeeeeeee

Overall, I think its such a good game."

16698,Amazing
16699,u are mechancicc
16700,it has a survival mode creative mode and challenge mode as well as bearings wheels piston s suspension and everything i would want in a game where you can create stuff like cars and jets too and look for parts and food in survival its really cool and i love it you can also post your creations using workshop i like to look at the cool creations on workshop and wire stuff together using a connection tool and wield stuff with the wield tool also you can get a gun in the game to defend yourself from the killer robots of survival i love flyers there able to get some serious air just make sure its stable which is kind of hard and you can use controllers to control the rotation of bearings.

16708,really good game
16709,"Was timid about the purchase at first as all sandboxes seem the same to me. But the engineering aspect of this game is amazing, and the lack of guidance, to me, is awesome. I can not wait for more updates, and was happy to spend 20$ for this game. Would recommend 10/10

"
16710,"I LOVE THIS GAME, it's not any different than any other crafting game i've played so that's good"
16711,"it is a gome 
"
16712,"Im not playing anymore, not because its bad; but because I have 6.9 hours in it... Nice"
16713,quite a fun game
16714,its really fun to play and you can learn from it in many different ways.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone who likes creativity.
16715,Really fun and cheap I highly recommend the game if you enjoy building things and its even better with friends
16716,"Best. Game EVER

worth the 20 dollars trust me"
16717,"Great game, survival is awesome, the one problem is that when crafting things, you can't click on the materials required to figure out what they are. Other than that and the high CPU usage, it's perfect. Can't wait to see what they'll do in the future"
16718,YES
16719,very good and relaxing game
16720,nice game
16721,i like this game beacuse you can build stuff and find your way out of everything.
16722,it good cos it good
16723,i love the creativity in this game
16724,it is so goooooooooooood
16725,"Great game, Wish it would come to console"
16726,it did chage a lot when the new update came out but its still fun
16727,you can do a lot with this game. even creative mode with friends is a blast! worth the buy !
16728,good game
16729,"Scrap Mechanic Survival mode is what I enjoyed playing. The elements that dominate the game are farming/protecting the farm, Exploring for crates, and building vehicles/devices to help do it all. The end game is to take down a warehouse.  I love the game overall, and its probably much more fun with other people. Only two fixes I suggest is find a way to either give armor to the character or diminish damage done by the tape shooters. They can be a nightmare at the warehouse. Another option id like added is some basic premade inventions. I understand that the point is to build crazy machines. But not everyone has those skills and I feel a couple basic inventions would help that."
16730,yes recommend very much 11111/1
16731,It is an amazing game
16732,yes
16733,"Its a fun game just be prepared to grind if you play survival
"
16734,"Things you can look forward to in this game: a rough start if you've never seen anyone else play it before. After you're used to the game the fun is pretty crazy. There are challenges at multiple levels of player experience, loot that is interesting, plenty of space for exploration, and stuff to keep you busy for hundreds of hours if you're creative. Building a base is quite a grind, but so worth the trouble. You can build amazing vehicles and contraptions completely within your own designs and concepts, and use them. You can mine, cut down trees, farm, raid bases... My favorite part of Scrap Mechanic is the cuteness of it and that it doesn't contain any filth, so it's safe for children. It's challenging even for veteran players but not so insane that you can't survive long enough to figure things out. It's a sandbox which offers tons of potential for strange circumstances, intense battle, goofing off and also having fun with friends.
However, no game is perfect. The multiplayer is so hardcore laggy that your friends will frequently pop in and out of sync with you. The frames drop hard when loading warehouses. It's not uncommon for you to fall from such a height that you drop through the world. Bag retrieval can be a real pain in the neck when bots are body-camping you. One species of bot, the tapebot, is way overpowered; he kills you in two strikes and he's quick as greased lightning. The warehouses are nearly impossible to survive through, so you have to have the patience of Job to get through one without kicking your computer across the room. There's no armor. If you plant too many crops a raid timer starts and you're pretty much tethered to your farm until the plants are grown and the raids are finished.
On the upside, you can customize your environment, paint the things you build, change outfits to create your own style, cook food, make automated systems to do tasks for you, mess around with packing and shipping fruits and vegetables, build flying machines and boats and have a giggle at the expense of some caged farmers.
The pluses definitely outweigh the drawbacks. I do recommend it if you're not a lazy gamer and like figuring things out. This is a problem solving game and great for people who like to learn how things tick."
16735,"My computer couldn't handle a good amount of the gameplay, but it is a great game nonetheless."
16736,fun
16737,"cool game
"
16738,uhhhh im just filling this out cuase it popped up but its relly cool game one feature i would suggest tho is the feature to switch gamemodes on one world just becuase it been awhile since i played so if its a feature sorry to ask
16739,At 375 hours and growing I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a good sandbox game. I've made numerous creations not only in creative but also in survival and each one has been just as satisfying as the next. The only burden I have come across is the lack of content in the survival mode but it can only be expected as the game is in early access. I would easily give this game a 8/10 even in it's current state.
16740,"great game
with mods only"
16741,Awesome game that makes you thinks
16742,"This game is so addictive! Looting and farming, as well as mechanical building elements too. Really fun to play, really hard to switch it off."

16749,its fun but time consuming but when its all done its worth the time used

i cant install mods tho cus theres a problem happening to people where mods dont work"

16768,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. The element of being able to create whatever you can imagine gives it an edge over other traditional survival games. Once you have a craft bot you have all of the recipes unlocked, so there isn't a regular system of progression you are forced to follow, instead you can gather resources for the projects you want to complete. There is a grinding element to the game, builds cost a lot of resources and it takes time to gather them. The actual game does have limitations due to poor optimization, you could have an amazing build but the entire game lags because of too many components. There are also quite a few bugs I have encountered personally. Sometimes my game audio just cuts out completely and I have pinpointed that it is the game's fault. I would definitely recommend this to someone that is ok with spending lots of time gathering resources but can use their imagination with little limitation."
16769,"Multiplayer for survival is really laggy and needs to be fixed, but other than that its a good game"

16788,"Review update (years later): I had enough technical issues in my initial review back in the day that I refunded the game.  I came back recently and while the game needs some polish, it's worth playing... initially. If you try making anything kind of complex, the engine just can't handle it. Game lags horrendously on a $3000 computer.  Fix your shit devs."
16789,yes yes yes
16790,"you can make
"
16791,"Even though I played a little, I've watched many hours of videos, the game is AMAZING. You should buy it if you are a fan of building games, challenges with the Challenges and Survival mode, and especially Creative mode if you LOVE building, you may take a little while to learn all the controls, but it's totally worth it!

Would recommend to everyone.
If you do not have enough money to buy Scrap Mechanic, go to scrapmechanicmods.com then go to giveaways, and join the gleam.io giveaway, that's how I got myself Scrap Mechanic, thanks to Durf for making the giveaway :), check his youtube channel out!"
16792,good game
16793,It is very good.
16794,"Great game with friends. Challenge mode is great fun taking turns (and /or sabotaging each other relentlessly), and creative mode turns into a jousting match or a race. Survival is boring and grindy. Pass if you're going to play solo.

Pros:
- open world sandbox with multiplayer, a recipe for fun.
- challenge mode teaches you how to play the game, then starts throwing problems at you. definitely my 
   favourite gamemode, especially with friends. You can also find user-made challenges in the workshop.
- creative mode is how the game originally was. Race your friends in rainbow-coloured buggys, make a giant 
   robot camel that falls over immediately,  or make up your own challenge in the world.
- map maker gives you the opportunity to make map custom map times and arrange them however you 
   want. You can also find more on the workshop, like a drag strip or a rocket league arena.

Cons:
- survival mode is boring an grindy. For the first few hours it's a walking simulator while you gather the 
   materials for a terribly handling car to take you to a workshop you could've walked to in half the time. Then 
   when you try to farm for food the game spawns in waves of enemies (more on this later). Resources are 
   scarce and difficult to transport in large amounts. Progression is painfully slow and takes hours of grinding.
- combat is boring and repetitive. While there are a small variety of enemies, they're either pretty easy to 
   defeat alone or take several people and vehicles to destroy. You'll meet all of them, as when you try to 
   make a farm larger than four blocks they spawn in waves.
- the game engine is glitchy. A perfectly symmetrical creation of a flat surface magically veers off to one side. 
   creations with large moving parts clip through each other and spin or clip through the ground and get 
   stuck. Attaching too many moving parts to the same blocks makes your creation hover or straight up fly 
   off.

Overall, If you've got friends who'll play with you, it's great, just stick to creative mode and challenge mode. You'll spend hours cooperating, competing, or sabotaging each other. Survival mode is a little easier with more people, but not enough for me to play it regularly. If you're going to play this solo, don't buy it. While challenge mode is fun and the workshop gives you more to do, it gets boring after a while. creative mode is cool for a while, but feels pointless without more people. Survival is way too much of a chore to play, even with friends."

16798,it god it even runs on my laptop
16799,needs a dedicated compass easier mod integration there are varible texture glitches during startup that need to be adjusted but other then that its a decent game so far
16800,This game is awesome
16801,"build what ever you want
"
16802,"[h1] really good game [/h1]
glitches are common but that is to be expected. there are a few things i‚Äôd like to see added, a testing mode, creative mode but in a survival world, as far as i know there is none of the harvestable rocks or water in creative and i want to be able to test machines before building them in survival where all the items i crafted to make it just get tossed out when it doesn‚Äôt work if this is already a thing i can't figure out how to do it which speaks to it's user friendliness. i wish lights were brighter, even at their max settings i can‚Äôt see what i am doing. and water physics, i want to be able to power a boat with paddles, it makes sense, being able the makes submarines that hold air would be nice to. I‚Äôve also seen people attempting to power a boat using water cannons, it seems like a neat idea and i wish it was actually effective but if the paddles worked we wouldn‚Äôt really need the water cannons. i also wish i could label things easier, best we got is painting them, it would make complicated creations that use 9 different buttons and switches easier to use, plus relearning your own machines if you have been away for awhile. i don‚Äôt know if anyone is going to see this or what the chances are of anyone taking my suggestions but it would be great if someone did. i also realize there is a lot of work going into the game and you probably have a mile long list of features you want to add so i‚Äôm not expecting any of my suggestions by the next update or anything. just my thoughts and ideas, for whatever they are worth."
16803,it is very good
16804,Good game great mod support. Only complaint is no mod support for survival

16813,"its a very good survival/creative/sandbox game. one of my top favorites, but you need a good computer to play well."
16814,"Creative is as always fun and survival is a little grindy but still entertaining

The amount of bugs and and glitches is [b] [i] ENORMOUS [/i] [/b] but some of them are really funny for example:

[list]
    [*]Character's head started spinning for no reason
    [*]Getting sent to the moon because of weird collision physics
    [*]Suspension
    [*]Pistons

And not to mention the [b] HUGE [/b] amount of mods make the game infinitely expandable

16862,love it its a creative master piece
16863,this is such a good game but PLEASE ADD AIRO DINAMICS

16866,i love this game a lot and i wish there you can change bot to not attack
16867,the game is fun with friends and if you just want to chill and hang out
16868,this is an amazing game.
16869,de oferta vale la pena.
16870,i love how you can make everything
16871,10/10 i love the survival aspect but i wish their was more options to decrese lag other than that the game is perfect

16873,I enjoy the game but it somehow got removed from my library and it acts like I never bought it
16874,"I never get bored. If you like to kill things, build what ever you want, or mess around then this game is for you and it also is an sandbox game with a great survival and creative modes. If you get bored there is mod support for you. So why not get the game and help it develop and watch it develop as you play. In my opinion its more fun to see the game progress then to play the final version."
16875,very nice
16876,i liked that u can use ur raft skills
16877,Yeah its fun I guess...
16878,"Just like every other survival game, this one is pleasantly fun. However, playing by yourself makes it so that you lose steam with it fast and ultimately forget it exists for several months at a time (if you dont generally like playing games like this by yourself, anyway). With friends, it can be an absolute blast. Otherwise it gets bland and uninteresting after a little while."
16879,v.good
16880,its fun
16881,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

I would recommend this to people who like sandbox games
"
16883,Amazing game!
16884,"its really fun, especially survival, and its even better in multiplayer"
16885,"The game is incomplete, of course.   Here is my list of what needs to be done albeit my opinions differ from the developers.

[h2]Core Software[/h2]
Set Water Level in Creative or tile-builder.
Spawn mobs and fuel-resources in creative.
Scripting system in creative.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Survival: a story and camera-based cutscene. How did we crash to begin with? Did someone spill coffee on the command console?  What happened?

[h2]Core[/h2] 
I'd like to see the developers implement a fluid system and  a propeller system that creates force depending on prop used and fluid containing that prop.  A prop at a certain elevation with so much surface area is going to generate more force, and experience more drag if it is in water.  This is possible with Magic Numbers or by properly accounting for drag.  A mechanic should exist for binding mouse movements to a particular part.  On a game-controller, i.e. the X-Box controller, the movement is continuous vs discrete.

While I appreciate the fact that the physics system is sophisticated enough to implement a gear system, due to computational constraints, I suggest at least implementing some toothed gears, crown gears, worm gears, etc.  The game does have pistons which work as actuators, which are often based on gear-boxes and step-motors as a real-world comparison.  Workarounds like the proceeding example are computationally expensive due to the number of parts involved.

A No-Gears workaround.

[h2]Kudos[/h2]
The wheel and suspension system is superb compared to many games like Space Engineers or KSP.  I like the potato guns vs robots theme.  I applaud the implementation of logic gates.  I am amazed with what is possible given the limited tools.  I look forward to seeing this project completed and am glad I got in on early access."

16901,it is so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16902,"It's good, really! Would certainly recommend!"
16903,"it's a nice game but, i don't play it anymore"
16904,"Very game!
Alot of fun stuff! 
"
16905,"At almost 100 hours, I still am undecided on my recommendation. I recommend this game because it is fun and has a very cool concept... but the hardware requirements for this game are highly misleading, and playing with even recommended requirements will inevitably lead to a poor experience.

I'm a big fan of sandbox and survival games. Scrap Mechanic has achieved a unique twist for itself that very much works within those genres. The physics concepts behind the game are a lot of fun to experiment with, and I can't wait to see what else is in store. If you've enjoyed time in survival, sandbox and/or creative games then this will certainly be a fun pick up.

However... This game is early access, the physics mechanics I mentioned before are definitely cool, but they're a double edged sword. My PC specs far above the recommended for this game, except for my CPU, which is an i5-6600K, and I can barely get 15fps once I start to fill my world with creations. This game requires almost nothing from your hardware except for the CPU which it will work to death... and while I'm no expert I am quite sure this is because of the physics that this game employs for EVERYTHING. So, if you've got better than me... maybe it won't be that big of a deal. But don't assume for a second that the recommended CPU is enough to play this game for any length of time, because it's not.

For this reason, I really hate to fully recommend people getting this if you're on the edge. I enjoy it so much, but it has all the rough edges that come with being early access, so honestly I'd say to just keep it on your wishlist until it releases or gets some chunky QoL updates if your hardware does not exceed the recommended requirements.

Many reviews I've seen I feel either give this game TOO much credit, or were experiences born from poor hardware and thus terribly negative. If you've got a dated PC, this game will run it through the wringer and you'll not have a fun time. The gameplay is unique, but it's nothing groundbreaking or to write home about... It's literally got a little something for everyone (IGN 2019). It dabbles in so many different pots that nothing stands out to me except their iconic mechanized take (hence scrap MECHANIC) on buildings and creations."
16906,I like survival open world games and in this you can both of them and you can make your own car
16907,this game is the very good because this game can haves the big ROBOT kill you and u can kill the big robot with gun and gun shoot the POTAYTO
16908,tare
16909,its good and creative game
16910,"I have been playing this game since 2016, (not in this account tho).
All through out these years i can finally say a conclusion into this masterpiece.
Scrap Mechanic is a very educating and also creative game.
If you really like creativity and making your ideas to a real thing (virtually), then this game is for you. And if you like learning stuff such as mechanism in suspensions or computer data works, this game is quite for you if you like making complicated stuff instead making it on a easier platform.

The graphics are very good despite the medium requirements of your PC specs.
I'm using GeForce 920M which is a crappy card that i would say, (2 gigs of VRAM)
I can run almost at all high settings without AA and shadows at medium, it would hit about 50s FPS in creative and 40s in survival (depends on the density of the scene).
This game is very optimized in graphics, but when you build large creation with a lot of bearings or suspension, it's gonna lag quite a bit, i have crappy CPU so i don't know about those overkill PC with an AMD Threadripper just to play Among Us' takes on this game.

Multiplayer, oh boy, multiplayer is very fun because you can be on a co-op in survival mode or just mess around with your friends in creative mode, both are very fun, but the main problem is, there is no dedicated server to host private server so friends can join, i know it would cost a lot of money, but i'm sure it will makes us happy, Devs.
Also if your friend hosts a server with a crappy pc, and slow internet, good luck having 2000ms ping.

I really recommend this game even at FULL price. it is just like a steal, i really thank to the devs for still updating this game and focusing on it, and also thanks Axolot Games for pricing this game at a reasonable price which is almost like a steal like i said.

TL;DR =
Fun? : Very Yes
Graphics : Nearly as AAA games
Multiplayer : Very fun, but laggy sometimes.
Optimization : Very good
Worth it? : Even the full price is like a steal.
Need friends to be more fun? : Yep.
GG have fun!"
16911,Greatest game that can ever live!!!!! by Evening Star
16912,"very good spend lots of time
"
16913,yes
16914,Amazing Game!
16915,This game takes a minute to learn but it is amazeing when you do
16916,Run out of food while driving around looking for loot. Begin taking damage because starving. Taking damage kicks you out of your driver seat preventing you from driving to a farm/home. Now an entire backpack of loot AND MY CAR that i built and used to get there is now stuck a significant distance away from my respawn point. Plus when you respawn you have less than 1/3 of your thirst and hunger bar filled; even if you didn't die from starvation.
16917,the entire thing is amazing
16918,"I initially bought the game for the sandbox mode, and have not been disappointed. There aren't many games that give you the unfiltered ability to create in any way you choose. Even Minecraft is somewhat limited by it's environment in a way this game isn't. The physics are very lackluster especially for vehicles.

The game runs pretty well, my computer is pretty middle of the road and I can run this game at max with ~160 fps, maybe 60 in a complicated area. The frame drops do get ridiculous at times though especially in the warehouses in survival.

almost all my issues begin at survival though. for one, the game gives you absolutely no tutorial. All it gives you is a vague understanding of how a few mechanics work on a handful of billboards. No tooltips, no help menus, not even item names in the crafting menus. I had to have the wiki open the entire time because the game gave me no help on what certain things were and how I could find them. Enemies are also strange, for how powerful Haybots are they're everywhere. I can take one or two at once but I get mobbed by like 6 and it's guaranteed death and there's no way to outrun them. Tapebots do a ridiculous amount of damage and require a spudgun to fight at all, and are very easy to get caught off guard by. Finally Farmbots, which are not impossible but require a lot of prep, cannot be killed with a sledgehammer. If only I had known that because I had no other option and nothing told me I couldn't. Also upgrading the hammer or more melee weapons would be nice. The stock sledge is usable but it can't put out the melee damage you need sometimes

Lastly, the gameplay loop. Personally I quite enjoy the grindy nature of making a big farm, watering it, harvesting, and fighting robots. Rinse and repeat, with a little resource gathering and ruin raiding too. More ways should be implemented to gather the resources. For cotton, you can grow it, but you should also be able to grow beehives or boxes and farm honey that way for less payout. Same with oil and glue. More alternative methods would in my opinion give the farming system more to do than just fruits and veggies and transform the end goal from raid the big warehouse to be entirely self sufficient from your farm.

Overall if you're a building/sanbox addict like me you've gotta have this. Well worth the $20 I paid for it."
16919,check it out
16920,GG
16921,It fun
16922,"Nice game for me
"
16923,"Here is the honest truth about this game.  It absolutely PUNISHES you for playing it in survival mode.  The gameplay itself is fun, but there are so many terrible design choices that have been made that every time you start to have a bit of fun, you get kicked in the balls and it goes from fun to miserable.  I've grinded to build vehicles, parked the vehicles at my base, had haybots randomly spawn nearby, aggro my vehicle, and destroy it unbeknownst to me while I'm messing around in a craftbot menu.  I've had haybots swarm me the second I get out of a vehicle and instantly destroy my vehicle.  I've been in buildings where I've cleared the haybots, rounded a corner, and then when I've turned around to go back the way I've come less than 5 minutes later...there's 2 more haybots that spawned in.  There is almost no indication when you will be attacked.  Your stuff can be attacked without your knowledge and your hours of time goes up in smoke.  The spawning of the enemies is broken and needs immediate attention.

Frankly, the worst thing about this game is the inventory system.  It is a travesty how little space you have.  You can't stack a bunch of the items (inexcusable in my opinion), for the items that do stack there isn't any consistency in the amount you can stack, and you end up running out space immediately.  With how many materials you need to gather to do the crafting, this sin is unforgivable.  The game requires you to burn entire stacks of items to craft just one of certain items.  The game becomes a chore within 20 minutes.  You can't upgrade your storage, you can't upgrade the items that can be stacked, and all you can do is craft chests so that you can store stuff.

This is the other big problem.  For a game about making vehicles, you have no mobility.  You can't craft ANYTHING on the go, the one thing you need to craft all the items...if you pick it up, you run like you're in quicksand.  You would be a fool to build a base anywhere but the first garage you see.  You have no incentive to create bases from scratch given how many resources they take to build, and even if you did, you would have to lug all your stuff to your new base site (and that would take tons of time given how little you can carry).  It's good you can make vehicles, because you would have to create a giant U-haul in order to carry your stuff around because your character sure can't do it.  This game has failed to do what a good survival game does.  It hasn't married the industry, the crafting, and the survival aspects together.  If you want the full crafting experience, play creative mode, but it will be pointless to focus on the industry since you don't have to gather stuff.  If you like the industry, play survival mode, but crafting will be brutal.  The industry, survival, and crafting do not have good synergy at all.

I'm only scratching the surface of the bad design choices here.  This game takes the genre to a whole new painful level.  Honestly, it just isn't fun.  It doesn't reward you for playing.  It beats you down.  There are so many better games in this genre that won't abuse you this way.  Buy one of them instead."

16934,"everything is good

16935,"The game has promise but as of right now its not worth the $20. The survival mode feels very empty and doesn't have a lot going for it. Also my world with several hours into it got broken and I get a crashed bug everytime I try to load it. There was nothing special or complex built just a car and we were upgrading a piston, piston wouldn't upgrade so we closed game and tried to come back. All of those hours wasted... Maybe someday they will fix the bugs and add more content, but for now its not worth the price when its so easy to lose your progress."
16936,dis game is awesome
16937,"While the game is not finished yet, it certainly is polished very well. Some mechanics however definitely require more thought and should be improved upon:
- There is no air resistance/drag for anything but the player, which removes the ability to create working planes and jets. Even helicopters are barely possible without freaking out.
- There's not exactly a clear goal for the story to follow. Some objectives are so random that it takes hours to find, which make the game feel like work instead of fun.
- Game framerate sometimes falls below the acceptable minimum on a RTX 2080 Ti paired with a 3950X, which I assume will be fixed in the final release.

"
16938,this game is great
16939,"If you're looking for a few hours of fun this game is for you. Anything past that you'll realize the game is lacking in development and has major game breaking issues that need addressed, anything big and cool you want to build?

16975,Good
16976,This game is very fun to play but in survival mode i feel there is a wall you get to when you have like 2 days of play time on a world there is nothing to do but build a mining car just to end up not using it. I wish the mobs in the game were harder to fight because when you get a spud gun its pretty ez from there and nothing can really stop you they also just need to add more things for your car like to where i can download a mod from steam but the only way i can build that car is if i have all the parts to build that car i just wish there was more to do than a wear house because once you get the main loot like 2 times there is no reason to go back to another one because the stuff you are going to get wont help you that much but i would still recommend this game you will have a lot of fun solo or with friends.
16977,i saw scrap man playing the game and it looked cool so i got it and its realy cool

16981,"this is a shit, bugs all the time"
16982,game felt slow and the grinding was unenjoyable. for example you need fuel for you machines. so make a cool drilling rig or processor? nope swim around and pick up black bubbles. Hated collecting fuel so much ill probably never play again
16983,loved it all
16984,"scrap mechanic is a great game, you have creative mode which is what it says but we don't have all the parts there, then survival mode is also great because you can build a base, attack bots when you plant vegetables and test your building skills by making cars, loggers,trucks,tankers and other vehicles. challenge mode is also great because you get to test you skills in time trials,build your own course or try other peoples on the workshop. overall amazing game, 9/10."
16985,"Long ago, in the distant early years of 2000, A humble game by the name of Scrap Mechanic was in Early Access. Even in that time, the base features of which made the game what it was were there: Building vehicles, Making structures and constructs with innumerable connections of wires, buttons and moving pieces, creating anything the mind can conjure with the simple, yet easy to learn, pieces that give functionality and power to all that they touch(just as long as you have the right pieces). Only the imagination is the limit in this place of vehicles and buildings to defend from the long awaiting farming robots who deserted their purpose and now revolt against all who try to place them back. Survive as any attempt to fill your hungry mouth with your own grown food sparks these robots to stop you.

In all seriousness, this is a game I have loved for the longest time, I went away for a while from it, and I am so proud of how far it's come from those early days. Anyone who has the chance to try this game if you enjoy mechanical and electrical sandbox games. Seriously, you should."
16986,No i love me
16987,why do the blue guys have aimbot and hit for 55 its the worst
16988,"ITS GOO
"
16989,"This game is a Masterpiece. 
There is nothing else to describe a game that ticks all the points one would want out of a video game. The physics are top notch. You can build almost anything. You can do anything. And its such a thrill to build machines and upgrade them and see how they work. You cant a lawn mower? Build it. You want a car that can also drive on water? Build it. You cant reach a location? Build something to get there. The amount of fun you can get out of this application is mind blowing. 
"
16990,So... creative

16992,AWESOME
16993,"This game has a lot of potential, and the creative mode is undoubtedly solid. That being said if you're like myself and bought this hoping for a cool survival experience look elsewhere. The survival mode for this game is a fairly recent addition and is nowhere near complete. I spent ten hours over four different saves trying to enjoy this game and every single time I quit in frustration. Whether it was the games total lack of navigation aids, clunky combat, or game breaking bugs, I found myself completely unable to enjoy the survival in Scrap Mechanic despite my best efforts.

If you're looking for a creative gary's mod-esque sandbox then this is your game. If youre looking for survival I suggest looking elsewhere."

And secondly, If you like building things, killing robots with potatos, Life threatining gardening, getting two shot by rolls of flying flex tape, and experiencing a heart attack every time you go into a dark abandoned building full of pitchfork weilding robotic mainiacs, then this is the game for you."

My hope is that it is optimized better when released. I would like to see  workshop items in Survival Mode. And there is still no pause for single play at least. The only way to pause the game is to quit to menu. Even then, I don't play very long do to the fact that, even at the menu screen my PC fans are running full speed."
17014,very good game i played it for 7 hours already. it is a really addictive game can be confusing but look at the book.
17015,"Ever get tired of Minecraft because the cubes are too big to be a little more specific on making certain shapes so then you have to make 4x bigger? no need to worry.

Also the engineering for this is awesome!"
17016,"Loads of fun and literal days of possibilities for those who are mechanicaly inclined. Powerfull physics engine and a unique art style makes this game entertaining for the long run. If you like a building game with few limitations and rewards you for engeneering skills then this is the game for you. Especialy with the recently implemented survival mode, this game supplies you with the tools to simply have a great time. Just remember, this game is still in beta, so while it definately runs great on my PC, it may lag a bit on yours, and its certianly not without its bugs and crashes.

For those wondering: Gforce 1060/Intel i7/Windows 10 - Game gets above 60fps unless i really push the ammount of assets loaded at once. For general play it doesnt dip below 60fps"

Survival mode includes everything you'd expect from a modern survival game: exploring, scavenging, building, farming, surviving. The map is huge and offers a decent amount of variety with more on the way as development progresses.

The game (in Survival) is not overly hard but definitely has a few challenges and surprises. Another big plus is that the game only features mild cartoon violence, which makes it really great for young children who can have fun adventuring and learning about mechanical engineering and physics :)

All in all a BIG thumbs-up from me for anyone who enjoys a good survival game in the best traditions of Minecraft & co."
17031,I spent a whole summer playing this game and it happens to be my most played game for the past 4 years the mechanical aspect is amazing and you can learn to create big and complex machines very easy. 10/10 AAA game
17032,survival very fun
17033,Nice
17034,its pretty swanky
17035,"I have about 7 hrs on the game. Unfortunately I have to reinstall EVERY TIME i want to play the game, U tried verifying game cache but it still does not work."
17036,Objectively a very good game :)
17037,"fun game pretty easy to learn you build vehicles and or bases if in survival mode, has a decently chalenging chalenge mode and has a sandbox mode where you can build whatever you want with or without your friends."
17038,Very Fun and good multiplayer.  You will need a good computer though.
17039,"Honestly it's a good game, I've loved it for a while and instead of learning to code at age 12, I decided to do something like this to start a ""Creativity Streak."" I've since quit the game because in the new survival update, they upgraded the minimum specs and I could no longer play it. ;("
17040,"Very good game, can be on the laggy side sometimes but with a non-potato computer like mine the game runs smoothly. Very fun to play."
17041,its fun
17042,very intuitive game. I recommend it

17054,The survival aspect of this game is highly entertaining.  Get a couple of people together and it makes it even more fun.
17055,This game is amazing. I have put so much time into it and I just like that there is always something to do.
17056,"this game is fun until you try to build interesting stuff, the collision is so aggravating that it makes it less than worth it to play. if they are able to optimize this game so it can work without crashing its going to be great, but in it's current state, 4 years old btw, it should be able to at least play somewhat fluidly. no one spends $1500+ on a PC to play at 2fps."
17057,"This is my most played game in my entire library. While it still has some major bugs (my personal enemy being the lack of friction with the wheels) this game is absolutely amazing. It will test your brain and inspire your creativity.  Patience is a key factor as you will be spending a lot of time grinding for materials, if you are like me and prefer survival mode over creative mode. Axolot has done an amazing job with this game and I'm positive it's only going to get better with future updates!"
17058,its fun and open world
17059,yes
17060,Build a 4 wheeler and turned it into a semi truck within like 20 hours. Your cars will evolve more times than a Digimon.
17061,THIS IS AWSOME
17062,very good yes DOWNLOAD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
17063,"very epoc survival game, 8/10 would recommend"
17064,good but you need a gaming laptop or pc
17065,This is better than sex (i've never had sex)
17066,yes
17067,So fun. I've only played 11 hours and its very fun. 10/10
17068,"Great game, but wheels are completely broken. they are rock hard and bounce and glitch out all over the place while driving."
17069,"I like the design aspects of this game and that part of it is interesting. However without a goal it feels empty. That's what survival seems like it should be capable of and it's easy enough to get to the initial point but once you make a base there's no way to navigate. The landmarks all look identical due to the stylizing and that makes what little orienteering I'm able to completely useless. So the first time I set out from my new base at the first stop to do that sort of thing I end up unrecoverably lost. So either I start over again, to the tune of hours of gameplay lost, or just go find somewhere to die and lose hours anyway so I can make enough resources to sojurn out to wherever the hell I just got lost.  Following by the waypoint to get there I end up forgetting how to get back since it's an entirely new path to get there by waypoint which means doubling back a few times in overly familiar terrain. As much as I want to like the game I can't reccommend the survival mode being such a massive exercise in futility."
17070,I like it cause it express my creativity
17071,VERY EPIC
17072,Its the best game in the univverse

17083,"its a really good game
"
17084,"Until the Dev's make the game even remotely playable, this review stands. 

""While upgrading a piston in Survival Mode, the game crashed for both me and my friend. My friend and I then got the BugSplat notification and restarted the game. Upon reentering the Survival Mode Map we had been playing on, the game failed to load, and crashed.... again and again and again. We no longer have access to the hard work and hours put into the map. We will be forced to restart if we ever want to play again.""

Keep this in mind before spending your money on this game. IT WILL CRASH! and crash, and crash, and crash again. You WILL lose your saved games. Your progress won't be kept. 

Hopefully the Dev's fix their game and stop robbing people of their money.

For things like the suspension glitch, I hope that, when they are fixed, in-game analogues are added to makeup for the loss of funtionality (like Minecraft and the old Minecart Booster system being replaced with the Powered Rails)."
17095,yes it good
17096,This game is a must buy for anyone who likes open world games. The games building system is pretty much only limited to your imagination. Super fun!

17130,"UPDATE:

With the newest update, I'm happy to report that Scrap Mechanic is playable for advanced builders! Gone are the days of extreme lag and frustration. This game is well worth the money and is incredibly fun! 

So, as promised, I'm revising this review to switch it from thumbs down to an enthusiastic, excited thumbs up!"
17131,"Disgusting multiplayer crashes that have existed since 2016. Yet they prioritize money over important bugs. Money being Survival mode. I do not recommend this game. It's broken. I get it's early access, but the developers over at Axolot had over 3 years to fix this issue. It'll work very rarely. Do not buy until they actually fix it, don't listen to their money focused company, instead listen to the truth tellers, the actual player base who was so kind as to give them money for a broken product. I'd rather pay $2 instead of the excessive $20. Given the broken state of the game."
17132,I love the game the gameplay is amazing and the experience is fun. I am able to play this game with my freinds which makes this game even better!
17133,"I'm and old grandpa nearing 70 who as played Minecraft with grandkids for about five years. I've been playing Scrap Mechanic for about a week. I highly recommend it. Color, sound, and realism is just right. It's a little like a great day at Disneyland. The in-game help and video tutorials are adequate for a beginner like me. The game play is well designed. It is a creative challenge. I hope the devs write better docs on the APIs and modding. I would like to be able to grow trees and to plant crops anywhere -- rooftops and rocky mountain tops, and not just dirt surfaces."

17147,Well worth the $20 and 130 hours.
17148,"7/10 
I enjoy this game a lot however, they need to fix their physics engine. Once you start getting into this game it kicks your ass back to not wanting to play it. While it hooks you on the possibilities you can build, once you start it destroys your FPS, at least on a 2080 ti. The other reason I have stopped is the resources mainly stone, do not respawn. So soon or later you will run out and be stuck. So this puts a damper on any base / platforms for vehicles you want to build. That with the FPS loss ruins this game. I hope this game will be fixed in the future and I will change my review."

[9/10]

My only problem is that I have a pretty beefy PC, but the game doesn't run very well on high graphics settings. I have 8 GB of Ram, and that's a fair bit."
17160,"Scrap Mechanic seems advanced at first, until you get the hang of it. It truly is a place where you can build anything."
17161,duh.
17162,"eeeek borring and the workshop doesnt work
"
17163,its really fun especially with friends
17164,"It's quite hard to understand how the game works at the moment, the survival mode feels a little bit harsh for new players. Though, after about 2 hours of exploring you should find yourself comfortable."
17165,"Fun building game which now has survival. Fun alone, more fun with friends. Build what your mind fancies, only imagination is the limit."
17166,.
17167,goood
17168,"Even though the game is good and I would recommend it to anyone, I can't support devs that forces always online DRM on a singleplayer game.
The country I'm in has the worst internet connection in Asia and this always online DRM can be infuriating.
If I happen to have no internet connection for that day(or week) and I have to start steam in offline mode, I can't play Scrap Mechanic despite the fact I did pay for the game.


Here's the ""Error"":
""Fatal error

17169,epic
17170,I like the feel of the game it's better with more then one player. Certainly full of potential
17171,its fun with friends (if you have any)
17172,"I've played this game in survival mode for more than 490 hours. I would have answered yes to the question of whether I recommend this game or not if it weren't for the fact that both of my worlds are completely unplayable now.  In my first world, I can somewhat understand why things became very laggy, even if I still blame poorly optimized code - a lot of my base was linked together and I had a lot of complicated contraptions for farm defense, planting and harvesting.  In my second world, I made a great deal of effort to try to avoid the lag that accompanies larger creations.  I made sure to create discrete creations, I kept my vehicles welded to posts a good distance away from my main farm and main base.  The four defensive walls (turrets on pistons) of my farm were actually completely disconnected from one another so each was its own discrete creation.  My automated farms were standalone creations. Very little was linked together that didn't need to be.  And yet, as with my first world, things again came to a grinding (near) halt.  One day I was getting 60-80fps and the next time I loaded into my world my frames tanked to 20-30fps.  This kind of performance degradation is inexcusable. I tried my best and the game failed me a second time.  At this point, with two worlds basically unplayable (both of which I have a lot of time invested in), I've given up on this game and I will not be returning until the performance issues have been fixed.

So, again, I would not recommend this game unless you enjoy spending hours working on cool contraptions only to have the game's poorly written code rear its ugly head and tank your frame rates to the point of being unplayable, let alone enjoyable. 

To Axolot: this game could be great. Please forgo adding additional content in favor of optimizing performance.  I don't want more content, I want to be able to create things without the fear of making my game unplayable.  Oh, and if you could make driving heavy things less like skating and more like actual driving, that'd be great too.  It's a freakin' ice rink."
17173,good
17174,"Overall, this is a very good game. Great community, large room for creativity. One feature I would absolutely love to see is public servers, at least once the collisions are optimized and don't lag out the whole game. This game has incredible potential! 10/10 would recommend to other creative gamers!"
17175,a GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD game play it
17176,"epicly fun
"
17177,I love how you can build stuff
17178,fun
17179,"pretty lit,"
17180,"Short Version: 
Do not play this game for it's survival mode, in my opinion it is a horrible grindy mess
If you are looking for a block based machine building game, get space engineers
Long Version:
My problem with this game is that, for all the time that they  put into survival mode, 3 or 4 years that I played for,  it is a mess. what i mean is that the survival mode is unplayable, because it takes too long to do ANYTHING, it takes hours to build a horrendous car., and to build a 'Real' car, it takes ages. Part of the problem is all of the silly little resources the game has you collect, like beeswax, which is required to make tires, of all the things to make players run across the map for... it's a game where you build a lot of cars, and the TIRES require you to run across the map. Another problem is that the hunger and thirst system is over implemented, you go out in your car that you spent 5 hours making, and you die of hunger or thirst, because the only way to get food is to grow it yourself. Then you have to get your car back, but the 2 times you try, you die of hunger and thirst on the way there FOR THE SAME REASON, by that time you decide to build a new car to rescue your other car, but then you realize you may as well just quit now, because you're literally redoing 5 hours of work, looking for beeswax, getting it home without dying, wasting time waiting for crops to grow, realizing you just ran out of seeds and have no way to get more, that is this games survival mode.
I didn't even get beyond a half decent car.
I also have a problem with the fact that when they added all these nice features to survival (New Blocks, Water, Bigger and More interesting map) they didn't add it to creative.
Conclusion:
Get a different Game if you want survival, or building contraptions, there are other ones out there.
I may continue this later when I feel that I won't start ranting"
17181,If you like to build or create then this game has no limits. the more friends the more fun!

17199,"love the game
but give us the ability to turn off player collision in creative












fuck you dearns"
17200,"Amazing game, I have had it for a while and just got back into it. Love that they finally added a survival mode."

17203,I would recommend this to any creative mind.
17204,Great game! Lots of fun. Have to play with friends for best results. (5 mins later after playing with friends) NOOOO THEY MADE MY WORLD INTO A SMOKING HOLE IN THE GROUND!! JK plz get this game super fun!!
17205,hours of fun
17206,"TL:DR
garry's mod/terraria contraption-building meets ark/raft ""survival"" (all player items are built of blocks/parts in a ""static"" world)
Building is fun yet the game still needs more to do and a LOT more optimisation. 
You CAN build a mobile-refinery-fortress-bastion but you will likely tank your framerate and the physics engine in the process.

Picked it up to play around on survival, having fun but the experience is very limited
it's similar to raft, with a focus on building custom contraptions garys-mod style to explore and harvest large resource nodes.
the challenge/puzzle mode is an ok distraction but the fun is in making things for yourself.


more info/specifics

the good (building is fun and it's inexpensive)
- dynamic map generation with some fixed-tiles, basic seed but it just about keeps things fresh despite the single biome (think of a carcassonne boardgame as your map)
- you can build quite complex machines using the provided blocks, pivots, rods, motors, logic gates, wheels and pistons. parts have friction & weight and behave like mathematically ""perfect"" rods/pistons/wheels/ when used small-scale, you can duplicate a LOT of engineering systems. from go-cart to logger, to automated aquaponic-farm to personal Takeshi's Castle.
- exploring is fun and risky at first (once you trade resources for a gun it's trivial).
- most resources are distributed in ""deposits"" so there's no RNG based on what you will get from refining an interactive element. Most consumables respawn, trees/rocks don't (presumably to encourage exploration and allow base building)
- Terrain is indestructible (it's a polygon texture layer) but your contraptions are built of cubes and specific ""parts"", if an enemy hits the wrong bit you loose a wheel, your engine gets destroyed or your vehicle can literally be broken in half
- the physics engine can handle a lot of punishment, until it can't. radial engine built of pistons, bearings and pipes? totally possible, pipes used to create multiple ratio gears that use a piston to swap gears? done! a JCB multi-tool built and controlled from control-seat built atop a mobile refinery? maybe need a youtube-tutorial for some of the tougher control-logic but totally possible.

needs work (performance, more gameplay, enemy Ai/variety)
-no map is forgivable, but no compass? that's terrible. Gotten lost a few times by going off-road and ending up driving in circles, death respawns you at the bed you bound to). the only navigation systems are temporary corpse-beacons (despawn on game-exit) and manually placed blocks(personal path-markers) you attach to the terrain. 
-4 enemy robot types, mostly-harmless, dangerous if swarmed, 40 damage (of 100 maxhp) rapid-fire-predictive-projectile guard and chonky ""boss"", easy to understand but they spawn in low numbers with short patrol/aggro paths. a gun is mandatory for 2 but trivialises them all.
-(ark-ish) farming is supposed to generate waves of dangerous enemies (one wave at midnight based on if you farm and how big the farm is) but the spawn numbers and risk are entirely too forgiving considering how large a defence you can mount (eventually). this system needs to be MUCH more expansive and better documented/alerted.
-oil is manually harvested through swimming around gathering 1-3 drops (cap 20 per slot) at a time from nodes. Not bad for small/light/simple ground vehicles but heavier/rockets/multi-function constructions can drain a full 100-fuel tank in minutes.
-blocks act like solid objects but motors/powered-parts/bearings(pivots) have no numerical values/limits listed. You can break the game physics by not knowing how much power you can apply before say, a wheels traction will flip a construct instead of moving it how much torque is needed to avoid a saw/drill from getting stuck is a mystery, how much power/mass a bearing/part will take before it warps the structure they are attached to (like a spring being flexed sideways) is totally unknown.

didn't like
-despite having no player-compass the game world has an absolute x/y/z positional system, player structures are based off small cubes so structures can only be placed aligned to the world-grid (freeform items align to the first block you place onto the ""lift"" device but the friction of the terrain tends to have un-fixed items slide about). you can cheat the placement restrictions using pivots but physics objects will eventually tank your framerate.
-once you acquire enough fruit to trade for a gun 99% of the challenge vanishes, farming ammo is easy and the enemies are dumb (if deadly up close)


warning - very much in early access
-the game performance degrades in direct proportion to the complexity of your builds/physics-objects-used. your built items can freak out the games physics where your framerate starts at 140+ and steadily reduces to 14 or less as you build more/bigger things. on top of this theconnections between pipes/pivots/wheels/suspension-parts can overload local -physics/positioning-logic making objects disconnect or act like slime/jelly instead of mechanical parts, comical until your wheel/drill/door decides to detach itself, embed itself in the terrain then trying to snap back into position like an elastic band (tanking your framerate, possibly spilling your cargo and needing you to reset it's physics.
-survival mode is already better than many older games but it's still a bare-bones experience. you can harvest, explore for crates (think ark but only resources/parts/visuals drop from crates), build cool things, farm crops and hunt the braindead AI. no story, no secrets (that i have found), no challenge (after you get a gun) and no endgame/pvp(co-op is available)."
17207,PRETTY NEAT
17208,i really dont like this game waste of 20 bucks
17209,Very good game
17210,"its horrible

"
17211,"I never played survival, but the creative is super fun. You can build whatever you want for 5 hours, and then drive it for 10 minutes.

Jokes aside, I think it's a game for people who are into engineering/creative stuff because else you'll be bored pretty quickly. The game isn't really super well optimised, but it runs ok if you create a new world pretty often, as too many vehicles on the map can cause massive lag. It also has a few bugs, especially with suspension, which can be annoying but can also be turned into useful things in your creation (suspension stabilisers and steerers). The game offers you the possibility to build so many different things that you'll never run out of ideas. You also can have some mods that can improve your creations, though I'd like to see wings in the vanilla game.

10/10 would recommend"
17212,it's better than minecraft but it have some small bugs but it' ok for me
17213,the builing in this game was very good
17214,absolute dog shit.  Computer exceeds recommended specs however it will not get past the loading screen without crashing.  Piece of shit cant even crash properly as it bricks the computer and takes 5 mins to finally close as it is so poorly optimized it uses more GPU that a triple A title.  Tried every fix online and nothing worked.  Thank god for steam refunds
17215,ummmmmmmm its ok cant put half thumb
17216,"very open to do what you want, a lot of tools to do so"
17217,"This game is fun to build stuff and mess around but survival is broken and you can't progress. There is some stupid glitch where every time I try to ride a warehouse elevator to the top floor the game lags out and crashes.  Then when I reload I'm glitched in the elevator (under the floor or just with the doors locked) either way, you can't get out.  (the only way out is to jump around swinging your hammer for 10 rl mins until you are finally dehydrated enough to die and respawn) I have tried many times at many different warehouses and it just won't let me reach the top, which you need to reach in order to progress.  I support a lot of early access titles and I know the drill but this has just really killed my will to play.  Maybe further down the line I'll change my mind (if they fix this and I can learn to trust elevators again) but for now I am done with this game."
17218,nice game
17219,"well its hard to rebind keys for a south paw as Pgup, Pgdown, home, end are bound to the same keys on the numpad at the same time. not sure why this is but until it can be changed you might need to buy a controller to consider this game as a left handed person."
17220,Yes
17221,njjbkj
17222,amazing game all around
17223,It IS fun. But the glitches is what ruins the game for me
17224,Ur DAD
17225,yess
17226,"it gud
"
17227,it is a game i have wanted for a long time and I finally got a gift card and I got scrap mechanic and i love it but I don't have any friends that have it but if you have friends that have it or have a computer then I would get this.
17228,it's fun
17229,I really like the creative mode. I wish we had more block selection though.
17230,its basically minecraft but vechiles
17231,"fun
"
17232,"1,368.6 Hours is how long I've spent figuring out the quirks and nuances of this game. I went from making cars that couldn't stay upright, boats that don't boat properly. And helicopters that are harder to control than a tired 3 year old. To now making dune buggies with self adjusting ride height, boats that kinda boat right. And helicopters and orbital drop pods that are almost self launching.

Is this game fun? I don't think I have ever been so intrigued by making and wiring up a logic system, just to figure out how to make an auto cannon that actively targets those fiendish bots."
17233,fun and chill game.
17234,"survival is pretty meh. Creative mode on the other hand is 10/10 one of the greatest games I've ever played. If you bring mods into the mix, possibilities are pretty much endless. Biggest problem currently is netcode and the infrequent updates (latter is not to much of a problem thanks to mods). Physics engine has its limits and can occasionally have some issues, but often you can find ingame solutions to these problems."
17235,"yes
"
17236,really fun and has funny glitches but if you dont have a pc build by nasa you might crash in the warehouse if hosting

17239,get gud scrub
17240,"this is a game that realy put your mind at work and with the perfect mods you can create the most awsome things
about survival its nothing much to say
its awsome and it gonna chalenge you at begining

17250,"Best game of the YEAR easily, I mean, like sure it has a few bugs, and one of my worlds are corrupted, but all the mechanics (and yes I do mean mechanics as in players and game mechanics) are great! 12/10 would ABSOLUTELY play again!"
17251,great multiplayer
17252,k√∏kj
17253,best game ever
17254,if you  can think and learn what each thing can and cant do it has alot of way you can enjoy your world
17255,"Great foundation for adding features, this could end up an almost perfect game.
Edit: There are a lot of improvements that should happen but major updates are coming out slowly
Another edit (about 400hrs):  I don't have the perfect pc or an ok one at that, I do get lag spikes and drop to a few frames or none a second.  In my survival world I have everything welded to a tile (be it the ground, mechanic station, etc.).  My pc would die if I were to try and do what scrapman does and build a giant base, rather any youtuber."
17256,"its amazing bulid want i want
"
17257,"its a fun game, reminds me of the good parts of ark. its very simple and forgiving when you die. building is very streamlined whether youre making a house or a car or anything really, they make it easy."
17258,"I am waiting for the survival mode to get better, but I do enjoy planning and building fun stuff in creative. The engine is still a bit dodgy, and starts lagging fairly easy, but from what I've gathered, the development team works hard on perfecting this game, so all's good."
17259,"I recommend you guys to play it but the FPS loss is the worst. I was building my own world with good cars and a base, but it glitched out having the game unresponsive and could not be fix unless the Devs do something about it. Fun game but needs to be fixed."
17260,"Soild game with solid devs. Great build system that can make a surprising variety of vehicles, shapes, mechanisms, and stable physics interactions. Promotes [i]relatively[/i] true to life mechanical and engineering solutions for suspensions and weight balancing. Very pleasing artstyle, bugs are few and minor. Definitely a recommended play and I regret waiting so long to try it."
17261,Very enjoyable game and the recently added survival co-op mode adds another layer of depth.
17262,"good

17282,i love scrap mechanic ive been playing for a day or two and im  hooked on it. its so amazinng that you get to build anything you can imagine. i built a toilet spinner on my first day! the steam workshop is filled with unique creations and things from pro builders like david baguetta. i recommend this game because of its authenticity and how unique it is. no wonder why its all over youtube... XD

17292,....
17293,good
17294,it is very laggy for me but not for other people
17295,"yes totally awesome game wish i heard of it earlyer
"
17296,"LET US PLACE STUFF AT 45 DEGREE ANGLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is amazing and what you can build is ALMOST limitless. The amount of lag is absurd because of all the connections needed to do anything. Allowing us to build at a 45 degree angle will SIGNIFICANTLY increase our options to build freely, without lag. And I, by no means, have a cheap pc. 

Aside from my obvious misgivings with this game. It is amazing. You can build whatever creation your mind can think up so long as you have a general understanding of physics. And by that I mean that you comprehend every action has an opposite reaction. You don't need to be some genius to play this game."
17297,it is fun
17298,scrap mechanic iz cool

17326,Great game
17327,"This game has a whole lot of potential. It will be great to see where it goes but I also don't have much hope for it as it has been in EA since 2016.

Survival mode for 10 hours with friends and there just isn't much to do. You can mine for two different metals. The farming mechanic is not fun or consistent, but you have to do it because you're constantly feeding your hunger and thirst. 

The combat is uneventful and I believe there are only three or four different enemies. You get a hammer or potato gun.

Building is fun. Playing with friends is fun. There just isn't enough content to keep you coming back."
17328,"Can do almost anything you can think of, limit is your mind. though fairly glitchy, and crashes often, i still give it a high rating. crashes less than skyrim."
17329,"This easily could be a better game, if not for the crashing, bugs and plain awful food and spawn mechanics. 

The only thing unique feature in this game is the vehicle construction, which allows players to play with simply mechanics to create and use vehicles, such as building with blocks, linking wheels, controls, engines and rotational devices together, as well as buttons for any added guns and/or jet engines.
Unfortunately, this barely can be explored outside creative due to the food system, overpowered enemies, and difficult resource grinding.

The food, water and respawn system are broken. Food and water drain at such a high rate, that you will quickly find yourself dehydrated and starving. This then causes you to be unable to ride/drive vehicles or sprint. Food is hard to come by, as the main source of food/water is from cows(of which enemies spawn and begin to kill by day two), or farming, which causes a countdown that ends with you being assaulted by several robots, that can not only kill you, but destroy your crops and structures. Your only weapon is a hammer that takes 3-5 hits to kill the basic beginner robots(that do 20-30% HP damage to you each hit) and in survival mode is UNABLE TO BLOCK ATTACKS. Robots have the ability to break buildings and vehicles you create, and often spawn in packs. Further, once one see's you, every robot nearby will attack you, leading to 4+ robots that can quickly kill you attacking, each that takes 5 hits to kill.

Dying causes all non-tool items to drop that you are carrying. These items remain on the ground in a sack for you to pick back up, however you respawn with only 40% food and water, the prior of which is already being drained quickly, and only 35% HP. Further, your character is apparently too stupid to drink water out of jugs you create, or eat corn, or potatoes, as only certain food/liquid can be drank, the rest used for ammo or crafting.

If you are playing to create funny vehicles and have a great time on creative, or explore your creative problem solving in the challenge mode, this game is good to play. If you plan to play for creative, be ready for repetitive game play, long grinds for items with even longer craft times to make other items needed to work your way up, and lots of rebuilding and respawning due to crashes, enemy spawning/respawning, and despawned vehicles/items.

Did I mention the tank and sniper robots that kill almost instantly or destroy any vehicle, building or player in their way?

Until more fleshed out and balanced better, I give this game a 1.5/5 star for the survival mode, 4/5 for the creative and 3/5 for the challenge mode."
17330,Very Good Game 10/10
17331,"At 1st I though I wouldn't like this game at all, that it would be too focused on a complex and frustrating engineering system. Clearly this aged like stale milk, BECAUSE GODDAMN I LOVE THIS GAME, SO MUCH FUN WITH FRIENDS, AND THE CRAFTIN' AND ALL THE OTHER GOOD STUFF
OH. DID I MENTION THE DRILLER TRUCK CAR THING? SORRY FORGOT ABOUT THAT

9.5 / 10 - Incognito"
17332,i did not pay for trash
17333,yes
17334,cool
17335,"Really fun idea with building your own creations. The survival-mode (only mode I play) has some fun and nice ideas and I'm sure there's more to come.
Unfortunately the game is really poorly optimized. The game can run smoothly for a good amount of time then get inte some crazy lagspikes that even may require you to restart the game.
using elevators (in the warehouse) has crashed the game on serveral occasions. Building too many vehicles will make the game run poorly (and I dont even have that many).
So for now I would hold on for a performance update. It is a really fun and cute game, just need some tweeks to make it fully enjoyable."
17336,EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17337,it good
17338,its just amazing
17339,"To be honest this game looks like could be hell a lot of fun, but in the current state I can't recommend it..

- Building machines is just so incomplete and non explained, the community are just looking for glitches in order for example to make a Gyroscopes to turn a flying machine are made out of Suspensions and Gate Blocks.. is just a nonsense to be honest literally you won't know how to build pretty much anything cool without watching tutorials of how glitching this game works...

- Enemy IA seems really dumb, literally you can hit and destroy robots just by walking backwards and spamming mouse button and you don't even get hit at all...

I do no find enjoyable the current state of the game, they should add new Interative Blocks like Gyroscopes and stuff like that to make building easier for casuals."

17368,"iv'e played 200+ hours and i love the survival people say ""it doesn't have much in it"" but you can do tons because after all the limit is literally your imagination the creative mode is for people that like to use there imagination to the max and the survival is for the people that want a challenge while trying to progress and make stuff to improve there last thing such as your main car your base your resource gathering method ect i mean if ya try hard enough you will have a blast playing this game is you like: creativity sandbox open world and vehicles this game will be fun for you to play and the better thing is its only in like beta so there is plenty to come down the road so i recommend to hop on and have a laugh or a infuriating time ""trying to found out the one thing making your creation not work"" XD okay that's it just get the game if you have read this much :)"

17411,"Changing my review to Recommend (see old one below)

My son convinced me to try this game again and lo and behold they've done a lot of updates. Now runs well on both our machines and there's new content as well. I haven't played it a lot yet, but he seems to really be enjoying building stuff. Glad the devs are still working on it

~~
Game looked fun, got it for my kid. He was getting about 10fps on a 970. Tried everything I could find on google; windowed/borderless, turning all graphic options off/on, vsync, etc, etc. Gave up and switched to my machine that has a 2080, still garbage. Saw that it had been in dev for 4 years with little updates. Asked for a refund. Don't waste your time"
17412,Good
17413,"I overall enjoy this game. From messing around in creative and seeing what amazing workshop creations people have made, to the puzzling challenge mode the exiting and addicting survival mode, I find myself coming back to this game and enjoying it every time.
Since the game is still in development, optimizations and bug fixes are still in the works. I've experienced my GPU almost dying because V-sync was disabled by default, and I've experienced my bike disappearing from a one-off game crash, which took two hours to grind for the kits to make. Pistons and bearings make the game die when used often, but with a currently very active dev team and a great community, these issues may be fixed soon. The mod support is nice too, although I haven't really tried it.
Overall, I would totally recommend the game to anyone who seems interested"

17415,Yes.

17429,"legit so fun (atleast survival). At the beginning your creations will be pretty basic and often won't work properly, like terrible cars, but then you start to gain more resources, and are able to make more function-specific vehicles like mining cars and stuff. Then you get to a level where you think of crazy stuff, like a monorail that looks like a cable car that chugs along to a tiny island 20ish meters from a shore near the Mechanic shop where you plant your crops to stop bots from easily getting to it. I haven't gotten through a fair bit of the game still, like the Warehouses and Bosses, but it is pretty much constant fun. There might be times where a bot that is chasing you randomly turns towards your car and destroys the engine which is annoying, but overall pretty great. Glad they are adding beacons soon because far distance exploration is pretty risky since the inventory drop bag from when you die as an attempt to make a marker for your base has a maximum view distance. 

In terms of performance, was able to run this pretty well on my Core 2 Quad Q6600 on Windows 7 with 2gb of 600ish-Mhz ddr2 ram, however with a GTX 1050 ti and a cheapish 120gb SSD, so luckily it seems to be mostly dependant on the Graphics card and Storage, becuase on my main PC I put it on my HDD first, and it was just maxing out at 100% pretty much constantly. So definitely would recommend an SSD for this game, and actually while you're at it an SSD for the operating system files would be great too, as I've seen so many people with their OS on the one hardrive the have with everything else, and it's just capped and theres nothing they can do unless they trim it down and clone to the SSD."
17430,i like it and i have nothing bad to say about it.
17431,"Colorful and the right amount of goofy fun. And very affordable! It is noticeably thin on content though. Not much variation in enemies and unless you get REALLY into building bigger and more advanced machinery you are going to run out of things to do, pretty fast. I am optimistic that this will improve with future updates as the game is still in development."
17432,"This Game Is Great For Those Of You Who Like Survival Sandbox Games (Like Minecraft) But This Game Is A Bit More Complicated Than Minecraft As It Focuses Heavily Around Logistics And Physics. I 100% Recommend It To Anyone Who Likes A Challenging, But Still Fun, Survival Game"

17441,"Scrap mechanic : Survival - Solo.
The grind is terrible.
The need to stay near your farm to protect it is annoying to the point of making it useless.
It seems like the only purpose to the game is to build machines to reduce the grind so you can build more machines...
After 20 hours I couldn't find any reason to continue playing, I really wasn't enjoying it.

Might be the sort of game that is more fun and quicker to progress with friends.
As a solo experience, I found it a waste of my time.
I only bought it for the survival and I don't think I will be returning to it.

Other survival games played:
7 days to die, Raft, The Forest, Ark, Minecraft, Astroneer, Terraria, Subnautica."

17447,"Survival Mode Review:
Faults:
- Content drought
- No real goals
- Zero direction from the start
- Lack of combat options
- Help menu provides little to no value

To improve:
- Add a real goal
- There seems to be an attempt at factory gameplay with automation. Should flush it out more
- Increase combat diversity. 3 melee enemies and 1 ranged is not enough
- Exploration does not seem rewarding enough
- Character progression system (blueprints, levels, perks, something...)
- Base building seems unimportant"

17453,"We played with 4 person on the survival mode but were quite dissapointed.

There is pretty much nothing to do but to scavenge pre existing structures that are the same on each game.

The same ennemies appear and building block per block can be quite tedious.
There is also nothing that really explain how to eat or drink (we never found how to drink water ?).

Multiplayer was quite buggy and we saw each others name glitch through the ground and rolled back a lot. Nothing warned us or could show us what's the problem.

Overall not a game for me, might be for someone who loves to do everything with littles blocks (I love Minecraft, but this isn't the same at all.)"

17539,I've definitely gotten my money's worth playing this game (on sale for $13) and would recommend it in general however you need to know that there are limitations currently which may or may not change in the future.  My concern personally is the rate at which the game is going to be updated since it took so long to get the survival mode even though it was announced many years ago.  Here's to hoping Axolot does right by their customers as it has so much potential to be even better than it is now.
17540,"Great Game                                                                                                                                                                                































CARS CARS MORE CARS"
17541,Lag from awesome builds makes multiplayer unplayable.
17542,"Some updates have come to the game since I last reviewed this, adding more variety, a beacon system and the start of what I hope to be a decent way-point system as well.

The addition of the 'Log Book' also speaks for a possible story line, or at least some more depth in the game play, (Side quests.)

All in all; certainly going in the right direction, just hope it keeps on going.
As it is, it's certainly has enough to satisfy me; if you're okay just building and farming resources, I'd certainly consider buying it.  If that's not enough for you...  Perhaps wait a little longer and see where it goes from here.


Previous review below:

The game has lots of potential, but the pieces that are missing are...  The basics:

A compass to find your way around.
A map of some form.
Character progression.  (No armour available, and a starter weapon and end-game weapons...?)
Some incentive to actually play the game?  (Story Line, an end goal?)

I've played for 50+ hours, and enjoyed most of the time.  At the point that your ranging further from 'home' to find...  Resources (People who've played know what I mean.)  It just becomes tedious to find your way back without even a compass:  Your character is supposed to be mechanic, surely a compass isn't too advanced for them to make?

I don't regret buying the game, and it is still EA, but I'm not sure I could recommend it like this..."
17543,its fun
17544,"Great game, fun to play. Fun to make contraptions to fuck around with friends. If you don't have friends to play with, it's pretty fun too."

17548,"I love this game and I really loved the survival but after testing the new mechanics I feel this game has become boring, i feel like there is no end only grind after grind for resources I need a lot of to make something interesting. I still recommend this game because i played creative for 200+ hours and its amazing but survival needs a little work done"
17549,Good Game

17556,"great amazing  get you,ll love it i did"
17557,it awesome
17558,"yeah, i like the game, but i do question why it takes so long to make any content for survival and why it took so long for survival to release in the first place"
17559,"This game is a lot of fun until you get to the point where you need a spud gun to survive. If you've not holed up somewhere that you can farm safely this game becomes a war of attrition to make any progress. Once you get the gun tho things immediately get better...until you enter the new warehouses. You can't loot them until you clear them, which is okay, but currently that functionality doesn't work and you can just...get stuck on a floor. Forever.

Such a shame really. The building mechanics are incredible but I need games to help provide me agency, especially a creative game like this, so I need Survival mode to actually enjoy myself. But right now? I feel like I'm grinding my face against a wall.

Oh also the fact that Tape Bots don't die in one hit sometimes, rarely drop loot, have aimbot, and deal more than 50% HP in one hit and can very easily shoot you twice before you can react can screw right the hell off. Is this game a sandbox or Wolfenstien? Pick One."

17577,"In all honesty, this game really went no where.

I'm all for indie game titles that I can follow from Alpha to their 1.0 release, but honestly, if someone told me Scrap Mechanic had been abandoned long ago I wouldn't be surprised... I've heard nothing from it since it rocked the Steam shelves back in 2016 when it entered Early Access. Youtuber's hyped it up as the best and most fun sandbox game with dazzling potential down the line, and so many people bought into it - as did I. However, in my grand total of 4 hours played, it never showed promise that there was going to be more. I couldn't imagine it being more, or where it would go. It got sorely put back on the shelf.

They've only just added survival? After 4 years?
I don't know, this was just a little bit disappointing."
17578,Really boring game even with your friends
17579,"Game takes too long to start up and i have no tolerance for playing a shit story for 2 hours just to get to a game i might not like.

ive never seen a worse survival game, let alone advertisement for one.

17585,itd super fun
17586,"it is a game only for intellectualls would reccomend 
"
17587,"For an early access game it is Really good and fun to play. There isn't many bugs or at least not any major ones I've seen. The modding community is huge and you can find LOADS of great stuff to play with, and with enough creativity you could make it all yourself.
Perfect game for getting technical and creative or if you just want to mess around and blow stuff up with you friends and creations.
If you aren't the kind of person who likes technics or making stuff then you need something else. Or if you computer doesn't meet the recommended minimum and you want to make big stuff then maybe get a better computer if you need it and really want this.

Survival is still pretty new and there a few minor bugs in there, yet they don't really diminish the player experience that much. If you really look around you can get a good impression at what your in for. It gives you a little too much freedom by letting you walk off and miss the tutorial area and what is basically a crafting bench. I believe once the game releases in fully access or at least has a good year of development that the survival will have loads of content and a much better beginners tutorial."

17593,"It's only early access and I've been having a blast! Definitely recommended for those who have a technical creative itch (like Minecraft redstone kind of stuff). It's not like other early access titles; it's actually updated and patched, and runs pretty smoothly."
17594,"This game is plenty of fun. If you're a masochist.

The core concept of this game is great. Make vehicles with your friends, or stupid contraptions. Easy-to-understand tools with significant depth for veteran players allow simple cars or massive behemoths.

Unfortunately, this game runs so poorly I'm surprised you can call this a game.
Physics are incredibly awful. Crash 2 cars together and your game will turn into a slideshow.
Haven't saved recently? Too bad. That world is now unplayable. There's no option to remove vehicles that are flying around, or reset, or anything. Sometimes you just have to discard saves because there's a random thruster-powered vehicle going around smashing into things.

Multiplayer amplifies this problem. Somehow, the physics engine performs even more poorly, and the networking code is apparently written by a two-year-old. It's a shame, really, because multiplayer is the only thing that makes this game even close to bearable. By yourself, you might as well not have it.

As much of a clusterfuck as this game is, it's also really, really fun with friends or by yourself.
If you don't mind the occasional slideshow, it's pretty good.

I'm only just barely recommending this because it's so fun.

TL:DR Fun, brilliant, but not at all optimised. Not worth the price in my opinion. Get it onsale.
Good tip: Turn off Dynamic Lighting. Fixes a lot of problems."
17595,"Seems like a nice game but is completely broken, does not launch on my PC."
17596,Fun.
17597,"10/10 breddy gud
(received for free as a buddy picked it up for me so I could play with him and another buddy)"
17598,"Spent two days looking for the vital battery needed to do literally anything in the game. Found it ten feet from where it was supposed to go, behind a door I had tried to open several times only to eventually hit it with a hammer and find out that's the only way to open a door.

Wasted another day trying to gather resources to build things, while trying to defend my farm (because you starve every two minutes in this game) but was failing bad at it. Realized if I put my farm on the roof it would be completely protected, so spent another several hours building an elevator. Finally got the resources together for the elevator, went to set up my new farm, found out you can only grow on natural ground. In a game where they specifically have a bag of soil, and not like a hoe or shovel like most other farming games, you cannot use that bag of soil to . . . put soil wherever you want.

Tried to use the trader, but was really hard because I couldn't tell what any of the icons where. You can't just hover your cursor and have it tell you. I thought I saw a blueberry and a radish so I slowly figured most of them out, although there was one vital resource you need for an actual gun and I could not figure out what it was at all. Turns out I had to find a random person, SOMEWHERE in the world, and then apparently abandon my vehicle next to them while I smack them back from miles away because you can't pick them up or get them into you car or anything.

Finally gave up trying to do things on my own and started googling everything about the game. You know, the way everyone wants to learn a game, by not playing it. Admittedly I progressed quickly after that, I had a lot of fun building different vehicles and contraptions around my area. Eventually ended up doing a warehouse, which I guess is sort of the ultimate level of the game. Fighting enemies that kill you in two hits. And they are ranged so you can be dead instantly without knowing from where. If it was a completely fair game I wouldn't mind so much, but the amount of times my character became stuck or frozen on an object, plus the amount of times an enemy would decide a wall didn't exist . . . yeah, really frustrating. I thought it would take an hour or two. Took me ten hours because I was constantly having to run back and find my way to various elevators. I was miserable.

So I will say, if you know what you are doing in this game it can be a ton of fun. But there is no learning how to do anything, the game doesn't help you figure things out at all. Get ready to read a lot of articles and watch a lot of tutorial videos before you even think of having fun. A few changes, like letting us plant wherever, more base related items or auto defense items, and armor, would probably make this one of the best building games out there. As it is, I kind of wish I had avoided it."
17599,it cool
17600,yes
17601,The survival update changed everything but the game is still feeling like its in a beta stage
17602,good
17603,minecraft but you can make better stuff
17604,this game is amazing you can do anything that you think of
17605,"This game was not too complicated unless you needed it to be, And even if you dont love being able to make anything you can imagine, you can still dowload other peoples creations and play around"
17606,"If your like me, like exploring, discovering, and what at first feels like that old school, **** me I died again difficulty.. this is for you, and your little group... very nice game for a nightly sit down for a month or so...at least till new stuff comes out! lol
"
17607,i like that its got a survival and creative the survival can be hard sometimes like i got my lost loot bag stuck in the wall
17608,it is fun
17609,IT IS FUN
17610,Lets me be creative - very fun
17611,This is minecraft on steroids
17612,Epic
17613,fun
17614,I liked the Graphic Quality and  creativity of the game.
17615,"picked this up in May, when survival launched, and discovered that the ""crash on launch"" issue from several years prior was still prevalent. returned today, same issue."
17616,"fun games with friends, a bit slow to start with and not much guides so prepare to rely on google or a more experience friend"
17617,cool game
17618,its confusing at the start but its really good when you get into it so much to do and explore
17619,"its a verry fun and exiting game, fit for all types of players:

the builder / mechanic: use creative to make your dream builds
the survivalist: survival mode, fend off hords of farmbots while trying to find new loot

all in all this game is GREAT"
17620,you can build cars motorcycles houses and more i recommend it
17621,"One of the best and most entertaining survival games I've ever played, I highly recommend it.
One issue I wanna get out, however, are the horrendous ping issues in multiplayer. My wifi def isn't great, but I should be able to connect with anyone in the world without lagging into another dimension. A bit of ping is understandable, but I can get a reliable connection with someone far away in many other games, which says to me that the multiplayer is very un-optimized. I like this game a lot, I just wish I could play with my friends."
17622,"I honestly love this game. But you should get a friend or two so you can have way more fun.
Overall: Good"
17623,nice game
17624,"I can't really say that this game is bad, but in the same time I think it is. Beautiful game design and music, but too buggy for me to want to play it all that much."
17625,"I would recommend Scrap Mechanic to anyone, It has great gameplay, The amount of things you can make is practically infinite, from fully working steam trains, to a huge concrete cube, Even if the survival had a lot of glitches on release, (That they have fixed) even though they had 4/5 (Ish) years to create, the survival mode added so much more than I ever could have imagined. From upgradable parts, to giant warehouses scattered around the map. 

If you are having doubts about this game because its in early access, Don't have them, I bought this game and several others while in early access and so far all of them have been amazing games!"
17626,"good
"
17627,is good
17628,"This game is really good, when it wants to launch. It only sometimes doesn't launch for me because i am just above min system requirements."
17629,the game is awsome it gives you the most creative freedom out of any building game. can you please add wheels that are one block bigger in diameter than the big wheels and wheels one block bigger than that. and in survival can you please fix the ragdoll because if you ragdoll while being attacked there is literaly no way to get back up so can you please make it so that the longest you can be down is 6 seconds.
17630,ptcoll
17631,"really fun, lots of content."
17632,"Great game, amazing physics engine, updates and bug fixes all the time, many mods available, even though there are constant bug fixes the updates are few and far between. Would 100% recommend if looking for fun, creative, sandbox game."
17633,its not that fun with out other people but in survaial its fun by ur self
17634,it is epic
17635,you should play it
17636,:)
17637,its awesome and cool
17638,"Very fun! For me, its hard to get bored because there are so many things you can make and test out from other mechanics. Very relaxing music. would recommend!"
17639,its okay.
17640,cool game fun game
17641,this game has so many possibilites
17642,ree
17643,Like it so far. wonder what other mechanics an items the will add.
17644,FUCK YEAH SCRAP MECHANIIIIIIIC
17645,the best sanbox game next to trailmakers number 1!!!!!
17646,"this game is AMAZING
"
17647,very good and hilarious love playing it with my friends so creative would recommend.
17648,bob
17649,"The game has a ton of very old bugs, which were never fixed, you can't play it offline, even though you bought it, literally the only way to play it without an internet is by using an emulator."
17650,"the best game i have ever played
"
17651,Been with the game since late alpha and saw it grow over the course of 4 years to todays period. It was tough in the begining but the communitys faith in this game was strong. It was a tough time to get to survival as there were many set backs and pushes which lasted more than a year but the wait has paid off and we get to enjoy the game we always looked forward to in the SM community. Even though its pahse 1 release Axolot put forth alot of content to keep the player base busy for a while until phase 2.
17652,is fun
17653,NICE
17654,i liked it a lot
17655,it is very funny and imaginative game. there are lots of possibilities to choose from.
17656,"The fundamentals are pretty great. My review is purely due to the Survival mode. Yes it's early access. The first few hours we played was fine, everything working properly. When we started travelling and doing Warehouses are when issues popped up. Elevators inside Warehouses crash the game, and when they don't, they get stuck forcing you to starve/dehydrate to be free. When that happens the Warehouse is completely broken and you can no longer progress forward in it, wasting your key. FPS drops on high end (8gb rtx2070) graphics also occur and slowly start to get worse. After my 36 hours I'm giving up playing due to these issues."
17657,This is an awesome game for the builder/creator inside of someone. Once you get used to how the physics in the game work (or don't work) you can get up to speed making epic creations pretty quickly. With the latest survival update it has made me love the game even more than I already did.
17658,I like the game and its cheap for the content.
17659,Muito divertido.
17660,Good
17661,"Update 21/6/2022 

I think its cool enough to recommend. 

Runs a bit better plus I have a better PC than before. Creative changes are cool though and I have made some creations. Enjoying challenge mode very interesting. 50 game challenges and a huge amount of user created ones.

Main campaign not that entertaining solo still needs further development. Does not match trailers, many things that don't work as intended. Updated very very very slow. 
The engine that the game is built on follows the scrap theme of the game a little broken and under powered.

Great concept, been following this for years. I would advise you to keep an eye out for this for possibly getting finished in 5 - 10 years."
17662,"Lots of fun, amazing amount of flexibility in play options, sometimes pistons, sensors, saws etc glitch inside a wall, very frustrating but easy enough to fix, wish you could lock blocks (like the vehicle chairs or controllers) so you don't accidentally remove them but worth playing"
17663,im playing the game the right way
17664,i love the game
17665,great game survive and creative awesome
17666,its fun
17667,"game is very fun you can make trucks and play with friends
"
17668,"A complex game but once you learn how to wire it gets easier only problem is I dont know how to make cehicle look lala good

"
17669,pretty cool
17670,cause x=y
17671,My butt itches
17672,"lovely, brings out my inner mechanic haha oh wait"
17673,"Literally the most poorly optimised game I've ever played, both for the physics and the multiplayer. Likes to freeze when joining friends and lag for builds that are not even complicated.

You don't have real guns to defend yourself from robots but you can trade humans for resources.... Nice, slave trading is back.

Survival and creative are completely disconnected, with completely different parts and no way to transfer blueprints. This is just stupid, no one wants to spend hours building and rebuilding and fine tuning a fancy build in survival all while dealing with food, night, robots, lag, a single toolbar and tiny stack sizes or no stack size at all... (add survival parts to creative and a factory similar to the crafting bot for building blueprints in survival)

The tile editor is the most user unfriendly thing ever and would take very little to fix and make less of a pain to use. The map and tile content on the workshop could easily be tripled - just by making the editor less trash, not even new features, just less terrible."
17674,"i like balz
"
17675,Amazing and a really fun game to play for a casual stream. gets lots of views on videos
17676,"it's Gucci Lit Fam.
"
17677,"its a very good game, to play with your freinds."
17678,gucci
17679,"very cool survival game compares with minecraft
so the reason why some survival games lack is because:
complexity (how well it makes new players understand it)
endgame (does it give more content past when you beat certain parts)
hardness (is it too easy or hard)
and creative (does it work well)

so with compexity its not super complex or super basic it offers both astroneer is too complex with its resources and stuff and minecraft isnt complex enough to do some things and scrap mechanic has both and on my playthrough the only thing that confused me was cotton because it didnt have a indicator in the craft bot but also endgame is something thats good because in minecraft endgame is good same for astroneer and it works well for this too with making cars and doing experiments you can do anything and now for hardness and its not too hard with the bots and stuff but theres a big grind to make a base or something thats big unlike minecraft or astroneer and its only the only problem and next is creative and it was started as a creative game so its pretty perfect unlike astroneer 

overall if you like survival type games play this (the reason i bring astroneer and minecraft a lot is because those are the 2 games that are like this that i have poured more of 100+ hours each on my xbox or pc)"
17680,great game
17681,this game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good
17682,i use big booms
17683,"I bought this Game for the Survival Mode, since creative is rather boring without friends, and my friends dont like this game.

Sadly the Survival mode is hot garbage.
The emphasis of the survival mode is surely to explore the more or less interesting map. I deduct that, because you get usefull and mandatory upgrades and materials by scavanging buildings and fighting enemies.

yet the game also incentivizes you to build a base and stay stationary, because in order for you to survive u will need to eat and drink. to prevent starvations and dehydrations, you are supposed to farm cattle and fields.
this limits you to a certain area, since u will need to attend those fields and animals.
If you build your farm too big, robots will start attacking it. this prevents you from stockpiling foos, to go on long journeys.

that problem is further intensified by the vehicles using TONS of fuel. the motors are so damn unefficcient, even with MAX upgrades, that i cannot even drive 5 minutes in a straight line without my tank running empty.
futher there is no way to automate fuel production. this means you need to stop every 5 meters to farm oil UNDERWATER to craft new fuel.... BACK IN YOUR BASE (because thats where your crafting station is).

this alone is a huge red flag for fun gameplay, or good player progression.

and yet it comes worse:
in order to use most blocks to their fullest potential (like making pistons extract further and faster, or having multiple command chains on a single button press) you will need upgrade modules. these upgrade modules are also needed for crafting almost all interactive blocks.
and where do u get these upgrade modules from?
same as the ingrediens u need to attend your farm:
from exploring and combat.

combat is so dull that i want to hang myself after playing this ""game"" for 23hrs.
theoretically there are multiple weapons in the game, wich can be found by extensive exploring. yet after over 23hrs i have not found any new weapons because exploring is limited by food and fuel.

this essentially means, that you are stuck to one area, never seeing the whole map, wich leads to the question:
why should i play survival at all?
if i am stuck to one area and building vehicles is 100x more cancerous when u have to farm for hours, just to get ur vehicle to move for 2 meters, i start to ask myself why i should start playing creative mode after all.

there i dont have to worry about all the shit thats bad in the game... like the whole survival aspect and can just enjoy building stuff.

but creative mode always means there is no use in building vehicles, since u dont really need them for anything except looking at them.

The thing that finally killed this game completely for me is the performance.
I startet to build a huge truck, to carry all my items and crafting machines around, so i could at least be somwhat mobile. it has 12 wheels and that was enough to drop my FPS from solid 144hz to 20hz  AT BEST. 
THIS SH*T  IS UNPLAYABLE AND NOT EVEN FUN.

My honest opinion:
while not perfect either, do urself a favor and play space engineers instead of this game. it is better in every aspect and u are actually allowed to build vehicles there without being punished with farming for it. in space engineers your creations work for you, not the other way around.

I will update on this, since it is EA afterall and maybe this will turn out nicely, but at this point in time i cannot recommend this game at all!"
17684,"Played for only ten hours so far and its so much fun, the logic systems are decently robust, and most of the interactions between different blocks and systems is super interesting, i'm excited for the future of this,"
17685,very fun 5 stars
17686,there is star wars lel
17687,"Very nice game. Solo or with friends. Highly recommending.
Unique sandbox experience."
17688,IT IZ GOOD
17689,I have cancer help

17697,its THE BEST GAME EVER the graphics are perfect  and plus i have a computer that cant even handle medium settings on fortnite. and i can even STREAM and it still runs perfectly. 10/10
17698,has a lot of potential! Definitely worth a shot

17706,just get from the depths
17707,.
17708,"Its and enjoyable game lots of fun . still a few bugs but well worth the purchase , only thing i wished it had was a map or at least a craftable compass to make easier getting around"
17709,Thought I couldn't run this game for so long but I absolutely loved it and thought i would give it another go. Runs so smooth now and its always fun bouncing around the map with glitches. Highly recommended especially with friends.
17710,yee
17711,"Have been really enjoying this game so far! Even in EA, there is a TON to do and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface. Lots to explore and work towards. I can't wait to see what happens when they implement the story!

My only complaint is that loading in can be a bit tricky. The loading screen takes forever, and often I have to restart the game 2-3 times to get it to not crash and to load textures."
17712,fun
17713,this sucks dont buy it dont even talk about  it its a toltolle scam
17714,good
17715,"Pretty good game, played this with my friend survival, and i played alone in creative.
the only thing i didnt like is that crops take a long time to grow, you cant eat potatos (sadly) and also scrap metal is too much of a hastle to obtain."

"
17734,good
17735,its not well optmised and have no story to tell but its fun solve problem and build machines and bases out of imagination. buy it on a sale or something.
17736,"Potato go pew. Woc explode in confetti. Much realism, such wow. 11/10"
17737,nice building game
17738,it ok but if u lose uor can then bad
17739,"This game is 100% worth the money, there's creative, survival and challenges. The steam workshop is full of fun stuff, and even though the game is still in development its really fun to play and there is updates and bug fixes every week."
17740,it pretty decent
17741,good game
17742,I really love this game because you can build anything you want like a plane if you have the know how you can build it. You can now build boats in survival.Literally anything in your hearts desire could be made like to be honest I would not be surprised if someone made a simple computer in the game.You could even build a flying house that can also drive.Anything is possible.
17743,it is fun and  fun all the time
17744,"This game still needs a heck of a lot of optimization, it's very laggy in multi player.
But it's worth persisting with it, the game mechanics are incredibly fun and allow for hugely varied & interesting builds. The ragdolls are also hilarious. Hopefully this game will only improve over time as it gets both expanded and more refined."
17745,"Minecraft, but with cars and robots. It's very fun to play survival mode and build vehicles, you can also go into creative and create mechanical inventions, which is harder than you think. The Logic gate system takes lots of Trial and Error and so does building any moving vehicle. 

9/10 worth the cash if you have the time and patience"
17746,"Fun and addictive - love the that you can just go anywhere investigating and create your own vehicles, either living off the land  tracking and fighting robots whilst travelling about, or setting up a huge base with defences and bringing the robots to you by triggering attacks.  
The Warehouse instances are totally different and brilliant fun for sniping tapebots and getting upgraded plants and gear.  Can be a laggy depending on your computer ability if  you are playing with a friend but other wise that brings more fun to the game allowing your friends to join in your adventures with the multi player aspect.  Really enjoying this game!"
17747,good game
17748,Amazing Sandbox mode. Super fun to play with friends in survival.
17749,"Relaxing, creative game. You need to collect resources, build a few robots, find food...but then the world is yours. Resources are abundant and mostly easy to find. There is some grinding involved but it's not that troublesome. The game truly comes into its own when you begin constructing your machines. You can build vehicles, automate farms, or build machines to help you explore, defend or collect resources. And you can do it with friends."
17750,still epic!!

17760,"Very fun and interesting game. Really addictive and creative game. I have been playing for more than 50 hours with my Girlfriend and we are pretty into the game. We are looking forward to all new features that will be coming to the game and will play for it. Totally worth the money but thats for us, because we had a friend to try the game and he didn`t like it much on top of that he had hardware issues with the video card. The game is still in beta and there are alot of bugs."

It's got the right balance of complexity for building and farming to keep you interested but it's not overwhelming enough to put you off. I thought there would be a huge learning curve but thankfully there wasn't."

17775,"It is so cool, you can make cool contraptions out of logic gates and stuff."
17776,One of the nicest and most creative building/survival games I've encountered so far; for now there's only co-op if you're playing multiplayer rather than PvP but the PvE stuff should keep you entertained on the battling front :)

17785,"I really enjoy playing this game with friends! However it has a number of crashes and bugs that eventually make it unplayable.
There is no dedicated server, the workaround is to run a game on an extra computer and friends can join from the Steam friends list. I setup a script to make regular backups of the save file because we found that often times the game would get in a state where anyone connecting remotely would crash a few seconds after loading into the game. Reverting to a save file seems to fix it, but this is a tedious process and demoralizing when you lose a bunch of work.

I really want to recommend the game and continue playing but the crashes and bugs have made it unplayable."

17805,Its a really fun sandbox game with creative and survival. My friend had it and i was obsessed ever since!
17806,"great game, make sure you have a decently powered computer however. I would give it 5 stars."
17807,this shit is amzing
17808,"lots of updates bug fixs and game improvements from the devs :D 
and survival mode is lots of fun"
17809,It's just a great game overall. Love it!
17810,"Great game, good physics, good lore, and I recommend it to players that like physics sandbox games."
17811,ok
17812,.
17813,great game
17814,gg
17815,.
17816,This game is awesome! Just needs a story in survival and its done.

17818,"(:

17819,"Crazy good game!!!!!!!!!!

Best game ive ever played."
17820,This is a very fun game for people who like mechanic based games. Would recommend this to anyone.
17821,Too much like minecraft for my liking
17822,I made a giant flying d#ck
17823,ok i put no but if you have hours and hours to put into a game and love grind grind grind go for it there is so much to do just i cant do the grind thing anymore now if you play coop it might not be bad but no one i know has them game so
17824,Good game to play coop. Wife and I love it
17825,its good
17826,"It is a great game and i would recommend it to others, but some people get it for the survival mode and after I played it for a while I realized that it becomes a boring game, you have to grind... a lot. After that phase its fine but still. 
Also, if the dev's are reading this I think you should add a story, and better loot-difficulty ratios.
but other than that, it's a great game, I'm loving it and think other people should try it out. =)"
17827,"Scrap Mechanic, the efficient learning time waster. I enjoy thinking I'm actually doing engineering projects but really I'm just having a blast playing this game. Great for Kids to use thinking skills they might not use commonly in school."

17829,its a fun game if ure into sandbox games and making vehicles
17830,At one point it is boring. But if u play for the first time you can try it.
17831,"good
"
17832,"It's a fain very game.
"
17833,is cool
17834,worlds 2 best game ark is better
17835,AMAZING! it makes makes everyone so creative definitly kids like me
17836,game nhu lol
17837,"Grab a buddy (or three) and enjoy this open world where the only limits is your creativity (spelled: resources) and literally, the sky."
17838,"i really love this game and would recommend this game if you have friends to play with. Survival is fun but try out creative before just to get the hang of things. once u start to play survival i really recommend watching some of scrap mans vids on utube, it will really help you to know howto do stuff. it is a fun game to play and I hope it tonnes of fun for you."
17839,"So far only played survival mode and gotta say no part of it is fun, its an exercise in frustration thru and thru. Honestly stopped farming because its just a perpetual cycle of suck.  Im sure some people find this fun and good on them, enjoy what you enjoy. but me personally.. I feel its too tedious and punishing in its current state. games should be fun from the get go not something u grind like a low paying job to eek a few bits of fun from."
17840,very good
17841,"This game is a fine tinker sandbox but the ability to have a weeks worth (three to four hours a night) of grind harvesting work vaporized by a Farmbot in one swing during survival mode ruined any sense of enjoyment for me. If my character takes three or more swings to knock out, how can my metal machine be so flimsy as to take only one? Even a wooden vehicle should last longer than a guy in a torn up jumpsuit. :D
"
17842,Great Game
17843,cheese
17844,awsome
17845,great game
17846,i really like this game but it needs a lot of things tweaked especially the grip of tires when one can not stop a vehicle from sliding down a gentle slope without welding it to the ground there is a problem. there a bunch of other issues that i hope they can fix before full release at this time i have a hard time recommending this game. i have a lot of hours in to this game and am finding the glitches and the grip of tires so frustrating that i am going to have to take a large break from this game at least until there is a major update.
17847,epic
17848,Even after 200 hours i'm still not yet bored of this game.
17849,the amount of stuff in the game

"
17855,REALY FUN GAME
17856,"I really enjoy this game, ive been playing for a while now and its really fun multiplayer but also mega enjoyable solo, download it if you are a technicle person."
17857,This is the most fun game i have ever playd you shuld chek it out!!!!
17858,"Great fun with crafting, building machines, and survival. Still a bit glitchy with the networked physics (it seems like the devs are running the physics sim on clients and host, then using impulses to ""catch up"")"
17859,IT IS SUPER GOOD  IT IS FUN ACTION PACKED AND HAS GREAT BATTLE MECHANIC
17860,"Still in development but already a fun game. 
Could be roughly described as Minecraft with engineering.
Definitely worth checking out!"
17861,This game is Awesome
17862,its so good
17863,One of the best creative sandboxes ever in my opinion. Survival needs a bit more work and more purpose.
17864,best game ever
17865,class
17866,"Unfinished, scuffing/clipping survival game. Same as every other generic survival game on the market. It isn't finished, clearly. Which is why I regret purchasing it. There's no story, no progression and no way to win. Why I love survival games, I also like to be able to finish them (like subnautica). This is not one of those, there's still a ton of work to be done before its ready. 

TLDR; don't buy it until its finished."
17867,fARm BoTS SHouLd bE a REAl ThINg!
17868,"The game is awsome and developed very good, the only thing YOU need when playing this to make it fun is a friend to play it with..."
17869,best
17870,yes
17871,noice
17872,always carry a toilet
17873,"Game is lacking on a lot of things, but its a fun little game for kids I think. Just not for me I guess."
17874,nice
17875,it's a vary fun game.
17876,Perfect Sandbox style game!! Hours of Fun!
17877,"A group of us purchased the game, thinking it would be fun to play as co-op.  Big mistake.  They have pages and pages explaining to you how to make an item, but you have to be lucky in getting anything to drop.  That includes fertilizers, soil, and seeds.  When you wake up, all they really need to start you off with to help some of the confusion is, ""Put out the ships fire, find a bucket.""  Well, that would tell you a bucket is nearby.  Near the bucket they give you a garden shed to explain at least how to garden, but expect to die at least twice of starvation before one plant matures.  And oh? want to explore?  You can't eat that corn that is out there. 

In the two hours that we played, we didn't find any food you could forage except that which was either in the garden (and gl with fertilizer), or what was found in the rare green chest.  At the two hour mark we gave up, and three out of the four of us got a refund (the fourth had been gifted the game, so no refund back). 

I can not currently recommend this game.  I can see that there is potential for it.  The graphics are pretty, the sledge hammer hitting the enemies is fun (not hitting the logs-or the excessive amount of time to refine logs into blocks), swimming and exploring under the water is enjoyable.  However with all that said, I can only say, ""No,"" on the recommendation.  It still needs a lot more spit and polish before it earns a, ""Yes."""
17878,its complicatedly fun
17879,It's fun.
17880,I'm obsessed.
17881,shit sucked
17882,you're a mechanic that uses scrap
17883,...
17884,i tried this game out because of its the same devs from raft and i wanted to try it out and this game gives me a lot of confuse and i had no idea on what i am doing i refuneded it and i do not recommand to play this game if you dont have the patience to learn since the game is pretty confusing .I tried the game's survivial mode and it has no survivial in it . I do not recommand to buy this game if you wanted to play survivial game since this game's was intented to create and build but not for survive
17885,what a game and even better since thay added survival
17886,"The game used to be fun, It's just not like before the survival update."
17887,good job
17888,"good
"
17889,if you like grinding for materials and farm raids you will love this game. i know i do
17890,I love it is great
17891,This game is amazing!!!!
17892,"TLDR: If you like minecraft or other survival, crafting, building games. You'll love scrap mechanic

I purchased this game when it first came to steam. At the time creative mode was all that was there, I eagerly waited for survival mode to come as the trailers i watched had hyped it up pretty good in the beginning. 
Fast forward four years later and survival is here, and boy was it well worth the wait. Survival mode does need more content, which i hope comes at a decent pace but judging by the past pace of updates i'm not very optimistic. you can pretty well build whatever you can imagine due to in game logic and interactive parts. 
Bearings and pistons are sometimes quite wonky and will make your creations have unexpected reactions. I've read people claiming its just physics, which it is but they aren't quite real world physics. 
It would be great if the devs would allow for bearings to be upgraded to carry more weight in the way other parts can be.
the weld tool functionality could also be improved. i often find suspension doing weird things, bearings going floppy, pistons pushing through blocks they are attached too, but to be honest. its pretty funny when your mining rig has a collision issue and starts doing the robot chicken.
even with its flaws which are too be expected, I'll continue to play this game and updates come out it will get better, the game has slowly gotten better over the course of its development and if this holds true this game has a lot of potential to be better than many other games of the same genre 
"
17893,good competetor to minecraft at the moment
17894,"Considering that the main sell point is ""mechanics"", you don't actually get to experience fun mechanical or thoughtful gameplay unless you install mods. Most of my 4 hours were spent in either pitch black (which you can't use the bed to skip) or figuring out that my crops and base was getting wrecked on the first night by robots... I think after several years of development you need to at least get the basic elements in place. Hopefully my refund request gets accepted."
17895,"Good game.  Really kills the time.
They added great mod support, but ONLY for creative mod.  
There are some instructions online to try and get mods working in Survival mode, but it involves downloading, copying and editing of files and I was still unable to get it to work.
There is a MOD tab in the Craft Bot for survival, but its always blank.

I only play survival and would like mods too.  :( 
"
17896,"What a fun game and the devs have put in such great little (and big) things that will make you smile/laugh for sure. I play this game with my man and there is so much to do for us. We grind and collect, explore, build, we have to be creative to afterwards laugh our heads off with what we have done or build or found ...
Absolutely an amazing game to have!"
17897,it's a fun game but it has a big learning curve a bit to hard for kids but teen and up would learn fast
17898,All of it
17899,"its like mechanical minecraft

17907,yes

17910,Amazing Sandbox Game! No Coding Needed! You Can Build Everything! I Am Going To Try To Make An SUV When This Is Finished Being Made!

17922,I love this game <3
17923,"A very good game, would recommend."
17924,amazing building mechanics
17925,"How to stop playing this game ?
I already adictide"
17926,"good
"
17927,Its a very fun game and i highly recommend it to everyone
17928,"Such a fun game. The beginning is pretty frustrating (hardly any tutorial in survival mode) but once you look up enough stuff on the internet and understand how the game works, it's so fun. The feeling of pride I got when I had a problem (How can I mine stone effectively?) and then designed my own machine to solve it is unmatched. The tools they give you in this game open up so many possibilities."
17929,it is great other than my game crashes often
17930,"good
"
17931,this is an amazing game to create what ever machine car rocket and more in creative mode or go for a  challenge in survival were its survival of the fittest but no worries did i mention you can play with your friends within this amazing game called scrap mechanic
17932,Very fun would recommend a pretty nice PC
17933,YES
17934,This is the best game everrrrr
17935,really good

17938,"Graphics: Good
Lag: it happens every day
idk what else its Good
"
17939,"Best purchase I have ever made, Such a fun game, Wide verity of PC's that you can play this on, I play it with a older end PC and it runs smooth as butter. Recommend getting!"
17940,"I highly recommend this game as a Parent/offspring activity. If your kid is into building, engineering and robotics and you are too this will likely be a blast to play with them. 

Just be aware it is buggy sometimes. it needs to be optimized and there can be a lot of lag that can be frustrating at times. It is definitely an early access game. but if you can get past this it allows for some great creative problem solving and collaboration projects. Stuff you and your kid can really build some bonds around. 

Now if they can just come out with a dedicated server like minecraft realms that would be awesome."
17941,One of the best games ever but it just needs to run better on the low quality computers.
17942,"so much fun, and very educational sometimes"
17943,"Build, Eplore, Fight, Beat challenges, See them all here on scrap mechanic today!"
17944,it is the best a tiny bit like minecraft you make creations and survive i think is is better than minecraft because you can make a lot cooler things.
17945,yes
17946,"It is awesome!!!!!! i love it!
"
17947,"Very fun game, creative and survival both have very different appeals and are both amazing. Be prepared to think up or find ways to build cooler creative builds and economical yet cool builds to meet your survival needs. Tons of fun, especially when playing with a friend."
17948,12
17949,me like
17950,This is the best game in wich you can craft any type of vehicle
17951,new update sucks
17952,"I love how I can create pretty much whatever I want and do whatever I want with it, but sometimes the bouncy and restrictive physics make me want to destroy what I've been working on for the past two hours"

17958,Absolutely nonsense fun and laughter with your friends! Would definitely recommend getting to have the best dumb time!!!!
17959,"Really cool love the game, its amazing!"
17960,Fun game to screw around in.
17961,"this game is pretty fly not gonna lie, and if you write a bad review... well you probably shouldn't cause that's... not smart. Definitely get this game."
17962,I enjoy the creative freedom that you have with any creation you can set your mind to making.  The only issue I have with the game is the inability to attach bearings directly to suspension pieces.
17963,"I've been playing this game since its release in 2016 and it never disappointed me, it's such a beautiful loading screen. 10/10 would load again"
17964,"Its fun
"
17965,YES
17966,Great game to play with friends.
17967,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE pretty good game i like the sandbox vibe
17968,"Scrap Mechanic is an amazing game and I daresay possibly a better version of Minecraft. I know this will result in a lot of anger from die hard Minecrafters, but despite the lag and the sometimes eccentric physics I believe this game is destined to be revolutionary. Creative mode enables endless creativity (duh) with custom worlds and room for designing anything you can think of. As long as it is not a boat. Or a plane. Unfortunately, there is no water features or aerodynamics, but anyways, who cares about that when you can make almost anything else in existence! I'm not much of a survival guy, but to my surprise I was hooked and I ended up playing a couple day long campaign with my brother! It is very rare that we agree on anything, but together we made a travelling base that may have looked like a scrap heap, but it worked! Scrap Mech is a great game with plenty of potential, and I can't wait to see how it improves in the future."
17969,it is a VERY good game
17970,Basically minecraft with a focus on mechanical creations rather than architectural
17971,I like it but food is always a problem in survival. it is hard to grow food because robots can destroy your crops and food isn't common in chests. You can use cheats though which is probably the best way to get food.  Other than that the game is fantastic. You can really build whatever you want.
17972,its really fun in my opionoin aslo i cant spell
17973,i don't like how quickly you can be killed there is no armor as far as i now and i lost virtually everything in the game because of that (i was driving and a spud firing robot shot my seat crashed my car then killed me i tried to go back) i rebuilt and got my stuff back . I don't recommend playing it if you are easily annoyed or are familiar with shield and using it
17974,if you like puzzle games this is for you the challenge mode is so good
17975,"it s a brilliant game

17978,awesome
17979,"This game is a fookin Gem. A GEM I TELL YOU!
Survival mode has AMAZING potential, but holy smokes does the multiplayer suck buffalo dix man...

I got this game with my bros and we are a small group of 3, and of course you going to make MACHINES! But that's where the issue is at the moment with this game... Making complex machines, adding ""too much"" can cause massive lag and fps drops to the HOST. 
There's duplication of mesh errors happening causing massive amounts of strain on the engine this game has, i really hope it gets fixed at some point.

This game is really good, just be a bit patient and wait for the Devs to fix the big multiplayer issues with rubber banding and fps drops when it comes to machines the players build. 

Buy the game so they can afford to fix it, see it as an investment ;)"
17980,"This game is very good for people that love games like minecraft or building games with a lot a short combat. Creative mode is exactly what it sounds like. This game is INCREDIBLY Laggy, when you do any thing like putting bearings on bearing and spin then they violently shake and bearings are the thing you will you use the most and or most prone to glitchs. Multiplayer is horrible it crashes like five times before it lets you join your friends and multiplayer is laggy"
17981,this... good
17982,yes
17983,great fun
17984,honestly what Sn00bE doge said
17985,"Blin, this is gud!"
17986,"Very creative, and is like a revamped version of Minecraft."
17987,yes
17988,fun
17989,please
17990,"the game is fun to play but even more fun to break. three words, rocket powered toilet."
17991,Yes/No/Funny/Award
17992,"I really like the survival mode in the game and overall its sometimes boring when you dont play with friends survival is okay without friends but creative is boring without any other players
"
17993,Good
17994,"YES, game gud and make crab car"
17995,"Runs well on low-end hardware, super fun game (Probably my favourite game!). Building controls are easy to learn, The Guns in survival mode aren't over/under-powered but sadly the bearings and other moving parts get really laggy in complex creations, but overall great game! 11/10 would definitely recommend!"
17996,i liked it
17997,yes
17998,"Great game so far. I am playing survival mode and I have to say it's very aesthetically pleasing. Nice world to just chill out in for a few hours. Already got my partner hooked too, which is nice as we can play together through Steam. Game shows LOTS of potential and I hope the developers add a bucket load of new things to interact with and build in the craft bot. ( Also if you are a developer reading this, can we have more hair colour choices at the start please? I really want blue. :[ ) I've not played the other modes much if at all, so I can't really comment on them, but I'm sure they serve their purpose well. Anyways, I'll STFU now and just give it a big thumbs up.

Edit: I have since found out that you can get more options for hair colour if you use the scroll wheel. This should be made more obvious as there is no indication of more options."
17999,tried to play this game and enjoy it but i got bored and quickly tried to pick at back up again but it was just not fun the game play mechanics are spot on dont get me wrong feels great to play just wasnt my cup of tea wish i could get a refund but i'll take the L
18000,"i can build anything



ANYTHJINNGGGG!!!!!"
18001,"This is an awesome game. Its like Minecraft, but not as blocky, and a lot more focused on technology and vehicles. So basicly nothing like minceraft. I learned about this game from Ibalisticsquid's channel. Please check it out."
18002,Straight awesome
18003,GREAT AWESOME GAME COMPLETLY RECOMMEND
18004,I love this game its great you have challenges to to face which are grow food kill robots and build to survive
18005,so simple yet so good. worth every penny.
18006,Jerron is a potato
18007,"Very good game - lot's to think about when building stuff. Quite grindy at the start, but once you get established with craftbots, refineries etc, then it gets better. Make & build anything you can think of. Lots to do & see. Robots from tote bots, too the big red bosses - these alone will keep you coming back for more! Start growing your own crops & watch out for those bots!"
18008,its ok you dont really understand it at first but it grows on you
18009,crashes to much :(
18010,Good game
18011,"keep lagging until whole game not responding ,."
18012,"Could have been a good game but the gathering rate of materials is incredibly low and grindy to the extreme.  Makes it a really boring quest for more materials. Sorry but on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this a 3.
"
18013,mostly a master piece of course it comes with a few cons that I wont dive into but its very great considering what kinda game it is I mean its a cartoon style sandbox survival with robots that you can fight and even build a robot (kind of)
18014,its aight
18015,"I honestly can say that this is one of my Favourite Survival games. Fun, entertaining and you can build what ever you want. The sky is literally the limit."
18016,"good game, need more endgame content tho"
18017,its fun
18018,Cool game üòé
18019,very gut
18020,"This game is FANTASTIC, I absolutely love this game I really like creative mode and survival mode is awesome. This is on my top 5 games list and it ranks number #1. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend. I'm very excited for the future updates, but keep in mind this is early access so there is a few bugs, but as creative and build what you want games go, it's great. I hope this review was helpful!"
18021,Pretty fun but after a while survival mode can get boring. Creative is fun and if u gets some mods its even better.
18022,"If you are planning to get this game only for it's multiplayer aspect so you can enjoy it with your friend(s) keep in mind there is a very high chance that the game will be unplayable for at least one of you.

The lag/delay was so bad me and my friend could not play this game at all ( delay would go up to 2 seconds for us ).

We were really looking forward to trying this game but unfortunately the game that beat us :("
18023,Fun game but u need to have BIG BRAAAAIN to be able to do stuff in the game. its really well done and alot of cool stuffs in the game.
18024,nice
18025,"This game is cartoony but challenging. I would say of all of the survival/crafting games, this one is one of my favorites so far. I feel like the game play is balanced(for players of my low skill level) and the game is compelling enough to keep me interested."
18026,"good a hate it gamemod s
"
18027,love'd it!
18028,good game
18029,"It's a great game, *BUT* the game crashes frustratingly often. Often for what seems like no reason. Until I can play this game normally instead of in 15 minute nail-biting increments, I'm gonna have to leave a negative review.

Other than that it's a super fun game and I'm really happy with the survival mode.

edit: good enough just give us the damn wedge blocks please"
18030,yes
18031,.
18032,you get to create what you what.
18033,Good game
18034,"This game is very fun and can be played for endless hours! I love the way you gather resources and create things. There are a couple bugs when it comes to multiplayer but apart from that and a few other bugs including mass amounts of bearings its a great game, must have

P A I N"
18035,its dope
18036,"The survival mode of this game SLAPS. It's so much better than minecraft in the sense that you actually have to try to survive. In minecraft, its so easy to survive that it makes you advance too quickly. In this, you have to farm, loot buildings, get milk from cows, and other stuff to fill up your hunger and thirst. Also, its so fun to craft all the cool mechanical stuff! Amazing game. Creative mode is super fun too, but the survival mode is AMAZING. One complaint though is that I wish the cook bot made more varieties of food. Other than that, its great!"
18037,"Much good. GET IT. 
I played it since early stages of beta. Only getting better. 

Now quit reading and get it already."
18038,good fun
18039,fun
18040,it was good
18041,This game is enjoyable.
18042,more like CRAP mechanic.
18043,"best game in 2020 its so goated even if ur a battle royale gamer this game is just good 
"
18044,it good
18045,ITs a very fun game to just mess around in and just build some weird stuff.
18046,Good game
18047,its hard butt fun in fact its so good i dont no what to say
18048,"..capitalism is dead, glory to communism!11!!"
18049,Survival mode is fun. Runs smooth and does not demand a lot of computer power. Don't get me wrong it needs a computer that is NOT a potato. Has some bugs but then what early access game doesn't. Lots of harvesting and crafting 'rabbit holes' to explore. MODS are out there to make it a bit less of a pain to advance.
18050,its good lol
18051,Bad
18052,easyily a win for me a great sandbox game with an amzing survival mode i would change a few things but its understandable as this game is still in beta.
18053,I love this game ! It is very creative. Having at least 16GB of ram leads to much better performance than only 8.
18054,I just wanted to say that this game has been a memory of mine and i have had this amazing game for years now and im just  reaching 1k hours now and me and my friends love to play this together and ive made so many fun creations.
18055,fun game lots to do
18056,Probably one of the more fun games my friends and I have played in a while.
18057,all around fund game
18058,build stuff and have fun i reccomend it
18059,nice
18060,"very technical

18061,"veri gud, makes you feel like a brilliant scavenger"
18062,tdsfs
18063,10/10
18064,"Yeah, it's okay I guess..."
18065,Such a fun game! It is a little hard to get going if you are a noob gamer but give it time. The graphics are adorable and make the game more fun. I definitely recommend this game if you love to build and fight and explore.
18066,"I hope that the manufacturer can optimize the lag in survival mode as soon as possible, and I see the part about the mod in the survival mode, I am looking forward to it, and finally, I like this game very much."
18067,bad multiplayer fix it already
18068,cool game
18069,"This is a very inventive game, it was a real joy messing around in sandbox and making abominations of nature that should be killed without a second thought!"

18077,it is fun to play and make frinds
18078,nice
18079,it good
18080,Is nice
18081,Really is a diverse and intriguing game. I am interested to see what the devs next update will be.
18082,i just recovered my account and i loved this game :D
18083,Fun game. Definitely recommend it but wish there was more instruction on how to play it.
18084,"A Competent early access survival for single player.
Pros:
- World map is big and a little different every new game.
- Challenging but forgiving for starters.
- Most bugs are still playable.
- Creative freedom to play it with least restriction (build a micro tank to raid the warehouse is a must try).

Cons:
- Ambient sound is too soft.
- No event music when bot raid arrives.
- Making a boat is pretty crappy especially when the thrusters burn out fuel too fast and deletes the fuel when removing the thruster.
- There is nothing more to do after discovering and unlocking all the tech available.
- Bug: the raid timer goes invisible when you log back on when logged out during the time.
- Game breaking bug found: The chem container once full can disappear if try to place it on a vehicle and you'll be stuck in ""carrying state"" so you can't carry anything else and will consume more water.
- If you park your vehicle in the warehouse it can fall through the floor once your exiting the elevator when loading the structure and if you spawn in that vehicle it's GG you'll be stuck in limbo.

 Hope the devs add in more bot types."
18085,the survival is GREAT
18086,"It is a game that's cute as a button, super casual in execution of building stuff, yet can be quite difficult when it comes to combat.
It captures building complex machines from simple primitives very very well, and its a core premise of the game, where you fight, loot and collect stuff around you, to refine it into blocks that you then use to either craft usable parts (such as engines, wheels, propulsion jets, etc) or blocks with certain properties (such as buoyancy, weight), and then build yourself whatever you want, really.

One huge issue I have with the game is that it, quite literally, doesn't hold your hand anywhere. I spent first 2h in the game wandering around, trying to figure out what should I do and how to unlock all the recipes. I repeatedly died at a distant place (that looked important) and got respawned 5 RL minute walk away.
After 2h mark, I gave up and went to read the beginner's guide, which explained what am I supposed to do - so game became more fun immediately, but this should _really_ be communicated better inside the game.

All in all, big thumbs up, if you ever enjoyed lego technics as a child - this is it."
18087,gooood
18088,ist is a good building game and i have injoyed it alot
18089,"epic had loads of fun but laggs sometimes :( i hope they fix it
"
18090,GOOD UPDATE!
18091,if you like freedom youll love creative mode. if you like freedom and death youll love survival mode  just get the game see for yourself and you will not regret the purchase
18092,This a good game survivle is really fun!

18100,"the creativity, survival open world to do as you see fit"
18101,The lag in the game is very bad and it still needs a lot of work. It's full of bugs. Will be a fun game when its finished i am sure of it. but for now. Save your $$$$.
18102,building stuff is fun...yay
18103,i like the game it is fum
18104,CO-OP works absolutely amazing. The progression feeling is one of the best. This game is a must if you are interested in simple engineering.

18120,yes jim
18121,"This game is very funny, also the survival mode is pretty cool. But creators should do a controller or gamepad support :)"
18122,works on low end computers like mine so it still runs pretty well
18123,fun with friends
18124,Best steam game
18125,very cash money worthy
18126,"Really great game and I feel it could be incredibly fun but...

The multiplayer has really bad input lag for whoever joins the host which makes the game borderline unplayable.
The reason I got this game was to play with a friend and seeing so many people have this same problem since 2016 is disheartening. 

I'd say I'll wait until it gets fixed but 4 years with this problem is not making me feel so hopeful."
18127,"The game is good fun.. etc.. however, the difficulty ramps up pretty fast and in the last 10 hours of my game.. my first 10 hours, I've probably spent a good 2 hours just running to where I got knocked out.. build a farm and bots raid you, twice per crop, each time more and more come, it's simply overpowering wastes resources and food trying to protect against them, resources that are difficult to get.  Later resources do protect you from this, to such a degree it feels like you're cheating.  You literally just farm the bots.. that are supposed to be stopping you farming food.

As the game currently is, i'd say yes if you don't mind loosing ¬£15.  Otherwise not recommended.  

There's also a lot of unnecessary grinding, some items cost pretty insane levels of grind.
I'd also add that loosing multiple vehicles due to the seat being destroyed, is a massive downer, given how easy the bots can hit the seat.  Hours of effort and grinding lost in seconds.

There's also no map ingame, no waypoints, no compass, no means of navigation at all.  So get lost.. and you have to suicide.. just to get your bearings.  Of course, then run for your stuff.  

I am on the fence really wether to recommend or not, it is an immersive & fun game, probably more so in mp.  

There's a single save file, which takes a very long time to load.  And keeps loading once you're ingame, causing short term fps drops.  No save options.  Although you can delete the save from start menu. 

Overall 8/10 for creativity, but 6/10 for gameplay.

Actually.. I've been thinking about this abit now, if you want to buy this as a Game.  Don't.  That's my recommendation.    However, if you want to buy this as an engineering game.. ignore the scrap part, with some sandboxy survival bot killing thrown in.. buy it. Right now.

The ""core game"" is not really about the bot killing or the survival.. it's actually about creation of robotics, coding, design.  Crafting.. in it's truest sense.  Yes there's abit of grinding to throw in as well.  But ignore the complaints and there's a real engineers dream of a game here.

Changing my review to a positive.

That was then, this is now.  They added some stuff it's better now, but overall there really isn't a whole lot to do.  Except build some crazy vehicles etc.  It's an excellent sandbox game, abit laggy in multiplayer but still excellent fun.  I have nearly 300 hours ingame now."
18128,Absolutely an amazing game 8/10 would always be down to play again!
18129,very fun. Especially for creative people
18130,played it for a bit
18131,love it!!!!!

18149,"pros: Its fun you.
You can build.
Cons:Food takes a while to finish growing but if it was like real life it would be longer."
18150,Absolute great game. Put a lot of hours into it and enjoying it building my own and seeing other fantastic creations created by the community. Overall i would greatly recommend this game.
18151,is good
18152,its very fun and easy  like buiding farming buying and fighting
18153,Scrap Mechanic more like CRAP MECHANIC HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA

18161,Challenging and fun.  Bit of a bug when he starts swinging his hammer like crazy.  Touchy mouse maybe.  Just starting out but really enjoying it so far.  I see a lot of potential.
18162,"Scrap Mechanic is a great creative/survival game! Get it.
"
18163,goog
18164,"I just played survival.

I enjoyed the game for quite a while. Built some nice vehicles to get the jobs with the stones and trees done. I semi-automatized my farm a lil bit and so on. I was looking forward to try to automatize as much as possible, so I was working on a pipe-network. These vacuum-pipes are freakin expansive, so it took me like 1-2 days to get the job done. Once I was finished with a simple network from base to farm to water-pump, the framerate dropped to 4 fps. Wow, how disappointing. I am writing this while I am frustrated with the game. I don't know if I will ever start the game again. I guess I will try in a year or so. This needs to be fixed. The fps drops even if my network isn't currently doing anything at all. 

Also, there are a few things missing in the logistic-system. Currently it is impossible to filter items, which makes it impossible to automatize stuff in general ‚Äì which is impossible anyways, because the framerate drops hardcore if you try. The vacuum-pipes tend to flood the network. Is it so difficult to differ between lazy and greedy chests? 

Building your base on the edge of two different chunks does also cause problems, which is just ridiculous, as most people will not even know that they built on two different chunks. 

I did enjoy the game alot for a while, and if you just want to build awesome machines, this game is for you. If you plan to build an automatized base, forget it. Currently simply not possible. 

I will maybe check on the game again and change my review in the future. But for now: I can't recommend it, as it is super frustrating."
18165,e
18166,it very fun
18167,i love to build things and this game does it for me
18168,1000x better than it used to be and it used to be amazing

18174,so creative

18176,I find it a little boring but it's a really good game anyways.
18177,"very fun, a little buggy though, but im sure that will get fixed later on"
18178,as a fellow pink haired mechanic i can say this game is lit and will always be playable even if i start a new save.
18179,Great game. So much fun....can't stop playing!!!
18180,"OKAY...... This is one of the best games that i played. no bugs, no glitches no lag."
18181,You can build anything you want. You can make a car that uses wheels or even a walker. You can download MODS so you can get different items.
18182,GOOD
18183,Meh
18184,Scrap Mechanic is a great game where you can be super creative and build almost everything and play with your friends (Update)
18185,Great game! Definitely worth the full price ($20). A lot of stuff to do and the survival feels rewarding :). If you want to develop your logic and creativity this is the game for you. It is even more fun with friends

EPIC"
18196,i like it and so should you
18197,its ok i guess
18198,Dont get me wrong the game is great and super fun and i see a lot of potential but the amount of bugs and co-op ping issues are insane(solo runs fine) im gonna keep playing but hope they fix it before any other release.
18199,"like minecraft, but you can make cars without mods and all blocks fall unless if anchored to the ground"
18200,"Love the concept and am very excited for this game!

The game right now is insanely hard to play because of the intense lag-backs. The game also takes longer than expected to load the title screen and the graphics seem to initially load pixel by pixel, sometimes not rendering all textures until a restart.
The survival mode also seems to be extremely easy at this point and with no direction.

The consistent and frequent lag-backs have caused me to give up on the game for now; however, with new updates and fixes, this game could really be something special!"

18204,this game is so fun creative has a whole bunch of things to experiment with there is survival mode its like creative with more things and every thing you have to work for while surviving and there's challenge mode where you create and fix cars and its all fun and games so i really recommend this game for others.
18205,its fun
18206,Good isnit
18207,wy wood yoouo get thi game when fortnie ois literaly fre?
18208,Just so much fun!  Totally lost track of time while playing.
18209,"This is a really fun game, if you are creative and know what do you want to build. The survival mode is good, if you are playing with friends."
18210,Yes
18211,i played this for a long time g 153 hours
18212,this game offers a great creative and survival experience
18213,"TLDR: If you like 7 Days, Space Engineers, or the like, this game will feel very familiar. But also, be prepared to search through mods to make it completely enjoyable. When on sale, the game's a bargain.

Scrap Mechanic is basically 7 Days to Die... with a better build mechanic. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, fighting to survive in a world of zombie robots to prepare for ever increasing waves of berserking mechanical hordes, can be fun... the problem comes from how limited the build set is, and how unbalanced the robots are... The lack of a map is also a MAJOR pain in the ass. MAJOR! The game would literally improve by leaps and bounds if there was a damned discover-able map... Besides the map, the game's build mechanic is not as rewarding as 7 Days, or Space Engineers, it's very difficult to make things look nice. It lacks basic shapes and edge pieces, and the physics can be more than a little wonky. Scaling is difficult, either you create something too small, or way too large. And the bots, are just plain annoying. Alone, they're super formulaic, you can kill them with ease by simply walking backwards, but then the difficulty ramps up suddenly if the basic units, the farm bots, are in packs, or if you suddenly meet a tape bot. Again, no scaling, but this time for difficulty. Either, it's a slog fest where collecting something takes forever, but is very easy, or you die almost instantly. Resource collecting is also a chore, mining stone is relatively straight forward, until you try to do it on a hill, where your invention's wheels just slip around like they're on ice, or fail to lock when you leave the control chair... Trees are also needlessly laborious to harvest, not to mention useless, as wood protects as well as paper. Component kits, BASICALLY the game's currency, is needlessly randomized to obtain... The game's just a mess of barely connected micro-tasks held together by a mildly interesting concept...

But is it worth buying? Yes actually, it is. It's shockingly well priced at 20 dollars, it's updated fairly frequently, the graphics are consistent and pleasing, it has three play modes for variety, you can customize your character, there's no useless research tree... and for lack of a better description, you can just jump in and play with very little difficulty and enjoy yourself... at least for a while. It stupefies me how little games such as Scrap Mechanic, which has its problems, bugs, and limitations, can choose a correct price point to make purchasing it rather painless, yet bigger so called ""triple A"" games, can unload a steaming pile of crap, while demanding 60 dollars..."
18214,Fun game with limitless potential!
18215,Very Creative
18216,Fun game. Very creative.
18217,very nice !
18218,Played this game with my friend and it was great the update to the game adds more than the base game
18219,this game is so gooooooood
18220,The back wheel always catching up with the front!
18221,lol
18222,"This game is so fun even with friends. good graphics, good machanics and good gamplay. but it needs a bit work to refine. cuz there is some bugs in game which makes my friend restart his world and redo all the work and struggle we did. but anyway i will give it 4.5 out of 5."

18230,"I love the whole character play aspect, with eat/drink/fight survival coupled with build your best bot/machine/car/whatever the heck you want! There are some bugs that aren't exactly game breaking but are still a nuisance. 

-Blocks you place then pick back up seem to disappear. (case in point, I placed 256 blocks to gauge a distance, picked them all back up to find I had only 212 in my bags. )
-Logging back into the game, sometimes all of my creations are flipped upside down. Not game breaking but strange still.

As you can see by my hours, I'm not only addicted already but I haven't advanced very far yet so I don't have any other bugs to share at this time."
18231,Its very creative and educational. I use it for homeschooling
18232,IT IS GOOD
18233,you can make cars so i recommed it
18234,AMAZING GAME
18235,"The first month (about 325 hours) so far playing co-op Survival is the most fun i've had in a non-MMO co-op online game with my friends in a very long time. The game can have lag issues when several players are using overly-fancy vehicles triggering tons of collision detection, but for the most part multiplayer co-op plays smoothly enough to be a nice drop-in/drop-out place to hang out with friends. Survival mode has enough of a game in it to give players [i]a reason[/i] to try building new contraptions - it's now more than just a non-game creative mode toybox to play around with for the sake of playing around, which was important to me. No excessive gore and vibrant colors rather than washed-out edgy grittiness make the game very welcoming even to kids, who could probably learn a ton of basic design and programming logic with controllers, timers, logic gates, and sensors in the mechanical system.

Also: Axolot made the incredibly smart decision to allow people to zoom out from first-person view to a relatively wide-angle third-person view. This makes the game playable for people who get motion sickness from the narrow-angle field of view that many survival or FPS games employ. That disqualified almost every similar game because a few people in our gaming group can't take the narrow field of view; but they can do Scrap Mechanic with no problems in third-person view."

excited to see how this games continues to evolve, both for me to learn, and to watch the developers continue. 

only downside, occasional glitching like I've lost blocks I've laid down in between world layers, and I wish I could set buckets down and NOT have to just store or dispose of them."

18266,"[h1]The only game with udder powered bathub cars with sawblades![/h1]

This sandbox game is great. Just take a look at the workshop to see what amazing stuff you can build(and then hold back your tears because your creations are never that amazing)

Seriously this game has everything you could desire.

- An unlimited supply of toilet paper(that's valuable nowadays)
- Unlimited Bubble wrap so you can keep popping it
- More potato than your potato PC
- Udders (could come in handy, you know)
- A shark that you can wiggle as much as you can desire

220 Hours in and I yet have to build an udder powered bathtub car.

Only the survival mode is very grindy. On the other hand, you can actually mount sawblades to your udder powered bathtub car and then go choppin' trees. That's something special, I guess.

Seriously, buy this game! If you're too lazy to build stuff your self, just download stuff from the workshop while you're trying to launch the first udder into space! And if nothing else works, just blow it up with explosives. You'll have a blast with this game!



Well, here's me having a blast building an air balloon in survival:

18271,this game is fun to play
18272,"Fun game with friends, updates are taking forever."
18273,its the perfect game get it now
18274,"this game so good and requirs brain . Buy it now if you have some friends . All of Theme good but multiplayer mode a little bit delayed . Pls work on multiplayer mod.

Thanks for reading."
18275,"This is one of my favorite games. Period.

Even though I don't have the most play time on it (by a long shot) and it is not one of the games I am absolutely addicted to, it is still awesome. This was the second game I ever got on PC, only beaten by Minecraft. 

And to me, this game offers what I felt was missing in Minecraft: moving parts. Sure there are pistons and all, but you can't make a car or anything. Not in a way that matters or counts.

This game also allowed me to explore computing and logic, something that is really annoying in MC is made simpler and easier on here.

Not to mention, the devs are still putting out more content years into it, like the Survival Update. We have been waiting, but they sure delivered.

If you like unique survival, this is it. If you like sandbox, this is it. If you like experimenting with logic, this is it.

This is a truly well made game, and it does not have that many bugs. They mostly reside in physics, but you don't have the problem so often that if makes it unplayable at times, it's only the occasional flying piece of something.

It was so good, I actually bought it twice. Thumbs up to Axolot. I wish this game had taken off more and gotten more people into it."

18281,pretty fun and complicated game
18282,Nice
18283,very addicting game. Never worked with logic circuits before but with a little help from the workshop i was able to build really cool trucks and devices while in servival mode. I would like to see the pistons stop at different locations when button is released. it could be used to move arms in and out for like a backhoe.
18284,Trash
18285,super fun unlimited build ideas lots of lafter soo many goals to achive i think its the best game
18286,"[h1][b]Trash physics engine.[/b][/h1]
When you press a wheel against another one, 
and want to use the first one to drive the second like gears,
they turn out rotating in the same direction...

A suspension/steering system with pistons and suspensions can even make the car float?! And you can even yaw the car in the mid air with pistons in that system?!

Those glitches should not be seen in a 4-year-old game.

BTW, plz learn something from Besiege."
18287,"i have this game since 2017 and i love it, amazing updates, amazing gameplay, amazing comunity"
18288,Fun
18289,"amazing survival ""gameplay"" story is bad cuz there is none"
18290,"This game has so much potential! I love the idea of building whatever your imagination allows you to, amazing game mechanics and survival mode is really enjoyable too! The only downside to this game, is that it's laggy as hell with the more technical you build is, e.g More switches and buttons installed the FPS drops down so bad. 
If this issue is fixed then this game would improve 10 folds! Would still recommend it though~"
18291,"This game is amazing and more. It's like 'Raft"" but with real enemies. It's a bit to take in at first but, follows through with more than you can imagine. Seriously, check out the community, its insane what you can build. The only issue this game could have is being too complex for anyone under 12."
18292,this game is great fun and so much to do and it for all the ages to play cant wait to see what the updates bring so well worth the buy and the play
18293,"Great game for those looking for an experience akin to something like Minecraft. While the learning curve for the game may be tough initially, there are many great resources on youtube to help out new players. 

The best way I can describe this game is the video game version of K'Nex. So if that sounds like something you would like then this game is definitely for you."
18294,A really fun game. I love how you get to build your own cars and how you have to build everything it feels so nice to finish this big base you have been working on or that car that you wanted to build. If you like building this is the game for you

18337,"Awesome game! It turns out that just the suspension was messed up, and the game works completely fine as long as you don't use it. No suspension. Suspension bad."
18338,"As it stands now, I can't recommend the game.

So much possibility and always being updated, this game is sooo good you will forget what the time is. I would love more items in the game like more BOT stations that allow for more tools. However, that is my own personal opinion as I still haven't played with everything in the game so take that criticism with a grain of salt. Love this game."
18355,"good
"
18356,"Great game, would highly recommend."
18357,"Creative Mode constantly crashes & let's game freeze when playing it with friends !

when a person tries to join your lobby, chances the game freezes is ~80%, that's too much!

All in all awesome game concept. But since it has been out for over 4 years, and still struggles with that high amount of stability issues, I can't recommend it.

When you play it only by your own, almost everything works fine tho.

"
18358,please fix the warehouse elevator thing cuz sometimes it bugs and we lose all the items
18359,"I love everything about scrap mechanic
Best game ive played so far"
18360,i think scrap mechanic is a really good game. Because the idea's are endless since you can create anything in the game. So my finale answer is its a fantastic game.
18361,is verry good game
18362,Really fun and such a variety you can create anything you want free your imagination
18363,very nice would play again
18364,For someone who isn't normally into these crafting type games I have been having a blast thus far. I highly recommend it.
18365,good
18366,Great for buuueelding :D
18367,"In the games current state I can't recommend. Bought it play with my wife, we play in the same room on 200Mbit internet and the game is almost unplayable at times which makes it very annoying. Every so often things or you will glitch out of the game and be gone. The bots are nice even though it would be nice to have a few more but the grind for a spud gun wasnt very enjoyable. The game allows for so much freedom in building but at the same time is very limited in building as theres not much variety. This game also really needs armor. Grab it if it's on sale but I'd wait for them to work some very serious flaws out."
18368,"Quite a lot of fun since the survival update.
Building system is pretty straight forward, even the logic systems make sense without a degree in robotics.
Needs full workshop support in survival.
I'm looking forward to future updates
"
18369,It's a ton of fun to play with friends! Definitely a lot of things to figure out and craft and a whole big world to explore. Being as the game is still in early release there are some bugs and glitches as to be expected... and hopefully some more content will be added soon but overall super great game!
18370,":)
"
18371,"lots of fun concepts to play with. The survival mode is similar to minecraft survival, but it focuses a little more on vehicle builds. I'd recommend playing multiplayer with friends over solo play though, as it makes it easier."
18372,its cool
18373,"I am unable to play this game at the moment, if I click at the wrong time, it will crash. If I do something too fast, I crash. I just launch the game, I crash. I'm sorry but I don't see myself trying to play this any time soon."
18374,YES 10 / 10
18375,you're always finding new stuff and getting your mind blown
18376,"I really wanted to like this game and normally don't post reviews. However I feel like eventually this game will be fun, but in it's current state it's just unplayable. Aside from other problems people have mentioned, we played survival with three people and the rubber banding was almost constant. Seems like the further away you are from each other the worse it is. The game has a hard time with multiple enemies on screen as well, rubber bands so hard that you can't fight back and end up dying - or the game will just crash. I'm not going to refund the game yet because it is still being worked on, and hope to see future improvements and updates; however we've all decided to move on from the game until then. If you plan to play solo, it does not have any of the above issues and you might really enjoy this game."
18377,"A fun game, but with a few issues. 

Firstly, this game is fun. A survival game where you build all sort of wacky contraptions and fight off hordes of enemy robots? That's right up my alley! Unfortunately, there's some niggling problems that hold this game back from being as good as I believe it could be. 

The game looks beautiful. The cartoony aesthetic fits perfectly with the somewhat silly premise and the absurdity of some of the vehicles and machines you can create. That said, there's time where this level of fidelity can impact performance. My computer more than meets the recommended requirements for the game, but as I explore, I'll run into little lag spikes as the world loads. Sometimes these lag spikes can hit with as little as stepping into a building that's been on my screen for several minutes. Granted, the game is still in development and performance optimization is usually one of the last steps in a game's development. Also, it may be something particular with my graphics card or drivers that's causing the issue, but it's worth mentioning. 

Onto the game-play itself, the building is fun and very intuitive. It's clear the developers had looks at other games with similar building systems and have learned from other attempts how to make building fun and rewarding. But again, there's little things that strike me as odd, or even frustrating at times. For one, some of the materials you need are downright puzzling. Beeswax for making wheels? Shouldn't they need rubber, or at least oil? Oil is already in the game. Scrap metal you get from killing robots being refined into normal metal as a crafting component makes sense, but then some parts have to have scrap metal, not normal metal, yet there's no way to turn it back into scrap metal? I get that some of these parts are needed very early, when you might not have the means to convert scrap into normal metal. But why not have alternate recipes for these parts? An inefficient one that takes scrap metal, and a more efficient one using normal metal? 

Another interesting aspect of the game is the whole 'raid' events, and how they're triggered. In short, you need to farm plants for food, materials, and ammo. However if you plant too many, you'll attract robots that will attack your base in an attempt to destroy your plants. Seems fine enough. Except these raids will keep happening regardless of where you are, so once you start framing, you're practically glued to one location, meaning that far-reaching exploration becomes almost impossible if you're on your own. And that's another issue with the game, it seems intended for multiplayer as the default. That's fine for most people, who aren't stuck on slow a slow DSL connection. But even if you aren't, that presents it's own problems. More people means you need to farm more plants to feed them all, meaning raids will get larger and more dangerous, meaning everyone has to stick close to the farm to protect it instead of going out and exploring the world for resources. This is one aspect of the game that definitely needs some rethinking in my opinion. 

Another aspect of the game I feel could use some more considerations is, well, all the scrap parts you'll be finding. Early on they're great for quick builds. but once you get a little ways in and you're gathering wood, stone, and metal with your machines, they become downright useless with only a few exception. Now, it's cool to run around in a vehicle made out of vending machines and wooden boxes, but not practical. And the stats of these items compared with basically every other block in the game means there's no real reason to use them for anything but decoration. Rather than being rare, useful items with only a limited number of them in the world, meaning every time you stumble upon an old abandoned roadside market is like striking gold, they're just junk cluttering up your base once you get a few hours into the game. There isn't even a way to break down these items into more useful parts. 

And lastly, this game NEEDS native mod support. Like Space Engineers, the ability for the community to supply an endless list of new parts, new mechanics, and even new enemies is the only way a game like this will have any longevity. And apparently there's already a modding community that's sprung up around this game. Except none of the mods seem to work. Every attempt I made at using mods from the Workshop or installing mods manually has either simply not shown up in game, or ended with the game crashing on load and needing to reinstall the entire game again. For a game so focused around building as this one, this is almost a death sentence. 

In my opinion, I'm glad I picked up this game over the summer sale, and while if someone else was interested in this type of game I would recommend them picking it up, I'd also suggest they wait a bit till some of the issues were more ironed out, especially the much needed mod support, but seriously considering it."

18379,This game is not good. The survival has almost nothing to it. Very little progression. And the physics are terrible for a game that has a focus on vehicles.
18380,why wouldnt you want to make a toilet launcher
18381,5/5
18382,very epic.
18383,"good game
"
18384,E
18385,its a good game
18386,"This game is VERY enjoyable.  I've seen only a couple ' glitches ' in the 81 hours I've been playing.  The game is still beta.  If you enjoy crafting, this is a game for you.  You are given basic building blocks and the rest is left to your imagination.  The help files in game could be more complete, but the folks on you-tube cover that shortcoming well.  Your creations are restricted to 90 degree angles, which is a bummer for some functions but can be worked around.  As I make things, it opens ideas for making other things.  Improvements are easy to implement.  Other than bots attacking, there is no real destruction.  All parts are re-usable.

This game is in Beta, and is more complete than most triple A games being released by the 'big' dev companies.  Well done.  I do not recommend waiting for a sale this time.  Get it now.   :)"
18387,"Great game, you can make a lot of different types of machinery, survival has a lot to do and building there feels extremely rewarding"
18388,Scrap Mechanic is fun as well as a good outlet for creativity whether playing solo or with other players
18389,For now im playing solo and having alor of fun but its always better with friends
18390,very
18391,"What i love about this game is that it doesnt really give too much direction. It kinda just drops you in this apocalyptic world thats run by robots who wanna kill you and you just gotta figure out how to survive. A friend and I easily put 20 hours on this game together running around collecting items, farming, and building things. Its been alot of fun <3"
18392,Its good but dont use to many modpacks as this can hold an item or block that can freeze/crash the game
18393,good
18394,Great game with loads of potential. sure there are some bugs but no more than from a triple A title. yall need to stop being so hard on indie devs. this game is awesome.
18395,nice game

18407,"Not normally the game I would play but it's highly fun especially in Co-op, great potential to be a fantastic Indie game.
Would be nice to have navigation added, I got lost and had no chance of finding my base again, I have no sense of direction!. Overall definitely worth the price."
18408,just a fun game

18432,"It's a fun sandbox game for everyone to play! I like the graphics, and the controls too!"
18433,
18434,Very nice
18435,"This game doesnt feel like most survival. I bought it cause of the survival mode and neebs gaming. Its an amazing game. Most survival ive played are easy compared to this. For a noob on scrap to not know how to build atm, this game is extremely difficult but a ton of fun too learn. 9/10 imo. It would get the other 1/10 if it had some sliders for a custom game. just imo"
18436,"I had fun playing this game. It has big potential especially the vehicle building part though can be lagging at certain point. The lag can be bad when playing with friends. Overall, it is a good game"
18437,This is the best game especially the survival update

18440,This game is one of my most best games I have in my libary
18441,"Fun game where you collect materials and use them to make all kinds of stuff or you can just go creative than your only limiting factor is your imagination and computer power, i do recommend this game for anyone who enjoys crafting games"
18442,it is fun
18443,"Drank milk infront of my dead teamate, would recommend again."
18444,"good game and now theres survival which just is amazing

18446,"Amazing game has got a lot of work to be made in survival though :)
"
18447,"It's an amazing game

"
18448,"Probably one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. I usually never play these kind of games - as a matter of fact this is a first for me - and I can't stop playing. It has action, depth and nice graphics.

The Survival mode is the game mode i'm playing - and it's fun. It's a work in progress, and struggle with dropping framerates etc. but they just released the game mode a couple of months back, and I hope they will fix all of this in time. It has so much potential for expanding the game features. It's also fun in multiplayer."
18449,üëç
18450,"Game gud, buy now"
18451,"Minecraft is not a game I enjoy. So I'm surprised I enjoy Scrap Mechanic! I just love farming the trees and mining the stones and metal. I love the building of buildings and vehicles to my friends I play with. And just nice, Survival mode was released recently plus it's on Steam Summer Sales discount (at time of review)!"
18452,"it good
"
18453,yes yes yes yes yes
18454,I like it cus its fun
18455,"great game
"
18456,if u like space engineers you'll love this
18457,like mincraft but so much better I love it the best game in history
18458,"very good game 
"
18459,its fun
18460,Go into this game with an open mind. The game is still in dev so there are some bugs glitches and lag spikes but there are tons of videos out to teach you how to fix or utilize these things so have fun! Also Haybots are scary.
18461,"A wonderful but chilling game full of dark themes and horror, Scrap Mechanic paints a grim picture of the future of humanity. Jobs replaced by robots who go rogue and kill all their masters. Nobody even caring that an entire planet's population has vanished. Humanity having progressed so far that they forget the most basic of tasks, such as cooking raw food or even drinking water. Blatant disregards for human safety during construction of structures. Classifying a tomato as a vegetable. Using genetic modification to create blueberries the size of a head. You name it, this game has it. It is not a game for the faint of heart. The visceral combat will challenge you at every turn of the game while you struggle to fend off farming robots turned rogue, armed with pitchforks, explosives, and pesticides lethal to humans. You do not even have access to firearms thanks to exceedingly liberal policies preventing you from owning anything stronger than a potato gun. But should you survive, you will be greeted with an entire abandoned planet to call home, full of useful scrap metal that can be refined. You may create your own vehicles and explore, combat, and dare I say, thrive to your heart's content. But never forget the true reason so many resources are available to you...humanity's inevitable future of robot overlords awaits.

And thanks to multiplayer, you can enjoy it with friends!"
18462,"A fun game that has your Dwarvish butt haulling ass!
It's all about exploring,
mining the resources you find,
then making weird contraptions to do it better (your imagination is the only limit here!)
there's also bot raids... the better and more food you plant... the harder the raid will be!
9/10... I want to see more!!!!"
18463,"By far the best game Iv'e ever played. Iv'e owned for a few years now, seeing it morph and change, and each update makes the game even better. This game has given me an outlet to explore my creativity as well as my problem solving ability. Now that survival is out, the game has a new purpose, and I have new reasons to build more advanced creations. Axolot you a G."
18464,The game is great. Absolutely great development was slow but the wait was worth it. Multiplayer is laggy but it's still in development. Keep up the good work Axolot.
18465,a lot better than the pirated version

18483,AMAZING
18484,A
18485,Gr8 game
18486,"The addition of survival brings this from a sandbox engine to a real game, and for a non-final version its actually really fun with a group. I only have a few criticisms about weird oversights and some pacing problems that will probably be worked out before it's true release.

The Good:
- Surprising stable for a pre-release, even on my (usually) less optimized RX5700 series AMD card.
- Graphics look really good, art style is nice and its not overly difficult to run.
- controls feel as expected for a building/open world game.
- building vehicles is SUPER cool. the physics can be a challenge at first but that's all part of the fun. 

What they need to add:
- Same items available in creative and survival modes: this goes along with the ability to chop down trees in creative, etc. There can be an argument made for keeping survival mechanics/items in survival only, but if you want to test something in creative it keeps you from doing that.
- Save vehicles from Survival for use in creative: obviously the first improvement has to happen first, but saving survival-purpose vehicles for creative would open up a new possibility of vehicles shared in the workshop with resource collectors and other survival-based functions. 

The Bad (in my opinion)
- farming is SUPER tedious (at least in the early game). Either characters need to go through food slower or the process is tweaked. The only thing getting in the way of really building and exploring and pushing the fun parts of the game is ensuring we all have enough food, the time spent is not proportionate.
- Smaller, quicker handheld weapons then the sledgehammer would be cool. (think like sword vs axe in minecraft)

TL:DR - if you have a crew to run with and enjoy open-world survival games with a focus on progressing your way, its 100% worth it. If you are picking it up just for yourself it may get boring a lot quicker, as this is a game that really shines when you get in funny/stupid situations with friends, but its absolutely a product that has the potential to go super far when it is finessed for the final release"
18487,"I don't want to give the idea that this game is trash or people who like it are simple minded. Because it's not a bad game, per se. It's just really lacking meaningful content or direction. I get that it's a sandbox game where you create the purpose, but you definitely have to really be into that sort of thing to play this game for more than a few hours and get any sort of fun out of it. There's not a lot of instruction on how to do things, you figure that out on your own. I didn't get  a chance to play with friends, so I can't speak to that aspect of the game and whether or not it makes it worth playing. 

So objectively negative things I have about this game is the survival mechanics. You have to eat and drink  A LOT. It's a huge part of the survival mechanic and maybe my own personal pet peeve is casting an overly negative opinion of this mechanic but I hate that I have to invest so much time eating and drinking. It's not that this mechanic exists, it's that it's too much."
18488,a very nice creative game with much possibilities
18489,"This is a great game. The survival starts out challenging and with quite a bit of grinding, but after you climb that initial hill it gets pretty easy to survive. At this point, you sort of have to make your own challenges to keep the game interesting. Luckily, the creative possibilities are endless and me and my buddy had tons of fun making a beautiful modern house, cars for different purposes, auto-farms, auto-turrets, and lots of small technical solutions here and there. For me, this was super relaxing and tons of fun. 

All of that being said, I still can't recommend the game. Updates are few and far between, and the lag can get crazy when playing with friends. I don't mind this too much though, and as mentioned above, a lot of the fun (for me) lies in coming up with your own challenges. However, what completely ruined the game for me is that all of a sudden as we were trying to load in to our server for an evening of relaxed building our server-file got corrupted. After some googling, it seems that multiple players have had this issue. Devs are impossible to contact, so it is safe to say all our work has been lost forever. Having this big of a gamebreaking bug with seemingly no intention of fixing it is simply inexcusable to me. 

TL;DR: Great, fun game, but you can lose all your progress in the blink of an eye and devs will not give a shit. Don't buy."
18490,i like this game its my  2nd favorite game minecrafts better tho
18491,too lazy right now to describe why this game is actually so great in poetic words so yeah all im gonna say its just too good
18492,Everything about this game is extremely well done and survival is a blast 10/10 would recommend
18493,"*Casual long positive comment*
"
18494,this is a great wonderfull game with many feautures and alot more would reccommend please buy
18495,This game is great if you have a creative spirit and the ability to make your own fun with what is given to you great sandbox to goof around with and make some wacky machines!
18496,perfection
18497,"Scrap Mechanic is a hard game to review. I have been aware of this game for years, ever since it ht early access almost 4 years ago now, and sadly it's still in Early access.... Recently however survival mode finally came out and gave some direction to the game. It is however pretty bare bones right now, many the glitches and bugs the game had years ago still exist with wonky pistons and glitchy bearings.

Lag and frame drops remain a pretty constant thing if you get to more complex builds with lots of moving parts. Which is a huge problem as building crazy machines is half the fun of a game like this. All that said I have to tentivly recommend this game. First off despite being in early access for years, it's still getting fairly updates with lots of patches in the last few months. New items and content are being added to the survival mode, even if it's not nearly as fast as I would like.

The Devs have listened to players complaints and reduced some of the insane grind of things like Oil and clam shells, even if a lot of grind still exist. But over all I think you just can't ignore the price. The game is a pretty cheap $20, and on sale for less at least 3 times in the last few months that I noticed. With a sale price of under 15 I can't complain too much.

The game is not perfect, but it is getting better and the Dev's actually seem to have the passion for this project and seem unlikely to give up any time soon. You might not ultimately get thousands of hours of out this game like some, but I think most people should still get more than their money's worth over all."

18499,Good
18500,"If you like building vehicles/machines with pistons, gears and stuff, it's incredible fun! Survival adds a nice challenge."
18501,very cool game i love all the stuff you can do and make
18502,yes
18503,"i'm baby

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ - (10 stars if i could)"
18504,this game is fricking awesome
18505,"Super fun game, Tad bit hard to figure out at the start but just watch scrapman on youtube he has a survival series that will show you everything!"
18506,awesom
18507,best game ever!
18508,please fix multiplayer servers.  I love this game and would play more if the multiplayer was fixed
18509,great game in every way
18510,"Lots of fun. needs more patches though
"
18511,"Bought this for the survival aspect, I'm currently a few hours into it and I feel I've seen it all. Food is quite plentiful so there is really no need to build a farm unless you want to unlock the other weapons which seems pointless when most combat boils down to walking backwards and swinging the sledgehammer. Building a vehicle that can haul your load of crops efficiently or building a heavily defended farm all feels like it's for nothing when the end goal is trading your crops for weapons, seeds, or clothes you don't need. Survival should be a lot harder than it currently is, you should be required to start building a farm to even survive for first couple days and there should be a need for the later weapons because as of now the only reason to have them is to fight two enemies in the game that drop common items you find around the world regularly.

Most of this can be forgiven since its early access and the survival mode recently came out, but then a couple days after purchasing I lost my internet connection for a few days because of a storm and come to find out you can not play this game in offline mode at all, people have been complaining about this for at least 3-4 years yet it's still like this. Out of all the games I own on steam this is the only one that I've had a problem with when it comes to offline mode, even certain scummy AAA studios allow this, there is no excuse for it. 

I plan on continuing to play this just to feel like I got my money's worth but even if some day I grow to outright love this game I will still not recommend it until it's blatant anti-consumer DRM is removed."
18512,"I love scrap mechanic it is the best game ever it never ends i played for 10 hours
"
18513,Awesome game.
18514,EPIC
18515,"Well let me tell you ,if you are interested in games that challenges your creativity for every need even with base making , this is your game ."
18516,it cool
18517,GOOD GAME
18518,"I seriously love this game (creative and survival(can't speak for challenge cause i don't care for that stuff)) but i am a little disappointed that there is no easy way to find cotton unless you have tonnes of veggies or get lucky with your generation. Other than the cotton, it's very good!"
18519,"How this has so many positive reviews, i dont get. Its sooo boring, and limited.

Waste of money"
18520,Yeet because why not?
18521,"1 day to build a walled garden .... found it wrecked and empty 
git gud"
18522,download right now
18523,"I loved this game (survival), but some annoying things ruined it for me.When going into the more complex creations, it gets very laggy, my Video card is still not fully utilized so is my cpu.Some grinding is very annoying, oil, metal, shells gets very repetitive.The world has very little to discover and is all very similar,....But the worst part, as soon as I discovered how easy to cheat with this game it completely ruined it for me.Survial it is a nice try, but gets boring very fast, and the fact you can cheat that easily makes it totally useless to work for items."
18524,Fun with friends.
18525,I really enjoyed this game. I grew up playing minecraft so this is quite similar to me. I do though wish that the hammer in survival worked for me.
18526,"i watched youtubers for a long time on this game such as comodo gameing, moonbo, spycakes,ect
when i got it a year ago my computer could not handle it but until about a week ago i can play good thx steam"

18533,"SO COOOOOOOL
"
18534,Unlimited Possibilities
18535,"I would definitely recommend this game for others because it allows you to open up your mind and build whatever you think of and you can publish your marvelous creations to the workshop and let others see what you have made! And I have owned this game over about 3 months and I've already had 110 hours overall played on it! Also, final thing, it has survival aswell which is my primary game mode which I enjoy because it gives you a challenge like; Fighting Bots, Collecting Materials and much more!"
18536,yes
18537,it was fun. really lets your creativity run wild.
18538,
18539,Very Moddable game. Multiplayer is fun and the game is overall one of the most fun games that i have to play. You can make anything you want and survival mode is the most fun. I recommend this game.
18540,"fun with friends, bad solo (unless youre working on a world with friends, and youre the only one on and you want to work on a car or something)"
18541,This game is good for about 500 hours but then u kinda dont know what to do after that so keep that inmind>
18542,"its fun with friends
"
18543,GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18544,"This is an awesome game, the possibilities in creative mode are enormous, and you can really have fun doing engineering, survival is nice tho. one of the things I would love if they added are gears, you can kinda do them with pipes but they aren't reliable at all"
18545,"If you like charming sandbox EA games, this is for you. If you don't like the occasional game breaking glitch or frustrating lag, stay away.

I know the last comment sounds like a bad thing but honestly this game is just so darn charming. The Devs do their best to work with the community with consistent updates and patches making this one of the best gaming communities I've been a part of in a while. Honestly, it's like the early days with Minecr*ft.

Once this game has dedicated servers for multiplayer, better garbage collection and a more straightforward tutorial, I think it stands a chance at taking on some of the sandbox MMO giants. It's not there yet but it will be .

**Update**
LMAO! In traditional Scrap Mechanic fashion, I experienced an unknown error when submitting my review..."
18546,"This game have changed so much in the past years and it stuns me how fun it's become. Used to be just a creative build whatevs you want sandbox game, and now with survival, it's become so much better and crazier.

The primary point of this game, is to build contraptions and let your creativity go wild. The more you play this game, the more you learn about yourself and your own engineering skills. There's lots to learn, many oppertunities to fail and a lot of mind boggling fun to be had! (Trust me on this one). If you like to build machines, kill robots and at the same time, eat juicy hamburgers on their bodies, this is the game for you!



"
18547,"It's a fun game but the fact that it's in alpha means you'll be starting a new world about once a week and constantly screaming about robots sneaking up on you because they don't make any noise when they move. Devs please fix this and I might consider coming back, I can't handle jump scares so often in a game that doesn't advertise them at all."
18548,its not a stable game can not play it for more then 2 min or less
18549,i got this game and cant play it =(
18550,is good

18560,"I have the kind of rig that can run 2020 games at max settings and 144 fps.

This game's music lags in the main menu, and I get 1 minute freezes whenever changing cosmetics in the character editor.

I tried starting a survival game and it just froze loading at 40%, and yes, I did re-check the game files."
18561,please check it out it is awesome
18562,black people
18563,haha when heehee
18564,great game
18565,"I can't get into this game no matter how hard i try it looks fun but making stuff in general feels really sluggish it also doesn't help i don't really like the playermodels, it making me sad as a lot of my friends have recommended me this game but i just don't enjoy it ."
18566,This game is amazing i would recommend it just watch out for the hay bots.
18567,"Can get many hours into the game, many possibilities in creative, and also fun adventures and base building in the survival mode, the challenges mode isn't that interesting, kind of reminded me of ""bad piggies"" challenges back in 2013 where you had to build a vehicle for the task. Creative building is very fun as you can make many different vehicles and weapons and designs; in which you can use in survival to defend yourself against the enemies."
18568,"The game is crashing every time. I got the latest Nvidia driver and it keep doing it. Even the save file gets corrupted while I play with my friend in Co-op. I wait 'till the next update. 

Update! Most of the problems are fixed, but after 1-2 hour the is begi to be unplayable, beacuse some delay problem when I the hit animation start 10 sec later and i being two different places at the in my prespective and the host prespective.

System:
Win 10 2004
I7-6700
2x8GB 2133mhz
Strix GTX 1080 OC
240GB SSD"
18569,Ye
18570,Physics engine is far too particular (read: nonsensical) to whole heartedly aprove of this game. The way you have to bend yourself over backwards to build anything and getting it to work is too much imo.
18571,Very fun. Endless possibilities
18572,"its awsome
"
18573,very good game
18574,"I got this game ages ago and it's been no end of fun, although be warned, the system requirements are a bit of a stretch. Now I have upgraded my PC to a Core i7 CPU, it should perform better. I tested the challenge mode and it's good fun and I'd imagine very useful for beginners! Haven't tried the new survival mode but it looks great too. I definitely recommend!"
18575,this game is or would be an overall best game ever but unfortunately i dont think my computer runs it only challenge mode works but overall is a great great game
18576,fun
18577,i really liked the game ever since i started playing but i feel that now survival came out that it has made the game more than it should be. good game tho still and i really love what they've done to it
18578,the game does need some adjustment but then again it is still in beta but other than that this game is real fun
18579,very epic games
18580,"At first glance I played about an hour and refunded the game. It seemed way too simplistic. Then I watched a few twitch sessions and youtube videos and bought it again. 66 hours later, I am writing my review.

There's so much to do and so much to build. This game is simply amazing. I would pay twice what I paid for it now that I have seen its depth even for an Early Access game. The game is in the same vein as Minecraft and others, but the automation and building process is so rich and fun to play with that you could literally spend all your time just in creative mode. 

With survival there is even more to do. You can build, hunt, mine, gather, automate, build efficiencies, raid the warehouses, destroy, multiplayer (friends list), and so much more. The game is simply satisfying and can be the most relaxing game ever or intense depending entirely on how you choose to play. If you like Minecraft or Boundless, this is a must have."
18581,its realley good
18582,This game has a lot of potential! its Fun and the building with blocks and parts gives creative freedoms I have been looking for in many building games. I cannot wait for the full game release. Keep up the great work Axolot Games.
18583,pretty good game but not much survival.
18584,"isane
"
18585,ehhhhh
18586,Yes
18587,"Survival has a steep learning curve if you haven't played before and wish the blueprints had a little more guidance, but overall this game is enjoyable if you have the patience to learn LOL. I have not played creative or challenge mode to comment on those."
18588,"While the game itself is fun it's a waste of time and money.  The game is full of bugs.  I've invested hundreds of hours on my save file which now crashes every time I try to load my game.  I've validated the integrity of the game files, I play vanilla.  I do not use any game exploits/glitches or use any vehicles with know buggy mechanics.

Do not buy this game unless you're looking for disappointment."
18589,Nice
18590,good bomb

18602,very good game survival is amazing can wait for the warehouse to be finished
18603,Good game
18604,Used to love this game but since the last update it wont even launch.
18605,While it has it's issues with multi-player the survival mode is a lot of fun!
18606,very fun
18607,It's really good for getting creative and having fun! :)
18608,"this game is fantastic, ive been surviving solely on that delicious moo moo juice"
18609,gud game
18610,"This is a good game, but my recommendation will have to wait until after it's out of early access....assuming that ever actually happens, since a lot of these games that seems to be a permanent state.

Right now, it's just got too much ""missing"" from it, and being so extremely unpolished makes everything take so much longer, which is rough in what is literally a farming game.   

It has a lot of potential though so we'll see where it goes, will change review later if things change."
18611,If you like minecraft you will love this game :)
18612,"This game is very good because it lets you build your own creation`s and test over people`s you can also create your own worlds in a way so if i had to rate it, 5 Stars"
18613,i have played so long its good Edit: i have played 291 hours now lol
18614,"As a survival game:
Sadly, I can't recommend the game in its current state. The amount of work you have to put in to making any sort of vehicle parts is so time consuming that it becomes tedious and boring within a couple of hours of play time.  Forget solo play. If you farm for food, which you will have to do within a few in-game days, you'll be stuck guarding your crops from robot attacks or using all of your resources to fortify your crops. Now maybe you can stick your farm on your giant car and drive away from the bots, but that seems like a late game kind of thing. Crafting is kind of irritating as you can only craft using stations.  There is absolutely nothing you can make on the fly that I've seen.

idk, I think the pace needs to be picked up since the game revolves around vehicle creation. There is very little vehicle creation in survival mode."
18615,It's fun
18616,i liked that this game is fun and many things to do never get bored what i dont like is the lag and bugs with the game
18617,This game is fun
18618,fix the loading in crashes please
18619,bruh its free range
18620,.
18621,"Very fun game so far!  If you can think it, you can create it.  Its still early access and there is some fine tuning but the overall experience has been very fun.  i really wish they had tool tips in some inventories.  They do in your backpack but not in chests or bots, which is really frustrating sometimes."
18622,Very good game and would suggest playing it
18623,i kinda cool
18624,this game is amazing i can make all of my bad ideas real
18625,Awsome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18626,its a fun game you can play with friends or by your self. If you like smashing robots and building awsome cars trucks plains and trains then scrap mechanic is for you !
18627,Not bad good game
18628,nice game
18629,iv played this game scince the start and i would recomend that you play this with your friends
18630,"The game was amazing, but I sadly can't play it anymore due to the recent updates (no problems with the game but the problem is with the specs of my PC). The game is very innovative in the simple graphics but huge and vibrant world, and the creativity that is possible in this game is beyond me. The possibilities of this game are endless and I hope they keep improving the game and they add workshop build for survival (maybe it's already in the game but I haven't seen it yet).

Small update - I got a new PC so I can play the game again. And I gotta say that I'm loving the new survival mode and am super excited for the upcoming caves and everything coming with that. I hope the game keeps getting better and I'm already excited to see what the end result will become!"
18631,good
18632,simple and boring. You reach endgame in 10 hours of gameplay

18634,"It would be more fun, if they had servers! But apart from that, this game will unleash you creativity!"
18635,happy 4th of july
18636,This game is great fun! The survival mode is a little empty but gives you another option in which to play as the sandbox can get old fast.
18637,this game is so fun and i recommend you to download it and star creatingg machines
18638,love this game it is a 10/10 for me! I wish could have kept it but i had to refund for money back.
18639,"I feel like this game is a hit or miss. You either like building stuff, or you don't. Based on the reviews, I think the majority of people who got this game enjoyed it. This game brings in simple mechanics, but when you do research and testing, you can start making some cool stuff. I am constantly learning new things such as how to create memory cells, how to make a piston powered car(Like a real piston engine), etc. I even got o the point where I made my own 8bit game(No mods). You can take simple things such as a nor gate, and turn it into a complex machine. To sum it all up, this game is great for people wanting to learn and maybe even improve real life electrical engineering skills.

ok bye"
18640,"yes, is game"
18641,"Best Game ever
"
18642,good 10/10
18643,yeah creative is fun
18644,"Great game with great mechanics (no pun intended).

But the survival mode needs balancing and polishing, desperately. Until the devs make it better, I don't recommend it."
18645,its great
18646,"this game is amazing, the only thing you have to worry about is those pesky robots in survival and if your good at building, two things i am bad at."
18647,yes
18648,yes
18649,I think this sandbox game is extremely good. You can create anything from a car to a flying toilet. With the addition of Steam Workshop mods and presets anything is possible. The price is very good for what you get and it got a massive update recently which makes it even more worth it. I would recommend this to any casual player.
18650,"it good game
























"
18651,It is really fun to figure out how to get everything to work and once you do it is really rewarding
18652,if you like coding/minecraft redstone/eningineering I greatly recommend.
18653,the multiplayer is hilariously unstable but it's a good time waster especially if you download mods
18654,This game is one of the most fun games I have played in a very long time! I have played this game for 151 hours and i don't regret a second.
18655,awesome survival mode
18656,tis pretty good
18657,great game
18658,funny car
18659,"My word this game is fun.  I play SP so I can't comment on the MP aspect.  The game is not shallow so it keeps to entertained but at the same time it's not overwhelmingly complicated to be frustrating.
You have amazing freedom with your creations, the only boundary being your imagination.
I can't believe they are selling it so cheaply.  Not greedy Dev's I expect.  Brilliant fun game with a lot of humour thrown in for good luck.
If you like building/survival games you just have to buy this."
18660,fun
18661,"I'm loving it! Only problem I have is that I'm as creative as a fkn stick so that hinders me a bit but other than that I'm really loving the survival mode! My car is still super shit and all but hopefully soon I can copy Moonbo's mining car. 

PS: I strongly advice following Moonbo's quick guide to at least get you far enough to build your first car otherwise you might give up on the game quickly."
18662,This game is so fun theres 3 game modes creative survival and challenge there all really good especially survival the grind is super fun and always worth it
18663,i like dinosaurs rpoar
18664,very fun
18665,super duper guud game
18666,"Do Not Diss This Game
"
18667,"really cool, lacking a true end-game in survival, but that's to be expected as it is still in an early access stage."
18668,VIS DU LIKER MINEKRAFT ELLER FORTNITE S√Ö ELSKER DU DETTE SPILLET 10/10 5 STJERNERS SPILLL
18669,"We spent the first hour running around, jumping off buildings to see if there's fall damage, and just generally learning how to play.

We spent the second hour learning how to craft and piece together a vehicle that we originally thought was cool... until we drove it. The awful way we designed it was immediately clear and it made me laugh hard enough that I woke up my wife who was sleeping in the other room. We spent the next three hours trying to get back to our backpacks and equipment after we died somewhere that we had no business even exploring. This was a very frustrating period. We then spent the next hour after that redesigning our vehicle, working out the kinks, and just generally getting it sturdy and steady enough that it doesn't flip over every time we accelerate or turn.

All of that doesn't sound terribly fun but it really is. It's like physics based legos set in a survival world. We are having a blast and I'm very, very pleasantly surprised by this game. It has surpassed my expectations even though it's still in Early Access and I have a feeling we'll be playing this for a long time."
18670,good
18671,"Pros:
- The game has 3 modes; Challenge, Survival and Creative. Its always good that i can change modes when i get bored playing the other one.
- The game offer so much freedom in building stuff. You can build bases, farms and pretty much any contraptions that you can think of, either for the reason of progressing your game in survival mode, automating and defending your farm, transporting goods or even if you just want to have fun and test out what's in your curious mind in creative mode.
- In creative mode, you can share your creations in steam workshop and of course vice versa, you can also download shared creations and spawn it into your world.
- Also in creative mode, you can customize tiles to create your own world. You can freely customize the assets, terrains, ground textures/color, and more. Some examples of the tiles I've seen and downloaded are; mario kart racetracks, runways for flying creations, mountain racetracks, rocket league arena, dirt racetracks.
- The game is open for modding and there are already many mods available to choose from in the workshop to further make your creations awesome.

Cons:
- Being in early access, there are lots of bugs and optimization issues.
- Collisions in game are not optimized and can sometimes cause minor fps drops and lag
- The game can't handle big creations and can cause huge fps drops/lags or even make the game crash.
- Survival mode does not offer much in terms of an interesting gameplay content 
- In survival mode also, gathering materials for crafting can be a hassle and grindy due to optimization issues again. For example when you're mining for metals and concretes using your creation, the fps will always drop and make some of your tire bearings to be lose and floppy, and pistons to go extend and retracts randomly. Meaning you basically lose control of your creation the moment contacts between collision happens.
- Although its fun playing in multiplayer it is sad to say that it is not yet that optimized. Again with the lag and fps drops and sometimes glitches and bugs happens while playing with others.

Conclusion: 
This game has a lot of potential as a sandbox/building/crafting and even farming simulator game, its just the matter of fixing bugs, optimization, and adding more content in survival to make the game more fun and enjoyable. And so, I'll still recommend this game even though I gave it many cons. The reason for that is because I had fun creating and building stuff and playing with others. That's it. Thank you for reading my long review. Stay safe and wash your hands every body.

18672,This is a bit of a frustrating game but it is fun also and it‚Äôs still in development so take this as info only.  I found it slow to the start and build; that may have improved.  The items needed are hard to come by but that seems to have changed with the last update; not sure.  But I like the car builds; almost techie but can be done.  They work better when you develop some understanding of the technical side of the game.  I was looking for the longest time for the mining camps but yesterday I accidently found one near home.  I found the dwarf will picking cotton but it took me some time to get him turned in because I didn‚Äôt understand the welder function and just wanted to play.  So the moral of this read is you might need to be slightly techie to enjoy this game more than I did.
18673,this game is a wonderfull expericene so i suggust u buy it due to how good it is
18674,Its a fun game i like anything where i can build what i want
18675,"very fun game it is a must buy if you like messing around with thing or building things, overall great game"
18676,10/10 great game I love survival and I think that axolot should something that is like a daylight sensor that u could connect to lights so at night they would be on just a suggestion.
18677,J
18678,"Good
"
18679,"great endless opertuneties, altho i just started playing i have watched vid on yt so its pretty fun :D
"
18680,Great game!
18681,"(sorry for bad english) i do love this game but there are some problems

(1) the multiplayer lag is insane makes the game not even playable anymore at some moments

(2) the grind for component kits are insane you need like 120 for upgrading a thruster to max.
and the amount of fuel you need is too much and definitely not worth the grind, and there is no way to automate or make a machine to do so. sadly :(

(3) the amount of bugs in this game is insane (this will prob be fixed in the future, i hope)

but other than that great game and very addictive 
idk if id recommend this game or not but if your looking for a game you can spend hundreds of hours on without getting bored then look some where else cuz this ain't it chief"
18682,so fucking boring build your car then your done ez
18683,"very good
"
18684,"Make Car, car no work, but car funny."
18685,"The game is just fantastic.  36 hours passed in a glance. You will enjoy both building and fighting. As well as 100% impressed by physics in the game. Game also has one of the best co-op engines I've seen.

My major feedback for the developers would be:
1. Re balance tape bots and make an armor to fight them easily. After spending almost 2.5 hours in the 4 storage warehouse I decided to drop - it's just too much time and effort to go through it.
2. I know that beacons are on the way, but some kind of top-lvl high overview map would also be great. Otherwise you mmight be lose in the same building easily.
3. The game totally needs a smooth introduction. It took us hours to understand basic mechanics.
4. Please, re-balance the prices for the bot. AFAIK cloth bot is mostly useless with unreal price. 

100% recommend the game for everybody. But watch the tutorial first :)"
18686,"Loads of fun tho still in development,its a good way to learn logic gates and circuit setups."
18687,"It fun but the developers need to sort out some of the bugs within the game.
The Physics of the game is currently a mess @_@

A map is a useful feature too!"
18688,"The game is onestly verry fun and i reccomend it to everyone, there is only one issue that i had, it chrashes everytime i open it and i dont really know why but yea thats it"
18689,Why haven't you bought this game yet?
18690,Great game! Just needs a better tutorial.
18691,"it mite seam a bit grindy after a while but its fun to play and build things in survival and creative.
"
18692,"I want to love this game. I really do. A friend got me to buy it when survival mode came out because he'd had it for a while and loved the creative mode of the game. But survival, especially in multiplayer, despite having a good computer and internet, is laggy and glitchy to the point of being practically unplayable. Whoever wasn't hosting has a significant delay between button press and action execution. We've tried so many things and nothing helps."
18693,"The game is simple, yet challenging"
18694,"I don't get it. I played it for 1 h or so. can't understand what i have to do in survival. There are not many mobs, or items, and pretty much i only found over and over the same things.... i just found the survival experience boring.."
18695,"VERY ADDICTIVE
"
18696,goog
18697,"Great game, I love the survival and being able create so many interesting things from scratch and then having to make them work on my own. It is very grindy and will require a lot of time to progress, and it isn't a easy game. This game will throw you into survival and you have to figure it out from there, yes it does have hints in some areas of the game to show you how to do certain things but definitely not a ""hey do this now that works, and put that here and it'll do this"" type game. The game is not optimized very well which is a very sad thing to say for how great it is, and the multiplayer NEEDS worked on 100% because it's no where near polished. I would have to say only get this game if you have a pretty good CPU and GPU because I have a i7-7700 and a GTX1070 and i still experience a lot of frame drops which I do not in graphic intense games. The Devs do seem to put a lot of work into the game though so hopefully a optimization update will come out because even people with REALLY good Pc's are experiencing the same problems."
18698,I love the game and their is so much to do. The only thing I would like to see is water cannons able to water more crops at a time. I highly recommend

18708,"This is not a survival game.... yet. I have seen reviews saying its like Minecraft, it's not. Not at all. It's more like a sandbox game. There are so many things I miss. As far as I have seen, you can not in any way or form do any landscaping. there is no map, there is no home beacon. And the drift on the wheels are horrible. Driving is not fun. 

What killed the survival experience for me though was trying to get water to craft with. Which at the time you could only get from crates, which meant more mindless exploring in a not fun to drive car. ALT+F4, uninstall. Also there are way to few craftable items, which you can build a base with.

When writing this review it seems like they have added craftable water.

All in all this is more like Garry's mod than anything else, for the time being."
18709,Good solid game for having plenty of fun. The devs keep updating regular so thats a plus in my mind
18710,"Great game
"
18711,"Brilliance. If you thought that the creative mode of this games was fun wait till you play survival! Very emerging experience, a lot of objectives to obtain and never ending interest. The world is fairly big and would take a ton of time to explore it. Best with friends."

18718,amazing game
18719,Always liked this game. Very creative and fun. A lot of potential for future updates. Recommended
18720,"This game is fun but sadly for me there are a few mechanics that just pushes the game into the not fun category. 

1. The way they handle food, water, and farming. You consume food and water at a quick pace which by itself isn't bad but don't even think about growing food/water because it will just cause your base to be raided every 24 minutes. As you advance and grow bigger things the raids get more intense.

2. The absolute lack of navigate aids. No mini-map, no home beacon, no way to teleport to your spawn point. Nothing. You literally have to stand in your base and die of starvation so you have a corpse which does show up but not always it does glitch occasionally.

3. The grind curve is crazy. All of these games have a grind curve but this one feels pretty intense. I feel like for every 10-15 minutes of fun it takes 1-2 hours of grinding to get the parts to build whatever I wanted.

The good news is the mode is only a month old so hopefully will address some of these in the future."

It's fun playing with friends and enjoyment never stops while playing.
There's so much to do and the developers are still pushing updates VERY frequently, not many games do that anymore!

If you like game mechanics, this is a game for you. An example of this would be Minecraft's redstone, being able to create almost anything.

If you're thinking about buying it, you should. It's a solid purchase and is fun even when you play solo."

For me it walks the line between to catoonish and to intricate to make a game fun. But, I personally would rather play Microsoft Excel Simulator than anything in this art style, so take my review with a grain of salt."

18758,people made thier own mods because of how long the update is taking lmao
18759,I LOVE IT
18760,"If you spent hours in Besiege or Kerbal or like creative building games in general, this is amazing. Suffers from periodic frame drop when you arent careful though. Mostly avoidable or temporary, but crashes occur every few hours or so. Never lost any more than a minute's progress though.

If you aren't the creative type, and you hate spending hours tweaking and troubleshooting your design, play something else. Only ~7 enemies so far, end-game challenges aren't difficult to reach, and farm-raids are going to bland without building cool solutions."
18761,it fun and your creativity gose crasy
18762,"I am loving this game.  The build mechanic is something to get used too and learn, but its great when you do.  In survival, (not sure on others, not tried them yet) there are pre generated structures you can hole yourself up in if you dont feel like building a base, but lets face it, why wouldn't you?  But it really helps out in the beginning.  Looking forward to many more hours playing :)"

18783,great game
18784,it was good
18785,"I was able to Convince a friend who is extremely against getting Early Access Games because its just that good, looking forward to the updates to come"
18786,EVERYTHING FALLS THROUGH THE WORLD INTO THE VOID.  So broken.  I've lost tons of resources due to this bug.  Cannot recommend this game while this bug exists.  It's fun but also rage inducing when all of the resources you just spent hours grinding fall into the nether.
18787,fun sandbox game  if you like complex logic stuff really like
18788,Thruster + Engine + Switch + 4 Metal Blocks = Fun
18789,"great would reccomend a better tutorial 
"
18790,"You would think that ""Scrap Mechanic"" would place some emphasis on mechanizing scrap; but really, all you need is CORN. 

I absolutely must describe why all you need to survive in ""Scrap Mechanic"" is a large collection of CORN:

CORN is indestructible. 
CORN can be planted around the perimeter of your growing crops so that attacking robots cannot pass.

Okay, you beat ""Scrap Mechanic"".

18795,Fantastic Game. I like the combination of a survival environment with the mechanical aspect of building vehicles.
18796,"You can just build whatever you want, it's perfect for creative people."
18797,Plus 1 good boi points
18798,haha yes really good game nice graphics haha really cool
18799,yeet
18800,YES
18801,"So much fun, and a blast to play with friends. Still needs work on optimization and crashes, but once this game matures it'll be one of the best."
18802,good game to kill time
18803,"Steep learning curve. Its fun for the most part, but the beginning of this game is so difficult. they literally tell you nothing and you have to learn by dying over and over. Not to mention that the tutorial that is here, is one of the worst since it guides you but doesnt a horrible job of explaining what youre exactly suppose to do. Just not fun unless you wanna spend hours of frustration learning the basics."
18804,such an amazing game definitely worth the money i think there should be a toutorial but all in all great game
18805,"laid back and chill game, i am very new at the game, but so far i am having fun. 
now if i only had friends to play this with, lol..."
18806,"Fun game, I made a torpedo that could explode, a missile, a rocket launcher, and a nice car, which I later blew up..."
18807,its epic

18810,best survival game ever
18811,"I love this game to pieces but there are some things that make it very frustrating and hard to play.

Pros: Beautiful world, nice and open 
         Awesome building system with lots of parts

Unfortunately that's about where all the good stuff ends. This game is riddled with bugs and glitches, you cant even make complex mechanisms unless you want to play a powerpoint slide. This game is infamous for its floppy wheels and nonsensical suspension, And multiplayer is impossible to play unless you like rubberbands and random glitching. Driving a vehicle on the map is like driving on a bumpy road and you bounce everywhere. Did i mention terrible performance? I have a decent PC, most other games i own i can play on max settings, but for some reason the optimization on this game is awful and i have to play on minimum settings, and, even then i still get random lag spikes and around 40 frames. Its really frustrating to see this game hardly develop for four years then the survival update came out and it was less than pleasing. Even more bugs were added and it got many negative reviews, mostly from the lack of guidance at the beginning of the game. 

I'd love this game but the bugs and performance issues make it very difficult to play.
"
18812,poop
18813,"This game is a lot of fun, if a bit slow to start.
Lots of moving parts and related attributes makes survival mode very difficult in the early game, if I could recommend anything to the dev it would be a mechanic to make simple builds more feasible (a grab and drag function would be super helpful until you're finally able to make an engine until then the mode even showcases a proceduraly generated wheel barrow you can't use)

the moving parts that do exist are extremely versatile and fun to experiment with <3"
18814,"yes
"
18815,I kept making penis cars so I could fuck the robots on the road. 10/10
18816,Now that it has survival mode i brought it and i'm loving it.
18817,"Fun, relaxing, Creative. Can sink hours into this game without even realizing it, and the vehicles you can make are only limited to your imagination."
18818,"A good game overall, but the physics needs to be improved. Plus the game can't handle 2 vehicles touching in a moving garage."
18819,good
18820,gret
18821,It is very fun when you screw around with friends and mods.
18822,"its is easy nice to play once you get in to the flow of thing, all you need to do it play and adapted"
18823,"i love this game good job to the creaters
"
18824,"I love this game, I can do wathever I want to do, cars, towers, airplains, smart houses, etc. I simply love the game. And you can make it even better with mods and some other community stuff from the workshop."
18825,the game has a lot of detail and is fun
18826,Just a simple funny game where you can let your imagination go
18827,This Is A Nice Game

18836,its a fun game for anyone who likes building
18837,"This game is a lot of fun a bit limited in respect to the use of workshop objects like vehicles, i.e. they can not at present be used in survival mode, but none the less still a great deal of fun and well worth the price."

its sometimes laggy but that fine

18850,Good game cool thangs
18851,"10/10: pretty great overall

I don't recommend it because it cost me waaaaaaay more than 20$, that extra cost being a (possibly) fried GPU

EDIT: Don't put too many complex or large vehicles in one place, or the game crashes constantly and may corrupt your worlds
Edit: fried GPU ;_;"
18852,"Hey mechanics! this game is awesome and i hope you think that to! this is game is like minecraft but things can move thats all you need to know it is so fun and my pc can run it just so you dont need that great pc to run it, if your pc is on the low end then make your graphics low so that you have smooth sailing! and dont do anything stupid to make your pc lag is it is on the low end, hope this helps you make your choice!"
18853,"This game in survival mode is extremely addicting and fun. There are endless creations you can make however in it's beta state, it gets a little laggy if you make things too complex. Overall, the physics are amazing and the development of this game seems to be headed in a great direction with the team being open for suggestions and fixing issues. This game is basically an engineer's Minecraft!"
18854,epic game. buy it.
18855,Get game to mess around with friends.

18859,its alright I guess
18860,"Refunding. If you are looking to play this in coop, don't waste your time. There is unbearable input delay in co-op that renders the game unplayable. There is absolutely no reason for player inputs to be networked like this, how can you get something so basic this wrong?"
18861,huge input lag makes co-op impossible to play
18862,This is a fun game but scrap mechanic+physics=bad they don't work together but it is a great game.

Better with friends!"
18876,great game
18877,"The game looks super cool, but when I tried to play with friends, the networking was so bad that after 20 minutes we decided to quit. 0.5 second input lags, and huge frame drops for the host (which results in freezing other players). It just doesn't work for us . our internet is not top of the line, but still, we play multiplayer all the time.."
18878,puzzling at times but a quick google search or youtube tutorial and you're sorted. it's lots of fun too when you mess around and play the right way
18879,Nice

18881,Very Good Game Ever !!!!!
18882,it is solow bot wot to got yous to it is it fine
18883,jjjjjjj
18884,"It's a little broken, but that's to be expected from early access. But, it's one of the most fun I've had in a long time."
18885,"amazing game
but sadly not on xbox"
18886,d
18887,if you like adventure and building you will love scrap mechanic it is all that and more in the three modes adventure creative and the all new survivle mode
18888,A+ Rated Game from those from Velociti Entertainment. I only bought it for the survival aspect. Seen some youtubers play it and wanted it. Its an amazing game to let your brain go wild.
18889,"I've played ScrapMechanic for a long time now, on my account and on another. the idea of building with other people and how detailed we could get the build was cool. also there are spudguns and explosives."
18890,It okay
18891,fun game !its just for me that i dont have time to grind so i think thats annoying but its just me so i recommend  buying this game if you have time to spare.i also hope there are wedge pieces in survival and mobile farming . it will help alot
18892,"hklhoiio;

18893,"Well, game concept good, graphics good, but the [b]bugs[/b]
It's fun to play until you create something, that should work but it turns to spaghetti kills your FPS and launches to oblivion."

18896,Great game. Lots fun
18897,Very fun ;D
18898,best thing since kim J
18899,"Great game, since survival came out its even better! They sead there will be a chapter 2, for the game, so they didnt even stop."
18900,i just bought it two days ago its very good physics but the game crashed in survival
18901,"It's a good game concept and implementation but I feel like the game design choices are ruining it.

The addition of survival mode was great but it was grindy. I thought it was because it was the first version but the next update made it even slower.

Growing plants and stuff is fine, although more than 4 plants  in the same place and you get attacked everyday is very annoying.
But scrap metal is horribly slow to gather in the beginning. And the stack size in the inventory is really annoying. You can go from having an abundance of something to needing it in seconds.

I know it's only just come out with the survival update but the developers seem slow to get anywhere with this game and every time I come back, very very little has changed.

Unless you have a big group of friends to play this with, I don't think you'll find this fun."
18902,trhgbv
18903,very epic
18904,Good game
18905,"it fun
"
18906,the game has gotten better i wish i had a better computer to give it true justice
18907,it is fun
18908,good
18909,"I do have some issues with this game. 

1. Its progression is painfully restricted by the garage and its the only place you can safely build.

2. Ranged Weapons are obtainable waayyy too late in the game.

3. The only weapons you can get are only obtainable by doing some serious grind of farming from nearly impossible to find seeds for a literally impossible to find hideout for the trader... which is dumb because you can't easily progress without them...

4. Air resistance isn't a thing so normal flight through acceleration without a jet copter is not possible making problem 3 a bigger problem...

5. Getting oil and glue sucks... you know you have a bad game design when placing an array of chairs under water is the most effective method for obtaining them... -_- 

6. No good basic cook-able food... cow meat and 3 corn should combine to let you eat for 25% of your food and water... not a problem after getting the cooking bot... 20 hours in... -_-

7. You can't drink water... even 5% would be nice...

8. Cloths are not group based... so it causes infighting over cloth packs.

9. You can't aim the water cannon like you should be able to like Mario Sunshine.

This game can be recommended at 5 to 8 dollars. Not much more than that. It's just Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts with far less polish and stuff.

10. Game is literally unplayable due to a game breaking bug with layered pieces and breaks worlds... been broken for 3 years."
18910,epic
18911,The game is pretty vague at the beginning but once you grasp a basic understanding it's pretty amazing.

18913,best game ever
18914,"After putting 100 hours into the game, I can say I can't wait to put another 100 at least in. The game has a unique physics engine that is really fun to play around in, and the creations you can build are only (mostly) limited by your imagination. The electrical/mechanical contraptions can get pretty intricate, with piston/bearing assemblies and complex logic gates. This analogy falls a little flat, but it's a bit like Minecraft with a legit physics engine that allows for a higher emphasis on building machinery. 

Most important thing to note here is that this game is still Early Access. You're paying to play early and helping the game come to fruition through your purchase. That said, you should expect a little buggery and glitchy-ness. Survival is a very recent addition, so there can be some frame rate issues. The devs have been very active with updates recently after the release of survival, and it seems like the game is getting a bigger following, so I'm excited for the future.

Help Axolot out, buy the game and play with you and your friends!"
18915,incredibly fun game
18916,fun
18917,yes
18918,big good
18919,as a wise man once said you can build your own cars

18922,GOOD GAME
18923,"fcjthgfjcjh ,iyrxgfdhygtghmhgfctyh yuvtgthfyutcgvu7tr4323457vtibtugvctrf best game ever"
18924,This was an awesome when it only had creative but when they added survival. This is an awesome game for people who love to build thing going from castles and bases to tanks and semi trucks. it is worth way more that $20.
18925,soooooo gooooooooood
18926,"I liked the ability to do almost anything you wanted, from building vehicles, to houses. This game is fun, but it can get complicated when it comes to logic and gets laggy and glitchy when it comes to large, free standing creations"
18927,Very fun
18928,Now with Survival think of this game as Minecraft 2.0.
18929,"I have played this game for 4 years since february 2016, as the updates go along I stick with the game, this game has been my childhood and is what I turn to when I'm bored. Survival mode had added so many more aspects to the game and has been extremely fun to play.

Unfortunatley, you will have to expect. Game crashes, elements that do not work and save corruptions. Ambushes are where you e.g. go to the toilet but forget to log off (pause doesn't work) and a raid comes and destroyes your entire base.

all bad thing aside, it is a great game for fun and for people who enjoy an engeneering challenge"
18930,"Ive racked up over 100 hours in Emypreon Galactic survival, space engineers and 100's of hours in minecraft. The building mechanics and physics work better in this game than any of the others combined. The developers have also managed to almost PERFECTLY balance the survival elements of the game as well. The world feels dangerous without an oversaturation of enemies and resources are just hard enough to find where i have to be conservative but the grind to restock isnt draining. 

I SINCERELY look forward to future updates and the eventual full release of Scrap Mechanic. Its truly a masterpiece."
18931,grate game .that's all i can say
18932,"I love it for the simple mechanics, but how complex you can make them
"
18933,Creativity
18934,is very creative
18935,ok
18936,Haha laser potato peeler goes brrrrrr
18937,"I played 28 hours in 4 days and need to stop but it's addicting.
It needs some improvements like being able to mark vehicles on the hud or easier access to food. The night is pretty much pointless and more annoying than anything. I would love to be able to create tank tracks and the game could get some optimization (loading times and graphic optimization)
Overall it's absolutely great"
18938,fun
18939,It cool and fun
18940,.
18941,As well as everyone else I've been waiting for survivial. Great game!
18942,fun with freinds
18943,good
18944,"game good, fun very"
18945,"AMAZING GAME!!! Ive always wanted to make things when i grew up, and now i can! i would reccomend this game to the other mechanics out there."
18946,its gret
18947,this is amazing
18948,"Originally, I had a rubbish computer so now that I have a gaming pc, it is fun to play with my brother, plus the survival mode makes the game SSSSOOOOOOOOOO good."
18949,The physics and game play are both great but the game uses up all of my computers CPU processing power and no matter how much I change the setting it continues to do so. Don't recommend.
18950,this game goodies you should play it is kinda lag but that can be fix :D
18951,fajna gra
18952,This game can enable people to let their creativity run wild. This can also let those who likes to build enjoy themselves
18953,"Amazing game, both survival and creative mode is amazing! I would recommend this game to all players who like survival or sandbox/creative gaming!"
18954,"Basically an upgraded version of Minecraft. I first heard about this game a couple weeks ago and started playing it about a week ago. I have only played survival mode, which seems to only have been released a couple months ago. It's a lot of fun, and I expect that it will only get better considering survival mode is so new.Definitely looking forward to the future of this game. Definitely worth the $."
18955,Don't trust the cute little robots. They stole all my crops
18956,"So far I have only played for a few hours and barely scratched the surface, Scrap Mechanics physics are pretty decent with that slight bit of jank that gives it character. The amount you can create in this game is immense and I'd definitely say that it is worth more than it's store listing."
18957,Survival has tipped this from an ok game to a great game. Looking forward to the future.
18958,Unique and fun would definitely recommend this game.
18959,This game is game for long days.
18960,bygga bil
18961,It is a very good game.
18962,"Got this game back in 2016 and it was brand new then and very little to it. Since then it has had a TON of updates including the new survival mode. The changes to the game has made it immensely enjoyable to play, especially with friends. 

It is still early access and has plenty of bugs, glitches, and optimizations that needs made. Yet even with all those it is a solid purchase."
18963,haha haybot grinder go brrrrr
18964,"This is a great game but the game is poorly optimized and may reduce your frame rate so low that you'll end up not being able to play which is really frustrating in a game you've been playing for many hours.

If you checkout the discussion on Steam about this game you'll see many gamer's have problems with lag (reduced frame rate) in this game including myself.

I would only recommend you buy this game if you have a beefy computer with a good graphics card otherwise your gonna end up with a love hate relationship with this game like me and many others.

The game runs poorly on my older desktop AMD Phenom x4 465 - GTX 970 - 16Gb ram

Runs good on my newer laptop Intel i7 7950 - GTX 1660 ti - 16Gb ram"
18965,j
18966,good
18967,love the game but i think its my pc or its the game but i cant play anymore i played all the time when i got it i had almost 1000 hours and i tried everything to play again for so long and im sad i cant play one of my favorite games again

but the cons it : 
- very laggy when join your friend world"
18970,creative fun and intense when fighting robots. there is lag when big stuff is made on the lift.
18971,"The new survival mode came out and it. is. garbage. 
Theres alot wrong so if you have questions on actualy gameplay just ask"
18972,"this is a great creative game! you can make about anything you wanted if you have the skills, once you get used to the tools and more, you can create about anything! plus they updated the game and added survival mode, something the fans wanted for a long time, it's good that they listen to their fans, it's like lego, only you don't have physics and fear of death weighing on you, im looking at you both! anyway buy if you like creative games and lego, plus making things! TLDR: great game, like legos but better, devs listen to their fans, buy it now."
18973,"lol its gud
"
18974,Why are developers to lazy to build tutorials these days?  I really do not want to be forced to watch your youtube video on how to play a game just so you can fulfill your wish to be a youtube star or your egotistical need to be the center of attention.   Just build a tutorial for goodness sake.
18975,Great Game! Can't wait for more updates...

18980,Using guides outside of the game helps.
18981,This is a crazy game... Had lots of fun with the Logic gates
18982,I love this game it is so overwelmingly fun
18983,"Still a bit basic as far as gameplay loop from what I can tell so far (June 2020, early access) but it does surprise you as you build up your little industry as far as what you can do if you are creative. For instance, look up automated watering system vids some streamers/youtubers have posted - it can get pretty wild when it comes to wanting to be lazy and not water your own crops. I enjoyed building a large wooden pickup truck with a big F U engraved in blocks on its front bumper (to help the weight balance for quick acceleration...totally)."
18984,"10/10 but survival is baws
"
18985,food bar gose down to fast but bisides from that and we need mod suport for suvivel its a perfect game
18986,just the best building game i have ever seen
18987,I have played this game for almost 100 hours and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sandbox games.
18988,"[h1] The game [/h1]
Scrap Mechanic is a creative multiplayer sandbox game where you explore, scavenge and collect objects from all over a wide-open interactive world. With these gathered objects you can build shelters, impressive moving vehicles, and machines that will help you survive on a dangerous world full of robots.

 [h1] The gamemodes [/h1]
There's currently 3 gamemodes in Scrap Mechanic: Challenge, Survival and Creative.

Challenge is pretty simple. You are given materials to build a craft that will need to surpass any obstacles along the way to the finish line.

Creative is the gamemode to let your imagination fly. Build anything without needing to worry about materials or efficiency, from a simple car to a complex logic machine.

Survival is the main gamemode in the game. Let's talk about it in a new section.

 [h1] Survival [/h1] 
So, here's the deal. You are a mechanic who just crashed into a completely unexplored world filled with farmer robots. You don't take long to discover that these creatures have gone wild and attack any mechanic who gets close. You need to collect food and resources to survive.

This seems all really good, doesn't it? 
Well, there's just one little problem.

[b] It's too grindy. [/b]

I can describe my 100 hours of playtime in a simple list:
0-10 hours: Learning basic mechanics.
10-20 hours: Farming and first weapon [Spudgun]
20-30 hours: Farming and material gattering.
30-40 hours: First warehouse.
40-50 hours: Farming and second weapon [Shotgun]
50-60 hours: Farming.
60-70 hours: Farming.
70-80 hours: Final weapon [Spudling Gun]
80-100 hours: A LOT of resource gattering to make 1 little house.

Conclusion:
Good game, but you need to invest a lot of your time."
18989,So far the farming and fighting the robots.  Need to make better females though.
18990,"I was looking for a replacement to minecraft for my young one. We both play now.

EDIT: THIS GAME IS A GOLD MINE! DO NOT HESISTATE! BUY NOW!

My 7 year old is getting into crafting games. She played minecraft on wii-u and was doing fine. So when I got her a computer, I thought the crafting game should receive an update as well. Enter scrap mechanic.

I initially bought this game because it had cutesy graphics my 7 year old would like. I mean minecraft was never a looker but it had been, what, a decade? I thought we could get at least better graphics. We got so much more than just updated graphics.

What makes scrap mechanic so much better than minecraft (bring on the downvotes) is the machine designing component. Using some simple components, you can build anything from a combine harvester to automated watering system. It is really hard to explain the joy of easily combining a couple logic gates, a controller, a few pistons and a water canon to produce something that works. You have to see it to believe it.

The environment is created by semi randomly placing some man made tiles (each tile is 256 x 256 blocks big). This is a winning approach as it brings replayability of procedurally generated maps, with thoughtful nature of designed levels. The design, tells the story of the game in a subtle way. Abandoned farms, bill boards advertising robots, captive farmers, underground farm traders' networks... They all add to your understanding of the game. 

The game doesn't have a scenario per-se but, its world does have a history told through the environment. It is liberating, as you don't have to listen to or read anything. Your encounters with the world slowly shapes your experience.

While the game is early access I would say it has enough going on to be enjoyable. I never thought I would sink in this much time into this game when I first bought it. The only thing I wish they would fix is the optimization. After spending a day building a defense mechanism, seeing your game become unplayable is really a bit disappointing. Still, even that is a minor inconvenience."
18991,First game I got on steam. Long ago 2017.
18992,like
18993,"Strange game, allows some interesting building, and interesting farming/trading.  Makes me think a bit of Spore"
18994,"Survival mode is WAYYYYY too broken to play right now. The amount of lag when going into the larger facilities makes it unplayable. The fact that you don't have a compass, map, waypoints, or ANYTHING that can help you navigate is really really frustrating. When dying in buildings your bag doesn't show so you can't even navigate back to it to retrieve lost items (unless you make a bed and sleep everywhere you go so you don't re-spawn a century away from where you were) and if you do that.....good luck finding your base!!!! Not to mention how frustrating farming is....you have to babysit it because the bots will come and attack your crops no matter what structure you build around it. Upgraded metal blocks, concrete, and other high durability items should NOT be that easily destructible. Oh and when you make it back to your location of interest the game just decides to get some sort of ""Error"" and force closes. Hours of building and work lost. I know this is an early access game, but FFS before you start adding new components work on stabilizing the game and fix the lag issues. I would much rather play a smooth incomplete game than a game full of fun things that you can't even utilize. While extremely disappointing the performance and TONS of bugs, I do look forward to the progression of this game. DEVs - FOCUS ON THE BUGS AND PERFORMANCE!!!!! (No one cares about the chemical crate at this point lol)"
18995,g
18996,its decent
18997,You have to at least try the game
18998,"Day 1: Crashed on ship, built 1st car and found mechanic station.

Day 2: Car gets destroyed by haybots. Im a simple man, I see crates, I take them.

Day 3: I see 3 Haybots raping an innocent cow on the field and I get raided on my garden, this is fine.

Day 4: Goes to warehouse building, sees tapebots. 

Me: NOOO, YOU CANT SHOOT ME AND KILL ME WITH THE TAPES SO ACCURATE!
Tapebot: Haha tape go fly.

Day 5: Found 10 diffrent types of blocks. Totally not minecraft at all.

Day 6: Sees red robot boss. Dies instantly and closes the game.

Day 60: Made an advanced garden and base and planted a lot of brocolli and pineapple. Worst decision ever. Raid of haybots and red robot bosses destroyed half of my base like a snap from thanos.

Day 70: Made a bouncy castle with robot ragdoll party all day and launched myself to space with a catapult. Kerbal space program feeling.

Do you like minecraft but in like realistic way? Do you like to see Haybot love with cows? Do you like seeing your progress being destroyed instantly? Do you like seeing robots go fly like in catapult?

If yes to all, then this is your game lul

EDIT: Thanks for the awards, luv ya all!"

19000,"With the latest updates they made multiplayer unplayable, there were some issues before this but they were manageable. 
With the latest update there is a huge delay, I know it is P2P but we have good internet, of +/- 5 seconds. 
The way the game was i would recommend it for online Co-op but in its current condition i just cant recommend it.
We have tried all known fixes even new maps swapping hosts but it is not working."

19005,"Nice game have fun


"
19006,"Fun game, It is kinda like Minecraft just less blocky and you can build literally what you please weather its a car or a full on transformer."
19007,The game is great... there are some buggy things in it but im sure they will eventually be sorted out... for a game developer making their own game engine its doing good... bearings and pistons can get floppy if there is too much going on but you can easily design around these problems... the devs have not finished survival mode yet so expect more to get fleshed out...
19008,Very good.
19009,its fun
19010,pretty poggers
19011,Love it!
19012,Pretty fun game best part is watching your character bobble around while driving. Fan of games like this and has a fun spin on it.
19013,"The game crashes at launch. I don't even get a logo or audio, just a black screen. Ive attempted various troubleshooting over several hours, none of which have worked in the slightest. Looking at several forums and posts from the dev team themselves, this has been going on for years and they dont care to look into it. You should not have to fix something so basic after spending money on a game. I understand its in early access, but being able to at least boot the game up is ever so slightly important. Ill check on it in the future to see if the devs figured out the basics. Shame too, looks like fun..."
19014,"Farming, Machines, Robots. What's there not to like?"
19015,"The game gives you a lot of things to play with, bearings, controllers, pistons etc. It gives you a lot of freedom and you can make whatever  you want, music, realistic engines, computers and there's no limit other than your creativity."
19016,"good game!
keep up the good work"
19017,good
19018,"It's such a shame, i wanted to love this game but i can't. I really like the creative side of things and survival mode but the low fps i get sometimes makes it unplayable match that which the choppy audio and bugs, i can't recommend this game. i know its EARLY ACCESS but that isn't an excuse for lame optimisation. My system specs are way above the recommended, it's great they keep adding features BUT maybe concentrate on getting things running smooth!!"
19019,well in my opinion its a must play
19020,its so fun i pufit as a gane
19021,good
19022,Why is this game so addictive to me?! I'm not that great at building cool creations but it keeps me trying. :-)
19023,"Awesome game. Love the goofy style. You will only drop frames when there are a lot of loose objects flopping around. Game hosts need to have decent connection for multiplayer otherwise other players will rubber band. 
I give it 4 stars which is extremely good for a game that's not finished!"

19029,"This game is really only limited by your creativity. If you can think of a way to make it work, it will work. However, outside of that the gameplay loop is pretty simple, and very grindy. I have no doubt they'll improve it, but I couldn't get very far without feeling like I was marching through quicksand."
19030,mods can make cars go moch 2 and also make game go crash
19031,"A great, laid back sandbox adventure. It reminds me a little bit of Portal Knights and Minecraft. It can be challenging at first, but I imagine with time and practice it will only get easier. No bugs that I've noticed or crashes. This game has a ton of potential. I highly recommend it."
19032,its boppin
19033,"It's a pretty good sandbox game that now includes a survival mode. You can make a lot of things in it and it doesn't take long to learn the basics. If you do get this and enjoy it, I suggest you get the modpack and a couple of other mods off of the workshop. Also, I don't know why, but when they did the update, some of my creations stopped working, but if you're just now getting it, that shouldn't be a problem."

19059,"Building inventions to solve problems like cutting down trees and having a support frame to hold the tree and run it through blades to cut it down and refine. Or mining a rock formation using pistons and bearings to have the blades grind the rock then rotate to grind down the broken pieces further. The survival element that has been newly introduced is brilliant with the introduction of farms bots and raids when planting crops. A life simulator if you imagine you are a dwarf creature crash landing on a new world and building creations including cars, boats, flying vehicles to meet daily requirements to gather resouces. Def give it a try :)"
19060,Good game to create machines
19061,"yo this game is sick

19062,beauty of a game
19063,the game is trash could not launch the game for 20 minutes and every time i do anything the game crashes

19069,its good
19070,"This is a really fun game to play. The crafting and survival aspect is great!
What it is lacking is stability when creating complex constructions and content. Don't get me wrong the game is awesome, I've spent over 100 hours just messing around with crafting and exploring but one day it just hit me. There isn't much to the story/lore of the game. I really hope the dev team decides to put a little meat on the bones of the game."
19071,a
19072,Would not recommend Liked it for a while but after a while it became boring Sorry axolot AND ALSO TO MUCH MONEY FOR WHATS IT IS HATE IT I ONLY PLAY IT FOR CREATIVE ONE OF THE WORST GAMES IV'E EVER PLAYED

19086,really pushes you to be creative. once fully developed this game will be amazing.
19087,"Yes

19088,"Tons of fun, love playing the new modes with my son!"
19089,it cool
19090,"It is a really fun game, especially the sandbox mode where you have infinite blocks. I specifically like downloading vehicles and fun stuff to modify or just play around with.

19097,Really really nice game but multiplayer survival mode lacks optimization. Since it's still Early Access it is kinda acceptable but it shouldn't take long for developers to fix it. But it if it's fixed otherwise i wouldn't reccomend it
19098,Survival unplayable. The game was running fine for about a week and now all the sudden when I load in the game freezes and I can't dp anything. Can't recpmenmd this game in it's current state
19099,i would recommend this game for the creative and challenge modes but the survival mode isn't as good the robots are just annoying they kill you in three hits and it takes forever to finally get away from them hunger is a huge problem because it goes down really fast and there isn't much to eat i mean you could farm but hordes of robots will rush you and try to destroy your farm in the end the vehicle building is fun and creative while the survival is pretty meh
19100,this game is so fun
19101,"its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good
"
19102,"This is an amazing game with good things to look forward to... but there is a lot of lag when building massive structures such as: flying machines, automated farms and many more. But i have hope for this beautiful game.

Please fix these problems, thank you"
19103,Honestly good if you love survival games!
19104,"I think this is a great game to buy because of the amazing things you can do! You can make a car, a plane or anything you can imagine."
19105,Bearings definetly need to be optimized for big builds. I hope the story your working is going great and hope new aspects and new things are brought to the game through the story.
19106,this game is is so cool you can do whatever you want and minecraft is 26 $ this game is better and this game is only 20 bucks!
19107,"I'll be the first to admit it's just not my thing.  I only played the Survival Mode with friends, never solo.

It's bearable to play with friends (we've had minor issues with connectivity at times), but the combat is super repetitive and it's a constant grind to make the simplest things.  I have a pretty decent PC (3900x, 2080ti, 32gb ram) and it will lag hard in areas, especially around the food packaging plants.  I know, Early Access (or it was at the time of this review).

Having just come from Trailmakers, I'd say go play that.  It's much better imo, more user friendly, and there is no real grind in that game.  I know some people will like the grind, and this may be more for you."
19108,"Scrap mechanic survival mode has very little in the way of in-game guidance. The first thing you discover is a board with simple instructions on how to grow crops. After that, you are on your own. At first I was confused as to what to do in this game. There isn't even a marker or a map to get you back home if you get lost. Indeed the first thing I did was walk too far and forget my way back, which pretty much ended that play through after about 30 minutes. I gave it another shot a few days later and things got much better. You need to explore, find materials, and just use trial and error to figure out what things do. Not everything will work, but you just tear it down and try again.

This is not a story or waypoint driven game. You set your own targets, figure everything out for yourself, make mistakes and ultimately build bigger and better creations."
19109,
19110,"i mean its overall a good game with the new survival and chalange modes i want more people to play it!

19111,I love it the survivul and all

19124,it good game
19125,i would not recommend but heres a thumbs up
19126,"I didn`t play that much before the survival mode was released, but since its out: Its so much fun to play either alone or with friends. There are no limitations to my creativity!"
19127,"Made a dick, started smacking it around until it eventually bugged out and flew into space."
19128,This game is very fun to play especially with friends but can to me it can get very complicated when building large machines but never the less tutorials were very helpful in assisting me to understand the basics.
19129,This is a very good game and I have recommended it to several of my friends. Highly recommended.
19130,"Pretty good game, multiplayer input delay is kinda bad but you get used to it. Much more fun with friends, but still pretty fun solo."
19131,This is a nice game but I think if the dev improve how the map is loading (In survival) it's gonna be the best game. When the different part of the map if loading when travel the game will freeze for some time.
19132,nice
19133,fun creative play
19134,well lets say im a teenager and ive been wanting to play this game sense i was young and now that i have i can say that this would be a good game for lil kids and the new surlivle mode is ausome so plz play and shout out to scrapman on you tube he is awsome at the game plz check him out

19166,good
19167,it is good
19168,"Fun game but it barely works, i have lost 2 saves that i have spent alot of time on so there is currently no point in playing the game at all because there is a good chance that your save will end up ruined. wait a year or so before purchasing, hopefully they will have fixed these bugs by then and there are alot of them. all in all i did have fun with the game but it's not really playable at the moment. unless you dont mind starting over and over after spending about 40 hours on each save, id say wait."
19169,this is a rediculasly adictive i will remomend
19170,Nice casual game with fun sandbox physics
19171,"I would recomend this to other players because I just can't stop playing survival or creative because it so fun and if you want to chalenge yourself go in to chalenge mode,"
19172,love the challenge. need more story though.
19173,"Absolutely love this game, has so much potential. Minecraft but with technology and robots, who wouldn't love that?! HOWEVER, the current start up time is atrocious. I play on a mid-tier gaming computer that can load plenty of AAA games no problem, but Scrap Mechanic freezes on every start up screen and almost crashes every freeze. The loading screen takes forever to render, and DEAR LORD, THE LOAD TIME. Game takes minutes until it actually starts. Once I'm in the game it runs fine, so I don't think it's anything with the graphics necessarily? I even have all the graphics settings on low/medium and like I said, the game itself runs fine its just a pain in the butt to try and load it up. I'd be playing the game a lot more if it started up smoother. I know the game is still in early access so I totally understand why this is happening, it's just sad that this is the main thing that causes me to pick a different game when I'm settling in to play. I know I personally would also like to maybe see some gamepad/controller integration at some point, but again, early access, I completely understand, and with how many buttons this game utilizes it might not be possible, but that's really the only other complaint I have about it. 
The building mechanics are fun, I love building the most ridiculous vehicles in creative and just being able to figure out how things work a bit better before dipping into the more high stakes survival game. Building can sometimes be a bit clunky, like if I want to click and drag a block to build multiple squares of something I can only drag it in certain directions, which often aren't the directions I wanted to build in, and if you're a bit of a dumbass like me you don't find the little help book until you're twenty minutes in and scratching your head like, ""I don't know what I'm doing wrong! How hard can building a simple vehicle be?"" The answer to which is, of course, pretty difficult as long as you're just trying to wing it. The instructions were pretty clear, though again if you're a dumb-dumb like I am it takes several readthroughs and some trial and error before it all clicks for you. Adjusting the speed on the engines can sometimes be a bit tricky, I either seem to be going incredibly slow or fast enough that turning at all causes me to tip over if I don't have little training wheels or bumpers that prevent me from falling over like a top-heavy toddler. 
I'm positively stoked to see what this game becomes as it continues to develop!! I can't wait to see what new features the dev team rolls out, like different difficulty settings in survival mode (and even some more detailed modifiers like different difficulties for consumables vs enemies, but I like to be picky when a game allows for it) or maybe some new enemies, structures, or who knows? Maybe even a story to follow and lore to unpack. Huge HUGE shoutout to the team behind this game, I love what you're doing, I think it's awesome and that you're headed in the right direction! I definitely recommend buying the game now while its still in early access, not just because it'll be pricier once the full version is released, but because it's always awesome to be a part of projects like this while they're still forming. Early access does come with some growing pains, of course, but the charm and appeal of the game outweigh those."

19177,"If you like making things, you'll like this game"
19178,Great game
19179,addictive game
19180,So much stupid shit you can build. The only thing missing is my creativitiy...
19181,it is fun but hard some times and you can do many things
19182,"To play this game to its peak potential, it requires at least a masters in engineering. Interesting and complicated physics interactions with vehicle construction, interesting and bizarre survival story, reasonable amount of content and pretty cool random world generation and mobs. I would like to see more protective PVE gear like armour and weapons perhaps, because until you get the spud gun you're just whacking mobs with a hammer. As a whole it is impossible to compare this game to any other singular game. Very rare set of ideas.

I especially recommend this if you have autism."
19183,yes
19184,i sucked off my friends while playing this game
19185,"its cute, and has nothing really to do...

the parts are quite limited for what I expect and it lacks variety not only in the survival but the world in general. I like games that let you explore creativity but there is virtually no instruction or storyline in survival. I'll stick with Stormworks for now, maybe one day I'll come back to this game, but with no real engineering challenge or world, this is not something I can recommend.

oh, and there is no progression or tech tree at all..."
19186,Great game even if it's in Beta! There is a lot to do. I think of this game as an engineer's version of Minecraft.
19187,its boring with out a friend
19188,"its best game i would like them to make where you CAN SPAWN CHOPPAA
"
19189,The game concept is very nice but it has a huge problem. The performance. Since the release of the game the performance always was very bad especially in multiplayer and it still is.. You are not able to build a little bigger thing than a car and it starts lagging even with the best PC.. I think that physics are a big performance issue here and I won't change my mind about that game until this gets fixed :(
19190,"This is one of the most infuriating games ive ever played. not only are the majority of the physics broken, the enemies are the most powerful beings in the universe. the devs have no armor system and for some reason think having the majority of the enemies being able to kill you in 2-3 hits. this game is only fun for a week and then you'll never play again. (EDIT) I am rewriting this review because ive been keeping up with this game and its developers for a while and they have been constantly updating, adding and fixing this game. I'm happy with the outcome. The game is in a good state right now and think people should definitely try it out if they like sandbox physics games."

19215,This is such a beautiful game with a fun game play and crafting system. I was really looking forward to playing this. But I tried to play offline on my lunch break and it refuses to start up.  Most ofy game time is only on break from work so no internet. I cannot play this game as it stands.  I really wish I could.

19217,it is amazing
19218,some fond memories made with this game
19219,"nice
"
19220,"Fun, easy to build complex machines. great for co-op."
19221,"This is currently just not good. Played co-op with a friend on survival mode for pretty much my entire listed playtime barring maybe 20 minutes of screwing around solo. Maybe that was the mistake we made. Playing survival that is, we went into this looking for a game not just a place to build some vehicles.

Either way presently survival mode is just a waste of time. Enemies are effortlessly easy or kill you with two shots. Building is alright though I never made anything memorable enough to really give it much review. Resource gathering and exploration...those are just awful. Clearly the intention is to get to the point of using vehicles for this but man it just wasn't worth the time sick. 

Passing for now.

"
19222,So I have not played this game for a not pretty long time. But in the time I have played this game I have experienced some bugs and some glitch... But those bugs make the game more funny and better in my opinion.
19223,THE BEST GAME EVER WOOOOOOOOO
19224,"A+ game but it still an Early Access Game, so may get bugs in game from time to time, but it still a lot of fun to play it."

If you actually play the game, and don't just bumble around for 6 or 7 hours not bothering to learn anything, you can have a lot of fun with this game.
It's more advanced than Lego, so if that's going to give you a struggle, find a simpler game."
19242,The fact that you can basically build anything you want is pretty cool.
19243,the mechanics of building vehicles and the grind for resources makes it exciting and challenging.

Also the character models look kinda gross."

19258,great game. can get glitchey sometimes but still great
19259,fun if you can get it to work but is hard to use
19260,"the only problem in survival is that food and water become a higher priority than scavenging and building which often leads to a barrier for what you want to do (build, scavenge, explore)."
19261,"[h1] Steady development, worth supporting and waiting for [/h1]

Most people are a bit hesitant when it comes to invest money in early access games, since developers often lose their goal / motivation and the desired outcome isn't met. Not the case here.
The delevopers are very passionate and are non stop working. While they keep you waiting and making you unpatient, they're always sooner or later delivering an update you've been long waiting for.

I've had this game before any signs of a survival mode and now I'm insanely happy it has been published. While it still has some flaws (for god's sake add a map, please) it's a pleasure observing the changes this game goes through. Survival is already fun to play, even so more with friends!
While this game is more of built to let you build dynamic stuff like vehicles, they're also working on static stuff, so you're able to build houses etc. At least it's more optimized than it was in the beginning.

All in all I'd say give it some time, support it and come back to a wonderful game.
You already can have fun right now in creative mode, creating a new project with friends. Can't wait for the final product."

19265,"So far in my scrap mechanic experience i have made many vehicles and started over many times, only to figure out this game is a grind. it's going to get better in the future im sure but until then i made my own tweaks to the games core files so it's not as bad. however i've come across an idea that i think would be nice in the game itself, not just survival. i think weather would be a nice touch to survival, heck even creative. why not just throw it in the base game. that would be really nice to see one day. Also i firmly believe survival_loot needs to be broken down, as it stands. even one misplacement and like half the system refuses to work. but not like a big deal just it would be nice lmao. so like i love this game and modding for it is super sick too, it's very intuitive, i've been at it for like 2 weeks and i've picked up as much code as i needed to make all sorts of adjustments to my gameplay, it's actually very simple. i can't believe this game is written this easily and yet still runs so smoothly. even with lots of loot on the ground, it doesn't take fps hits too hard when opening massive crates of like 100 items, i do admit my system is pretty beefy but still i have a buddy who normally gets like 5-30fps (leniently) and he said woah lag when he opened crates but he's on some 6 year old notebook with an i3.

ultimately i've enjoyed my time and will continue to enjoy my time playing and modding. Thanks for an amazing platform for entertainment. Cheers"
19266,.
19267,the game often crashes and i have no clue why but other than that its a good game
19268,great game. create anything you can imagine to survive in the new game mode survival of just to have fun in creative

19271,cool game roflmao
19272,its fun
19273,"My experience with the game thus far has been 75% negative and 25% positive. 



PROS:


- The appeal to build crazy in-depth creations, and test your metal with them in a survival world that is a blast to play.

- One of the few titles that are going all the way with being a fully dynamic ""Building game.""
i.e. You can quite literally build an actual engine with all the gears and actuating parts where torque and horsepower can be a thing, all while having crank shafts and differential axles to boot.

- Logic gates, command modules, pistons, buttons, switches ect. All the complicated craziness from any other extensive building game except NONE of the mind twisted frustration as this games UI and intuitive controls, and over all mechanics and game play really make it easy to do extremely complex critical thinking things.

- Land, Sea and Air... The only survival game outside of Empyrion that puts ""functional, practical, and Needed"" emphasis on these creations... again, you can get very in-depth to the smallest detail in how these creations work.
Ex: You can make a literal crane with a grab claw on it to cut the tree from the earth, and place in/on your back end of your vehicle to load it or have an INBUILT mill that can cut the tree up AND refine it on the SPOT! (You've never had so much fun applying creative thinking with critical thinking to achieve a goal) Plus it can crab and kill bots too! haha 

- Physics and Mechanics... Feels real where you want it to feel real, and is forgiving in all the other areas.

- Survival is really well balanced with a healthy difficulty on enemy strength. Very nice to see serious threats like the boss/farm, tape bots who have ranged attack, and Red bots who shoot RPGs at you. The Boss bot and Red Bots can really give you a bad day in game if you are not on your toes AND prepared for them... which is totally awesome and exciting!

- Perhaps the ""GREATEST STRENGTH"" of this game, is both the combination of the above, and how absolutely stunning this game is to explore visually- with the in-game music (super chill and well done), and the sounds of the world itself all around you- all while exploring the open world with your creations. 
""To be able to look out so far and see the country side, lakes, and oceans"" and all the crazy awesome topography of the world that really challenges you to build something that can master it's terrain is just so well done.
... I just love the beautiful landscapes and art of every little detail. 

- Your choice of playing first person or third person with on the spot camera adjustment to boot. It's really quite amazing how different the game feels operating your creation in the different points of view.

- Part of it's brilliant difficulty dynamic is how it challenges you to actually use your brain to accomplish simple things. For instance, finding north is important, and SO MANY people complain about how there is no sense of direction in the game, however ""THERE IS A SUN that rises and sets (East and West)! It's these subtle details all throughout each milestone of your game progression and experience that makes the game an over all wonderful experience and teaching tool while having fun with your kids or younger siblings.

- Exploration is highly rewarded. 
- High risk with high reward.
- The more difficult something is, means you could probably find a better way, or there is a solid pay off coming if you can get through your difficulties.

- Physics engine enjoyment in general. 
It's just so much fun to be able to build something in an ""actual challenging game"" that is fun to play with friends.
... Most, if not all that try to achieve what Scrap Mechanic is succeeding in, is that the actual game is not a slap together, but a well thought out, challenging, NON-Grinding, fun gaming experience that you can get lost in for hours. It's chill where it needs to be relaxing, but stimulating in all the other areas that you want to be challenged in. 
i.e. Farming! Traveling! Hauling things you need! Combat! Raid Defense! Raiding structures! Raiding End game Warehouses (remember the roofs are full of things to take to build a really cool base)! Boss Fights!

- The game is frequently updated with a very passionate Development team. The Game promises to deliver more new and exiting content.



CONS:


- Easy to get stuck.

- Hit registration on NPC is very faulty, most noticeably on the boss bot when vehicle ramming. 

- Easy to fuse with solid objects on map with vehicle.
Ex: [url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733159504870506538/738408491856822312/unknown.png] Large Vehicle Fused up into a very large Tree.[/url]

- No block diversity
i.e. T3 Metal (armor) is only cubes, there are no sloped or angled blocks to make shapes.

- Traction and wheel options are limited and lacking good performance.
i.e. off road wheels/tires on larger vehicles offer little to no grip on the ground like driving on slick muddy ground.

- Bearings, axles, and suspension systems are the bees knees when it comes to games like this. Being able to build things like the Hemit 8x8 military truck, or other crazy massive land crawlers and haulers are most enjoyable and truly gratifying when properly designed... but you can't build these properly or even remotely... 

‚Ä¶ BECAUSE THE GAME NEEDS SERIOUS OPTIMIZATION to the following-
1) Suspension
2) NPC/bot-pathing - they get STUCK and actively search for a path to move to, that they cannot move, and it will bog your system down to a crawl!
3) Bearings
4) Heavy vehicles
5) Collision detection (i.e. ramming the boss bot and nothing happening or you driving over him like he's a ramp) Mind you this occurs maybe about the 3rd of the times you encounter them.



IN CONCLUSION:

This game has been out for over 4 Years now, since 2016. The same issues and problems that make the game unplayable have yet to be addressed such as the immense loss of frame rate when doing any type of building or engineering on anything. 

If you are looking for a game to tinker with ALONE or with a very tolerant friend who doesn't mind playing the game with 30 frames or less once you start building things, and you like to build crazy in-depth ""LITTLE"" things then yeah I could recommend this game to you in a heart beat. 

However, what sold me on this game was the survival game play and being able to build a piston powered engine of perpetual energy. It looked like the ultimate end game achievement as it challenges you to get the materials needed to even build it and then the mountainous challenge of actually building it, and well at that.

Sadly, the Optimization Cons ruin this gaming experience for me, especially because nobody want to play survival together at 15 to 30 fps.

I have pro gaming titan rig with an excessive amount of ram, so I'm typically in the mid 200-300 fps mark in any game I play, from first year Ark Survival Evolved, to Subnautica beta, but this game, REALLY brings down my cpu HARD. So yeah, I can't recommend this game at this time. It would not be honest of me to do so."
19274,its fun for me cuz baldi is in it so get the game pls
19275,it is a amazing game and i suggest it to anyone seeking fun and danger
19276,"Fun game, cool take on the genre. Needs to add more automation options, mainly for getting oil/gas. 
Was a bummer when I died far from my main base. Realized i could put a bed on my vehicle to set spawn point. Was a bummer when a farmbot hacked off the side of my vehicle so now im across the map from my main base, spawn point on my disabled vehicle, with no ability to fix it. Still had to run back, build a new car, drive it back to my other one to fix.
Once you realize the map isnt THAT big and running wont take THAT long things got a lot less scary. Also bearing motors..."

19297,"Really fun, tons of things to do and the survival makes it 10 times better, still a few bugs(with any early access game) but for the most part it's great. Think of it like Minecraft but a lot more engineering and mechanical focused. Can't dig but the amount of endless possibilities one can do is really something I've loved about this game even prior to the survival release, the game gets even better with the multiplayer option too. Also I would like to mention that the character customization is a neat touch, hopefully they can be adding a lot more clothing options though. Over all this game is definitely worth the while."

19304,"i think this game is very enjoyable, especially survival mode. the creations you build have a purpose, and its just fun to work your way through the game.  the bad things are that it is very Very grindy, so what i think is good is going into the game files and changing some resource drop rates and other things, like make component kits easier to get, and same with crude oil. although if you like a challenge then you can just keep it the same."

It is constantly being updated with lots of new features, and the game isn't even finished yet. It also has amazing mod support, so if you want mods installed, you only have to click a few buttons. Scrap mechanic also has challenge involved, so you have to be skilled to make something amazing, which adds to the fun of playing it.

19336,"They have tons of work to do for survival mode, its fair if you got friends but its not optimized for single players. I'm constantly getting wiped out when I start farming. Yes, you have to farm to get anywhere in survival mode. Don't get me wrong its a great game, but if you're gonna do anything you need friends.

i suggest you get the game yourself to have the fun im having!! :))) EDIT: NOW THERES SURVIVAL WHICH MAKES IT 1,000,000,000 TIMES BETTER!!! XD I LOVE IT! Edit: 600 more hours in this game (lol) i freaking love it and yall gotta get it for yo self! Edit: got 800 hours on the game now! i dont like the survival mode anymore btw... it needs more... or we need a gamemode selector to be in creative in our survival worlds, just if you made a survival world, you cant go in creative in that world, or if you do anything in creative and switch it to survival it wont save it... update: i have an adittional 1,114hrs on this game... its fun, as, H E C K... whoever is reading this needs to get the game also i said i didnt like survival cuz my computer is a powered potato Edit 3: its fun, if you like sandbox, survival, exploration, and etc type games, this game is for you. plust i have lik 1396.9 hours in here now or something"
19341,I have a crippling addiction to this game. I hope it gets better...
19342,its not as good as gmod but not as bad as left for dead
19343,its fun multiplayer but in single player it gets boring.
19344,"It's really fun to play with friends and it's a very chill game to play, you have to expect to die loads at the start of the game but it's easy to grab your loot again.Fun to discover new areas and building whatever you feel like. Can't wait for updates for future development and see this game grow."
19345,i liked the warehouse and if you see a big red bot if yu have a spud gun shoot him with it
19346,Surivival!!!!
19347,very fun

19352,"I got very unlucky when I had first purchased this game, I had seen a youtuber playing the game online thought it had seemed fun and bought the game, that was 3 1/2 years ago or so. When I got it I ended up playing it for over 2 hours (my first problem) decided that I did not enjoy the game as it was complicated in a way that I did not enjoy in a game. I asked for a refund but since I was over 2 hours of playtime I was denied. I know that now there is no chance of me getting a refund since I have owned it for over 3 years so I guess I am posting this just to say, Make sure you enjoy the game when you get it or don't play it for 2 hours trying to figure it out"
19353,fun game. starts easy enough but can get deep quick
19354,If you like survival craft games this one is a must have in your list of games. This game is a lot of fun to play and I love every moment on it and cant wait for some of the stuff to come. Get people get this game and build some cool stuff!
19355,Very fun building game which with the addition of survival mode gives you loads of stuff to do. Worth the money.
19356,"very nice game . great user interface.
"
19357,"Love this game, I hope they make it so you can play multiplayer in survival."
19358,d-aia
19359,good creative game
19360,"Great game now it has survival, a bit grindy though especially with oil n clams.

Has some performance optimisation issues, not for potato PC's!"
19361,it is a solid game but it has a few bugs that can be fixed
19362,good game:]
19363,The new survival aspect to Scrap Mechanic has great potential. And breaths life needed in to the game.  I really look forward to seeing them develop this game into something awesome!
19364,"Fun and imaginative game. There is so much that can be done in this game. It is a little lagy at times and hopefully that gets fixed for the final versions. Well, Apparently bases are not perminant structures. Tried to weld a trap to our garden and the entire base became unfastened from the ground and slide into the lake. Damn it."
19365,"Nice sandbox game with many options for modding and vanilla
"
19366,"Great game, addictive!"
19367,"One of my favorite games of all time. This game combines survival, base building, logic and wiring, and advanced vehicle building. I was able to create a giant truck with my own custom-made large wheels made out of other objects. I used the big truck as a mobile base and carried around all my crafting stations and storage on it. I've never done anything like that in any other game and I find it extremely cool that the game allows you to do something totally unique like that. If you look at the community content for this game you'll see the endless creative freedom this game allows.

That being said, it does have serious performance issues that need to be improved. Whenever an enemy or player trips they go into a rag doll mode and it destroys the frame rate. The warehouse areas of the game have consistently bad performance."
19368,"very good
"
19369,its just great
19370,There are tons of features and you can make complicated machines using different mechanics.
19371,fun

19383,you can do anything
19384,"Game fails to load past the world loading screen. Attempted many fixes to but no avail, sent my bug report to the devs and will re-visit & review again when they get pass beta/early access. Had high hopes to play the game.

Won't recommend if it doesn't work on your setup

Will recommend if it works on your PC.

19385,Extremely repetitive gameplay. The early game is a slog with easily missed places and uneventful places to find. Things look interesting until you realize how long it takes to do anything. Very disappointing loop of exploration with almost nothing good to find.
19386,so fun it is a good game
19387,it da best
19388,"Check this game out!
Fun to play. Huge workshop. Great creative mode(s).
If you liked Besiege I would check this out. It has the same energy of creation, but Scrap Mechanic is a lot more complex and fun. (In my opinion.)

Take the next part with a grain of salt:
I did uninstall this game because of it's poor optimization. This game feels like it takes a stronger computer to handle. I'm sitting here with my lowest graphics in the new Survival mode in a slideshow. I did clean it out and now it runs a bit better. (I think.)"
19389,"Complex with limited instructions, bit tough to start but overall super fun."
19390,"Its pretty good
"
19391,.
19392,great game!
19393,fun game to play with friends
19394,This game is Great!! so much to learn and do about building vehicles and farms. Just the ideas that come to mind when you need to survive are ambitious and this game allows you to do it. Hope they add many updates cause this game is great.
19395,"I have enjoyed the game, but I wanted to play it on a trip. But with no internet the game wont start. They said back in 2016 they would be working on being able to play it when people didn't have internet. It's now 2020. People don't need 4 years to make a game work off line also."
19396,‚ÄúStart where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.‚Äù best game.
19397,it's a very fun and addicting game
19398,"i cant even start it 
"
19399,is very good
19400,I
19401,Very fun. Has a lot of potential for improvements and increased content.
19402,"XL&! Lot's of fun, and now with survival even more so"
19403,i have played this game over 180 hrs.. 80 of those in survival. if you are looking for a game to kill time or put hundreds of hrs in...this IS the game for you.. 10/10 would recomend to anyone.
19404,yes
19405,"very fun game when you know what to do 
"
19406,yes
19407,nagyon j√≥
19408,this game is for people that are smart but iam dumb
19409,"amazing game very fun with friends 
BUT
i hope they optimise it a bit"
19410,good game
19411,Such very the cool
19412,www
19413," i like playing with my brother its realy fun
"
19414,Survival is amazing and the devs are continuously working on updating it and making the game better.... I can't wait to see what they do next with the game.  If you like building crafting and making vehicles while defending you're farm... or just want to create with not to many limitations... this is the game for you.... well worth the price
19415,is gr8
19416,"I've played more expensive and less fun games than this. I'm not into these sandbox games but this hooked me so hard i love creating different cars, the exploring and the not so told lore of this game it gives an aura of mystery and wanting to know more and keep exploring i mean it's an early access and i want more of it so i guess once it's released it will be even greater, the current price it's really fair and i would spend them again in a heart beat. what negative things you should expect? since it's early access it can't be perfect right? long loading time some heavy frame drops (lag) when you get invaded in your farm if it's a large farm, physics are not very top notch sometimes  you have to get use to them. my score is a solid hard juicy veiny  8,5/10"
19417,yes.
19418,e
19419,the only limit to this game is your imagination
19420,Fun but slow at first
19421,simply amazing
19422,its amazing
19423,"Much potential, but much too early to really enjoy."
19424,"good game
"
19425,"BEST GAME ON STEAM BY FAR IN MY PERSONAL OPINION

~BRANDON UNGARO"
19426,werie goed game fun and multieplaer
19427,"An excellent game, thanks to a solid physics engine and a large arsenal of tools and components, there is almost infinite potential for creativity; Scrap Mechanic proves itself to be one of the best survival games since Minecraft in some cases goes beyond in its potential ways to play.

Edit: also, while artificial lighting is a little rough in places and render distances for them aren‚Äôt very good, the sun lighting and god rays which react to your player character and builds (static and in motion) are incredible! Hats off to the developer responsible for that."
19428,r
19429,Good
19430,"Scrap mechanic in my opinion the best sandbox on the construction of machines and mechanisms, and with the addition of new modes in it is fun and just so hang"
19431,Great timewaster :)
19432,Gay
19433,YES
19434,yeet
19435,"amazinc would recomend, much fun to obtain, yes. only downside is occasional physcs breaks produce fun"
19436,"Great game, especially with friends!"
19437,dd
19438,Minecraft aura + Fortnite graphics + Terraria depth = I think any sandbox survival game fan will enjoy it.
19439,"truly an amzing game, i never get bored with in 1,000,000% you should buy this game, it gives you way above your moneys worth, really fun"
19440,"it is very fun
"
19441,It's fun as it is thus far and has a lot of potential. Also as far as I can tell the developers care to update the game until it is fully complete.
19442,Really fun and challenging.
19443,It's a great and fun game to play
19444,"Great game with great physics too, should be more popular honestly."
19445,"Fun game, with a different premise, having to build your own machines to process things, and get around.

It's a bit of a grind at the moment, even with the recent changes. Also there's not much tutorial or directions in the game, which came make things difficult when starting out.

So either check the Wiki or watch a few beginners tutorial otherwise you will be lost."
19446,great game you can make anything you want and more
19447,OwO this game is good my friend brought it for me OwO
19448,Great
19449,we love this game and my 6 yr old has learned to play from watching you tubers playing the beta .  He just loves the game and all the connections how they work.  I love seeing how he learns.  thank you!!!
19450,"THIS GAME IS VERY GOOD AND I LOVE IT
"
19451,Fun game! You guys should try it.
19452,this is vary fun
19453,Great game
19454,good
19455,"It's a fun game for sure and i know it's early access but the lag is like getting 10 dicks rammed in every F-able hole at once, just saying."
19456,"game ,"
19457,i recomend
19458,I would recommend this for people who like to build in the creative or play the survival mode witch i have been addicted to recently
19459,super fun and awsome
19460,"Amazing game, I fully recommend this game. The survival mode is amazing and is very interesting and I haven't seen in a lot of Survival games. Amazing price for what your getting, Creative mode for your creative or testing needs, Multiplayer to have fun not only by yourself but with your buds! If your looking for a challenge, the challenge mode with all of the user made challenges you will ever need."
19461,"This is a great game, but it has quite a few glitches and can be laggy at times. I know this comes with a game being in beta testing, and constantly being updated, but it can be annoying at times. With all that said, it is a great game to play with friends. 4/5 stars"
19462,Its just a really fun game and i think that mods are a very good feature
19463,best game EVER IN THE ENTIRE WOLRD
19464,it is fun and I get to be creative
19465,big fun it is. buy it you will...hmmm
19466,yes
19467,TYI
19468,I absolutely love it and I can make all of my crazy thoughts into reality. But when it comes to survival it is hard for me to follow because at the moment there is no storyline to guide you.
19469,This is a really good grapical Game. How the game is working is really nice. This game are really funny and you can learn your brain for hard mechanics.
19470,Game worked fine for about two months. And since last update completely unplayable. Lets me into my work and run around for about 10 seconds then completely freezes and locks up.
19471,It fun
19472,"For early access, this game is very well functioning and polished, no complaints there what so ever. Then again I found out that this game has been ‚Äùearly access‚Äù for 5 years now, which is a meme in itself. You can‚Äôt hide behind the early access label forever just to get good reviews. 

In these 5 years, they haven‚Äôt managed to release any dedicated server software, which pretty much is a must for a game like this. Anyhow, so this is an engineering sandbox building game, now with survival mode included. It is VERY grindy as you need to farm for materials more or less all the time. You can however activate developer / creative mode even in survival, so that you can enable unlimited resources if you don‚Äôt like to grind for weeks to get a material, or if you just want to experiment with different components.

There's not much objectives or much to do other than pretty much whatever you want to do. The world is a massive random map that you can explore, with buildings and warehouses that you can raid. If you like building, farming, grinding, exploring and freedom, then this game is for you. 

There's quite a few very advanced mechanics with logic gates and switches, connections and electronics, and not much is explained to you, so some actual engineering experience helps a lot. I will give this game a thumbs up, but just barley, considering it is lacking a dedicated server, which is a massive downside."
19473,Scrappy Dirty Diaper Wiper
19474,very good survival game mode!!
19475,amazing
19476,"its a great game with the survival and creative and with with the fun mechanic that you build your own creation




"
19477,"Amazing game. For some reason, I sense a Witcher 3-esque vibe while playing the game. I think it's because like the Witcher 3, the game has so many features and great attention to detail, yet the game runs smoothly. I think the devs of this game writes extremely efficient code. Compared to how borderlands 3 runs, yikes.  

100% worth the full price."
19478,AMAZING
19479,i really like survival mode.the trailer is really cool. i got it because its a building game.my brother is  a mechanic.
19480,is the best game in my opnin is like minecraft but better
19481,is realy good
19482,its just constant fun mmmm hmmm
19483,"Seriously a Great Game with a shitload of potential :3
Totally love it and its totally addicting.
Hope the Devs keep working on it as it really can be something great in this genre.

Only downside is the performance and some really rare but annoying bugs like
me having to reinstall the game after every launch.
Complexity of variation you can build is awesome. looking and hoping into even more.
So just keep it up and make it even better but before clean out those bugs please :3"
19484,Im having a lot of crashing problems but i still love the game survival is amazing not sure about the other modes a i have not played them/
19485,its pretty fun for still being an early access game and all. still a lot of tweeks to do in it to make it run smoothly can't wait for it to be fully out. i got a few people thinking about getting this game.
19486,"Fun game

19487,good
19488,good boi
19489,best game EVER  and if u dont like it well... you are messed up
19490,my fav game yet
19491,Great survival game with some solid exploration and combat mechanics.  Devs are great and really listen and react to community feedback!  Definitely worth the money right now and I'm excited to see where we end up!
19492,"Amazing game! Some optimization issues that you can expect from a early access game, but if you had a love for lego as a child, and like survival games, this game is a perfect mix. LOVE IT!"
19493,"Far far too much of the progression of this game is hidden. It should be called ""wtf am I supposed to do next?"""
19494,"This is by far my favorite game. Beautiful art style, amazing mechanics, and overall good fun. This will probably stay as my favorite for a while because it's still being updated."
19495,I GOT 2125 HOURS
19496,.
19497,"Great game! I only wish my computer could handle it. If it could, I'd be on it 50 times more than I am."
19498,   One of the best EA games going. The creativity is endless and now with survival mode even more challenging.
19499,car
19500,"Just a few major bugs, some collision physics, and polish is needed still but overall solid game.  One of the best survival / builder games i have ever played for longer periods of time and still have infinite possibilities to continue to figure out.  Highly recommend this game to anyone.  Multi-player, in my opinion, is the way to go but still loads of fun with designing, engineering, and then actually building said ""machines"" for the needs you have.  Fantastic work and I look forward to new and updated content."
19501,Very Fun!
19502,"it's okay i guess, but it gets boring over time"

It has been in Beta for a few years, other than that great game!"

10/10 would buy it myself.
Please come back and play it with me again. This is more fun together."

19565,super game
19566,I got this game when the survival update came out and I have been full-on hooked!
19567,really fun
19568,it is a very fun game
19569,"Minecraft 2.0 in the making.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Multiplayer shenanigans are very entertaining
- Lots of creative engineering -- scratches the same itch as Minecraft redstone creations
- Exploration (but not as good as Minecraft... yet)
- Harvesting/farming (better than Minecraft because you gotta use your brain to think of good ways to cut trees and mine rocks rather than just upgrading your pickaxe)
- Automation (great for farming food, getting better for other things -- very satisfying)
- Base defense (fairly basic so far but made extra fun by the limitless engineering possibilities)

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Optimization (fps drops when there are a ton of robots or a lot of loose objects on the ground)
- Story* (this isn't a story/quest based game so it's not really a con but if you need to be motivated by that kind of stuff, look elsewhere)"
19570,even better than minecraft
19571,SUCH A GREAT GAME
19572,.
19573,its very fun
19574,"Ok so I only played survival which I find should be the meat and potatoes of this game, even though creative lets you build whatever you want. 

Cons: 
*It's very grindy. Like the amount of wood you get from a whole tree seems a little low.
*it doesn't give you and hints or tips as to what to do except for how to grow crops. I had to look things up to figure out what to do. 
*my computer is a beast but I got constant lag spikes. Poorly optimized.
*Water physics don't work right when you want to make a boat
*Obviously missing a lot of content that i'm sure will be added at some point, but for now leaves it feeling a little hollow.

Pros: 
*You can build pretty much whatever you want. Cars, boats, plains, transformers. the only limit (besides a few missing components) is you.
*Whacking farmers in cages around is flipping hilarious.
*it's really cool to solve a problem with your own invention.

Overall. definetly needs some work, especially on performance. Really fun to play with friends though, so at the very least keep an eye on this one.
"
19575,i love it
19576,Survival is alot of fun.
19577,Game fun with stupid physics or glitchy physics 10/10 would recommend
19578,"Unfortunately I can not recommend this game in its current state. I want to start off by saying that I understand it is in alpha but it still needs a lot of work before it's playable, at least in my opinion. It has tons of potential but, there is nothing even close to resembling a tutorial aside from a few vague pictures on the wall of your crashed ship that you only find after putting a fire out, which I only figured out after watching a 30 minute video. There is no sort of crafting help other than telling you what you need off just pictures. No map of any kind. Combat is sloppy, you deal damage but no knock back and the enemies deal tons of damage with tons of knock back. The added difficulty of having half health, water, and food after death is unnecessary. To summarize, great idea of a game, great potential from this point, but if your looking for new game to add to your library to pass some time I would recommend rethinking this one unless you enjoy getting frustrated by lack of simple game mechanics."

19608,does anyone want to trade car mechanic simlator for scrap mechanic
19609,"This is a fun and engaging game that i have spent countless hours playing over the past month, but it is definitely still an early access game. My big complaint is that the survival mode has no real end game to it, and after a while it just gets boring. Maybe if they create a goal like building a space ship to get off the planet or killing some super computer it will be worth putting in more time. 

All in all a fun game, and i don't regret buying it."
19610,"Great fun. Different enough from the similar build games to make it enjoyable. Don't even really notice it's early access (even though it's been around for years). Looking forward to the full release and the extra polish that it will bring, but it's extremely playable now. Would highly recommend."

19615,"Excellent physics!  And fun!  More constructive than combative, but who knew potato guns could be so much fun?"
19616,the game used to run fine but now when i play every once and a while it will cause a blue screen of death and ill have to restart my computer. i know its not that my pc cant handle it. the problem is not my specs
19617,yes big
19618,"Such a great game, i had it for a little past when survival came out and if you cant tell by my ~450 hours that i enjoy the game. my only problem is performence issues, for over 8 months ive been working on a V2 of my cargoplane (in the workshop) and the game is starting to not be able to run at full frames because of it, hate to waste my 8 months of work just cuz its too laggy for people to download"
19619,best building game only problem i have is the game is very unoptimized thats my only problem i have a rig of a machine too 9/10 would recommend
19620,s'ok
19621,"laaaaaag and survival mode is trash its a game about cars not walking if there was going to be survival it should be mad max not joging stimulator 

the lag has signifigantly improved but survival is still trash"
19622,"I can't even begin to explain how amazing this game is. There is plenty to do, there's people to meet, there's a great community and amazing content creators. After playing the game for four years and seeing almost every update. The developers always seemed to bring something new and amazing to the table. Thank you axolot games, me and my friends have had an amazing time with this game and so have many others."
19623,hi
19624,IT IS GRAET
19625,scrap mechanic dont wor with my frends so i cant play with my frends
19626,it so good
19627,Super satisfying building and physics. Like Minecraft on crack.
19628,great game
19629,"So first impressions: I see all the great reviews. So i Purchased it and at first glance there is no description or guidance for new players. so i went for the new survival mode?

it throws you in with no tutorial. there is a ""H"" menu that has some directions on how to rotate items etc but zero info on what the game is about or what you can and can't do etc etc. IT really needs some sort of introductory tutorial. there does not even seem to be a build menu to get a feel for the things you can make?

if this is more like mine craft where is just block based and you can re purpose them., it should be stated someplace i suppose.

adding some agro bots as you walk around does not make it a survival game."
19630,"Great Fun New updates make it less laggy Love it
"
19631,HECK YEAH BROTHER!!!!!
19632,cocol game cuz
19633,play it it's fun
19634,A lot of adventure in survival mode and lots of challenging bots to defeat. When you farm you get a penalty which you have farm bots that come your way to try to defeat you which makes survival more fun and challenging to play. In creative you have infinite things to build and its really fun. Would recommend 10/10
19635,AMAZXINFFFFGGG
19636,"As far as survival goes, right now there are much better choices for this price. Repetitive landscapes, very few enemy types, even the machine creation aspect is actually much mote limitted than I expected. Much dev work is needed for me to truly enjoy and recommend this."
19637,recomended
19638,Very intuitive game that allows a lot of creativity.
19639,"good game
"
19640,awe
19641,"While i love the game, it has a lot of issues
1. There's no map. Obvious deal breaker in most cases, you can get lost etc
2. I need 10 component kits to craft a craftbot, the thing is i found 9 by grinding and after playing for 2 ENTIRE HOURS i couldn't find a SINGLE component kit. Plus the world generation is extremely bad, you might get an ember forest, but you will never find cotton, vice versa, and you might not find either. So far survival is about luck
3. The fact that you need to restore power to a broken ship to craft parts made out of SCRAP is bs, you should be able to craft that in your inventory instead
4. The game is super janky and laggy especially in multiplayer.
5. Although the game is fun in creative, survival gets boring quickly without multiplayer, because you just grind 80% of the time and the other 20% is actually having fun doing whatever.
Those are all the things i do not like about the game
However. I do really love the freedom this game gives you because you can make whatever you want, car? Check. Plane? Check. House? Check. The possibilities are endless and as fun as the game is it is still super janky, as of now i wouldn't recommend it but in 1-3 years i could see myself having fun in this game with friends.
TL:DR: Multiplayer bad, survival bad, go into creative.

Edit: cool they added underground stuff
now fix multiplayer.

Verdict: Don't buy."
19642,"i played a year ago and totally forgot about this game, its pretty fun, i like downloading mods but     there is one thing, it is stupid hard to build crap when you dont know how, i totally recommend this game but it should have tutorials :|"
19643,Like)
19644,great game recomended  for people who have creativity and like survival games
19645,Its fun to build in this
19646,"its AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING

19647,"its fun, and that's it"
19648,Y
19649,the game is fantastic and fun!!
19650,"lahlahlah
"
19651,The game is very buggy and mulitplayer is even more buggy. They had like 4 years of making a good survival version of the game and they did a bad job at it.
19652,yay
19653,cool
19654,"Goofy physics, multiplayer, an underrated gem."
19655,"A fun little builder game, looking forward to the finished product.  The developers listen and are doing a great job!"
19656,its to cool
19657,"It's to the developers of the game. Hi, I have such a problem, he doesn't bother me, but I'll fix it. Always when I turn off the game, I get a notification that there was a game crash and that I was forced out when I closed the game with the exit button"
19658,"fun
"
19659,It's great and is exactly what you think it is.
19660,This game is good.
19661,good
19662,"its a great game, crashes often but still great game i am a workshop kinda guy so i don,t build by my self."
19663,This is a fantastic survival/building game. You can create so many things. The survival mode is my favorite. The devs keep adding better features to the game all the time. I cant wait to see what they add next.
19664,"Don't get me wrong, I love the concept and game itself. However, it crashes to desktop every 30 minutes and it's getting exhausting. Submitted MANY bug splat reports. I'll be back after future patches to see if this issue gets resolved."
19665,I like this game and the mod support makes it even better!
19666,"Super cool, I loved the creative long ago, but this new survival mode is awesome. Better than Minecraft, The Forest and other survival craft-games --- super awesome while its still in early access! Best 20 euros spent."
19667,yes
19668,"great
"
19669,Is good game esspecially with friends
19670,great game
19671,This game is so addicted
19672,Lots of fun! Everything i payed for and more
19673,"I only focus on the survival mode in this review, since that is the reason me a apparently a ton of other people bought or came back to this game.

I played the survival mode for a good 10 hours, but to be honest after 5 you've seen everything it has to offer. While the world itself is pretty you do realize quick that there is nothing to find or see. Every point of interest is extremely boring in design and there is like 3-4 designs that keep repeating all over the map. The POI are just some lazy created tower with nothing to find but some boxes. There is afaik 4 different enemy types in the game and the fighting in the game is awful, its basically walking backwards and left clicking at all time.

The vehicle building is find and while there is not really much you can do in terms of variety it is good enough for some cool creations. One big Problem tho with the cars you can build is, that they all drive pretty bad, they flip over and get stuck on hills etc. The wacky driving is fun ... like really fun in the beginning but when you start to realize you not getting a normal working car ever, its getting pretty annoying.
One of my biggest issue in the Survival mode is the gasoline you need for the cars, it is a pain in the *** to collect it in the first place, being underwater for 20 minutes to manually collect oil is so tedious, what it makes even worse is that even if you collect 100 oil you can drive around for like 10 minutes before running out of gas, since the engines need so much of it  even if you upgrade them to lvl 5 and you have to do that really early on, otherwise it is basically not possible to drive cars. The base building  need IMHO to much Ressource that's why we skipped all together, we just build a little fence around the farm but that's about it. 
Another big problem is,  if you want to explore the world you barely have time to do so, between the endless amount of oil and driving around, the enemy's will attack your food pretty frequently, which makes you drive back and forth all the time, its not like there IS anything to see or explore, but you wont know that before you checked it out.

Over all the game (survival mode) has potential, but at the moment it is mediocre at best, i would love to give a mixed review but if i have to choose between recommend and not recommend it will be not recommend for now.

PS: They changed the amount of oil you get per source, that might makes it a bit more bearable but it wont change the whole picture."
19674,Super fun and survivival looks sick!
19675,yus amazing game
19676,eaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaaeeaearfgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggge
19677,"It took a long time, but they came through with survival mode. In a time when it's incredibly easy for developers to take the money and run, Axolot put their heads down and worked. It's paid off hugely."
19678,this game = good =3
19679,this is one of the most creative and yet fun game i have ver played yes it may seem hard at first but once you put 1 and 2 together its quite easy to make things
19680,dope game
19681,meh
19682,so fun
19683,Love it very educational
19684,It's very fun and you can build pretty much anything if you get the right mods (the mods are incredibly easy to install too)
19685,FUn
19686,"fun and engaging. the amount of creativity this game allows is leaps ahead of most looter survival games out there
"
19687,"fun but need a good cpu can play if you lower the graphic enough if not. but still fun and the combat is good. hard to figure out how to make the steering work but again, you get a hang of it. all around a fun and amazing game."
19688,"I loved this game its been 3 days and I love the game!
"
19689,YES
19690,"Deceptively deep. Make a car with 4 wheels, make a car with 18 wheels and double wishbone suspension. And everything in between. It is a rocket car ride into survival that does NOT hold your hand."
19691,"At this point of its development its just terrible. There is very little logic to it. Only being able to use a bucket or water cannon to water plants is just plan stupid. You can't even drink water. If you create a pump with a container, you can't use the water obtained from the pump directly on your plants. All pipes in the game, except vacuum pipes, are just decor. No function. The vacuum pipes require crazy material so you wont be laying pipes across the map to bring water anywhere. 
You can spend hours GRINDING for material to build a car only to have something come along and destroy it leaving you with nothing to show for the time you just spent grinding. Beta or not, the devs show little concern for the players time. Not for me."
19692,it is fun and i like how you can make stuff.
19693, good
19694,good game just wish that the creative mode would have some more items from survival and also a bigger map. for the survival I would love some new creatures in survival.
19695,GREAT GAME BUY IT NOW
19696,Nice game !
19697,This game is amazing i would highly recommend if you like to build things if you like Minecraft this games survival mode is slightly similar.
19698,"There are still some minor issues that can be expected, but overall the game play and the world are great."
19699,Illegitimate child of Kerbal and Minecraft. Absolutely worth it.
19700,"As it is right now it is rather good, altought it would be appreaciated less grinding (apart from what has already been done) and hopefully it is jut a matter of time for them to put more and more content. Like maybe some sort of ending, or a simple story."
19701,"Highly recommend this creative progressive crafting survival game. Your imagination is the limit. However, sometimes there's a glitch happening at the packaging plants. Everything will be open and lit up green and centered for packaging, but the packaging plant will not take the designated plant to package. The plant will shoot out of the large chest and be destroyed. PLEASE FIX this packaging plant glitch to allow plants to be packaged when every component is green and or the cage is open."
19702,"Highly recommended, great gameplay and creativity, My only complaint with this game is the packing plant glitch, making it difficult or sometimes impossible to pack fruits or vegetables to trade with the farmer. I still recommend this game because I wouldn't say its unplayable, just a major annoyance. Once the glitch is fixed, I give this game a 10/10"
19703,sure i will post a review
19704,"Its a lot of fun
"
19705,a really fun game
19706,"Honestly this game is just pure fun. The art style is amazing, however the female characters don't look unique enough from the male characters. So that was a bit saddening. Also maybe have something where if you hover over an ingredient you need for a crafting item, it tells you? I had to use Google so many times earlier, because I didn't know what I needed."
19707, This game is like MINECRAFT!You compete you're mind!
19708,Gg
19709,"is a nice game

19710,it's an a amazing game
19711,no

19713,Good game very grindy
19714,you can custom build so much shit in this game!
19715,i like this game a lot.
19716,amazing game very mutch worth it
19717,fun platfor for creativity
19718,"bit of fun, worth the money, nice easy creative game."
19719,very fun game. love survival mode. u can do almost anything in this game.
19720,it is very brainy but it is so addicting
19721,"The game is still in development, but the updates and feature recently has made me hooked to the game. Spending hours in Survival mode, putting your creations against hostile robots and terrain really pushes my levels of creativity. Although there a few bugs and also concerns with lag when creations get too complicated, hopefully the dev can fix those in time."
19722,very epic
19723,"I bought this because a survival mechanic was added. After playing this for a little while I realized that the survival mechanic was poor at best and not very deep. This is a game that does not respect your time and makes things tedious from the beginning so that upgrades become meaningful. I feel that this is just poor game design.

Additionally the base mechanics of the game aren't that great either. The vehicles you create do not feel right and often times require an insane amount of effort. If you are looking for a good game where you can do stuff with your creations take a look at Stormworks: Build & Rescue. I feel that that game is superior in everyway.

Regret not refunding this. If you despite this review still want to buy, wait for sale. It is not worth more than 40% of its asking price. I appreciate that the devs delivered on their promise, but that is about the only positive thing I can say."
19724,"I like the game mechanics and the gameplay of this game, but it still has some bugs that i hope are going to be fixed soon"
19725,yes
19726,great game
19727,it is really fun
19728,great game!! love playing it.
19729,big brian
19730,poggers bread
19731,"this game is EXTREMELY fun! but only when you are playing with other people, otherwise, its jusst more frustrating than anything. i would recommend it, but not unless you have someone elso to play it with you
overall rating 8/10
"
19732,Fun game needs a lot of polish but there is a load of potential here
19733,"Best sandbox ever, lack a history/objective yet but I recommend!!!"
19734,Good shit
19735,nice game.
19736,so much fun!!!
19737,"Survival mode is hot garbage. Very little polish, feels more like a side mode than the intended mode for long term play."
19738,"tis game fun.. yes yes, good play"
19739,"No real direction when playing the game. Advanced enough to colonize a foreign planet but yet not enough to develop a map. Respawning really sucks when exploring a new area where mobs kill you. Would be nice if foliage actually provided the same blinding effect to the robots as it does to us. These are supposed to be farming bots gone rogue, right? So why would they be equipped with infrared sight to see our body temp?

Besides all that, it is actually a fun game once you figure stuff out and get your spud gun. Would recommend finding the farmer first."
19740,i reccomend it because it a fun interesting game with a ton of potential
19741,;0000)
19742,"is good
"
19743,good fun
19744,This is so amazing. Its a mechanically inclined minecraft or something. I cannot get enough of this game.
19745,"The game is absolutly still in development but overall a fun experience.  Expect to have lag.  Expect to lose your world and have to restart. Expect all the things that come with a game that is actively being developed. That said, tons of fun to be had"
19746,great game
19747,You make scrap into scrap that moves
19748,"Less developed than I thought it was. Maybe there's some fun gameplay to be had somewhere, but there's just no direction for the player in survival mode. No tutorial to help you get started, no goals or objectives for you to pursue... You're just thrown into it with no clue what you're supposed to do. Feels like they took sandbox mode, slapped on health/thirst/hunger and then limited your resources. There's nothing to work with."
19749,Very fun to build vehicles though there are some grindy aspects still very fun to farm and do other things
19750,dw
19751,lag

19760,great
19761,Fun and inventive
19762,cool game for kids
19763,Cool
19764,"As far as survival games go, so far this is the best I've played. Kinda mix of Don't starve and Minecraft, you can build, craft, grow, and be hunted down by mobs hellbent on your destruction for hours. No limit besides your imagination on what you can create, and with the game physics, there are consequences when you mess up your engineering.

Overall, I love the game, and highly recommend it for anyone and everyone. Even for children, especially if they have a knack for being creative."

19766,FUN!!!!!!!!

.....7 hours later"
19774,Yes
19775,goooooooooooooooood game
19776,It is very creative and a wonderfull game!!
19777,bery fun
19778,"Very neat lego game. I started survival at early access launch and it shows a lot in how far it still needs to go, but the framework is there. Once it has the balance settled in, the poor optimization handled, and more content to play with it'll be a near perfect lego game."
19779,"I love this game and is more than worth the money.
"
19780,its a good gameand its getting updates  so i always enjoy a good update
19781,This is a very fun sandbox game where you can build whatever your hearts desire. I've been playing this game before the tile builder and spud gun. It was a sight to see when survival came out. Because i have over 1000 hours in this game i this point I think the game deserves it. There are updates coming and coming it is wonderful. This game has everything you can wish for and has been really fun now survival came out. So now the game is gaining more and more popularity I think this is the time to leave a review. I have a lot of joy playing this game and I would recommend it for everyone!
19782,"Awesome Game! Wanting to see the future ahead of this game. Well Done Axolot, you always give really good games, such as Raft too!"
19783,"Creative was great but survival is so much better. It has it's problems at the moment, some bugs here and there, but it improves with every update and there is a page for reporting bugs to help the process along. If you find a bug, report it, politely, with as much info as possible and your PC spec, help the Devs make this game perfect. We waited a long time for this and it was worth it."
19784,"survival mode is BRILLIANT, I love it."
19785,fun game
19786,super fun and better with friends
19787,good game
19788,YES! it is so fun
19789,"this game is so fun, like"
19790,"I was so excited to hear this game had put out a survival mode.  I think creative modes for these types of games are great, but I usually spend the vast majority of my time in the mode with progression and basic gameplay objectives.  Unfortunately survival mode is really underbaked.  You literally can't craft anything unless you know to walk about 15 mins in a specific direction to find one of the two special buildings that allow you to craft.  Its like if minecraft only had two workbenches and they were placed by world gen and you could never move them and the game never even mentions that they are out there.  I'm sorry that is unforgivable game design.  I'll be back when they've improved things."
19791,"Build stuff. then do other stuff i guess. if that's your thing, then this game is for you."
19792,Love this game!
19793,best game ever
19794,first month good but after that you would like a refund
19795,arne
19796,this the best game in my library
19797,Good
19798,"pretty good, survival mode has some non game-breaking bugs that are annoying tho. pretty fun!"
19799,"Sure creative allows you to build cool stuff, but ""survival"" is just... sad. The story isn't terrible, but doesn't seem really well thought out. 
You're an engineer sent to repair a bunch of murderous farmbots. Okay, not bad. 
They've kidnapped farmers. Okay cool. 
There's one lone guy on the map that will buy boxes of packaged food and sell you spud guns? Seriously? That's what they come up with for an economy system and to gate the weapons? Okay, I guess we can work with that. 
By the way, nearly everything you build or upgrade will require a component that only sometimes drops from bots and can be found randomly in loot boxes. Hurgh. That's frustrating.
Oil can only be acquired manually by swimming in the water. Whatever. 
Engines guzzle fuel like no tomorrow. Are you freaking kidding me?
You're basically tethered to the engineer shop once you find it, at least for quite some time while you try build every buildbot.
Clothing is locked behind yet another grind for a crop you can't grow and a random ""lockbox"" unlock to get the clothing items. 
There's even more minor issues that just make survival a tedious grind without any real direction (ever hear of a map? Not here.) I'm sure there are a lot of people that enjoy it, but I just can't get past how much of a chore it is to actually play survival."
19800,Amazing creative and survival game. It does cost a bit but it is worth it. Kind of like minecraft
19801,","
19802,Love This Game
19803,"Oh, okay... 38h. I got it this week.

Is this my day job now?"
19804,very great yes indeed yee
19805,Fun
19806,The game is mostly about creativity and the fact of limitless posibilities. If you like a game with a defined perpose then this game is not for you.
19807,"FUN GAME, VERY EASY TO GET LOST IN IT LOL!!"
19808,Creative
19809,Great would recommended to every one

19811,"My first 2 hours was so sluggish due to the fact that I actually had to learn in order to play it. I went from considering a refund thinking I wouldn't have that much fun to having a full fledged base built into a mechanics shop containing multiple cars (each with varying uses), a bar (with a bathroom), and an indoor farm. 

There are some performance issues where the game is loading the map and it's pretty hindering. You can just be enjoying a Sunday drive and suddenly the FPS drops to 10 for like 5 seconds as it loads the next chunk, this happens a lot when you are traveling near any length. 

Also, for some reason it's by far one of the quietest games I've ever played. I have to play at near max volume  with both my computer and my headset just to have levels normal sounding (and yes, the audio options were maxed). If the devs can crank up the decibels to double or let us turn up the volume past 100 that would be really nice.

This game is definitely worth a try because it's slow burn learning curve is really rewarding as you go.

Pro tip: back away as you swing at the Hay Bots."
19812,Great game but don't get potato hardware to run it. i  have a ryzen 7 3800x and an x570 gaming x from gigabyte buuuuuut a radeon hd 7000. my rtx 2080 super is in the mail. 5/5 stars. although i'm on update 0.4.9 i that up to date? i'm new to steam just finished my build.
19813,Fun
19814,great game. shit networking
19815,"this game is an amazing sandbox ,mostly in creative not in survival, it feels like one them android ripoffs"
19816,great
19817,"Great game however

fps drop is horrible once you start build more complex creations, 
this game needs to be optimized before i come back

keep an eye on this but dont buy yet

"
19818,"Wrap a fat head, load up SM, get creative."
19819,"Full disclosure: played the survival platform for over 80 hrs. & enjoyed it for the most part. The reason for the down vote is for the lack of support for a crash. While I did enjoy the game, it isn't much to me to be forced to start at the beginning again of a game that is rather grindy, takes lots of hrs to get even small amount of resources to even build anything. So no support to get back the game I put several hrs into that has no reason to crash or reload in the first place (just stopped while getting resources, of course). It still works...I can start another, do creative mode, etc. but I can't get the back I wasn't finished with in the first place. There are balance issues in the survival mode that I ignored but rubbed me the wrong way...fuel for vehicles go very quickly and it's a lot of man hrs to collect the oil then refine it. Best upgrade your engine to max to help with that. If you were to build a 2 bedroom, one bathroom brick house in real life...you'd be done with it quicker than in the game for the amount of time required to get the resources, refine resources into the materials required (bricks came from one material of another resource to make it, etc.) Some might like this, more power to you...hope it doesn't crash while in the middle of adding the roof to the building cause you're starting over."

19822,"Big Fun with friends small fun by self. so alone by self. so pointless by self. don't be by self, be with friend. :)"
19823,Very good set of tools for creative building. A chill building experience with a touch of danger. Lots of potential for further improvement.
19824,.
19825,My son 8 years old love this game. I think as a parent i recommend this game for kids to build their logical thinking.
19826,Its
19827,Still lots to come but its a grate game as is .
19828,good
19829,"I'm pretty casual gamer with very casual gear.  As a mechanical engineer, I love this game so much despite some simplifications that could be exploited.  I love its design, it's attention to detail.  This game brings me back to being a child when I just build/draw whatever is in my imagination.  With years of rigorous training in engineering, you kinda lose that creativity a little bit. This game has brought that back for me.  On top of that, I love that this game's physics is robust enough that my professional knowledge kinda still applies! Can't wait to see how far the devs can take this game, keep up the great work!"
19830,1
19831,"So far I've only played survival mode, there is still much that could be added but it's already quite fun."
19832,this game is a game tath i wod wakmand
19833,Awesome game play killed by crippling lag. After you build a few items the game will slow to an unplayable crawl.  Still a work in progress.
19834,Yes This is a game that at first seems similar to minecraft but is actually lots more than just blocks and is one of a kind it may only be in beta but trust me it is fully ready to play
19835,yes
19836,yes
19837,"Its a pretty fun game, especially if you like building."
19838,"game was quiet fun until they claimed a bunch of fixes to the lag issues while playing with friends 82 hours into the game and now i cant even load into a friends world without constant crashes as soon as i get in. not a game i would tell anyone to buy due to there horrible job at trying to fix any real problems, i will say the mechanics of the game were cool until all these problems started to be a constant thing happening every time i log in"
19839,Awsome game built solme fun things to play with check my workshop this game is so fun!!!!!!!!!
19840,u can build your imaginaion
19841,"such a fun adn creative game

19846,It's really fun and to be honest survival mode Is my favorite part
19847,amazing game
19848,"It's incredibly fun with friends. The physics engine is complex, though it needs some work in terms of fps optimization in certain areas."
19849,"Multiplayer is fun in this game, the rag-doll physics are just hilarious. And the core gameplay loop is also good i guess."
19850,DIS GAMEEEEEEEEEEEE GLOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD BPOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
19851,very fun would recommend
19852,"So much potential for survival but much much more polish needed.

I really liked the idea of building all kinds of machines, but when it comes to wood cutting and mining with machines the ground is like ice.  Its a constant battle to farm resources with the tires side slipping non-stop, and it makes tree cutting and mining not fun unless you weld your machine to the ground.  When you weld to the ground you have to get out and farm the stone and wood by hand because of your machines limited mobility, if you're doing that why make a machine?

I can live with some of the other minor things, but this issue makes the core game play unfun.  If this issue were fixed I would 100% love the game."
19853,"very nice
"
19854,I would highly recommend this game. The only problem I have with it is little glitches that happen here and there. Right now it is a game that is still in progress.
19855,BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19856,this is fun
19857,"this is a good game
"
19858,"After 50+ hours of playing, I can say that it is a really fun game to play. Survival is fun, but there is a lot of room for additional stuff. Personally, I feel as though the day / night cycle goes by too fast. Day being 20 mins long and night being 4 mins. They also need to increase bot rate or add different types of bots. I would like to see more bots out on patrol, or increase the rate the more days you survive. Just some of my suggestions! All and all the game is really fun and I can not wait to see what the future holds for it!"
19859,"MORE EZ ROBOTS FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME! A pitchfork and a walking taser ain't gonna cut it. MORE MELEE WEAPONS! Tired of sledge hammer combat? ME 2! CRAFTABLE RANGED WEAPONS! Fuck those shitty store bought potato guns, a real mechanic makes HIS OWN FUCKING GUNS! DO IT!
Thx for the lovely game I love it and it's great."
19860,tfcr
19861,fun
19862,"Great game overall has a few optimmastion bugs that keeps chucks loaded too long in survival but an overall amazing game that has helped me cope and have fun, I can't wait to see what else the dev's add and bring to this already amazing game"
19863,"Yeah, it's pretty good. I bought it aeons ago in very EA and thought it was pretty niffty then (like so many that never really make it), and have just recently booted it up much later with a ton of updates and Survival Mode.

Wow, great grind! This game actually broke my ""Gamer's Block"" (ageing with young kids). Nice one (:"
19864,No incremental game saving. If it crashes you will lose hours of play without any way to recover.
19865,yes
19866,its a good survival game with an addicting wave system
19867,yes
19868,"Kind of boring. Wold design is meh, crafting is okay, graphics are nothing new. Main missing feature is purpose (survival).. There's nothing to do. Exploring is really boring with nothing interesting to find but generic structures and the same 2 enemy mobs over and over. Buy this only if you enjoy playing with vehicle building. Survival needs a LOT of work to make it even remotely entertaining. I haven't played the other modes, was only interested in survival."
19869,Where in the HELL did this game COME FROM??? Aliens at work! if I had two computers I would buy it twice.
19870,"I was introduced to Scrap Mechanic, by Splitsie and Capac of The youtube channel ""Flipsie"".
It runs famously on my ~10yr comp with a GTX960, 16 Gig of Ram. I dunno if the game auto detects hardware, but the default settings were good as is. The tutorial, and actual introduction to survival; was really, quite well done imo. The game is interesting without being 24/7 chaos. After watching 4 youtube episodes, I was sold on the game... an for 21$ not on sale, personally I believe it's still worth it. The distinct lack of Ghosting (Starmade), Texture failures (7Days to Die), or klang (Space Engineers), leads me to believe they are on to something with this. I wanna see what they do in the future."
19871,this game is fucking cool and will make you creative and you will have fun
19872,GOOD GAME
19873,"Simply amazing.

Extremely charming, extremely original, a super fresh take on the survival-genre that manages to both be familiar as well as endearing and before you'll know you'll have spent a dozen hours of your time trying to make the perfect Pizzaburger"
19874,very nice
19875,play
19876,m
19877,good game
19878,its fun
19879,i like this game because i can just build anything that i can imagine so it takes all those ideas that have just been building up inside my head and lets them free
19880,"Incredibly fun game but after my server has fundamentally broken twice now I can't recommend this game. It is easily the buggiest mess I have ever played. First time there were numerous people falling through the world after glitching inside a warehouse elevator. This caused my server to crash on start up 100% of the time. The only way we fixed it was having a computer science buddy of mine edit the save file and delete individual objects 1 by 1, trial and error, until the server loaded again.

The 2nd time was 2 days ago. I simply tried to put a chest down on my car, and the chest vanished. Tried another chest, same deal. I am now unable to pick anything large up(aka all of the items that slow your movement when being held) and the game is acting like I am constantly holding something(my thirst is constantly draining). I don't feel like going through all of the effort to fix their problems for them again, so that's it for me.

Like I said, great game. Can easily dump hundreds of hours into, but the fact that you are one interaction away from completely breaking your character or server at any given time is a total deal breaker for me. They seem to be keeping up with regular updates, but this is ridiculous. 

Aside from all of that, this game NEEDS dedicated servers. If you play with even 2 people on a server and try to go and do your own thing, expect massive frame drops. There is so so so much cleaning up to do with this game, it is really disappointing."
19881,.
19882,FRIGGEN AMAZING. 210 hours well spent and millions of more hours
19883,This is fantastic when you get into it. I enjoy the vehicle building and problem solving.
19884,its ok ig
19885,"(I've only played survival in single player) 
I've never loved and hated something at the same time until now. I wish there was a neutral recommendation or a ""wait until further updates"" option but there's only a Yes or No and right now it's a No. 
As much promise as the game shows it fails completely in just about ten other ways.
You need to do some absurd things to collect even the most basic items and for some you'll spend more and more time grinding over and over just to gather enough to build something that makes it slightly easier to do the next time but the next time you'll need 50% more of that stuff to do the next thing so no matter how efficient you become you'll always feel like you're doing allot of busy work with very little time for messing around and having a little fun, your only reward for grinding warehouses which are the games stand-in for end game dungeons is a good 2-4 hours of being killed over and over just to get to the treasure room and be rewarded with a few items you probably had in your inventory already and the satisfaction of knowing you'll never get that time you wasted back. I got some basic level car suspension parts and some food for my last warehouse run and the other time before that i did the 5 level warehouse and got an epic level garment box that gave me a T-shirt. Not a T-shirt with some kind of buff... no... just a plain ole' T-shirt. Not even a ""I wasted 4 hours on this warehouse and all i got was this lousy T-shirt"" T-shirt.... Just a T-shirt. 

That kind of sums up this game right now.
 
Perhaps it will get better but instead of trying to make it better the devs are too busy ""fixing"" issues like nerfing respawn beds rather then giving people proper online servers or fixing the countless list of game breaking bugs like the one that makes you drown while walking on land. 

That's why it's a negative review right now, i hope it will get better and be worth it, i really do, it's got so much potential to be a fantastic game but right now it's not."
19886,Good
19887,i cant get enough of this game i unfortunately cant play as much as id like but when i have the free time to play anything i go for this one especially now with survival and challenge modes
19888,da survival mode is a little scary cuz of the robots but thats probably cuz im a scardy cat tho but still Super fun
19889,FUN
19890,"This game is awsome but it is so buggy.  And yes I know it is in ""Beta""  but I did have to pay for it....  so I expect some level of playability especially in multiplayer."
19891,cool game no i'm not a bot...
19892,very fun game
19893,it is fun
19894,its jun when you know what you are doing
19895,"Difficult to get used to, but truly amazing! :)
You can do so much with this game."
19896,CLASS
19897,"Really cool, really good, and can be on really any PC with out crashing."
19898,"This game is infuriating, and terribly unbalanced. I also have more seeds than I know what to do with. The bots are overpowered, especially when they hunt in herds.
It‚Äôs hard to navigate the map. Essentially since my map is basically Endor. Just when I think I‚Äôm going in a straight line, I‚Äôm attacked, get turned around, and just like that, I‚Äôm lost. The game could use a map, or coordinates, or just a compass.
The grind is a pain, even with a saw and drills. I‚Äôm tired of my builds getting randomly attacked. Fighting off bots is hard when you‚Äôre not used to keyboard controls. 
Not to mention, the game is still glitchy. I‚Äôll go off to take the car, only to find that steering is disconnected, or the car drives itself with me in it, or half the lights on the car are out  even though they were connected to the same switch.
This is not a game for casual gamers."
19899,Scrap Mechanic is a fun entertaining game for all ages. Create your wildest dreams and watch as they come to life. Survival mode is new and a great addition to this game.
19900,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
19901,"This game is amazing.  Even it early access, Scrap Mechanic is still more polished than some games after release.  Don't get me wrong, there are definitely bugs and the physics are wonky as hell...but this is some of the most fun I've had playing a video game in a long time.  Do recommend."
19902,Yes SM is so good
19903,Neat game

19905,"This game is for the mechanics and engineers out there.  The potential this game delivers as is will allow you to build almost anything you can imagine and how well you can figure out the complex system you wish to create.  Test and retest the build until you get it right with the games internal mechanics, (no pun intended).  As always, Mods will enhance the experience.  Until the official release of this game, is it worth buying, trying out, and creating crazy contraptions... ?  Yes, for the short term.  

Creative:  yep... just what you thought. 

Survival:  Meh... Still too early for a decent review for survival.


Wait until the Devs optimize this game and add a bunch of things to do.
Don't make a lot of vehicles or any kind of medium to big base... the frame rate will discourage you, that's if you can stand it so low as it is in the current state.  How unfortunate."

19922,"great game, hoping that the devs keep pushing updates and adding content. desperately need an in game map or some way to mark locations other than leaving a bag from death everywere"
19923,"Fantastic game with alot of room for improvement physics wise. there is alot of issues with anything with 8 or more moving joints especially if its heavy!

If you like building working contraptions it does not get any more fun then this game"
19924,"A broken Game, always lagging ,crashing ,limited content . after 500 hours i feels like its a  waste of  time, specially when its been out since 2016 and its 2021 yet still the same issues . if feels like a scam they took our money for a broken unfinished waste of time game."
19925,it is a exellentgame
19926,Amazing.  Like minecraft but with incredible vehicle building and physics
19927,i found a GAME
19928,"Survival is a great game!
Yes, the game has bugs, some very anoing, such as suspension bugs or some bugs related to pistons. Performance problems are especially true with very complex mechanisms, but the developers fix it and receive regular updates.
But the game contains so many layers - you want to be a farmer, build and develop a farm, make automatic farms. Whether you want adventures, raids on robots, or want sharp feelings raid to warehouses and fighting farmbots, or create sophisticated mechanisms and machines that will help you gather resources or simply travel around a world that is not small and reveal simply beautiful views."
19929,its epic
19930,Game is broken. Not worth trying.
19931,"Its a fun and simple game, a great entry level game for a fun build and grind fps game, if you like to build neat and creative things this game is great! and at its current price its worth it.

That said, I can't recommend it, due to a game breaking bug it has currently, which is, if you crash while in the elevator during a warehouse run, the game will bug and when you load back in, you'll be stuck, unless of course if you enable cheats, which then will make your game unjoinable by friends, thus making it pointless to unlock outfits, which is sort of the point of warehouses, so, I ran into this bug, and well 73 hours down the drain until this fix this bug."
19932,fun game
19933,i love it it is the best game in the world
19934,its fun but buggie
19935,Survival is boring and was added way too late to the game. This is why you don't buy early access games. 3/10 wouldn't recommend.
19936,Still a beta product after all these years. Survival mode is pointless.
19937,"Tons of fun solo, but even more with friends. Survival mode is great and would recommend to anyone who has experience with Minecraft or enjoys a game that is relaxing yet mentally challenging at times."
19938,"This game is early in is development still however, It has replaced Minecraft for me, and that's saying something because that has been my go to game since it was in beta 1.4... Scrap Mechanic? MORE LIKE SIMP MATERIAL! THIS GAME IS THE GREATEST THING EVER AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE YOU AND EVERYONE YOU KNOW IS WRONG. #this post has been approved by the national academy of social propaganda."

19954,"how to play scrap mechanic (creative):
-build a car
-you fucked up the wiring, you fuck everything up, no one loves you.
-fix car
-car actually drives
-drive around like a boss for 10 seconds
-flip car
-try to improve the engineering
-flip car
-try to drive better
-flip car
-follow tutorials
-flip car
-cry."
19955,"Cute fun building game with excellent physics.
Brilliant survival mode!"
19956,thebest game in the world
19957,"Good game, but I can not recomend this yet.
Main issue is it needs alot of optimisations, lag when people die in dungeons lag when bots attack farm and lag when nothing seams to be going on. And alot more adding to be considerd a full game in survival. For some reason all blocks from creative cant be made and there is no sloped or curved blocks."
19958,yes
19959,I think this game is great if you like survival games and creative games like Minecraft.
19960,great game but my experiences have been 50-50 because it crashes a lot but this is maybe because i am running it on 4GB of RAM and you need 8GB of Ram
19961,Its nice u can build things
19962,"i wish scrap mechanic would have the option of keep inventory but it is still a very good game
"
19963,"Great game, they need to try to optimize and fix collision errors on the physics engine before adding more though. It limits your creations to some extent. That said, I've had a blast playing and learning and I've already gotten value out of the game."
19964,No in game review requests.
19965,Bought this for offline gameplay; Been really enjoying the survival mode! it makes it much easier to learn the game ironically since you don't get overwhelmed with so many options right off the bat :)
19966,very fun to play with friends :)
19967,"All I can say is: This game is a Survival/Creative/Sandbox game. Creative for people who don't like limitations, Survival for people who like resource collecting, and it's sandbox, so you can basically do anything with the things you have access to, you can make a car with wheels made out of boots. And you can upload your creations to the Steam Workshop. The only reason I recommend it is because the survival update came out after 4 years."
19968,"In my opinion this game is so funny when you play with your friends.
I recommend!"
19969,Cool sandbox game with strong survival elements. The world is procedurally generated so your world is completely unique. If you are clever enough you can build pretty much anything. There's plenty inside this game to keep you entertained for a very long time. It's still in EA so its a bit buggy and laggy especially if you build too many complicated machines. It's both intense and fun to explore the dangerous world and the game incentivises you to go out and explore and build machines to go places and collect resources
19970,great game 100% worth the money for it it is hard to get good at tho
19971,haha funny robot go brrrrrrr
19972,it is a very cool game
19973,It is very gooooooooooood
19974,wwwwww
19975,"if you like minecraft, creating stuff, ... then Scrap is the next game you NEED to play!"
19976,yes
19977,"There are a lot of bugs and fps drops too much (especially in multiplayer). Developers aren't fixing the most important problems and try adding more things.

19979,Took a little while to get into it but its fun asides from the hunger and hydration always depleting so fast but its fun and enjoyable. Only thing that can hold you back is your creativity. :)
19980,fun
19981,"i really love the endless possibilities of this game the sky really is the limit . and its also very educational in the way the that the logic gates work as its the same as how real electronics work in real life. and theres just so much interesting and exiting things to learn and discover especialy now that there has been the new survival game mode added it really does top the game off and i highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in building, electronics or mechanical building and tinkering or anything around those genres."
19982,"hehe 420 hours played....
:)"
19983,i love this game but in survival is bugs.in water you gone use thraster
19984,Its like minecraft for adults. I love that the blocks are smaller so that I can get creative when building a house or garage as far as making one wall for the exterior and a painted all for the interior. Minecraft needs to take notes on that. Also making vehicles or mechanical machines is pretty fun to play around with.
19985,verygud
19986,Scrap Mechanic is a very fun game it hasn't had an update for a few years but Survival brings a lot of joy to the players of Scrap Mechanic.
19987,ok
19988,laggy af a piece of crap
19989,"this is amazing
"
19990,a good game to play
19991,"This game is so fun. It has a mixture of creativity and survival, that is if you play on the new survival worlds. And the fact that the game so uniquely brings out the inner engineer in us all is so fun. I love creating inventions in creative because I can build what I want, and I love building creations in survival because they have a use and you get the feeling of fulfillment when your creations work correctly. I mean it's like you com home to the impossible flavor of your own completion, come home to Simple Rick's.


You see. Yoos see what i did

its 
its allusion
its alluding to Rick and Morty you pleb"
19992,YES
19993,Nice
19994,A fun sandbox game with endless possibilities for hours of fun. The long awaited survival mode makes the game 10x better.
19995,"hmmm yes very glitch hmmmm
"
19996,ass
19997,its awsome
19998,"Okay, I purchased this game around may 22, been playing since the day after, and by jeebzus, is it addicting, I normally rather doing school work (NEEEERRD!!!) But, ever since I bought this game, I've been playing till I cant no more. Like, look at how long I've played, 169 hours, around 4 days? Yeah, I'm addicted"
19999,"It is a deceptively fun and challenging game which combines survival, exploration, and building into a wonderful time. I have played and looked up at the time on more than one occasion to see that several hours had passed without my realizing it."
20000,"GOOD CREATIVE GAME
"
20001,Amazing.
20002,basically engineering paradise
20003,"A lot of fun, can really let your imagination go."
20004,"i love the new update it is amazing plus i love the cows they are cute :3
"
20005,"I needed to edit my review as of the official release of 4.6. 

The games net code has finally been stabilized to an effect where me and a large party of 4-8 players in any given world can play. For early access the current game is a very solid experience. My only gripe is the world is vast but not deep. There is a lot of land where you will traverse but you won't stay or even explore, and if you explore you will know what to expect or be disappointed by the lack of unique rewards. There is a good amount of scrap towns, ruins, and unique biomes with their own identifying challenges, but these zones don't entice you to explore and often are just another part of the scenery as you chew up the road.

-Suggestion to fix this; in certain procedurally generated areas that are rare have more items like lockers, etc. (basically the materials seen in custom that are rarely found in survival) -

Another gripe, Warehouses don't regen. That's fine it's cool to feel you are conquering dungeons that stay conquered. However if your incentive is clothing items, this forces you to make a new world. I am ok with that, only I wish more warehouses were available in any given world.


Pros
- Good incentives rewarding creatively and good reward loop once you've invested time.
- High potential for continued improvements such as exo suit and spud gun modularity.
- Variety of gameplay experiences, gameplay is highly emergent.

Cons
- Lacking reasons to explore, new areas often have little in terms of new material to offer the player.
- Limitation on acquiring clothing through conquest."
20006,This games is sooo fun.
20007,It is a cool multiplayer game and you can build almost everything you want. Cool mods you can add to make your game experience better.
20008,good game and fun mechanics! Keep working devs!
20009,it's neat
20010,Yes
20011,"I like the survival aspect, the respawning of loot makes your respawning not as bad when you die, I would like for it to be a little better optimized, I would like for there to be amap that either you fill in or is available or at least a in game map like a buildboard or something in different points on the map that say you are here like at a park. Other than this, in creative worlds, I would like for the ability to spawn and control ai so you can test what can and can not effectively kill robots effectively while your still trying to farm for spud guns."
20012,tyht
20013,its a fun and good game
20014,Good game but once you get a good base going and start really getting into the baerings and automated stuff and you try for big project the game drop to 5 fps. unplayable.
20015,Vey cool game
20016,"There are a couple things that I dont like about SM and that is that there are many bugs glitches such as going under the map or flying into outer space.
 There are lots of great things about SM I wont mention but glitches are the only flaw.
 I would buy this game if i didnt already have it and you should too,"
20017,fun and creative a blast to play
20018,"If you like building and playing around with logic gates, this game's for you. If you were looking more for interesting combat and variety in survival, this game isn't there yet.

The vehicle creation and automation is interesting enough that I'll check back in a few months, but for now, there's not quite enough here to keep me coming back."
20019,the game is fun
20020,Enjoying it very much. Survival is very good.
20021,"While this game does have a few bugs, both supported by the developers and those they are aiming to remove, this game has been a wonderful survival game. This game provides you with thrilling survival game play and fantastic automation options for those looking to complicate things yet simplify your game play. 

"
20022,great game lag sometimes but you just reload and it normally isnt an issue
20023,xDxD_......
20024,too lazy to write a proper response but the game is very fun. Whatever you have a vision for the game will allow you to do.
20025,"great fun! cant wait for the update to include the warehouses! can be a little resource intensive when playing multiplayer but other than that, it is great fun!"
20026,most fun game i have ever played
20027,"amazing
"
20028,good
20029,Nice game
20030,"its a good game although u do have to think and i like creative the best survival is just to laggy for me so i recommend for the creative part alone 
"
20031,its laggy tho
20032,"Scrap mechanic is awesome. It is a sandbox game. The main difference (to other games from this category) is that it focusses on technology and therefore machinery. There are endless mechanical objects and systems that you can create.

The art style is unique and beautiful. The controls are easy to understand and logically set.

There are two game modes:

The survival mode (since the last upgrade) gave this game a fully new gameplay section. You need to build stuff, discover the map and build working machines, while defending against evil robots. This is really fun with friends. Automatize the processes to increase your efficiency.

The other one is the simple sandbox mode that I mentioned before. You can create whatever you want and have a chill time with your friends.

I absolutely recommend this game if you enjoy building machines, systems and cars.
"
20033,fun
20034,this game is fun
20035,i guess
20036,"I love games like this. When you start playing Scrap Mechanic, time passes so fast. Collect, build survive. 5 out of 5 stars."
20037,very fun
20038,good by yourself but its great with friends
20039,"this game is def early access. so many things missing, like theres no map of any kind, not even a compass so you'll have no sense of direction. theres no story or goal. no dedicated server so without a friend this will get boring quick. the game just kind of throws you in the middle of nowhere and you gotta figure out how to do things. it looks great and has great potential but little things like not being able to use items unlesss they are on your hotbar really annoyed me. Im gonna keep an eye out for future updates because i really want to like this game"
20040,"The game keeps crashing.

the game is good and all, but it just keeps crashing and freezing, this has nothing to do with the graphics as I originally had them on high, but then turned them down to medium and low. I have played only 3.3 hours on this game due to this bug, but also had it on a different computer and there was the same issue. The first hour or so of owning the game is fine, but after that it just keeps crashing. I am still able to load saves but then it just immediately stops once you`re in game."
20041,This Game is Amazing!!!
20042,"+ survival mode is very fun and addictive in coop
- however there needs to be more content, something like an endgame
- performance is a huge issue: in survival in warehouses (kind of the current end game content), we experience huge lags and therefore die, also many crashes; in creative mode, the game crashes when you have too many bearings/tires

very enjoyable game that needs more content and performance improvement."
20043,"Very entertaining, hours of building fun to be had."

20050,"Love the game, especially the survival aspect of it!"
20051,"lovE
"
20052,This is truly a great game.  You can be creative.  More fun with others.
20053,"Read minimum requiremenrs carefully!
I will preface my review by saying that i have alot of fun playing this game and though it is still very glitchy and could use a good amount of polish, the concept is solid and gameplay/physics engine leads to alot of laughs and misadventures. 

That being said, the reason i am not recommending this game is due to the requirement for an internet conection to start the game. It is a gripe dating more than 3 years of the developers promising to fix it from what i can pull up, and it is clear they have no intent to do so. 

If playing singleplayer wherever you please is your intent DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is DRM locked and you will not be able to play the game without internet. (In the spirit of fairness, internet is required to START the game, not to play it. If you have the capability of starting the game before leaving wifi coverage, you should be OK from what ive seen.

It is shaping up to be an awesome game and i have thoroughly enjoyed my short time playing it so far, but due to my profession my internet availability is constantly shifting, so i cannot recommend any game that needlessly hides its singleplayer content behind a internet requirement. If you have stable internet, and you want some fun shenanigans, then this is a inexpensive gateway to let your crazy ideas free. If you do not and are expecting a fun singleplayer game to kill time between stations, dont get it until the DRM is removed."
20054,crashes every 5 mins
20055,gooci
20056,This game is so much fun! The new Survival mode adds an exciting edge to Scrap Mechanic. It keeps your attention because you'll want to make new inventions with the vast amount of materials provided. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!
20057,Buy it
20058,Funnest game I played in quite awhile!
20059,"This game is a ton of fun, I love survival games, and the mechanical, creative, and inventive aspects this game pushes are by far the most unique I've ever seen!"
20060,Nice.
20061,it's fun
20062,good game
20063,This game is Great. Its performance could be better but the game play makes up for that ten fold.
20064,i like potatos and this game has potatos 10/10
20065,incredible deep and immersive survival mod
20066,It is awesome. You can build almost anything you imagine
20067,I love this game i wanted  it so bad
20068,So. Very. Addicting. @_@
20069,like the game
20070,"I have been playing scrap mechanic survival now for 5 hours and i don't like it 
"
20071,Some stuttering and glitches in multiplayer but a fantastic game in development.  Minecraft++
20072,fun game
20073,hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
20074,"its just fun,probably cos im an autistic fuck"
20075,"Ever since survival mode came out, the game has only gotten better!"
20076,"There are a lot, but I a lot of bugs on this game. I purchase the game and start playing it for about 40 hours in 2-3 days of period but because of the bugs i stopped playing it."
20077,"Get blocks, build blocks, protect farm, advance. A little tedious in the start but the grind gets more balanced on the go."
20078,Just ok
20079,its a grate game
20080,great new game that needs refinement.
20081,"This game.... This game... IS AWESOME U GET TO BUILD YOUR DREAMS, ETC SURVIVAL CAME OUT AND IT'S AWESOME! BUY IT GUYS... IT'S WORTH IT"
20082,Fun stuff!
20083,"Very fun game, it involves farming, chopping down trees and much more resource collecting. Also you actually get attacked, no scripts needed!!"
20084,It's Great!
20085,Nice
20086,"gud game
"
20087,I love this game!!! I got it yesterday and I played it for seven hours
20088,"I've played a ton of this game over the past 4 years of owning it, but every time there's a major update, it seems Axolot breaks the game more. I love so much about this game, but I don't think I'd recommend this to anyone in its current state"
20089,fun free better than minecraft
20090,now let me say this game has a lot of potential. i have spent 75 hours playing this game. today i was using a bearing made vehicle. it hit a rock threw me from the vehicle then proceded to start flying around while the wheels glitched out. that was about 10 to 20 hours worth of time to get materials and trying to get it to work. i cant tie it down with the lift. it doesn't hold still enough for me to try to disconnect the wheels. this is really a bad time when that much time is wasted.
20091,TRFG6Y8UI79
20092,I just can't stop playing
20093,"Scrap Mechanic is one of the best games on Steam. If you like Survivel and creative games like Minecraft, Rust or other games then is this game for you."
20094,"Fun game all around. The Pc requirements aren't high either.
It is a lot of fun when playing with friends. Great game 9/10"
20095,I love this game you can really let your creativity free and build some awesome things. But I would like to see servers you can host or a better multiplayer system.
20096,fun
20097,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game but has flaws because it's still an early access game. 

So to start off, I think that the crafting system is so fun and goes so well with survival.

Crafting: 9/10

So imagine you're sick and tired of using all of your hunger and thirst chopping down trees for wood, so you go and make a car with saw blades attached to it to chop down the trees for you or to make it better, you can have pipe tubing and bearings to attach to steering wheels to turn the saw blades and use controllers to only turn the saw blades when you need them so you're saving gas. Combine anything I said to any kind of action to get materials and you can use all kinds of neat tricks with logic gates, pistons, switches, buttons and etc. 

Combat: 5/10

You literally backpedal while swinging your sledgehammer at the haybots to avoid getting a 30 damage hit or you can ""block"" by right clicking to negate 10 damage or if it works at all. The Spud Guns are great. Tapebots are OP.

Farming: 5/10

You start a farm and the bots will come in waves that will come after you at midnight. Pretty simple. You have some late game fruits and veggies that are only obtainable in the warehouse or in the gold chests that spawn at these torn down buildings. Again with the crafting situation, people all over Youtube have made some super intricate water cannon farms to water your crops, harvest them and then re-seed the soil. Amazing. 

Survival: 5/10 

For early game progress and not starving to death you either farm your veggies, fruits and such and defend them from robots OR spend 2 hours gathering 30 stacks of corn to feed to Wocs to get milk that barely fills up my hunger or thirst bar. Sometimes the bots will kill wocs and so you'll find that they usually drop meat. So you think you'll be able to cook the meat so that you can eat? WRONG. You can craft a cookbot but it only offers a Burger, Veggie Burger or a Revival Baguette.

 Which in order to get you need to start a farm and get good materials but the combat that mixes in with protecting your farm early game is slow as fuck. If you want to get something else than milk, then enjoy going looting and let's just hope you find a blueberry or banana to feed you. God forbid that you can hopefully find Crafting Components to upgrade your engine and other parts. 


So again, It's still a EARLY ACCESS GAME. But goddamn I've had fun playing it and I hope they'll improve on some stuff in the future."
20098,"Like minecraft but better
"
20099,"Please do a search on the word ""Refund"" in the games forum discussion area. I thought I had researched this game enough before making a purchase decision, however, I was wrong. After playing for only about 30 mins I was unhappy with many ""gameplay mechanics"" and found almost all of my dislikes spelled out specifically in the discussions about refunding this game. 

This game was clearly not for me. I can handle frustration if fun is part of the deal, however, in this case, I only found frustration. 

Note: Game has thirst meter. Can't drink water? Logically, I should gather 3 corn and feed it to cows for 1 milk. For this and many other reasons; Refunded."
20100,The game is great both creative and survival but if your planning on playing with friends it is glitchy sometimews
20101,the best game ive ever played
20102,fun
20103,"Fun game. I love how you can download mods so easily.. In other games like Minecraft you have to download files like forge but in this game you just need to click Browse in Creative or Survival (I don't know if there's mods in challenge) and then just search something up a mod you want and hover over it and click +! I love that. I also have some feedback. Please fix the searching. Once I searched up ""New York City"" in the world editor and i found tiles which had ""New"" in their title but not ""New York City"" So please fix this Axolot. Thanks! I totally recommend this game to other people, Great game!"
20104,i like this game it is really fun to see your creations come to life but it is definitly challenging to learn the advanced building tips.
20105,Amazing game!  Fun solo or with friends!  My kids and I have a blast on our shared world and when they are not around I play on my solo world.  10/10 !
20106,is good
20107,very good game love survival
20108,great game
20109,addictive
20110,"HELL YA
"
20111,Its cool
20112,"love it
"
20113,it is an overall good game and survival it just mad it a lot more intresting and it is a really good game
20114,"Very fun game, do play :)"
20115,"It's been quite a time since I've played this game, probably because I needed to stop after all the hours I spent trying to make almost anything. Besides that, you should definitely play Scrap Mechanic, although it is most enjoyed if you have at least one friend to play with. Most of the stuff you do simply feels worthless without your friend's attention. I'd say that this game  is simply what I'd call ""the most redstone that any redstone could ever get"""
20116,"all in all a great game, the physics involving traction with wheels is my only objection as my car no matter how many wheels i have touching the ground still manages to slide around when i'm not in it, but other than that, pretty good, can't wait for new parts and stuff."
20117,"slow development and needs a lot of work, especialy survival mod support but it's a good game, most fun i had in years"
20118,"it is a great game, it takes a bit to get used to but it is awesome
"
20119,"Great game, just needs a bit of optimization and would be awesome :)"
20120,"is good
very wow"
20121,najs bajs
20122,"First off I refunded this game with 71 minute trial.  A good 20 minutes of that was spent learning to do simple things. If you are the type that need/want direction in how to do things then this game is not ready for you. I honestly expected a little more direction from a game in development since 2018. 

Struggles, found wheel barrel but no way to move it. Ended up trying to take apart but ran out of inventory. 

Putting out fire was easy solution but requires exploring. Since you start in a burning wreck of your ship you first thought is gather what you can for the trip ahead, but fire is in the way. 

There seems to be no crafting in the game or any key that is assigned to open a crafting menu. There is a robot console that is on the wall in the burning wreck but if you do not decide to put out the fire you will never know about it.  All you get when you look at it is ""Need Power"" completely unhelpful. 

Ok so this was struggle examples in survival which is what I bought the game for. Then I moved to creative to try to learn the game a bit. 

Well no better here. Lay out lift pile a few blocks to make a fram. 2 rear wheels 2 front wheels Bearings Engine driver seat. Well Engine for some reason only connects to 6 things. So with 6 wheels you can not connect the driver seat. Not sure the point of the limit but there was no way to figure that out either. 

In all this was my rough experience and though could be unfair I was looking to stay under the 2hrs so I could refund if I was not satisfied. 

So the point of this review is to let others know to keep this on your wishlist for a while longer. I plan to continue watching to see where it goes. I had tried Terratech early on too and refunded but now that it is complete I am loving it with about 100hrs. 

For fans I truely wish this had a neutral button as it is unfair to thumbs down this game. Still I could not recommend it to friends so I can not recommend to strangers."
20123,good
20124,Very entertaining.
20125,This is a really fun game. I've played it for a while and the mod support is awesome. I can't wait to see mod support in survival and that there will be a mini program or something else made by them to help others make mods.
20126,Hey you. Yea u 18-27 year old male. Do u like cars? OF COURSE U DO. UR A 18-27 YEAR OLD MALE. Remember minecraft? OF COURSE U DO. Well now u get to hanna montana that shit and get the best of both worlds.
20127,"SM is by far the most fun game to play with friends, or just build something when your bored, SMS is most fun, as is the newest, you get all hyped to get the good tools and stuff, and also have little robots come at you. SMC is also cool but not as interactive, just for building and stuff, 10/10 would recommend this to a friend"
20128,"good

20135,"If your on edge about buying this game, Go for it!
The new survival mode is already brilliant with lots more updates coming, Scrap mechanic gives you the freedom to just build what you really want to, and i like that."

20158,"Only having the content they have this far into development shows exactly how crap this game really is. 
The trailer is an absolute lie.
After five hours of playing this game if you can call it that youll wish you were dead, and thats exactly what will happen to you in game every five minutes if you dont eat something.

Dont waste your money on this heap of scrap"
20159,this game is very good
20160,"Scrap Mechanic Survival oh so laggy and buggy at times, yet so much fun to play. I recommend to play with friends."

20171,the game is great but i wish there was a easier mode and you can customise the world and how much damage bots do
20172,"Very fun and addicting game. There are some similarities to a favorite childhood game of mine, which makes this game even better."
20173,Cool Game

20181,Great game
20182,Game likes to crash as soon as you have a few hours invested in a map. awesome waste of time.
20183,"To the management. This is written using Google Translate. I would like to add a gyro block. I can't make a bike. Multiplayer communication is unstable. I can't drive. I hope I can share the world of my friends. I support you.

20185,survival is pretty great but has few to no bugs
20186,"so goood
"
20187,"Survival mode has a super rocky start for early game but becomes an amazing addictive game of creations.  Build a base, grow a farm, smash some robots, and WAY over build any vehicle you design.  

Once a tutorial is added for early game I dare say anyone would enjoy this game."
20188,i Love this game its really fun
20189,Smelly in a good way
20190,super fun for people who like engineering games
20191,its a great game the survival mode is FINNALY OUT and really fun but dosent explain what to do in the beggining i was also being pretty dum soooo...
20192,this game i have played for years and loved it your freind s can play with you too
20193,"pretty good game.

update over a year later: still a good game."
20194,ive played it a little and its pretty good (shame survival broke most mods tho)
20195,"Game looks good and there is a lot to do, a lot of fun"
20196,"It doesn't take itself too seriously, but is close enough to real physics to be fun. I wish they would bring gears back. unless gears was a mod then I want that mod
"
20197,"Fun Game, I hope they continue to add more stuff, because it will get boring quick if they don't add more  rather than just a protect your garden with robots that come in waves."
20198,it's fun and really interactive for all ages
20199,I love the new survival mode

20213,"I love the new survival, it is challenging and incorporates all of the stuff from the main game with so much new stuff."
20214,its a fun game but it needs for the berings to be better plz
20215,"it is very good. I suggest playing with friends, as it is more fun, This changes if you or your friend edited files, it will glitch and not let you join unless you have the same EXACT files, other than character files, so please check before you join a friend."
20216,"ITS SO FUN BUT SERVERS IS TRASH 
"
20217,ITS A AWESOME GAME!!!!
20218,Its a fun game to play with your children.  Not really something I would play myself since the upgradability of your character and the enemies really isn't there.
20219,Its an amazing game and is really fun. I've enjoyed playing this game alot.
20220,"creativity
"
20221,Is super game.
20222,"For a early beta game its amazing! Got into the game cos of 2 friends and I'm almost about to surpass them in building :D 
One thing I would want to have is that there is a story line and multiplayer servers.
I wish it had more mods tho that would help with quality of life"
20223,"its a good game, bit buggy when you try and join people and needs some optimisation but i reccomend it"
20224,ITS SUPER FUN
20225,"This is my most played game this year, so much fun."
20226,epic gamer game
20227,"A very fun game with infinite possibilities that you can show your creativity. Definitely worth the price, especially now that the survival mode is finally released."
20228,is nice. better than when it only had creative and challenge mode.
20229,it has a lot of creativity.
20230,good sandbox
20231,This game is great for creative and adaptive people
20232,its a creative game for people to just have fun doing whatever
20233,its fun and creative
20234,My dad got me this game and i love it soo much
20235,"good
"
20236,"this is a very good game and even in challenge mode but if axolot is seeing this please add farm bots to be placed in challenge mode, it will make preaty cool challenges like, make a farm that can withstand the fam bots for 6 rounds or something"
20237,"This game is a bruh moment

20238,k
20239,you can build evrything
20240,bets game ever!!!!!!
20241,"lags when entering far into gameplay worlds
only issue"
20242,The game is great! cant wait to see with its fully developed and we can get parts from warehouses.
20243,This game is really fun to play BUT i do highly suggest is to watch other people play so you understand the game better because some builds require more complex subjects.
20244,it is amazing
20245,Axalot has done a great job so far of patching survival mode imo and this game has been a blast. Really can't recommend enough!
20246,i love this game it takes imagination thinking but i think they should make more player skins thats all
20247,vhbhlgjhghjyf
20248,this game is amazing 10/10 would recomend
20249,Really Good game a lot of crashes on the multiplayer side. But this game is a really great game great ideas and super fun.
20250,it fun
20251,"good game, bed update bad"
20252,it is amazing with endless machines to create or see if youre not the creator type.also it just got survival so woooo
20253,very good game i have been addicted since the start from survival to creative!!
20254,It do be kind of a vibe
20255,"Really fun, easy to pick up! =D"
20256,This is currently my favorite survival game. For being early access it is incredibly well polished.
20257,"When this game gets the updates it needs to resolve game play lag issues in multi player survival mode, it might become the BEST GAME of the YEAR award from me!!!

Also FULLY understanding that this game is still in beta, and in early release mode. 

We have a team of 8 people that all have played well over 200 hours each......can't say that for too many games.

"
20258,retarded game crashes on a 1060 with an i7
20259,a good game overall with a cool story line in survival
20260,"This game is amazing. I'm playing it now for about 200 hours and it's awesome. Just a few improvements in my opinion:

-add a minimap
-survival terrain generation in creative
-ability to switch between creative and survival
-ALL survival items in creative
-upgradeable tools and backpack
-fly-mode in creative
-upgrade slots to make machines faster or more efficient
-abilitys to unlock for different character like fast regeneration loose less hunger or go faster

And PLEASE fix, that your death loot does not bug below the map or in any wall."
20261,it is fun and challenging
20262,"Good system minimum is 8gb of ram but i have 4gb of ram on laptop and its okay and without lag, just map in survival is loading 2-5min"
20263,Its fun
20264,"its a really good game
"
20265,10
20266,Really really fun
20267,"Awesome, can't wait to try survival now that it's out!"
20268,"It's fun, if you have friends to play it with, otherwise it gets a little boring."
20269,very epic game

20275,The game definitely has a lot of content and it is well worth it even though it is still in early access! <3
20276,extremely fun and addicting game where the possibilities are only limited to your imagination
20277,if you're creative this games an amazing sandbox and if you aren't creative or just don't wanna go through the building process you can just download anything off the community workshop
20278,"I don't recomend this game for now. You can do many things in this game but you also need to do some things. you need to get inside buildings and fight harvester bots no matter what to get some critical items and it feels too repetetive. my advices for this game would be
*improve water vehicle mechanics. buoyoncy should directly corelate to volume of item. make the dynamics more realistic
*add maps
*upgrading engine and seat makes sense but suspension? make it completly upgraded when crafted
*armor or shield would be nice 
*nights are too dark. increase brighness
that is it for now"
20279,"Its a fun and simple, sort of, game. Fairly forgiving and always something new to do. And the developers are constantly working on it."
20280,"With the recent addition of 'Survival mode' and the fixing of loading times this game is much better than it was a couple of years ago!
Still has some bugs but one of the best sandbox building games i have played!"
20281,"The game is outstanding "" survival  long awaited and has opened the game for more scope  .......  the thing is the days are very short in the game .. multiplay - Brings a new adventure  with your friends . www.twitch.tvthe50plusgamer"
20282,i bought it a year ago but my computer couldnt handle it until now and i just started yesterday and im having so much fun
20283,its awesome
20284,"JUST PLANE SHIT AND NO REFUND FROM STEAM 
"
20285,it runs really well (i run it on a 3g laptop) and really fun with a couple bugs here and there
20286,"Absolutely incredible game! If you like Astroneer, Minecraft or 7 Days to Die you'll find this game super satisfying! Survival is a tone of fun and if you have some regular mates to play with its even better! 10/10"
20287,this game is so creative and funny .
20288,noice game
20289,"Great game, but i have one Gripe, The game at this time, lags out, due to too many entities on the ground, and it would be nice to have a command to clear all non player placed entities, laying about. (like cut down tree's, robot arms, and the like)"
20290,loading screen sim
20291,"I play survival games almost exclusively, and this is one of my favorites. Similar enough to be familiar (start by sledgehammering a tree) but different enough to not be the same old grind (put a sawblade on a rotor and attach it to a gas powered motor on your car if you want to gather wood faster)."
20292,It is buy far the best game I have played
20293,"The survival mode can be a little bit of a learning curve if you have never played before. It's defiantly fun for those who love to build and tinker. Survival is very heavy on the grind scale, not that is a bad thing. Wish they had a beacon or map system of some sort, it gets frustrating to use only landmarks and roads to get around, when the landscape doesn't very much."
20294, Good Game
20295,nice
20296,"Can we fix Chinese, are we not visible to so many comments officially?"
20297,ITS FUN
20298,Buy Buy Buy Buy NOWWW.
20299,"Hi.  I am new to the game.  How do we install the patches?  Or does it patch the game automatically. Please let me know.

Thank you.  Much appreciated."
20300,"I love this game, I bought it on release and was the third game ever to appear in my steam library, I grew old while waiting for survival but it's fun and even better with friends."
20301,"at first its hard to learn the controls but after a little bit of playing you get used to it
"
20302,"it's the game i never knew i needed, building different vehicles and farming materials. Also, getting to horde everything you find and build bases and storage rooms, farms, etc is a great time. especially fun with another player, although survival mode is new and there is quite a few bugs and issues with the game it is still a good time. currently, I've had to modify the game files to allow cheats so that i can actually loot the warehouses which are the survival modes ""end game"" atm. overall, thumbs up."
20303,i think i have an addiction
20304,it good
20305,dont bother with survival. its not ready.
20306,"At first I didn't give this game a glance. But when survival came out, I decided to jump all in and give it a try. I can easily say that I have sunk over 200 hrs in less than a month. The story, the graphics and the ability to let your imagination flow through your creations is magnificent. There is something for everyone and every play style, you can play solo, with friends and it even has challenge modes. The game even has a help book in game to show you the basic mechanics of how to build your first car, how to make a door that can open and close with the press of the button and that really is the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more you can do and the only thing to stop you is  your imagination! The combination of farming, crafting and defending against evil farm bots makes it a great game to add to your library and provides hours upon hours of fun."
20307,"This is the best!
So Creative 
The Best game Ever!"
20308,It's really good but my game glitched removed my seat on my car now my car is gone and i cant find it now im lost
20309,fun game lots to do
20310,ads
20311,/
20312,e
20313,"the very definition of a sandbox game, the possibilities are endless with the many parts and mechanics put into the game, made even more elaborate and unique thanks to the developers attentive maintenance and a strong community producing content to accent the game and offer many more things to play with! 

10/10 for its unique gameplay and limitless ways to express creativity."
20314,Fun.
20315,its very fun
20316,7
20317,I love that I can build and create in this game and then be able to use my creations in live mode.
20318,amazing
20319,"Great game, regular updates and fun co-op. if you like building things and designing things, this game is for you. Don't hesitate, just buy it! buy it now!"
20320,"Nice game with good mechanical play totally worth it
"
20321,Bruh
20322,how do i get the new beta version?
20323,"Its really fun!

Edit: Okay so the above was really really pointless... I really need to say more about this game if i'm being completely honest! This game is wonderful the game has literally no limits! You can legit build anything that comes to mind. You think about it and how it would work then you just build it. Its really nice to finally see the Survival mode and it is amazing. The survival mode offers a more challenging aspect to the game while maintaining the original vibe to the game which is to be a mechanic! Definitely recommend people to purchase this game as it is just one of the best imaginative games out there. Oh and you can look at overs creations with the workshop and there are community created mods which allows you to do more with the game! 1 last thing though... Its really fun!"
20324,very good and fun
20325,Very cool physics based game make sure you check out survival
20326,very fun
20327,"It is a great game. Solo or multiplayer survival, with its open world map is a great way to chill out. The AI is not OP or overly weak, with their own behaviour patterns. The game gives you a lot of freedom to build things and play the game however you want.

Looking forward to the warehouse loot and a better way to harvest oil and glue clams. LOL"
20328,yes
20329,"Awesome game, crafting is nearly limitless.  If you love Legos, tinker toys or even erector sets this game will take you back!"
20330,my suilval does not work but  all the game is laggy but it is ok
20331,funny
20332,Love the game worth buying
20333,Yes.
20334,Plz give us a update on chapter 2
20335,"If you are looking for a game that allows you to create almost anything, this is probably the game you are looking for.  After learning what the parts do, you are limited only by your imagination, aptitude and material collection abilities (in survival).  I've seen some pretty creative solutions to rescuing trapped farmers out there. This game won't hand you solutions but it does give you the ability to create the solution."
20336,best game ever create and let your imagination run wild

20338,Yes! This game is vary fun! and it's even more enjoyable with friends! the only thing i don't really like much is in survival mode where if your going to fast and hop out of your seat you get thrown. but other than that i would recommend.
20339,"So much you can do that the community has shown with everything they have made in the workshop, and survival is really good even though its been out for only a couple of weeks. Highly recommend this game!"
20340,i love this game!
20341,"Add a fine mix survival with Scrap mechanic's virtually limitless crafting possibilities and you've got one hell of a great game! Despite some minor bugs here and there (it is in early access after all), Scrap Mechanic is the first game in a long time that has me coming back for more. It plays well, looks fantastic, and the physics are an engineer's dream. There is no better feeling than being lost in the woods after dark, wondering aimlessly as you hear the sounds of haybots nearby. Once all hope is lost, you spot the faint yet warm headlights of your janky improvised vehicle not too far ahead. You hop on, crank up the old weedwacker engine and take the long journey home as you witness the mesmerizing sunrise. 

10/10 I would recommend to a friend!!!"
20342,"One of the best sandbox mechanic games i've played so far, and now with the addition of Survival it got a thousand times better. As of now, there's no mod support for Survival but it'll probably be out in like 2-3 weeks from now on. This game has nearly infinite replayability and modding just multiplies that by a billion times.

[Edit 1]
So the next big update promises tons of new stuff like caves, sticky wheels and generators to produce batteries among many other cool stuff. There's one part im insanely excited for, that is the generator. Just buy it already its %100 worth the price, in fact i'd gladly pay double."
20343,It's fun with friends. What's mot to like.
20344,"GREAT GAME

But pls fix net issus when i join my friend i got some lag and when my friend join me he got the same lag and both our nets are fine"
20345,GOOD GAME
20346,amazing game full of adventure
20347,fun
20348,Its great
20349,haha this game is very fun and epic
20350,"The game is really great, I've been watching youtube videos about it for the last couple months, and seeing all the people react to the survival trailer inspired my purchase. The survival aspect is really fun, and exploring is not too hard, but I heard rumor they are thinking about making the beds have limited uses

The world generation on some maps can leave you without finding resources to make beds, or at least just enough. A lot of peoples first time in a warehouse (or just getting unlucky) can die easily 10 times, the tapebots kill you in 2 hits and they headshot you the moment they see you.

If they make the beds limited use I will be changing this review to a ""no"""
20351,"Awesome and fun game, it is worth it."
20352,"What a great game! As a fan of strategy and complex mechanic games I didn't hesitate a minute and bought it as soon as the survival game mode come up. Some may say that it is a buggy mess, but after all it's still in development and I can't wait to see what the devs will make in the future. Even in the current state it is a great experience with unlimited options of replayability. It has a great potential to become a classic and I hope the first thing they will fix is the lagging caused by more complex machines, because after all this is the point of the game."
20353,a little bit laggy but the game is fun a tiny bit challenging
20354,Very fun survival game to play with friends but a little glitchy because it is beta. But it is so glitchy in a warehouse elevator that the game crashes several times.
20355,"Engineer and Physics Nerds.  If you build it, they will come."
20356,love the survival
20357,This game is fun to watch a youtuber play.  it was ehh for me to play by myself
20358,Not bad I got bored of the game when I first got in a couple of years ago but now with the survival mode it has become more enjoyable to me. Also people are still making creative items in the workshop
20359,just a super fun game ive played it on my main account before it got stolen
20360,Loving survival and the number of updates. This is the game I wanted so long ago.
20361,Best Game EVER!!!
20362,Robot smashing and contraption building fun!  So far in development this game is a lot of fun.  Some minor issues with resource availability and it is still a little too easy to get lost with no mapping feature at all.
20363,It a fun game and i neat concept.  I think the survival part needs more content which i am led to believe by what i have read and heard is on its way.  Overall a fun game and worth the money
20364,"ti is cool
"
20365,"coooool beannz
"
20366,E
20367,It's like a mix between Minecraft and Space Engineers.
20368,"great game, much automation"
20369,"Overall great game mechanics / concepts, although Survival mode could benefit from a tutorial."
20370,i like this game because it allows you to be creative with anything
20371,"It is a good game but, there is a lot of places depends on parkour which is with this  retarded jump system is an agony, why they just make a normal responsive jump like every game ."
20372,Fun game. but still needs a ton of work.
20373,hyhfyfhghxxhhxhhrtrthxhx
20374,Solid survival craft game where you build vehicles.
20375,Absolutely Amazing Game cant get enough
20376,yeah it's okay

20384,This is a very good game!!
20385,great game fun open world
20386,it is fun
20387,"i like the driving aspect of this game but if you dont have a good computer it will lag really bad
"
20388,i love this!
20389,"Pretty consistent updates since they added survival. The survival mode is a lot of fun. It can feel tedious, but once you figure out how to make vehicles that work for you, the tedious stuff becomes very fun. 

For instance. You spend a ton of time gathering base materials early game. However, if you learn the physicals of the vehicles and how to properly make them, you will be sawing trees down with a super vehicle/chainsaw. 

I have barely scratched the surface. I just got my hands on a spud gun at 18 hours. The game is fun and challenging."
20390,ti is a fun gam ewith survival and creative that you can free build
20391,it is the best game if you want to be a mechanic
20392,Fun
20393,it good game play it
20394,Its Great
20395,"This game is amazing in every aspect from the quirky character and item models to the farming and vehicle making. The game is very fun and great to play with friends. I have actually convinced 5 of my friends to get it with only two of them really getting it as the others are Mac users and cannot play Scrap Mechanic. Overall this game is great, but I just think there could be some changes from the compatibility to some small features in the game. Would rate 5 stars if possible."
20396,fun
20397,Minecraft+Car trucks planes +robots and cool back story stuff and its just epic
20398,its fun
20399,good game

20409,yee iss gooood
20410,"love it 
"
20411,Overall a great game. they could make making planes car etc. a bit easier for new players but don't let that stop you from playing this game as you can use the steam workshop and play with creations that the community has made. Really fun.
20412,its really fun and there is no limits
20413,It's okay i guess
20414,you will defently need a pwarfull pc
20415,It's pretty good.
20416,its epic gamer fun
20417,it is a fun game like yo oyoo platyyyy it foun funn play it fun it is mmmmmmm
20418,great fun if it worked without constant lagg
20419,Was fighting with someone who should drive and I got stuck on the passenger side with no driver and the engine going. Tried to stop the car and it got even faster. We were laughing so hard we couldn't breathe. 11/10 will find that car
20420,"Update: They have now added Waypoints! Finding your base is now much easier. 

SIMPLE FIX, SIMPLE FIX - Refiner gives 3/4 times yield on anything put in it. You can mine/pump oil, maybe a unit you can build and put over the oil in the water and connect it to a large box. 
Survival:
This game is fun, and there is a lot to do, but man is the GRIND REAL. 31 hours in and all I have to show is a Drill car, 1 car used to chop wood, and 1 pickup truck. This is due to there not being a reliable way of getting resources. I do wish vehicles would not tip over as easily or that if you have specific items on it you can put it on the jack to flip it.  

Pros:
So much to explore and attack. 
Love the random spawned buildings and going in to fight everything
Fighting waves is great!
Love how specific you can get with building and connecting everything customization is great

Cons: 
Going out for resources does not yield enough return on work
Oil is impossible to get without spending 1 hour swimming for it. A one for one trade is not enough
Physics are unforgiving and any creation either tips over too fast, wont float or cant do what I need it to do
No map, getting lost is practically a game over - Fixed! 

All I am asking is that you get Oil, Wood, Metal and Stone 3/4 times more per yield and a map. This would encourage players to explore the map, build more creations play longer. Also encourage people to play more survival games with other players to get creative. Currently at its state I would recommend this game, because the developers are working hard to balance it out. But beware of a grind. Excited to see what updates we have in the future."
20421,good game!
20422,"Really enjoy the building aspect of the game. Also, creating contraptions and mechanisms is fun. I recommend this game if you're looking for some sort of building survival game! Can be a bit grindy."
20423,BESTEST GAME EVER
20424,It's like minecraft but better. It has better applied physics and the mechanical side is great.  Would not play if you don't have a basic understanding of physics or mechanical knowledge.
20425,I cant seem to find cotton anywhere .maybe ill try again in a few months
20426,its good
20427,"i love all the possibilities for what you can create. and i love the survival mode, a survival creationbased gamewhere u can make just about anything you can  think of"
20428,"If you love building and having absolute control over every aspect of what you build; buy this.

If not, don't."
20429,I love the building. It puts your mind to the test and lets you create anything you want.
20430,This game saved me from the dumpster fire that was Fallout 76.  Thank you Axolot.
20431,pretty good
20432,I like the minecraft feel and more depth. I hate the combat without guns.
20433,:0
20434,very fun game for creative people.
20435,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try‚Ä¶"
20436,its amazing
20437,"Pretty decent game, very fun if you're a creative person. 7.5/10"
20438,verry good game be good with a story mode
20439,Definitely one of my favorite games 10/10 will always play.
20440,fun
20441,GOODEST GAME EVER
20442,"really good game, but they need to optimize it for less lag."
20443,"Terrible multiplayer experience. I have suffered over 20+ crashes in an hour attempting to have fun in a otherwise decent game. These issues and bugs are unlike any other STABLE games, and have existed since the very beginning, attracting very little dev attention."
20444,"Take the Besieged construction and use it for a survival game, it's good fun. Survival mode's a little bare at the time of writing but that doesn't mean you'll ""win"" quickly. The more you build up, the bigger a reaction you get from the enemy, so you can test yourself to see exactly how good of a fortress you can design."
20445,"Not the best gaming experience. Everything has an animation, even item drops. When you beat an enemy it legitimately takes half a second for the items to fly up and land on the ground with sparkles coming out of it. It may sound cute, but when you want to build and get through the game its a pain. And the colours are alittle bit obnoxious but that's subjective. The whole game just feels immediately bogged down or washed out. Its just kind of a pain to play"
20446,yes
20447,EPIC
20448,e
20449,time flyes by its really fun
20450,A true sandbox experience with a great sense of progression where your imagination is free to roam this immersive world. Would be great if we could at least bang the cows though. Any chance of an update where we could bang the cows? Even being able to touch their udders would be enough.
20451,gyyfrf
20452,"This is a really good and fun game.
"
20453,i have been completely addicted to this game and obsessively playing survival. highly reccomend
20454,GOD
20455,"good
"
20456,fun and good to play
20457,"Still WIP for the survival part but its playable, thoough quite the grind. Cant wait for balances and changes!"
20458,"survival is fun, not too far yet, but the potential for automation seems great. the building is great, simple, and quick. sadly i think the wiring lacks some depth. I was hoping to get more options to allow for better control and key mapping. but i was still able to make a working plane with the ""wings"" mod"
20459,it is good!!!!!
20460,game keeps crashing while playing.
20461,"Hey Mum you can be proud of your son now, because I'm a graduated engineer thanks to the Scrap Mechanic Engineer Academy.
I used to fill up shelfs at Wal-Mart and Tesco, but Scrap Mechanic Survival gave me a new opportunity and i don't need to work in these lesser-class jobs anymore.
Be like me, buy your own diploma now for 19.99‚Ç¨ and fulfill your dreams."
20462,"This game is awesome. It's a sandbox similar to Minecraft, but also totally different. All blocks have physics (sort of, they fall when broken off of something, and large, uneven creations can tilt and fall over). Many parts of the game are realistic including bearings, tires, suspensions, engines, and tools used for things like connecting different parts of a creation, spray painting individual parts for full customization, welding things together, and more. There are even mods! I haven't tried any yet, but I have seen some creations using them in the steam workshop (I'll talk about that next) that look absolutely amazing and I think it's awesome of the creators of this game to let mods be used. The steam workshop is an amazing community interface accessible inside and outside of the game. When you are playing the game, place down the lift, press E, and then select steam workshop at the top. Anybody (including you), can submit their creations and can include all the details needed in the description, like how to use it, what each button, switch, key, etc. does, and what it is used for. The last thing I will talk about is how many things you can actually do in this game. There are many building materials and parts to customize your engine to not only make it look cooler, but to have more features. Like I said before, you can weld things together and spray paint things, plus some other features that you should check out yourself. There are two types of tires, driver's seat, regular seats, and even a toilet to sit on. There are just so many features that I'm having a hard time thinking about them all. You can choose to have suspensions on your wheels for a more off-road experience, or just regular bearings, or none at all! I strongly encourage you to check out this game, and the steam workshop because of all the amazing things on there that truly show all the spectacular things you can create in this game. There is also survival mode, with different objectives. This gives the game a more natural and hard working kind of feel if you're more into that. Please try out this game! Also, it can be hard to remember how to do everything, and to figure it out, but I can assure you that there many, many, tutorials online to help you get started and figure more stuff out as you play. This game is truly a 10/10 and I would recommend it to anybody, anytime, anywhere. Just one last thing, you need a computer with at least 8GB of ram to run this game or there will be lag. Lower your settings if you don't have the strongest computer, and pay attention to the required computer specifications that you can find online. This game is truly awesome and I have had many laughs with my friend when we create all these hilarious things that shoot us up into the sky and explode and so many other things! I hope you have an awesome time playing this game, but I feel like I don't need to hope, because I think that anybody who plays this game will love it!"
20463,"good nan
"
20464,unable to play multiplayer due to connection problems.
20465,i love this game and i would %100 recommend this game
20466,"This game is by far one of my favorites. Although it is pretty similar to Minecraft, I think this game allows you to interact with things a LOT more. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games and who like creating and exploring."
20467,I can see the potential in this game. Just dont waste my $10 please

20469,Awesome.
20470,If your super into problem solving and engineering then pls play this awsome game
20471,every thing is good but mountable spud miniguns are a bit laggy
20472,i love enjenering
20473,really awesome
20474,this game is epic
20475,its a good game but the lag is something to look at but overall goodgame
20476,"A great game with a nice survival mode that can give you lots of hours worth of game play, Currently playing on beta 0.4.5 and I am enjoying the game. There is some balancing work that needs to be done and it looks like there is going to be a nice amount of content and tile work that they will add latter on."
20477,.
20478,Its just super fun
20479,.
20480,"(based on survival mode only)

Honestly, I'm a sucker for games that allow you to build what you want, so this is right up my alley. I understand that this game is not yet complete and there's definitely some basic things that it still needs, but I'm having such a great time building my own vehicles it's barely noticeable.

The good:
1. Very interesting building mechanics, you can build structures just about anywhere, and and kind of vehicle you can imagine. Sky's the limit honestly.
2. Very cute and stylized, I like the art style, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.
3. Very big maps, plenty to explore. I'm still finding new little secrets.
4. The crafting/cook/tailor bots are super cute and I love them.

The bad:
1. There's no parking brake. You will just slide down a hill unless you put your creation on a lift. In fact, there's no brake at all which makes no sense for a game where you can drive around.
2. There's a lot to see, but a lot of it is kind of ""samey"" still. Many of the buildings look very much alike with the same color palettes. Makes navigating by landmarks difficult.
3. There's no way to cancel a build order in the craft bot. Accidentally click something you didn't want to make? Oh well, those resources are wasted now.

Can't wait to see how far this game will go. If you love Minecraft or similar games I can recommend checking this one out. There's a lot of potential here, and enough to do that it's going to take a while to get bored waiting for new content.

20483,This game hits different when you overdose on tomato and milk
20484,"Been playing scrap mechanic since the survival release. (I don't really  dig  the creative mods).
 The game is tremendous, I would recommend it to everyone who sometimes likes to be creative.
  But please, Axolot, fix the coop play, the server lag sometimes is bad as hell. Or maybe it'll be better to ask Volvo to provide dedicated servers to this game just the way it went with Rust back in the days."
20485,"I have nightmares with haybots sneeking up on me while standing in a wheat field. 

Sometimes I meet totebots that 100% ignore me and are totally passive, until I hit them. Totebots are cute and I kinda wanna tame one and keep as pet. 

Glue clams is always in short supply.

Is very fun and good game!"
20486,I pireted this game at therst. But i sow how grait it was and wen it got survival mod i bot it. (I LOVE THIS GAME)

and check out scrap mechanic mods here: 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6aVu9YbosqWWmqeL2HijeQ
before buying to see if you like what this game is"
20491,"its an amazing game where you can create any vehicle beyond your dreams with creative mode or fight robots and build bots and cars in survival
"
20492,Nice game
20493,"great game to explore and build what ever you want, its fun with friends to mess around with"
20494,fun
20495,"If you like building things and seeing if they work like you imagined, only to have it fail and force you to make adjustments until it finally works how you want, then this game is for you! I've spent so many hours just making my vehicles more efficient. Recommended for those who enjoy problem solving. This is not a game for those who just want a quick adventure game that you just barrel through. If you enjoy redstone in Minecraft, then you will most likely enjoy this. I'm addicted!"
20496,This game is awesome!!!!
20497,its amazing!!
20498,boring
20499,good
20500,This is just a humungous upgrade from the old Scrap Mechanic ..........it somewhat is a rival for Minecraft........But i would dare say that This is better than minecraft.........since that game is one of a kind...........this does not apply to Hytale
20501,"This is one of those rare gems in early access - think Subnautica or Kerbal for the level of quality and continuous development.  With the recent added inclusion of the survival mode (and also now the challenge mode) suddenly building machines to combat the bots has a great deal of warmth. 

Building and rebuilding is great fun, intuitive, and rewarding when things work as you want them to.

My only complaint, if you could call it that, is that time seems to disappear in the real world when this is loaded.  Tremendous fun and certainly worth adding to your library if you like things like Minecraft or Space Engineers."
20502,"i Love this game its so much fun even if you have no one to play with
"
20503,Best game ever maybe better than minecraft
20504,its extremely fun to just build cars in creative and the survival is also pretty dang good
20505,It's a beautiful game <3 Enjoy it a lot :D
20506,extremely fun very mechanic
20507,"Even though it still has a few bugs Scrap mechanic is a pretty good game. If you like to try strange contraptions with little to no  consequences then Creative mode is for you, if you are more in to in survival situations and having to fight off killer robots if they see you or you plant too many crops then survival mode is for you. Finally if you are interested in competing against your friends to see who can build the best vehicle to traverse different challenges the fastest then challenge mode is for you. I have had a very positive experience with this game and if anything above is just a little bit interesting to you I recommend you at least try this game,"
20508,nice survival mode and the updates keep coming
20509,"Like Minecraft in concept, but can't get past its cubism and janky animations/combat/literally everything? Wish you could build a weaponized motorhome-cum-tree shredder? Want to live in a farmpunk post-apocalypse? Do you eat tomatoes when you're thirsty? Scrap mechanic is the game for you."
20510,"Fun until the robots kill your seat after spent all your resources on building a bad ass vehicle and it drives into the middle of the ocean, 3 times in one session.... time to rebuild lol... Very good game with endless possibilities."
20511,such a great game que buen juego
20512,it is a fun well rounded game
20513,good
20514,can be played for a long time but eventualy you need to take breaks from it
20515,"One of my favorite games! No lag, no bugs, nothing but an awesome game!"
20516,Good wholesome robot bashing time.  Oh!  and farming.
20517,the game will not stop crashing for me I don't even know how I got to 121 hours
20518,Great game I play it with my students to teach them engineering
20519,fun
20520,good game for people with imagination
20521,"This game is actually really fun. I've had this game for years but have been waiting for the recent survival mode. The game is challenging and rewarding. There are a few flaws to be worked out, but solid start and I can't wait for more content updates."
20522,"It seemed fun at first, then the survival game came up and everything started going down hill from their.

Death? Lose everything and it appears in a bag. This would be fine, if it wasn't for the fact that picking everything up is so tedious; you have to move one thing at a time. In an age of video games where you can pick up everything from a container with one click, having this is a real hamper.

No map system! Not even for areas you explore! You get lost, good luck finding ANYTHING again! 

Building things feel utterly restrained as you making things like turret seats is next to- if not- impossible. I tried making a water cannon turret for watering crops- didn't work.

This game is NOT one I'd recommend to anyone until it gets some real big changes made- specifically the ones mentioned."
20523,REEEEEEEEE
20524,"Physics based crafting with light survival elements. Immensely fun so far. I'm probably not nearly as far along in making and automating a base as I should be because I'm spending so much time playing around with the goofy looking vehicle I made.

I would suggest this game to anyone who's a fan of open world crafting/survival games like Minecraft or 7 Days to Die but wanted to focus more on the mechanics of making and piloting various vehicles than making and protecting a base. There's still some of that in the form of an ""Unauthorized Farming Detected"" warning that pops up each morning in the game if you plant enough crops. The amount of crops you have planted will determine the number and type of robot monsters that show up to try and destroy your farm and cut off your food supply. So don't plant too many crops right away unless you have a group of friends to help deal with the horde. I lost my last few banana seeds that way.

With the variety and depth they provide to craft your own vehicles, there's a plethora of content already to keep you entertained for hours on end if you're the least bit interested in crafting your own custom vehicles and looting ruins and beating up robots. It's a nice cycle of running thru the various prefabbed towers during the day and clearing out the monsters and chests that respawn every few games days, then defending your farm at night, spending the next day crafting stuff with your loot and testing your creations, defending again the next night before going out to raid different towers all over again. 

It's a fun loop of scavenging for parts to build stuff to test that stuff and then gather more parts to build new stuff. Plus, I found a bathtub in a field surrounded by cows and took it back to my base and it's now my passenger seat instead of the toilet I was using for the longest time."
20525,Great
20526,It is pretty cool
20527,i love the mechanics and i wish my frames were better when i hit another creation but overall i love the game
20528,"it's just a magnificent work of art, also fun lol"
20529,noice
20530,its a pretty fun game you can make basically everything except planting dirt anywhere except on the ground
20531,"One of the best sandbox games out there. Honestly, this game isn't worth 20$, but it is."
20532,best game to play a youtuber got me to want to play scarp man if  i was the creater of scrap mechanic i would thx him
20533,"Good, fun game. Very open to play around in creative and a good challenge in survival. Not great on a low tier computer, but still works well."
20534,"Please rename to Crap mechanic, no real tutorial, no intro no backstory, you have no clue what the hammer even does, or what can you do with it other than swing. No real goal, no idea what you can actually start with. Crap mechanic on it's best."
20535,"Great game, just binged 20+ hours this week. I'd say the one lacking factor this game is missing is a recycle system for parts you outgrow."
20536,"Great game. Not normally the type of game that I like to play but I really enjoy this game. 
Graphics are nice. The warehouse instances are a blast to play with friends.
"
20537,its epic
20538,make fire trucks and moster trucks
20539,este
20540,I LIKE IT
20541,too many bugs
20542,"This game is one of the best I've ever played, I think that this game is good for kids of all ages because this game shows them creativity and makes them use their head in a good way instead of them thinking about how they need to get the most kills. So if parents are looking for a good game for their kids to play and you don't want them playing games that involve just killing others then this is the game for you or if your just looking for a good well made game to play this is also for you."
20543,best game evver
20544,"The best vehicle building game, full stop, amazing and well worth it (Better than Gmod, Trailmakers, Brickrigs)

20555,it good game
20556,LOVE IT!
20557,This is not a review. Just a recommendation of this gem of a game because I have enjoyed it so much! If you like crafting/survival games I highly recommend giving this a go! Just watch some youtube videos to see how amazing the game is or can be. Just my opinion.
20558,me liky
20559,It brings the Heat
20560,this game is the worst but i liket.
20561,Its good
20562,sgdgdg
20563,"I do not recommend it - YET - you better wait till it's more refined before you buy. Was hosting MP survival for friends on an i7 3.6GHz with 32GB RAM, graphics at minimum and half resolution. (It's a bit dated but still)
If we didn't weld our vehicles to poles, my frames were dropping below 20fps and everyone started lagging. When ppl were scouting different directions frames dropped and everyone started lagging. Mining rocks, it's lagging. 
We built a monorail and when it was re-welded to an other pole our whole base was tilted 90 degrees and most of our stuff was below the surface - the base itself had several surface anchors but they were not considered.
Lost several resource containers because they clipped through the floor.
Well and tbh. I'm not a fan of keeping stuff like the suspension bug or free-energy machines with piston/bearing by reasoning it's for the creativity for the players. At least not in survival mode.

It was fun but also very frustrating.
It's early access so maybe I'll check again in a year or so."
20564,"HARD BUT FUN
"
20565,"This game is realistic and also fun to play with friends, with survival you can also build a great empire and its then a great game! What more could you ask for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
20566,not easy to learn for first timers. but a blast once you are in the swing of things!
20567,Car go brrrr.
20568,butiful game and fun to play

"
20570,Love it! It is such fun. Keep up the good work Axolot! :)
20571,amazing game to play with friends
20572,"The game is very enjoyable during survival and creative gives me the ability to test out before I build it in survival. I wish the game had more block types, but besides that, I think it's a very neat game."
20573,"kind of good

still good survival was ok for the first 100 hours then got easier"
20574,its never rsponding
20575,"Its an amazing game, and I've had it since it came out. If you can grind alone in survival its the right thing for you. Its nice letting your creativity free, especially with friends."
20576,Awsome game it makes you think allot
20577,Best game I have played in a long time. Spending loads of time building huge harvesting machines and iterating on them. Great fun as Coop too.
20578,Really fun! Try Co-op survival.
20579,good very nice
20580,Best game i've played so far. An Engineering MASTERPIECE
20581,it has really good graphics and is fun to play
20582,Survival is excellent. Eager to see additions of future updates.
20583,yes
20584,survival YEEEESSSSSS!!!!!! creative YESSS!!!! mix it together AWESOME!!!!!
20585,"yes
"
20586,can you see about putting not neseseraly a map but a cartography system where set up beacons that map an area.
20587,"Great game! but
when i tried to search for mod items on creative nothing showed up so wondering if you could fix that."
20588,poop
20589,Amazing Game
20590,Your imagination runs wild!
20591,Exploration is fun and kept my interest when I discover new thing. the more I discover the more I learn about new items to make!
20592,yes
20593,"One of the best sandbox games ever, yet still unlike any other. it combines reality and fun in a way i have never seen before. it makes building machines fun and painless. it is truly a game with no limit on creativity. there is no right or wrong, just good and better."
20594,"I would reccomend this game to my friends, and other people who play games like brick rigs, and survival adds a new aspect by kind of creating an almost minecraft survival feeling, but with vehicles"
20595,"this game allows it's users to build and create cool and weird creations. I would definitely recommend this game, it is kid friendly and has no violence."
20596,The game is fun for beta testing. It has some glitches and saving problems but it is a very nice game. I love the graphics and the skill and learning progression. Can't wait for more content and story line. Having fun so far.
20597,Good
20598,"Scrap Mechanic is a unique crafting survival game. It is in early access, and has been for a very long time. There are a lot of things that are missing from the game in terms of content. Honestly, it's absolutely boring unless you install mods. Modders made the game rather than the devs. The idea behind this game is building everything from the ground up. You want a car? Well you have to assemble it piece by piece. You want a turret? You have to create it block by block, and use modules that act like electric pathways that signal to receivers that allow you to control it. Want a plane? Yea that gets complicated with having to create your own yaw and roll controls. It really makes you feel like a caveman figuring out how to use a wheel. The game is extremely open ended, and that's both a good and bad thing. The only goal is to build what you want, and do what you want. The end is when you get bored. That said, the only sense of accomplishment is building something that took 10 hours to make, and it actually does what you want it to do. This is why modding the game is so important. The actual game content is so scarce, you will get bored within a few hours. It's basically mandatory to download mods. With that said, is it worth it? Fuck. No. I personally enjoy building things so adding 20+ mods doesn't bother me. To the average person wanting an enjoyable game with a story, a goal, or things to do, it's worthless. This game is so devoid of content, it should be free. I'm only recommending it because of the potential INCLUDING the mods, but think of this as a mixed response. Do not buy this for 20$. Wait for it to go on sale, or get it for free somehow. In its current state, it's absolutely worthless."
20599,so amizing
20600,epic
20601,Wasn't a huge fan - but I feel like some people could get into it
20602,"Would be great if it would quit telling me ""check your internet connection"" when i'm trying to join my roommate's game... or anyone else's game for that matter. otherwise, survival is pretty fun.

Edit: I forgot I was in steam beta. I opted out of steam beta and all my ""check your internet connection"" issues were resolved. ALL IS RIGHT"
20603,"This game is great for adventurers, creaters, and future engineers."
20604,"Scrap mechanic is an interesting premise, with a heavy focus on vehicle building and base defense, and while those are both big wins for me, I just found the game to be endlessly boring and tedious. Everything seems to be just a little too slow, just that little bit too inconvenient, far too nebulous with too little to go on, and way too little in the way of fun. I wanted to like this game, but despite its charms, it is a very vapid experience."
20605,"i do like this game because it keeps you busy when you are growing food, however i still need to learn how to build things other then that over all it is a very cool and fun game i can sucked in playing this."
20606,amen
20607,"Really fun and interesting, but keep in mind it is early access and has it's fair share of bugs. Luckily it looks like the developers actually care about making this game better, so i can't imagine it will get worse!"
20608,yes
20609,Such a good game! i just bought it because of scrapman's channel! I'm a brazilian subscriber!!!
20610,"One of my favorite games to play with friends, sadly they never play anymore"
20611,The game is good.But there are no achievements in steam this is not a big problem but I personally would be happy to get an achievement.
20612,"I'm loving this game! Who knew I always wanted to be a mechanic? Developers and designers like this astound me. I continue to be surprised at where these kind of development houses take the survival genre. I thoroughly enjoy making vehicles.

Their minimalist help guide is creative and fun, and doesn't give too much information. I am not entirely happy that the descriptions for some objects is sparse, especially when crafting them - I can't tell what is for what, or remember what I needed to make.

I do want to see more content, but who ever says the opposite? I am glad I purchased this game!"
20613,"fix the multiplayer, when I'm trying to join any of my friends game, it says ""connection failed, please check your internet"" or something  like that, the interesting and more  annoying thing  is  that my  friends can join my world, without any problem, so, where's the error message saying the thing with the internet connection and please listen to the community about their opinion on your product"
20614,bildin
20615,awesomely amazing
20616,"This is a super fun game... My friend and i played almost 100 hours making a awesome base, cool cars, auto farm, and anything else we could think of.... then the game crashed and we were never able to load it again... all that progress and time lost. The save will not load as it just keeps crashing. This has happened on 2 separate saves now... like i said its a super fun game but watch out as you can lose all progress with no notice..."
20617,"Survival drops:

Me: Nuts"
20618,"+1 star for robot smashing piston base-building fun that you never get tired of.
-1 star for requiring live internet connection to play.
-1 star for no player body modding ability.
-1 star for complete lack of customer support. (they don't respond via e-mail ) 
-1 star for no digging ability.
-1/2 star for no ability to craft projectile weapons which gets frustrating when battling wave after wave of killer robots. If you have the ability to craft rocket ships and giant transformers, why not a gun or canon?


I'm enjoying the game but I give this game almost 2 stars; if you are not a person who likes to mod things--or mod things to make more sense for the game--then you can disregard my review:
My favorite mode to play is Survival, which is the only normal-game style play where you have to defend your crops from raids by robots who think you're illegally farming. I love making piston platforms that extend down when I press a button and crush the destructive robots hanging around under my farm. Very fun for me, 

Aside from your sledge hammer you can craft everything EXCEPT weapons that work against the robots.  There is no way to craft projectile weapons for fighting the robots, and I'm unable to get any mods into the Survival mode folder for that. Mods apparently mostly just work in the Creative mode which I have no interest of ever playing. 

 I know the point of the Survival game is to spend a long time gathering crops and then through a procedure, turn them into crates to exchange with a farmer for the eventual spud gun projectile weapon you can get WAAAAAaaay later in the game, but I have a hard time staying motivating enough for that and just want to build a canon right now.
I also want to mod my character's body as an excuse to get better at low poly character modeling in Blender, but the Scrap Mechanic game people won't respond to me and no one in the modding Discords has any idea how to mod and change the player body. Apparently Scrap Mechanic has removed the ability to mod the character bodies and this is reflected in the steam Workshop where there is no category for player modding, only block modding.   Not my thing. 

I continue to enjoy playing this game but I don't recommend it to anyone else, now, as I can't fully enjoy a game unless I can mod the characters in it.

Also, without having a projectile weapon in this game or the ability to set any kind of traps other than a piston platform back at base, I'm going to lose interest in this game and stop playing it soon. 
yeah, I know there's a spud gun, but I'm not interested in spending 90+ hours in game to earn it when I would rather be exploring, joy riding, battling and crafting.

  I'll probably end up dropping the cash to buy Space Engineers instead because supposedly that game still lets you mod the player bodies, but their survival mode is lacking monster raids and apparently takes a lot to mod that into their game.. but at least you can."
20619,Is crap mechanic
20620,I recommend this game.
20621,very nice
20622,its epic
20623,It is great. I loved it before the update. Survival is amazing. It is worth paying for. I have over 300 hours of this game it never gets boring and I have never gotten tired of it. This is my favorite game and I would 100% recommend this game to anyone having any doubt about buying it.
20624,"i like the game,its fun but you have to add more block different block and buildings"
20625,This game is very hard to learn.I havent mastered this game yet.But definetly deserves the money.The workshop makes this game better
20626,"Do you want to build vehicles or bases with unlimited resources? This game can do it. Do you want to build vehicles or bases whilst grinding for all resources and fighting off robots? This game can do it! Do you want to spend hours creating a vehicle to pass a challenge level and still fail? This game can do it!! 

This game is an 8/10."
20627,"this game is my fav game ive been playing loads it is adventures it has loads of cool things in its a great game 
"
20628,"excellent game, still requires some additional updates with more blocks and possibly more functions but other than that really enjoyable game"
20629,i liked it because i liked it.
20630,"it is such a good game
"
20631,fun makes you think not just shoot
20632,"I love this game for what it allows you to create and the ways you can go about building the things you can imagine but sadly it isn't all positives. I'll just list a couple of things that a group of us thought of while playing the game.

1 - Hunger and thirst was a huge problem for any more than 2 of us. Plants wouldn't grow fast enough, we barely got any food from the crates and we just ended up dying a lot. On top of that, respawning with only 30% of all bars is fine and all in concept but given the game's lack of accessible foods, we could barely do anything enjoyable. We would die of starvation or thirst from our characters healing themselves which in turn lowers the hunger and thirst bars faster. If it were increased to 50% on respawn it would be more fair to players as well as those bars generally going down half as fast. We came to these particular suggestions after changing the games code ourselves to find a level that was comfortable but still challenging.

2 - Multiplayer being a bit awkward sometimes. Things like funky playermodel animations, nametags bouncing around, elastic-banding making the game feel wonky to play for those joining friends. I've heard a few people saying that this game isn't optimised well and, sadly, I kind of have to agree with them after seeing certain simple machines create massive amounts of lag for everyone. I've also heard points thrown around about how certain parts of the game are made to load and function client-side instead of server-side which causes more issues.

3 - Anything being bigger than a truck hitting your fps like a truck. I love this game, I do, but when I want to make larger machines or have an idea of, say, a mobile base (which I'm generally a fan of, anyway), I do my thing and I manage to build it with relative ease in a simple way as to attempt to not make my game lag but no matter what it's made of or how it moves or anything like that, my game can barely handle it. And it's not even a case of my computer being unable to handle it, either. I've been playing game that should be far more demanding for years, now. I've actually handed the machine over to someone with a better PC than myself and it basically broke their game entirely.

Aside from that and a few little nitpicks, I do like this game if you couldn't tell by the amount I've played it while writing this. But, yeah, I'd recommend it. Give it shot, I guess. It is only in 0.4.5 as I wrote this."
20633,"Lot of fun!!  Still needs a little tweaking.  A map would be great, but most Survival worlds are random, so beacons maybe?"
20634,Pure unadulterated FUN.
20635,you can build whatever you want
20636,"It's just quite boring.
Unless I played it with friends it wasn't possible to have fun, and for 14$ it's not worth it.
Spend your money somewhere else."
20637,calm game
20638,Brain Power 100%. Brain Capacity 0%.
20639,Its very good game
20640,Its So Fun! You Can Do Alot Of Things

20645,e
20646,its pretty dope
20647,good
20648,yes :)
20649,such an awesome game
20650,a lil buggy but rly fun w friends
20651,"Bought it when survival launched (at that point this became a ""proper"" game). 

It is great fun with friends. The game is centered around gathering resources and building creative bases and vehicles. A main gameplay loop is to make a small farm where you plant various plants (that you need to purchase weapons that you will need to raid some warehouses for special loot). This causes your base to be raided by bots at midnight. And the more you plant, the larger the raids (so you are forced to balance how much you expand). This works well.

The longevity of the game comes down to the creative aspects, and how much you enjoy building things.
You can easily build quite advanced machines, as you even have logic blocks and timers that you can use.

Downsides:
* Still beta.
* Could use more varied environments/set pieces to explore in the world, and perhaps a bit more end-game content (seems a bit more is on the way here).
* Various physics-related bugs/problems can cause severe lag issues or delays for clients or drops in framerate (seems to be more likely when suspension pieces are involved). Mostly a problem in late game, but hopefully this will be improved in the future, but considering how long the game has existed I am a bit worried for this one."
20652,"Fantastic Game, very much enjoy the new survival mode. So many possibilities and things to do and it only just came out!"
20653,"I can really get sucked into this one. Grab a friend and play!

Update: they added way points which makes it easier to direct yourself back home! 

Excited to see more updates to come."
20654,"I got this game about 2 years before the survival update and kind of stopped playing in the first year but with the survival update, i have been playing much more than before, i would HIGHLY recommend."
20655,load screen simulator
20656,so when i travel and i have my respawn bed with me there is a chance that i respawn to my last check point but my bed is still there but IT's A VERY GOOD GAME
20657,"Total playtime sky-rocketed when survival released, and it won‚Äôt stop rising for a long time. 10/10"
20658,"i like to build the stuff and the things, very good"
20659,its super fun best game i ever played
20660,very fun game survival scary with out friends creative very fun as well.
20661,"Can't join friends, only loads to 30% and says network connection lost."
20662,Currently im playing during early access so there are definently som bugs and glitches that need to be worked out but even then its a very fun game
20663,"mechanic by day, scrap mechanic by night"
20664,FUN GAME needs more content tho
20665,Everything was fun until you reach the moon (but u won't)
20666,great game dont need that good of a PC to play
20667,.
20668,THIS GAME IS AWESOME
20669,RECOMMEND 100%
20670,"I love the new survival mode, but I always Never have enough materials and I sometimes want to test my creations against farmbots but I can't make it Again in survival, so i came up with an Idea what if you could select a setting in the survival world creator and when you did you could customize your world and you would spawn with a special block that would allow you to have the creative inventory and it would work for crafting and making food and all that it would just bypass all the requirements and you could keep making whatever you want! metal 3? you got it! and I also thought that this would be to easy so I thought that you could make everything harder, farmbots more common loot crates barely exist and garment boxes where harder to get too! I thought that as well as all this you could make special blocks that would mark out the area of your creative inventory also in this area you aren't immortal so you can't just place it down and survive,
and I thought that as well as upgrading the dressbot you could upgrade your clothes as well and there was another part to the dress bot so you can make armor that looks like clothes but functions like armor! i really hope this helped someone create a mod or something or that something like this actually happens!"
20671,g
20672,"The game is grindy but very fun and interesting. Good tip, let your creative brain think of the idea, use your work brain to exacute the building and construction of it."
20673,very good and nice graphics
20674,e
20675,A M A Z I N G !
20676,"It's very early in development but Scrap Mechanic is super addictive, charming, and very smart. Building a capable vehicle is the culmination of hard work farming the materials, and smart design choices - and because of that it always feels super rewarding to hop into your own creation and find out IT WORKS. 


I'm really looking for a place to post feedback to the devs with ideas for future features I'd love to see. I think a game like this has so much potential and I'd love to be able to float ideas."
20677,"love it




"
20678,Great fun! You can lose track of time playing. I greatly enjoy the survival mode.
20679,"game is broken cannot use survival mode at all, devs seem uninterested in fixing the issue"
20680,fum
20681,"I was born wrong.......













great game"
20682,"really fun game had it about 4 years, just one thing : if axolot see's this please before anything else add lan play, both me my brother and my dad have this game; and cant play together because their is no lan play.

edit: 0.4.7 has arrived still 2-4 second between pressing forward and moving forward on multiplayer, and no lan. still recommend! best played solo sadly, because of delay and no lan."
20683,"it is verry fun, survival is scary but fun"
20684,Ive loved everything.
20685,amazing game realy fun
20686,SCRAP MECHANIC IS THE BEST YOU CAN TRAID FOR SPUD GUN'S AND SPUN SHOTGUN AND THE SPUD GATTER
20687,"If you like to play with physics, and create what ever you want with the given blocks, this game is an absolute YES! in creative mode.

Though I bought the game for the survival mode. It is hard, it is really hard, especially when playing it solo. But, well, that how it is. What turned me off in the end - same reason as for Astroneer - NO ORIENTATION. The survival map is huge! But they don't even give you a compass. The buildings are randomized and basically all look the same, so they don*t help with orientation. The road does fork to often to get any indication of where you are currently or where you need to go. No beacons to mark a breadcrum trail either. After dying a shit ton of times and had a run back of about 8 minutes, I decided to find some cotton to craft a bed... my journey brought me to some bushed eventually. But now I was totally lost and could not find my way back... I could have died to respawn at the starting point, but unfortunately on the journey I accidentally saved in one of the beds on another workshop. Dying would leave me without anything, 9h into the game for nothing."
20688,"3.5/5

This game has a lot of potential and is quite enjoyable. 

Good things:

-Decent pricing and content for early access
-A lot of possibilities for future content (Game isn't designed to be too restricted)
-You can build some crazy things depending on your imagination

Bad things:

-Survival Mode is a bit easy when you have infinite lives. Out of food/energy... just drop dead and come back.
-Before any additional content needs to be added, dedicated servers or lag issues need to be resolved. Game becomes unbearable to play after a certain amount of building and etc. This is amplified in multiplayer and even worse in survival mode, especially during defense time. This is where I take 1.5 stars away. You can add more additional content but you can't enjoy anything if you glitch half the time or by the time you develop yourself enough to use or build these things, the game is too laggy. 

I come from a small gaming community and we'll return once this issue is dealt with.
"
20689,yep
20690,amazing
20691,i like it very much. as many people say it is like minecraft but with cars. i would suggest more improvements to the survival but it has only just released. i reccommend it 10/10
20692,gg
20693,i love it
20694,"This is incredibly fun to play around with, like the Minecraft Redstone system but with more possibilities and less of a learning curve.  Not to mention that Survival is an incredibly unique experience. Major thumbs up."
20695,"So, I may be biased coming from Space Engineers, Ark, and 7 Days to Die. The game is a lot of fun and there's a lot to do and explore but it has a lot of drawbacks that make me feel like I won't be playing it for very long. 

The Bad:

Not a ton of content
The game has a static survival map and a lot of the loot and mobs respawn in virtually the same places after so long. There's a lot to do and explore, but a lot of the places and things to explore are virtually identical. It's still a lot of fun but it made me quick to stale for exploration. 

Too Grindy
All survival games are a grind, we all know this. However Scrap Mechanic takes it a little too far. It feels like I am working, not playing. The harvesting is slow, the automated systems still require a lot of ground work and grinding, and the vehicles require too much fuel that is very grindy to obtain itself to do far too little. In the end it's this that I think will tear my interest in the game up because I love building unique vehicles for the task at hand but a single simple vehicle will accomplish as much as a complicated one, so there's just no point and not a lot of innovation needed. There's no way to upgrade tools either, so the speed is constant and very slow. 

Limited Vehicle Creativity Needed
As previously mentioned, the vehicles don't speed up production all that much. They open new resources and allows for a lot of better and faster resources, but it's still slow, grindy, and arduous. Even with that, there's only one real allowance for tools of each type, meaning that there's not a lot of reason to go all out in design or to make special vehicles. In fact, thanks to the easy removal of parts mechanic, really one vehicle is all you need. Further, with only 3 types of wheel, all a little clunky, and thrusters that don't quite do enough considering fuel costs. It's all very tedious work. 

Block Inventory is Bad
As much fun as it is to place all your things around in junkyard fashion to store them, the block storage capacities are horrible. Many items don't stack or only stack to very small amounts, and the amount of available item slots until you start producing large storage bins is abhorrent. It leads to a lot of back and forth trips to places to gather items, tons of junkyard hells, vehicle storage capacity issues, and generally just serves to make the apparent grindiness of the game exacerbated. 

Static Adventure Map
My final major negative note is that the map isn't huge, it's static, and it's not a sandbox. This means you are limited to the same island, it will never change, you can't create a happy landscape for what you dream of as the perfect base, and there's not tons of replay value. Combined with the grindiness, expiration date on exploration excitement, and the lack of creativity needed to thrive it really creates a combo for a tapering off of interest for me personally. 

Minor Note: No Tool Tips
Recipes don't allow for a mouse over text, so if you're missing an ingredient you have to try to puzzle out the image of the ingredient and hope you can track it down or there's a wiki out there to help you out. A minor gripe, but a big one. 

--------------------------------

However, all said and done, the games a lot of fun. It's unique, silly, intuitive, allows for a lot of creativity, has massive potential, very streamlined and easy to play, and has a lot of great features you don't see a lot in other games. Add to all of that the game gets incredibly more fun with other players and it's already an awesome game. My personal hope is that as it develops all of the things I listed will be remedied and this game will become a powerhouse of entertainment on par with any other survival game. 

I had a lot of bad to say, but make no mistake, this game has far more positives than negatives. It's well worth the purchase and as time goes on it's only likely to get even better. Well worth the price tag."

20712,Fun
20713,"The best way I can describe survival in this game is unintuitive and frustrating. I am new to this game and will describe my experience. You spawn by a wrecked ship on fire with no signs that it is salvageable. A path of items leads you away from the ship as if to say ""that part of the game is over now go explore"". I quickly found I was unable to do much if anything and it took a friend of mine telling me you can put out your the ship to get me playing again. There are buckets in the world. Nothing pops up around them as you look at them and they appear to be static objects I had to watch a YouTube video to figure out that you can even interact with them. There is no tutorial at all. They will not teach you how to interact with the world. Finally getting to putting out the ship I find that the flames turned invisible and I had to guess where the flames were by running around and figuring out where I was dying. That wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to go down an inconvenient cliff every time you had to fiil the bucket only to go back and burn yourself in invisible flames again. Finally, the ship is put out and I find that I can't craft a single block anyway and despite the crafting station there and powering the ship. No indication of how to progress is present. This developer did a great job with Raft. Unfortunately, Scrap Mechanic doesn't seem to get the same attention despite its age.

I am judging this game based on my experience with other alpha survival experiences. Most others that I have played like Green Hell, Subnautica, and Raft to name a few. Have been more feature-complete per addition to the game. So far the survival release has been a disappointment."

20731,I love the survival gamemode and i like how they made things very detailed
20732,"Its a good game you can literally build whatever you want, i've built 18 nukes now."
20733,a very fun game
20734,"So i love how they added survival mode in this game its actually pretty fun... You can build anything as long as you have an imagination or youtube lol. The biggest problem is the rubber banding when you play multiplayer if you host your fine if you don't then your boned. I been playing a few days with my buddy, He hosted it and the first week was good no lag no issues. Now that we have more and more building things i constantly lag i get kicked out every 5-10min and i have to relog. It becomes more of a pain than enjoyment. If they can fix that issue maybe host on their own servers so it wont lag it be an Epic Game."
20735,Very fun game to play
20736,great game

20746,it is really fun and its just amazing to see what other people have made.
20747,"Po√§ng: The Little-Known History Of Ikea‚Äôs Most Famous Chair.

With its bentwood frame, cantilevered seat, and curved backrest, the Po√§ng chair is one of Ikea‚Äôs most recognizable pieces. The Swedish furniture maker has produced over 30 million Po√§ng chairs since it debuted in 1976, and it continues to sell about 1.5 million every year‚Äìthe company‚Äôs bestselling armchair‚Äìnot bad for a design that‚Äôs settling squarely into middle age.

So what, exactly, made the Po√§ng a commercial success and an instant icon for Ikea? The secret lies in a genius concept that‚Äôs been gently updated with the times. The company doesn‚Äôt normally put individual designers in the spotlight, but for the Po√§ng‚Äôs 40th birthday, it did.

Japanese designer Noboru Nakamura is the creator of the Po√§ng. He came to Ikea in 1973 to learn more about Scandinavian furniture‚Äìand there, he collaborated with Lars Engman, the director of design at the company, on a chair that would use plywood veneer construction. In a video interview, Nakamura, who left Ikea in 1978 to start his own furniture company, describes how the chair came about.

‚ÄúI learned by experience that a cantilever consisting of a U-shaped structure could, with a person, swing to some extent with the use of molded plywood, and I wanted it to swing in an elegant way, which triggered me to imagine Po√§ng,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA chair shouldn‚Äôt be a tool that binds and holds the sitter; it should be a tool that provides us emotional richness. [Po√§ng] creates an image where we let off stress or frustration by swinging. Such movement has meaning and value.‚Äù

The final silhouette resembled Alvar Aalto‚Äòs Model 406 chair of 1939, but in lieu of a webbed or caned seat, the Po√§ng sported thin upholstery.

‚ÄúWhile the design has remained largely unchanged since its inception, this iconic product has undergone some alterations to make it more accessible, more affordable, more relevant, and to increase the quality,‚Äù says Mark Bond, deputy range manager of living rooms at Ikea.

There have been tweaks to the upholstery color and pattern to keep the chair relevant with consumer tastes, but the biggest change happened in 1992. The chair‚Äôs seat was originally made from tubular steel, but in the early ‚Äô90s, the company switched to an all-wood frame and also narrowed the size. This allowed the chair to be flat packed‚Äìa move that reduced the price by 21% for customers (it‚Äôs actually less expensive now than it was when it launched). That same year, Ikea changed the chair‚Äôs original name, Poem, to Po√§ng.

‚ÄúThe evolution has always been design-focused, thinking of this product not as a fashion item but rather adhering to and improving upon the classic design,‚Äù Bond says.

Considering that the Po√§ng routinely shows up in houses, apartments, dorm rooms, and anywhere you need to kick up your feet, Nakamura‚Äôs emphasis on an emotionally rich chair‚Äìand Ikea‚Äôs affordability-minded engineering‚Äìhave proven to be a winning combination. To honor the design, the company is selling a limited-edition version of the chair, with a grasscloth-like cushion cover much like the inaugural offering had in 1976, starting in September.

Like the recently opened Ikea museum, that fanfare around the Po√§ng‚Äôs design shows how the furniture company is beginning to demystify some of the genius that‚Äôs contributed to its history‚Äìa welcome change that gives some of the most ubiquitous products in the world the same pedigree as pieces that cost many hundreds of dollars more."
20748,its fun
20749,e
20750,awesome game
20751,"feels like ive played for a night when its nearly 100 hours later. Endless potential. A great lil builder that rewards the clever. If you are a fan of KSP, Besiege, and the like, then this is the game youve been wanting to play all along and just didnt realize it yet. I cant wait to see what the devs roll out in future content patches. A Solid 7.5/10 for an early access game! Well worth the investment."
20752,If you want to play the survival mode you should wait until it's updated even further. There are still a lot of bugs and the survival mode is not polished at all. Survival mode is way too hard right now because you don't have any crafting options to get yourself all necessities like food or water. And its even harder to upgrade your craft machine to get the items needed to make food and collect water. So you have to restart your world multiple times until you're lucky enough to find the stuff which you need early on to get things running.

20754,"There are still to many things not included in the survival part of the game to really be good enough.

but if you want the sandbox then thats good enough. 
but the survival part is lacking a lot and have plenty o bugs and at the time of this review many of the resources needed are slow to be gathered (unable to be automated, like farming can be automated, but oil gathering cannot)

so i would wait till the survival is more fleshed out."
20755,"Engineers: I built this working mech in survival that shoots explosives.
Me: Haha Wooden box goes brrrr"
20756,I LOVE IT
20757,It's nice
20758,the game is fantastic i have almost 100 hours and i have been enjoying survival mode a lot

20763,"This is my brief thoughts of the game in survival, I'm not a creative mode fan in any game and spent max 8h in it and this for testing purposes only.

This game is like Pringles ""One you pop, you can't stop"" for real, 98h last 2 weeks *thank you Social Distancing*
Survival is still pretty bare boned and lacks a lot of the bits and pieces that Creative Mode offers and mod support is not yet there (any easy way).
But even so, you can tell that only imagination will set the limit for what you do and build ingame.
(well you can go creative to get it all + a whole workshop to play with) 
but as said, if I'm not stabbed in the back or hunted while gathering resources I loose interest fast ^^

There are of cource bad things in game, optimization being one, huge fps drops with machines that have to many bearings/shocks and moving parts.
But as said, it's EA and no real point in optimizing something that will be undone next week with additions to the game.

I recomend the game as it is, i have a lot of fun in it, both solo and with friends.
But if you want a ""survival game"" with all the bells and whistles, lagfree enviroment and a juicy main story?
Well you better wait a bit for further development since you will get none of that.
What you get is a fun game that urges you to learn how things work, and use your imagination to create something with that =)"
20764,good game
20765,i dont know what happend but i havent played the game for a while and as the survival update came out i logged on my old account and i dont own it anymore and i realy liked the game i just dont wanna spend another 30 bucks on this game that i allredy had
20766,real gud
20767,"Good fun, Has a fun dungeon"
20768,Nice game
20769,"Good game, but add  map =)))"
20770,"This is a mixed bag of a game, it has fun/easy building as well as wiring mechanics but also doesn't very much develop itself in the physics side of the game (aerodynamics/flying, impact damage, etc).

And this game has a survival mode, which I must say is fun for the first runthrough to the warehouse, then it just loses its glimmer."
20771,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, NICE TO PLAY WITH OTHERS AS MUCH AS ON YOUR OWN , BUT THE LAG AND THE CONSTANT KICK OFF FOR OTHERS PLAYING IN YOUR GAME IS VERY ANNOYING TO SAY THE VERY LEAST."
20772,GREAT GAME
20773,"It is so creative, you should give it a try"
20774,this is literally the most addicting game ever. LOVE.
20775,Definitely recommend going in blind on this one.  The game is quite intuitive and the road provides a great tutorial experience.  As you progress you can feel  your options open up and it becomes a rewarding feeling.   Havent played long enough to give a final opinion but the opening experience is great.
20776,"This game is great! Its a shame you cant play it offline considering i dont have the most stable internet. And because i cant play offline i will sadly have to dock 2 stars. Witch is a shame. If the whole offline thing gets fixed ill change my review to what this game achualy deserves

I give it a 3/5

Highly recomend if you have stable internet. If not. Might wana hold off on geting the game"
20777,amazing sandbox and survival game there are so many things to do!
20778,"just meh.  the survival game is boring.  the definition of wonky.  the creative might be fun, but the survival aspect gets old too quick.  better with friends."
20779,idk.
20780,"A lot of potential, and since this review made during early stage (this game).  There's not much thing to do beside farm and grinding gears for you creative nerd. Cars specifically. More fun with friends.

Recommend."
20781,very like this game
20782,good
20783,Interesting game but a bit lagging during raids and a lot of glitches to be fixed
20784,amazing
20785,"its fun play it it has a new update 
"
20786,"It's a fun game. Not too serious, the crafting isn't super involved but it's complex enough to not be just a kids game only."
20787,"Fun Game
Be creative
Frustrating at some points like turning your car accidentally onto a Catherine wheel and watch it fly into the sunset..... with cargo attached."
20788,It is good
20789,good ja
20790,"Started playing when the survival update dropped, It's been a really good experience both solo and with friends. Excited to see what the future updates bring, but as it stands (0.4.4) the game is well worth the pricetag in it's current state."
20791,"AWESOME GAME

20801,I love it
20802,"8 hours in so far, and its been super enjoyable.  As long as the Devs remain active and engaged, this game will be a masterpiece!  9/10"
20803,"I've played other survival games out there like Ark, Last Oasis, and Raft and none of those have engaged me as much as this game has. The building system really puts this game out from the rest and with a balanced looting system that makes you venture out and explore the world other than smacking trees for hours. I would say this is easily one of my favorite survival games."
20804,"100% fun as hell! really gets ya mind going !! 

Only played 50+ hours but really enjoyed this game would be nice to see maybe Open Party play popping up so we can meet new people and play along with them as right now its just Friend play, but the game is still fun solo or with a few friends. it has a few bugs but im sure the dev team will fix them i have not seen any mega downside to this game yet but will update if i come a crossed anything thats need to do told! but right now! 9/10* worth the time and the money!"
20805,.
20806,It's just yes.
20807,absolutely adore this game
20808,Fun game for the money!
20809,"Survival is Unbalanced Mess
Component kits are rare and u realy need them a lot even more if u lost/ or get u car destroyed.
Cant save cars so u lost it and all the work u have done for it.

Fuel Usage! is Crazy!! 1-2min driving lost 10fuel,  and u cant mine/vacuum fuel automaticaly so u have to grind those manualy.

Some minor lag sometimes.

no map

3/10  Very early! Unbalance Mess"

20811,I love this game. To me its like if a more terrestrial version of space engineers and Minecraft had a baby. To me that's Scrap Mechanic. It was the first game I just bought with my first gaming laptop. I love it.
20812,Fun time waster!
20813,"Very Nice!

Altough the playtime reset since the survival update. was about 1400 before"

20846,"I fundamentally love the game at its core, truly amazing game. But the multiplayer surival needs HUGE work to be done to it. Its incredibly fun until about the 3rd or 4th or 5th person joins your game and the game starts rubber banding. Also huge rubber banding issues whenever raids spawn all in at once to destroy your crops. Its basically unplayable if youre not just playing by yourself or with just one other friend. We‚Äôve also had issue with our game crashing and then trying to log back into it and the save gets corrupted and unplayable so we‚Äôve had to make backups of the save files just in case but its really defeating when you have hours of work put into something only to have it deleted and start over again and again. I dont think this game‚Äôs survival mode is ready yet, would not get the game just for survival if you have a group of friends. Creative is fun solo though."
20847,"Its like Minecraft meets Besiege, I've had too much fun with game in Survival mode and looking forward to more updated in it as well."

20850,"- The instructions are quite sketchy but for quite creative
- There should be an online part for other players to play together instead of just playing together among friends
"
20851,Great Game.
20852,It is very good
20853,"I had a lot of fun with this game, flexing some good ol' brain muscles I long forgot to flex.  I do have two complaints, however.  One is the warehouse.  Not every player has an army of friends at their disposal to call upon for assistance, so unfortunately I attempted to raid a four story warehouse solo.  Yes, I did have a spudgun and plenty of ammo.  I do not think it's particularly fair to solo players to fill a location to the brim with enemies that can effectively 2-shot them.  I've had many instances of turning a bad corner to a face-full of tape, only to desperately try to run back inside before dying of hunger and thirst from a my vehicle parked just outside (Equipped with a bed of course.)  After a few dozen deaths, I did manage to find the loot room on the fourth floor.  I hauled my loot back to base and quit for the night, exhausted, but ready to plant the broccoli and pineapple seeds the next day.  Unfortunately... the most recent update has rendered my save unloadable.  Attempting to load in results in a CTD.

Short version: Tapebots deal too much damage (55) per shot and saves are unstable after updates, but everything else is still fun.

Edit: Every time you re-enter the crafting bot's interface, the selected recipe to craft is the wiring tool.  So if you get in a rush and oh, say, accidentally create extras... you're stuck with them.  You can't cancel the crafting process. You can't remove tools from your inventory, save by sticking them into a chest.  So be careful about not pressing that craft button!"
20854,i love it
20855,nice
20856,it a good game
20857,Scrap mechanic is a great game if you want to build something that is cool and mechanical. its great for a creative mind and i definitely remommend this game
20858,"You can still tell its a pre-release game sometimes, but survival mode is really a lot of fun!"
20859,"Do you like survival games? Games with automation? Being able to build cool things? Workshop content? If you answered yes to these questions then this is the game for you!

Scrap Mechanic takes a bunch of features from survival/building/sandbox games and takes it in its own direction. There is automation, actuators, logic, and control while also managing resources, defending your base, and making sure you have enough food and water to live another day. Is survival too stressful and you just want to go build cool things? Take a break and head to creative, where you can not only save your creations, but you can upload and share them to others for them to use. Not only this, but you can even custom create world with a ton of unique map tiles to suit your automated theme park! Oh, and did I mention it is multiplayer AND in early access with many free updates to come?

tl;dr - buy the game with your friends (or solo) if you enjoy games with creative building, automation, and sandbox survival modes"
20860,It a really cool feature when you press alt f4
20861,great!
20862,"great fun if you like getting yer noggin joggin with some logic gates n fun crafting. you can make almost anything in this game. 
cons: i think survival mode is lacking a a variety of blocks which limits your ability to be creative and some resources (glue clam and crude oil) are really boring to gather and aren't really possible to significantly improve gathering for, which takes away from the spirit of the game imho. 
Grinding for materials is slower in this game than others despite the fact that you can make some insane contraptions to gather resources, you can get somewhat fast but there is one big hindrance.And the one major downfall, gasoline. In this game you must dive to the bottom of the ocean constantly to gather crude oil which can be crafted to fuel. it's slow and there is no good way to do it better that i know of. This could change fast though, game is constantly getting updates at the moment. Also, engines need more directional inputs, to make something as simple as an aiming turret using WASD you gotta combine sensors and a stick which results in delayed weird controls. alternatively put the WASD logic gate mod into the game by default because i feel like that takes a lot of potential out of the vanilla experience."
20863,yess
20864,Buy It
20865,Its awsome! but multiplayer i kinda laggy
20866,"Lovely game, the survival is great besides the getting glue part."
20867,greaT 60000/1
20868,"The game is great.  Except for the horrible lag.  It's damn near impossible to play.  I play with 2 others, some days, we just rubberband around the game.  Get a little frustrated, maybe die.  Other days, we can move, but the game doesn't register our last action for, say eating or drinking, or sitting in a vehicle, or placing an item, at least 1-2 minutes.  Before you say, did you check your connections or did you see if you were capable to play it on your machine, yes.  We checked.  We had each host a game and same issues all around.  If they could fix the lag problems, it would be an awesome game!  Even with the lack of content at this moment in the development."
20869,its amazing just surivival is a bit jlichy but they probably fixed it by then
20870,"I like this game because you can do so much stuff this game is great there are some bugs tho.
I really hope this comes to my ipad and ps4 I would re buy I saw chaco taco playing and had to give it a go."
20871,"Very Enjoyable

Edit: still very enjoyable"

20876,fun. Really in depth.
20877,It's a fun game to play with friends. It can be hard at first but once you figure out how everything works it is not that bad. 10\10 would recommend.

Game summary -  after a crash landing, you land in a world were robots will destroy your crops if you build to much. You have to go out and seek for new materials by adventuring through the world."
20889,"Good start to survival. Needs a lot of improvements, but is entertaining for a few sessions."
20890,very fun game to get lost in and really fun building mechanics
20891,I downloaded this game after the MINUTE it released and I gotta say the game is pretty c00l
20892,bestest steam game ever
20893,This game is so fun
20894,"When this game is more complete, I hope I can change this review, but unfortunately it isn't just bugs in survival mode that make it not fun to play, but also core game mechanics. The farming system seems alright at first, but the raids that the farmbots do on your crops really take away from time you could spend exploring and gathering materials to fulfill your goal of being a mechanic. The way this system works it makes the player feel more like a farmer than a mechanic. The game is still in development, so it's hard to complain about there being no intro or advice on what to do, but the fact that this game is in development shouldn't make it so that the player must rely on looking up what to do in order to actually fully enjoy the game.  A prime example of this is the big red mining robots, there's no way for the player to know that you need the spud gun without taking a random guess or finding out through dying to it. Despite this being a negative review, I believe this game (survival mode I mean) is in its extremely early stages of development. A friend and I played it despite the horrendous lag (especially in warehouses) and enjoyed it for a short time. The recommended specifications might be a bit too low, but I cannot be sure of this. All I can recommend to people looking to buy this is to be patient and wait for it to fully release, then decide whether to buy it or not."

20916,this game is awsome . I was watching the stream of Chocotaco and the other day i purchased this game . I love playing this game and loved the idea behind making all the stuff ingame...
20917,this is the best game ever made i love it its great its awsome i love building and when minecraft got too boring i went and played this and the enginering made it better sorry for bad gramer
20918,:)
20919,"What an awesome Solo or Co-op game!  
Well worth the $20 or so (with extremely high replay value).
Kid-friendly but addictive for grownups too.
It's a game, but also a mini science lab / teaching & exploration tool for all things mechanical and basic logic programming.

This game is a step beyond Minecraft in every way, yet very similar to Minecraft (both Creative and Story Mode) in concept.  Also similar to Portal Knights, DragonQuest Builders 2, CreatiVerse, and other exploring, crafting, surviving, building, light-combat titles.
I think the Devs actually are the same ones that ported Mincreaft from PC onto console? But then created this to take things even further both fun-wise and educationally.

The Creative sandbox mode is so much fun, but the Survival mode introduced in 2020 is VERY well done without being overbearing or obnoxious.
Great community as well.

Highly recommend for yourself, or for a young mechanic or scientist under your wing.
Minecraft is used in some schools as an educational aid, but this simply outdoes Minecraft on practically every level, and takes the education piece to quite another degree.
Co-op mode is phenomenal to collaborate on projects, basic farming and surviving (you enter Co-op from within Steam by Shift+Tab and click to invite your Steam friends into the game).

It has been sitting in my Steam Library for a long time, but after the Survival mode was recently introduced I finally gave it a fair go, and cannot put it down.

Until proper Controller support is added, just use Xpadder or Controller Companion or something (I created an Xpadder profile in 10min that works very well and is similar to Win10 Minecraft controls).

I HIGHLY recommend it.  An easy 10/10."
20920,Really enjoyable game for survivalists and has a very promising future to come.
20921,yes
20922,"/

20923,"Excellent game, lots of options, like minecraft, creations for days. Very fun and lots of potential."
20924,Its fun
20925,mlg
20926,"Its fun, kinda hard on lag tho"
20927,it good
20928,This is a excellent game even though still in early access so some features don't work how you think they should (for now). Best way to describe this game is Meccano as mechanical construction creating over just structures building which would be Minecraft. and the survival mode great edition to the game with bot fights and having to find resources. My only complaint's is you can't make everything in creative to test for survival and no way to find other players in game menus.
20929,"Its a very relaxing, minimalist survival PvE game, which you can play with your friends.
OK, a few minor bad points, some bugs, as to be expected, but, the majority of the game seems to be very challenging re: automation,and extremely enjoyable. 
There is a fair bit of documentation and videos to watch on Youtube. so if you do get stuck, all is not lost.
The community is really friendly and helpful, and recently there have been a few updates to the game, so it seems like the devs are listening and tweaking the game to fix broken stuff.
"
20930,is great
20931,if you like minecraft you will love this for sure
20932,"Play solo or team up with friends to create anything you can imagine in a great sandbox. With the introduction of survival, many new features have been added and you can now survive in an open world environment. An amazing game with good developers and constant updates."
20933,"Hello, I've been playing this game since the game is out. I'm very happy about the survival mode but I wish there were finally better water physics. When i build a watermill to move my boat, i also expect it to move. I hope you take care of it!"
20934,cool sandbox game
20935,It's really fun and you can be as creative as you want!
20936,Great Game thats all to say!!!

20939,yes
20940,one of a kind
20941,great game!
20942,"A very fun, quirky survival game with a complex building system to unlock. I'll be spending many hours as a scrappy dwarf."
20943,"best game, you must try it"
20944,the game will look fun but it gets old quick because the lack of content on survival mode becuase there is no objective no motivation to do anything just be there i tried soo hard to have fun but i couldnt maybe it is more enjoyable with friends but i dont have friends to play it with so this is my review of the game
20945,this is an amazing game to play similar to Minecraft but way different building to survive and able to build vehicles and devices with simple logic while still presenting a challenge in a unique way the laws of gravity apply in the game is amazing i simply like the way its made.
20946,minecraft 2.0
20947,"Amazing game, would recommend to anyone who likes quirky game mechanics.

The new addition of survival mode was long awaited by me and many others. It is a amazing addition to the game and if you were to buy it, I would buy it now. There's so much to mess around with in survival.

Thanks Axolot.

20948,xtra gud
20949,There is a lot more to this game than expected
20950,I totally recommend this game. Best with friends.
20951,"I'm fairly new when it comes to Scrap Mechanic Survival and what i have played so far tbh has been really enjoyable. You can build some crazy machines and bases. I think i'd have to use the term ""Survival"" loosely as i found it easy to survive altho that might be due to the amount of hrs i've spent in 7dtd and the similar genre. My only complaint really would have to be the random lag spikes and stuttering that seem to get worse as i play the game to the point i can no longer play. I've changed my gfx settings from low to high and nothing works and even though i have a system that runs high end games with no issue this game lags and stutters like i was playing it on a low end system. My hope is the devs are working on it. Survival has only been out a short time and like most games in EA games will experience problems. To me it feels like a bad memory leak so yeah i hope they sort it soon because it's become game breaking for me and this is why i cannot recommend until they fix it. :(

I would suggest sticking it on your wishlist for now and keeping a eye on what ever bug fixes the devs have done."
20952,Good Game
20953,Man I love this game. I have had the game for 20 days and have 200 hours in it already. I cant wait for  the new content to be added to the game as it matures.
20954,sick gme
20955,the gameis amazing
20956,"Great Fun, would highly recommend. On that note, some things I find totally annoying after more time in both modes.. Stuff that you rely on in survival, the collectors, pumps and whole systems are not available in creative to prototype stuff in survival. This seems to be a horrible oversight hopefully, and if it's intentional, what are you thinking Devs.. If you need a lesson on survival/creative games, see Empyrion, they do it right."
20957,"The game is so good I have persisted through  80+ PC crashes in 120hrs! I am so sad to have to delete this game, it runs terrible. My PC is way above min spec, I have everything set to low, makes no difference. Game hangs, locks up PC, hard reset required. Been through every forum fix. Lost tens of hours of worlds and had to recreate new ones, and now finally had a day of it running smoothe, put about 15hrs in to a new world... boom, crashes PC within minutes of spawning in. I keep saying, one more try, one more try, one more chance, but finally, I am deleting. MANY people experience similar problems. Was even worse on a shared world with a friend. GUTTED, great game,  Shame, I coulda spent a good 500-1000hrs here."
20958,yfgjhtdtytfuifuykutygood game
20959,Nice game
20960,[u] yes [u]
20961,Extremely good game 100% recommend this game!
20962,"[h1]Really fun so far! [/h1]

I got the game less than a week ago and I have accumulated quite a bit of playtime already. Survival is very captivating me and my friend. Exploring, building vehicles, fighting bots, coming up with new strategies, building structures, the list goes on. There is a lot to do and to accomplish and to work towards. At the same time, we were a little confused at first - it can be quite hard to find a good start, as the player is thrown into the survival situation (but that's what survival is about, isn't it?). As soon as I figured out what was going on, the game captured me within it's non-verbally told story and mechanics quite well. Some game mechanics may be hard to figure out, but it feels rewarding if you do learn something new (you stranded in an unknown place in the first place anyway, so learning by exploring is quite a great story telling choice in my opinion). I am sure there is lots more to find and uncover!

[b]A tip if you struggle:[/b] [i]keep exploring and follow the road if you don't know where to go ;)[/i] (I think it's brilliant.) Also: no shame if you have to look up things, it happens.

I am looking forward to future updates and improvements, especially I am looking forward to any addition in Survival and an upgraded Creative Mode!
Crative Updates I'd like to see are:
[list]
    [*]selectable Upgrades for functional parts (most imprtantly the seat as it gains the ability to control bearings more precisely)
    [*]an updated list of parts (there are no chests or beds or bots like the craft-/cook-/etc-/bot?) they wouldn't need to be functional, but they'd be handy for spacing and also because of their weight if you plan on placing them on vehicles)
    [*] a filter or another way of telling the player what parts are obtainable in Survival (maybe all of them are obtainable, I just haven't found them yet? [spoiler]But for example: I haven't found a way to obtain Warehouse Dungeon Objects)[/spoiler]
    [*]maybe spawnable mobs for experimenting with creations (?)
[/list]
These improvements would come in handy if you're trying to plan Bases or Vehicles for Survival Mode!

[b]Overall:[/b] I really like the game and I really think that there is more awesome content to come! If you like survival games and/or games that give you lots of freedom to find creative solutions for problems/that let you be creative in general, this might be just the right game for you as well!"
20963,Great game especially with the new survival mode and overhaul. I love playing it with friends or just working through survival.
20964,i like your bum
20965,"Let me start with this. The game is broken. Physics seems to work in their own way which is hard to understand. The multiplayer gets really laggy at times with very few robots (4-5 hay/totebots) next to each other. The bearings lagging out the game makes sense, though it would be nice if the game would run smoothly with at least 20 bearings rather than 8. And for all these problem to happen on my computer as ""beefy"" as it is also kind of sucks.

Update: As of June 13, 2022, this game has dramatically improved. Mind you, the bearing issues still show up from time to time within the game, and multiplayer still has its kinks. Regardless, it's still incredible to play as is, and it's only getting better every day.

That being said, absolutely love the game. All the problems, at least in my mind, add a nice challenge to the game. You have to think ahead of time before you plant bigger crops and spawn in those big bot waves that ruin your frames. You have to put some effort into understanding the physics to make the best creations work. Multiplayer is still a little broken, but still having someone to suffer with makes it really fun on top of the fun it already is. And as for the bearings, it forces you to decide if you want to suffer the lag that more complex creations will bring or to limit yourself to those smaller creations for your game.

Ultimately, right now, the game does feel slightly lacking in content. However, what U love about games like this is this : The content is what you make it. Create. Invent. Inspire. 

Would still like to see some fixes for multiplayer, but over all, worth it. Three times over, since I bought a copy for myself, a friend, and my sister."
20966,Mantull
20967,it is gud
20968,very nice game
20969,"This was my favorite game for a few years when it was first released. Now that survival is official out (which has been in the works for 3-4 years), I highly recommend getting this game sooner then later. 
There is just so much you can do with this game, such as making a computer, an AI robot, crazy suspension, different piston engines, and so much more."
20970,"this game is fun,anybody that enjoys building games should like this one.reminds me abit like rust but less stress."
20971,"A fun open world sandbox survival game. 
The world is cartoony and the controls simple enough. Run up to what you think is a resource, hit it with your sledgehammer et voila! Building materials. 
Even the murderous farming robots are fun to whack. When they're not swarming you that is ... 

Some basic knowledge of mechanics can come in handy but is absolutely not a requirement to play the game. The online tutorials will show you what you need to know.
Your creations are only limited by your imagination.

The maps are randomly generated each new game. They're quite large too. As there are no means (yet) to help you navigate them -no compass, nav beacons, minimap, ... - I find myself lost half of the time trying to get back to my base. The only  time you get a nav marker is when you die; your backpack will be pinpointed on your HUD. 
This is something i'd like to see improved or changed.

Other than that the game is great fun. 
There are currently 2 modes: one where you have all the resources and building materials available and no enemies. Perfect for building and testing new creations.

The other is survival mode. It's you against the elements and an endless army of whacky robots. Resources must be farmed and you will have to overcome hunger and thirst.

The third mode is not available yet.

Remember this is an early access game. There's lots of room for improvement but it is very playable and definitely worth checking out. 
Big thumbs up from me."
20972,"IS GOOD
GET IT NOW"
20973,amazing!!
20974,"I've really enjoyed this game with one caveat. It's INCREDIBLY buggy. If you are willing to put up with things like 

1. The elevator doors being stuck closed after you fight your way to the top of your first warehouse. 
2. Your car disappearing if you carry it too far on the lift and spawning randomly on the bottom of a lake. 
3. Fully upgraded pistons randomly disappearing. 

Now that I've complained, the community is amazing. The game is addictive as all hell in Survival mode.  It's fun with friends and the intricate creations you can build are unrivaled. It's got that certain something that gives games staying power and the ability to truly be great,  I think eventually it's going to be a permanent member of my game roster on par with minecraft."
20975,"This game is very fun, survival is addictive and it‚Äôs wonderful, a few bugs and a bit of lag for when going into warehouses, but overall a really fun game!"
20976,The building mechanic alone provides you with countless hours of game play. Adding in the need to farm your plots of land adds so much variety. Plenty of exploration. Survival mode isn't as fleshed out as it should be but it's in it's early stages. Buy it if you like building games.
20977,Super good I lovve it!
20978,cool game I've been wanting for years that I now have but I've been playing for a day and now when I start up my world my hammer is there but never appears? Kinda makes the game unplayable
20979,YES
20980,very nice sandbox. still kinda glitchy. They are working on it
20981,love this game. can't wait for the finished version (now 0.44)
20982,GREAT game i have a very bad conputer i run the game off of sd card too but its still super fast and enjoyable gameplay only thing i got to say is that i think survival is a but brutial at forst so you need to play creative first to not die right away other then that game is so fun and good to pla
20983,Fun game tbh
20984,so worth it
20985,"I have had a very hard time recently feeling motivated to play any games. This game is the first in a very long time to occupy my thoughts even when I'm not playing it. It scratches the itch I've had for a survival game that isn't zombies and has a super interesting building mechanic, one of the best I've ever played with in a game. It's complex enough to keep you interested but not so over the top complicated that it exhausts your mind. I love it and I hope they keep improving it because this could be a game I play for years to come."
20986,it's so good
20987,"hatz
"
20988,Scrap mechanic is a piece of shit......every time I load into it.....the hammer is in the toolbar but not on the screen....meaning that I cant hit things........no animation either......please fix
20989,awesome game
20990,it is a really fun game the only problem is multiplayer because when i join one of my friends it rubber bands me.
20991,"It's alright, needs more content for multiplayer.
"
20992,Addictive in a way that scratches that minecraft itch.
20993,"it sucks. I want a refund, but because i have over 2 hours on it, i cant get my money back. Its a sandbox game, 2 hours doesnt mean shit."
20994,"This game is so much fun. It can be enjoyed by yourself but so much more fun with your friends. The vanilla game is fun, but the mods and modpack's in the workshop make it better."
20995,THE LAG IS UN GODLY TERRIBLE!!!! IM RUNNING A HARD INTERNET CONNECTION AT ALMOST 960MBS. TRYING TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. THE GAME HAS POTENTIAL BUT IT IS EXTREMELY GLITCHY AND TERRIBLE WITH LAG. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!
20996,Fun as hell
20997,"This game is pretty good. Not at all what I expected, but in a good way."
20998,i like
20999,pexelente juego para personas creativas como singlke player o coop.
21000,"The Whole concept of the game and the ability to build anything you can think of and all the functionalities of certain blocks and objects in the game really make it good. the only think i dont like is the fact that their is no aerodynamics in the game. i think that would really improve the game depending on what the devs do with that physic. but other then that, survival and creative options are really fun. i dont like that all the stuff in survival isnt in creative."
21001,The game is very fun and is good if you like creating things
21002,good
21003,honestly love this game
21004,Amazing game. So much stuff to do!
21005,i just liked it
21006,This is the best sandbox survival game ive ever played. Worth the price for how much game you get. id say its worth a full $60. i give it 10/10 Jan Michael Vincents.
21007,"game is really good and i get to be as creative as i want, however i do have only two issues. first being the need for LAN, i tried playing with my brother (who is in the exact same house) and its lagging worse than any other game we play, the other is with the seat dropping you right on top of it when you get out. it leads to anywhere from being in the roof of my creation or killed by leaving it, it would be a bit more helpful to put the player beside the seat when they leave"
21008,"Love this game, has been hard to run it though since the survival update but I'm sure they'll fix it soon!  Love the creative before this update and the survival is going to be awesome once they fix the start game rendering!"
21009,"This Is a great game to play with your friends in creative or survival, with all the blocks in the game it allows you to create awesome complex machines/builds while having fun doing it. I've had the game since it came out and me and my friend have been playing it ever since we always try to find cool builds in the steam workshop and we always try to figure out how they work. Whenever you think something is complicated you're able to look it up on youtube and then when you watch a video about it turns out what you thought was complicated turned out to be very simple which so satisfying to learn. Once you learn how to do most stuff you can build incredible builds which can be put on the steam workshop. You're always finding new stuff about the game when you play it, which is why its so great. All in All an amazing game with lots of replayability."
21010,"Really good game. You can create a lot of contraptions and structures, the only limit is your imagination... or the lag you might get if you have a lot of loose parts together. The survival update added a lot of possibilities and new ways to play this game but there's still a lot to fix and/or add to the game. It has a bright future :D
Definitely would give it a try!"
21011,"One of my new favorite games i cannot wait to see what they add to it from here.
"
21012,i think i crapped myself when i died from hunger for the 1000th time
21013,Survival Mode is the best I have played for a Beta version of a game. The attention to detail and the fact that Devs are actively working on bugs shows great support for the game.
21014,"there is only one thing wrong with this game, my creativity is the only thing that cant keep up!!!! it is such a fun game and i find myself loosing so much time enjoying myself. just need people to play with now"
21015,great game to play just has a little of a slow start but all in all a great game
21016,"In the current state of the game, survival multiplayer is very laggy, and in my opinion unplayable.

The lag won't start until you're 40 hours in, super dedicated, having fun with your friends.

Each of you will make a cool contraption -- or a cool vehicle!

The swinging of genitalia will continue as it always has, trying to out-do your buddies to make something cooler or more efficient!

But, the more you put in the game, the more you make this ""sandbox"" world yours, the more unplayable the game becomes(in multiplayer).

Updates are still rolling out, and if they release dedicated servers or server hosting it might get better.

So is it worth $20? 

If you want to play a children's game by yourself, sure.
"
21017,gud game
21018,amazing has gottten me hooked for hours
21019,"It is a fun game. I don't believe that it is still early access. the survival game mode just came out, and every one was waiting for it and we all got what we wanted and more! It is the best creative multiplayer mechanical building sandbox or campaign or   player built challenges EVER!! If you have enough money, definitely get it.

Edit: Its ok i guess but im bored get minecraft instead its way better
Edit 2: https://www.thisworldthesedays.com/lol66.html"
21020,very good
21021,"Under-Cooked.. 

Some friends and I really gave this game a chance, being someone who played Minecraft during its early days in Alpha and saw it progress and grow to what it is in 2020 I know well enough there is almost no future for this game at this rate. It's a great concept I love the idea but a very poor execution on the devs side, a game with a relatively static map like this one needs many additions like a mini map and less frustrating scenarios for singleplayer in essence fixing bugs and making PvE more fluid or in hindsight and a ""buddy bot"" that helps you get through your first few days of game play. Yes we also tried to play 3 person multiplayer survival mode with someone who was knowledgeable in the game and it continued to be frustrating as things glitched below the map and, we were unable to advance in the game without spending a predetermined amount of time farming and then once again collecting items to be able to automatically farm and water crops. The game is not immersive, not balanced, and not optimized enough for even a great gaming PC let alone a budget one. A message to the devs, focus on this game, and spend revenue in building your team and testing for bugs, this game has a lot of potential."
21022,just a super cool game and good pass time
21023,"With creative mode you can build anything you like, like a buggy, or a plane. also with the new survival you can challenge yourself or just try to survive, there is also no blood or anything like that so this game is just perfect."
21024,creative
21025,"a lot of things keep crashing, I don't recommend it"
21026,Epic
21027,"Fun, if only multiplayr would be less laggy for thje one who joins"
21028,I love the survival mode. I think dogs that are tamable or bots that resemble dogs that can be crafted in the mechanic station should be added to the game in the next update.
21029,gud gam
21030,VERY GOOD GAME
21031,"Basically minecraft with smaller blocks, cars, potato guns, and explosives
"
21032,very good
21033,ITS FUN
21034,"cool

21035,"iiiii
"
21036,"its really fun, has almost unlimited possibilities, and if you cant figure something out, help is everywhere.
i have found that Kan gaming on youtube has most turtorials, so if you need help, i recomend you check him out"
21037,Really great game you can play for hours with friends or by yourself
21038,"Great game and great mechanics. So  much fun. However there are still bugs. Game lags whenever you get a lot of monsters attacking. Secondly I can't pick up anything anymore as the game glitched when I tried to place a chest. Now the chest is gone and I think I'm carrying it around, just can't see it. Very sad to start all over again."
21039,Very fun.
21040,"This is one of my favourite games on my steam library.

It started as a creative only game and recently they finally released survival mode.
You can make anything you can think of assuming you figure out how to: ships, cars, tanks, airplanes, motorbikes, mechs but also robots, automatic turrets, vehicles with basic AI and more.
Feels like building with LEGO but better. 

If you don't feel like making something for the sake of it, you can play survival alone or with friends having to deal with woodcutting, farming, mining and the usual stuff you do in a survival game.
The difference is that in scrapmechanic you don't just make a new tool to improve the speed of what you are doing, you can make automated systems for farming, woodcutting and so on: you have to figure out how you can improve the way you make things instead of just crafting a new tool with the shiniest material avalaible.

if this is not enough, you can even download mods for a better experience, upload your creations and download other people creations.
The community is very nice and will gladly help you if you need.

since survival just got out there are still some issues: enemies are too easy to kill, there are some bugs, sometimes it crashes and it's a little unpolished sometimes.
There are also some issues with fps drops: building too big or too complicated may generate massive fps drops but I suppose it's the price for playing a work in progress.
Can be unnerving sometimes but I can deal with it.
The game is in early access and the devs keep releasing updates nonstop so I expect to see the game getting better and better as time goes by.

if you like sandboxes, this is the game for you.
10/10 would make a somehow successful wheelchair again."
21041,best game i played in forrover wish i had people to play with
21042,This game is fun... until they stopped caring about it for like 4 years and then released survival mode. There are still much needed tweaks to the way the game runs as it is either laggy or smooth. I don't recommend this game because i don't think the company isn't as invested in their game as when AshDubh and IballisticSquid played it.
21043,"looks stupid, is a great game"
21044,yes
21045,love it i learn so mutch
21046,is very fun yesh
21047,good
21048,good
21049,It's an amazing game for anyone who loves to be creative and build amazing machines and awesome structures.
21050,Somehow this game blue screens my entire PC after ~30 minutes of playing.
21051,its a amazing and creative game i would recomend it if you are looking to have fun and to experiment with physics and its alot funner with friends
21052,it is a great game but sometimes when I put the collector on the ground it went through the ground and i could get it back so i had to make a new one.
21053,"This is a nice game, discovered it with the release of survival mode.

Pros :
- I like the cartoon aspect of the game (if I had any kids I definitely would play to this game with them), it's a nice looking game
- The ability to build whatever vehicule you want, even goofy ones.
- Physics are not realistic but it's nice and there may be room for future improvements of water physics
- Enemys are here to keep a little thrill by menacing your farm and despite the cartoony aspect warehouses still manage to be quite scary. As the size of raids are depending on the amount of crops you are farming you can adapt accordingly to what you can handle.

Cons :
- I hope new blocks will be added in the vanilla game, but with the mods the gap will be filled in in a way or an other :) 
- Logic gates are quite buggy, very easy to have a loop in a circuit
- The feature I'd like to see quite soon is the ability to have a dedicated server. I'd really like a dedicated server to have some kind of Minecraft-y feeling."
21054,oof
21055,"--Edit December 2020, still no dedicated servers. It is too laggy to play with friends even with a decent internet connection.

Its a good game, but there are so many glitches. Playing single player is very very fun, however it is difficult to play survival with friends. 

There is no option for dedicated servers, only peer to peer connections. 

A lot of mechanics need work, such as gas pumping, etc, for late game accomplishments. 

There is just a lot of untouched quality of life issues overall ."
21056,One of the most fun games for building and being creative.
21057,great
21058,Just give it a Try
21059,E
21060,super game lots of things u can build if u put yr mind to it!
21061,is fun. like scraping mechanics makes for a good fun time 4.5/5 stars. this game has been on my radar for a long time and until the survival update I had not purchased it but I think getting the game was a good choice.¬†
21062,Fun survival game.
21063,"Primarily played survival mode since that is what I'm interested in.

Pros
 + Pretty Art Style

Cons
 - Wouldn't have picked up the game even if it were free in hindsight
 - Got a bad case of Moon Logic, common sense is useless here, and you will never be given so much as a hint as to what that one material you need to progress is even called, let alone what bizarre place you need to get it from.
 - Paced to waste the 2 hour refund grace period, then the realisation comes you've been duped into buying what amounts to more of an art piece than a game at this stage
 - Early gameplay loop is fundamentally broken; wooden walls are butter to raiding enemies and the block size is so tiny you need to fell and refine every tree for a mile (which takes hours and days of ingame time) to build a single, very small wall - that will get eaten through in a couple of seconds, along with your entire crop."
21064,"Fain
"
21065,"Bought on a whim without even hearing about this game, and it's become a favorite. Fun survival farming and building with a really neat look. Building things is pretty awesome and I really haven't even scratched the surface. If you're looking for a non-zombie, non-pvp survival game and you like games like Little Big Planet, you should definitely check out Scrap Mechanic.

I love this game."
21066,Good gaem.
21067,"cool game concept , but to be clear what we want is a better mods support and a better physics engine and the game would be absolutely perfect"
21068,Survival is very bare bones and isn't worth buying for.
21069,yeah
21070,generally fun!
21071,"i like to build cars
"
21072,xyth u
21073,"this game is amazing but there is a problem with lag when there is alot of block soo if you have a potato pc just dont buy it
"
21074,survival is very good (even if it took 4 years)
21075,"Of course survival is new and needs improvements. But still overall, game is fun and very creative and can be really good time eater. Building vehicle is fun, very customisable and creative. For 20euros i suggest to buy this and try out. I hope future updates will be very good and will improve game even more."
21076,Amazing game i defently recomend it
21077,"The game provides hours of fun especially now survival is out there are however some cons such as:
-Cons 
Survival took ages to come out
The game can be incredibly laggy when building large or complex creations
-Pros
Very enjoyable
easy to get used to
Survival provides hours of fun"
21078,"I have 400 hundred hours of scrap mechanic on my account and played it for 2 years at the time of making this review. The survival update came out a few weeks ago, and since then I have lost all respect for the developers. This update was in the works for over 3 years I believe, and they failed to include some of the most important parts of the survival mode. When you raid a warehouse, you cannot deactivate the connection and destruction ""totems,"" which they said you will be able to do in the future, but they have plenty of other plans first. The warehouses besides this take at least an hour to raid and have a measly few items as loot, if you can find them. This makes the game practically pointless leading to hours of grinding for blocks for a few seconds of building. The funny thing is, they made it so you can throw water into other peoples buckets if they have them out. This feels like a slap in the face. You include such a pointless function, yet fail to finish one of the most important parts of the game that actually make it worth playing? Smh. It isn't even possible to enjoy creative mode at the moment either because survival broke all the mods, worlds, and creations. I spend more time trying to keep the game from crashing in creative than I do playing. Sure, ill still probably mess around with the game with friends, and im sure ill revist the game fully someday, but until they decide to include necessary parts of the game, and fix the constant crashes, im taking a break and a bad review. 
I would not recommend buying this game as it would be a waste of money.
Hopefully this will help future buyers."
21079,"It is amazing to play with your friends, a little bit of boring grind if you start out solo but it√§s still a lot of fun!"
21080,i
21081,"amazing game just needs some bug fixes

"
21082,"Yo put in working propellers for boats and planes. Also there most definitley needs to be a way to collect oil with a pump machine from land. 

Old timey stuff would be nice too like zepplin mechanics.

Thank you for great game!"
21083,"Great game so far. I've been sinking 7-8 hours a day playing the game since I got it. The only gripe I have is the game lags like no other once you've placed a lot of parts and this heavily affects the multiplayer experience, especially if you're not the host. Other than this, the game is legit. The survival aspect is challenging, as well as the grind for materials. The game is as hard as you make it."
21084,"a thumbs down from me. The game is buggy, survival is grindy and food is scarce, i know u can survive with cow milk, but it replenish so little hunger.
the main reason i dont like the game is because whenever u sleep or driving a car, u look like epileptic kid on a dance floor with disco ball glued to your eye."
21085,"apparently the game will no load anymore for me.  Won't be able to get refund because of time played, mostly trying to get the piece of shit to work."
21086,"honestly for beta it's fun lets you be innovative with what stuff you build which i love. probably the best game i have played in beta
"
21087,"Honestly I can see the appeal in this, I don't like it and I'm reflecting that in my review because it feels really boring when the ""tutorials"" in game are in a handbook and have links to videos to try and teach you crucial game mechanics. Look, I can understand not wanting to give the player too much direction and letting them figure shit out on their own but it's really confusing when you spawn next to a crashed ship and see a trail of chests, you follow the chests to a building get some loot and you think that you should just be on your merry way figuring stuff out but 1 hour later and you realize that in the crashed ship that was on fire, there is a tiny path leading away from it where you can get a water bucket to put out the fire and acess a crafting station you have to power by hunting down a master battery, a concept that is never explained. I'm no stranger to using a wiki to figure games out and find hidden mechanics and other cool shit, but when the wiki is basically the tutorial it feels like something is wrong with giving the player direction and objective as well as a basic understanding of game mechanics. I really love open world survival games; the forest, subnautica, etc... but with this game I feel like it could be just as cool, if it gave direction and at least tried to teach the player game mechanics. 

TLDR:
Game looks really cool but without a functional tutorial it's unfamiliar and scary for new players to approach."
21088,"Scrap Mechanic is a cute, survival game with a very deep and interesting crafting core. The game does not hold your hand when it comes to what you can craft allowing near infinite possibilities on what you can create. However this also creates a steep learning curve and may frustrate some players as you struggle with your earliest creations. I found that  while the crafting is only limited by your imagination the game lacks a sort of depth that encourages survival players to keep grinding and creating. Once you have created a solid base, a few vehicles and obtained a gun you have seen all that Scrap Mechanic has to offer. This can all be done very quickly and once you have obtained these you will find yourself doing maintenance after the raid and then deciding whether its worth it to keep playing. You could make a better car or a stronger base sure but I didn't see the reason to do so. The game doesn't reward your hard effort with rare materials or special items you can see the end of the games progression as soon as you start and that put me off on the game.

You will also encounter bugs. Lots of them. None are game breaking but they are all annoying. Some are funny. 

This is a perfectly fine game especially if the crafting clicks with you otherwise this will just leave you looking for a different survival game."
21089,It's a fun and creative game!
21090,"love the concept of the game, graphics, humor nature and the building. my issues is crashes, but is getting better. love to play with  my boy and the building aspect is crazy fun.  A must have game for sure."
21091,fun creative sandbox games where you can make vehicles and play with your friends would recommend especially with the new survival mode.
21092,yes it is literaly the most awesome game i have ever played
21093,"Great game. If your into survival games you'll love this one. Its a grinder for materials, feels like your making progression always. Graphics are cute looking and very beautiful nothing like walking along the beach in HD.
It really is a full complete game even though they just came out with survival. One thing I personally would like to see is more viraity of enemies. I expect they are working on them since the game is somewhat concrete already.

Great for all ages. Alone or multiplayer"
21094,very fun
21095,"yes
"
21096,Good game
21097,y
21098,"Amazing. I have wanted Scrap Mechanic for years and now that I have had the chance to play it, I can say my expectations have been met."
21099,This game rules but its hardf to make a plane or a car
21100,I find it amazing how I lose track of time playing this
21101,In Creative mode you have unlimited resources and infanite posibilitys. I my self use creative mode to make designes  for my gameplay in the new Survival Game mode
21102,"This game allows new players to not die at any time, while also providing new experiences to more hardcore gamers. The game allows you to build anything and make any vehicle. Scrap Mechanic is a fun game that anyone can pick up and have fun with."
21103,Yeety good game
21104,It is a vary nice game where you have fun and i just love how creative you can be in the game
21105,"I've only scratched the surface, but once i got into survival, i was instantaneously hooked. I played a little bit last night, and now look at my hours!"
21106,Oh it guuuuuud
21107,The games amazing i have only played for a few days and already love everything would highly recemend it to anyone
21108,"I found this to be very grindy with constant set backs.  One such example, my heavily upgraded vehicle got stuck on a tiny rock, and then flipped over.  Then, out of no where, a farm bot comes and smashed it to nothingness.  SO, I basically lost all of my progress, with no way to get it back."
21109,"Scrap Mechanic is an amazing sandbox game, meaning it has almost no rules, and it amazing for you to play with you and your friends. There is so much to do, so much to explore, and the one bad thing in my opinion is that gathering materials takes FOREVER. Aside from that, the $20 USD was 100% worth it. Would Recommend."
21110,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game it allows you to build many things its quite the challenge but is always fun and rewarding to figure out the logic of the game and make your own creations, be it flying, land or sea its always a blast to see what others come up with and to make you own to share with others especially with the new survival game mode its sure to satisfy your needs giving you a world to explore and loot to build your creations to strive and survive."
21111,its good
21112,"Robots,  Cows, Evil Robots, CORN?!?!? How could this not be the best game ever? Well.. its not the best game ever but its pretty decent, similar to Minecraft as far as you build , grow, and collect resources to survive. The enemies are robots, instead of zombies and wizards. However, the things you can build are really cool, functional cars, trucks, your own helpful bots and whatever you set your mind upon. The multiplayer aspect of it is terrific and I enjoy building things with my friends, or having them build everything while I just relax and farm."
21113,Good quality Awesome game
21114,Its fun
21115,"I bought this game when survival came out (so recently), and it's been so much fun. There's a good amount of content and it's interesting even for non-engineer types to try out and put together different structures. I really hope the developers reveal more about the story, because honestly it seems so interesting and would love to know more about what happened to cause this post-apocalyptic world (I have ideas, but nothing is fully explained...yet). I can't wait for more to come out! Highly recommend this."
21116,buggy but addictive. fun with friends too. cant wait to se what else they add
21117,i love this game
21118,This game is a fun survival game that is amazing to play
21119,its fun
21120,this game is udderly amazing even though there is no survival mod support... one of the reasons why this game is good is because if you like complex building mechanics in not only creative but survival this is your game
21121,"This game is probably (other than minecraft) the most time I have ever put into a single game. The base game mechanics is enough fun to last a long time not to mention the huge modding community. If you like building anything, and I mean anything you should play this game, Cars, planes, games, computers, and more. However I must mention the recent survival update. I mean its fun, not really my thing but I can understand why people would love it. I think it is great at being what you would expect when you hear scrap mechanic survival, but for me it is meh. The reason I really dislike this update is because it broke almost if not all mods for the game. However this game is still a lot of fun and I really recommend it."
21122,its just fun all around.
21123,the new survival mode runs pretty smoothly for my crappy pc. So everyone with a crappy pc the survival mode is very fun
21124,"yes
"
21125,Best Game
21126,very good game
21127,Creative was fun in 2016 but holy crap survival is so much better
21128,"Incredible game. While the connections and logic can be confusing, after some thought and experimentation you can build some incredible things. Now that survival's out, so much has been improved and added! Really shows how much Axolot has been working! With all that has been added, I look forward to it's full release! 

Great work, devs."
21129,"one of my favourite steam games, totally worth 22 cad, it's very fun building your own vehicles then driving and testing them, especially with friends. only issue i got is it's missing some optimization which can make the game laggy at some times, but other than that, 10/10 game, very well made and very fun"
21130,edrgw
21131,Its friggen mamzing
21132,great game just got better
21133,Good game.
21134,asss
21135,"this game is a lot of fun. lots of things to do and explore. also lots of grinding to build the things you want/need. this game is amazing but there are a couple things I would personally change to make the experience a little more enjoyable. 

1. tapebots
Tapebots need a nerf bad. 2 shots and your dead. sometimes they seem like they have aimbot, where they instantly shoot you the second you round a corner or break a barrier in the warehouse.  
I would increase their health, but decrease there reaction time and damage they deal. maybe 40 damage so you can at least take 2 shots without being knocked out. 

2. farming/ raids
The farming mechanic in the game is great! but the lag on heavier raids is pretty bad.  optimising the frame rates when it comes to that would be awesome. also being able to farm cotton and paint plants would be great too. I know not every word is the same, but in most worlds I have, the distance I need to cover for only a few cotton plants can be pretty long. even if they where considered a higher tier crop I think that would be great.

3. randomly generated vehicles / warehouse raids. 
I think this game would benefit from some randomly generated broken down vehicles scattered around the map. the harder to get to the higher tier stuff is on them.  to balance the higher tier stuff they could require more and more items to actually make them functional. It would also be super cool to have a broken down flying machine of some sort  randomly generated on the roof of a warehouse. like say a 40% chance of them being there to promote raiding more.

4. adding an ""end"" to the game
 I think adding an ""end"" to the game would attract more people as it would have a definable start and finish. It would be great if it was something similar to minecraft here the end isn't really the end of the game. more of a loose goal that  doesn't need to be completed to enjoy the game, or change how the game is played post completion. 

overall scrap mechanic is great, the developers have made a really well done game. it is still as of writing this in early access and you can sometimes tell, like in the more intense raids. If you want a survival game that is physics based  that includes base building , vehicle design and resource gathering. you cant beat this game. the price is still roughly 20$ CAD as of 25 may 2020. I would throw a 20$ bill at this game any day of the week. 10/10 would buy again."
21136,yes
21137,"The game turned out to be quite interested, I won't lie and say that I make very complicated logic systems to make the game slow down but it certainly does start to hurt a bit when you have too many connections and construction present. Not sure if something is being done to help the game when large things like construction or cars are present but outside from the lag you get because of large builds the game is quite enjoyable."
21138,Garbage
21139,cool beans
21140,cool
21141,good game
21142,Very good and easy to understand building game. Very fun in survival with friends too
21143,IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUN
21144,very cool
21145,"Selamat malam, namaku nikolaus supriadi suim, saya dari indonesia.
aku sangat menyukai game ini, tapi terkadang masih terdapat beberapa kekurangan menurutku, seperti terkadang terdapat lag saat menambang batu, ataupun lag saat kita melakukan beberapa aktifitas, map nya cukup luas dan itu sangat menarik, tempat untuk mendapatkan kapas terlalu sedikit menurut ku, kemudian didalam kreasi blok atau pun part mungkin perlu ditambahkan lagi agar lebih menarik, dan mungkin untuk musuh robotnya bisa di tambahkan model yang lain pada setiap map agar lebih menarik.
terima kasih."
21146,"I would definitively recommend this game, because even if it is slightly buggy at some times the other 99% is so much fun. Even more so after the release of survival."
21147,sdafdwdfwefwdfewdfewdfewd
21148,"Best game I have ever played by far, I have 101 hours on it and it has been great. You can spend alot of time in the game just having fun solo or with friends!"
21149,this game is full of fun things you could do and with the new servivl mode it gives you something else to do when you get bored.
21150,its fun and there is allot to do
21151,its fun
21152,"Get it now, its good"
21153,"very good buy, worth it 100% interesting survival game."
21154,"iTS FUN
"
21155,"Its a really unique game. The building aspect of it is insane, you can get crazy creative!
Definitely worth buying!"
21156,dort
21157,fuck this game
21158,"it's great 
"
21159,Survival mode with friends is fun!
21160,"a great fun game for all ages, allows you to be creative and use your imagination in creative mode aor play survival mode for a bit more of a challenge"
21161,"this game is very fun
"
21162,good
21163,This game is beautiful and definitely worth the money. I LOVE how you can make machines out of simple trash. It is a must-have.
21164,.
21165,"good game
"
21166,"Look at these people leaving bad reviews with only 15hrs of playtime, yes I know there will be someone with 3 times as much as me - but do I care at this moment in time, no.

Us who have had the game for 4 years or more now know the pain of waiting for this mode, and no it may not be that fun in survival at the start but with friends, preferably more than 2, it is lots of fun. One thing that I did to make the start less sluggish is I didn't build the car, I ran to the mechanic station and built a craftbot. The craftbot then let me build proper wheels, etc. That is how to make survival less grindy at the start, don't build the starter car. Now on to creative, it's great but survival broke it. Some items act as survival items. The developers had to add another month onto development because of the current disease outbreak and maybe this is why it is not as good as we had all anticipated, but believe me - the devs care about this game and listen to our suggestions (on twitter) and they will add more content."
21167,the graphics are really good  only if you have a good computer but i highly recommend the game. ITS AWSOME!!!!!!
21168,fun. aesthetic and unlimeted
21169,Very fun and inspiring
21170,"Tried this game out and basically marathoned it all day for 13 hours. Super addicting and fun if you like the survival crafting genre. It feels like it's got a bit of everything like Minecraft mixed with a little tower defense with a simple yet complex vehicle creation system. 

I absolutely love this game and am so glad I found this."
21171,survival
21172,it sucks
21173,"let me first say i don't right reviews, i usually keep my thoughts to my mainly cause i play a lot of alphas and things are always changing. that being said i have to say i love this game, the concept i feel is new and fresh and the feel of the game even thou its survival is not to intense at the start like other survival games that usually turn new players off quickly. with this game if you can think it you can probably build it and you should. multiplayer is so much fun that even friends that hate survival games play because of the building aspect. all in all for the game itself all survival game players should have this in their library.

now is the part of why i'm writing this review and i really wish i didn't have to. this game even thou alpha and i get it theres bugs is having way to many issues right now. usually i would shrug this off but when i purchased this game i did not encounter many bugs, and crashes was rare but they were there. since the may 14th update i have been dealing with countless bugs things that were never a issue before. those things i hope will be fixed with a future patch and soon. thou what i can not get by is the fact the last update said it has fixed crashes from main menu and while playing. i have not been able to play this game in three days cause of the game crashing when ever trying to load into a world. doesnt matter if its my solo or a friends multiplayer it does not work. i spent a hour one morning restarting steam, computer, re downloaded with nothing helping. i really hope the devs listen to their players and see this, i love your game i want to play your game but you guys either rushed out that last patch or did not even test run your patch before launching. so please fix your game a lot of people enjoy it and really wish to support you guys."
21174,Geim gud
21175,"I really quite like the game, but I can`t enjoy it because of the awful optimization. I have better specs then the recommended ones and still I can`t go 5 minutes without a lag spike. I run on low graphics and still the game crashes and is almost impossible to play. I`m very disappointed because I waited survival for years to buy the game. Most of my hours I was trying to boot the game up, because it kept crashing. It takes a 2 - 5 minutes to boot the game up.  At this point I can`t recommend the game if you don`t have a beastly PC."
21176,ff
21177,Just such a good game and so worth it.
21178,the best
21179,"This game is amazing. I've only sunk 7 hours into this thing and I'm already loving every second of it. Also new survival mode is quite enjoyable but challenging.

Seriously fun with friends and allows heaps of creativity."
21180,j√≥ j√°t√©k van creative √©s a gondolatodra van b√≠zva minden
21181,"this is realy fun game he just got survivel and its so exaiting,or how ever you say it."
21182,"buggy as hell, no support and devs communicate via twitter

Update: game now crashes to desktop randomly, uses up to 100 % cpu and gpu randomly on an i9 9920x and 1070 gtx ti. Also if it crashes on a friend's world will not let you rejoin and gives and error check your internet connection when connection is fine at the time, returns to title screen and gives a bugsplat dialog box asking to send an error report."
21183,this game is awsome
21184,"Nice simple fun for everyone. Chilled gameplay with a good few layers to work through if you want, or just mill about and farm!"
21185,gasoline so bad :(
21186,"Good game,

very bad optimization

if you have a quantum computer that can calculate movement of every bearing and/or movable objects on your vehicle get it for sure. otherwise stick to basic vehicle buildd and flip/ roll /skid around on every single bump / corner / uphill. Or improve the car and enjoy the lag"
21187,very good game best game like Minecraft
21188,Great new edition for an already great game
21189,some bugs but it s ok
21190,This game is so addictive! I can't stop playing it from the moment I bought it.
21191,YEET
21192,Its Awesome you should buy it
21193,misto joc
21194,yes
21195,It's improved a lot since launch and survival gives it a longer lived point.
21196,yes
21197,Very fun game fun to build and learn how to do things
21198,its gud
21199,Greatt !!!
21200,Its a wonderfully technical game where in which you can build interesting automated machines to accomplish tasks that you primarily set for yourself. Very eager to test more automation in survival
21201,its a fun game that keeps going with new and exiting things as you play through it
21202,Absolutely amazing
21203,"This game is perfect for anyone who likes crafting, surviving and or tinkering in a physics based sandbox. I struggle to put this game down for more than a few hours which makes working from home difficult. The art style and theme are great and you are only limited by your imagination (and physics)."
21204,good game fun times
21205,i have been playing for two days it is too addictive they are trying too brain wash you
21206,It is a creative sandbox that is better than minecraft
21207,It's fun to play with friends
21208,"is vary fun!:)
"
21209,this is a great game with lots off adventure the lag tho can be bad but its a great game all round
21210,"Its been a while since my last update to my review of this game. 

The game is still running in 32bit but its FAR more stable. But there is still many instabilities.
Physics is still a little bit weird but it makes for some funny collision moments. With the Increased stability I‚Äôve been able to do a lot more in creative than I use too. There is still heavy lag that occurs with some collisions create enough particles a lot of lag that can lag out the game or change how things operate along with moving objects to locations where they shouldn‚Äôt be with no form of fixes other than put on a lift. (Could be the Engineers fault) I‚Äôm looking forward to the updates released in the recent dev log that will change the game a lot. As the story releasing with the new updates, it might add more to the game along with the quests! Now with all of the upgrades and changes I can recommend the game. 

Here are some features I would like to see
Automation of various parts like schematics that can create component kits or circuit boards Preferably in the late game. Automation of naturally regenerating objects such as corn collection, Honeycomb collection and tools to create automation for stationary drills or even a late game to craft things such as crystals or metal via chemicals. I know some mods do this already but it would be nice to have a more official way to do this. Another last option is to have a drone platform that‚Äôs configurable with code blocks with a switch to get actual code. This would be Extremely handy and maybe even reprograming a seat or other tools to work differently than default as a final upgrade after. This is a lot to ask but it is something that would make the game more complicated and more fun! 

My recommendations that still stand 
Switching the game to a 64 bit game which can tackle a lot greater tasks (A 64 bit port might be a good choice to help benefit the higher end systems) and still having a divided team to focus on bugs will be amazing! Yes updates will be later but they‚Äôll be far more stable as the team can work on both old and new bugs! 

This game is still my favorite calming game to play and as it grows im wanting to play more and more! 
"
21211,i like this game
21212,IT IS SO TRASH DONT GET. IT LAGS 24/7 AND THE CHARACTER MOVES ON ITS OWN SOMETIMES. PLEASE DO THE WORLD A FAVOR AND DONT GET IT!
21213,I like it
21214,"Fun and addictive for now, it's somewhere between Minecraft and Subnautica, original to an extent and fun to play."
21215,"It's not a bug it's a feature.

9/10"
21216,Yes
21217,best game
21218,EPIC
21219,Good stuff. Pog
21220,Creative mode was fun to go crazy with now with survival mode its lots more fun !!
21221,E un gioco molto interessante e creativo ve lo raccomando
21222,Good
21223,"The base game (creative only) was already good but now they've implemented the long awaited survival mode it's given it all a whole new purpose. 

Sure it's still got some glitches/bugs but none that have personally affected me in any way other than comic value with over 200 hours of gameplay.

If you like building things and physics simulators, give it a go. If the game doesn't contain the part you're after the modding community is pretty active and can even help you to build your own mods with relative ease."
21224,"AMAZING

21225,great
21226,"Ive got a few different opinions about scrap mechanic, relating to the 2 different game modes. 

Creative mode is useful for experimentation, and building whatever you want however you want. However, I find it somewhat limiting that i cannot use certain survival mode parts in creative mode. Otherwise, creative mode is a great mode for shenanigans. 

Survival mode is very exciting, with a basic story-line along with being able to build many crazy creations to tackle certain challenges. Want to build a basic car? sure why not. Want to build a giant saw-blade-lined beast? go for it. How about a car with drills on it? yes. 
However, i find the un-spoken need for thrusters for water travel to be somewhat limiting, and i would wish for some sort of propellor to make it less costly components wise, as said propellor could then be connected to the nearest engine. 

If you are playing Single-player, the sky is the limit with your creations. But if you are playing with a friend or 2, the latency is the limit, especially as it relates to the use of certain computing intensive parts.
In the future, multiplayer optimization is a must, as playing with friends is usually more fun.

this game has come a long way. At the moment of writing, the game is great with many possibilities. However, some aspects of the game could be fleshed out a bit more. This game has much potential beyond what it already is. 

If you are looking to buy the game, then i would recommend you do, as it is very fun once you know what your doing. 

"
21227,yes.
21228,It's Ok I guess. It is hard to understand and has some  tricky components but it's pretty good.
21229,its good but better with mods
21230,very CPU intensive but cool
21231,yes
21232,hi
21233,Its so amazing but he net more update at multiplayer survival
21234,Great relaxing game
21235,its good

21237,"I managed to survive the 5 year wait for a survival mode that beat expectations. Lots to do in this mode with endless possibilities for construction, with creative being a great way to test ideas for survival."
21238,great game
21239,oooo survival :D
21240,sick
21241,your imagination is the limit
21242,it is amazing
21243,"What i can tell about that games. The games is boring in the begin and whan you starting the games you are geting out from crashed ship to the big open world. What you need to do in the games? That is just walking, faind some tools or items. Oke that is not every time fun. But what about your enemys that attacking you with VERY POWERFULL weapons and all thing what you can do it run and try too fight your enemys. The games is Boring you can not creat your own BOTS or ROBOTS that can helps you. You can not download and spawn the Vichles from Steam. And you can not good creat the perfect vichles and other transports like PLAIN TANK and Good weapons. So i think the games is STUPID experements for players who looking for games like minecraft. But the Minecraft is still better!!! So what can i say about this games 3 or maximal 5 stars from 10. 3/10!!!"
21244,game is great and all it still needs more stuff more challenges and more bots and more blocks for more intricate designs. farming could use a little revamp as the watering is a hassle maybe add a sprinkler system or a irrigation system of sort also need a way to produce fertilizer instead of just finding it but all in all its a great game to play along with friends
21245,"Saw all the great comments, watched the trailers and a few let's plays and was like cool, it's TerraTech but better vehicle design.  After 2 hours in survival... I'm bored out of my mind.  Why are bots coming to attack my farm?  Why is my first vehicle slower than me walking around?  Oh, because it's intended that way.  To generate progression in survival, devs made sure the early gear is as awful as possible.  That way you want to get better gear to have the smooth creative experience.  No, I think I'll just be going now.  Cheers to everyone who enjoys this but it's not for me."
21246,"ITS AMASEBALLS
"
21247,"Honestly one of the best games ive played. very fun, though raids are laggy"
21248,"fun game, isn't the most stable though"
21249,A  very fun and unique survival/building game. I would highly recommend and for its relatively low price I think its a must have.
21250,"It's very fun, and surprisingly easy to understand!"
21251,great game I really like the style of the game
21252,"only 4 words.....it is worth it................. build in creative live in survival  or create you own creative bio-dome.
the game is addicting  and the  lil dudes are cute too almost too cute"
21253,"AMAZING
"
21254,"Overall a really fun game with a huge potential. It's a good balance between building stuff and make it do crazy thoings controlled by you.

Why i can't recommend it right now is one simple reason. 4 yeasrs ago it was reported that collision detection was causing massive FPS drop to the point where it's unplayable if you build stuff where one thing can pick up another thing you build. I caused my i9900K 32GB Ram 1080 system to drop into the 15-20 FPS range.

It's unexcusable that it has taken 4 YEARS to do absolutely nothing about this issue. They need to simplify the detecton so it ony does the check once until the geometry changes.

On top of that, physics for vehicles is aweful! Even the heaviest vehicle with low speed will slide around and almost not steer, it makes no sense at all, and the engine controls are garbage, if you want enough torque for larger vehicles, it also speeds up the vehicle to a point where it is uncontrollable.

Such basic things should just work in a game with 4 years behind it's development, but instead the focus is to push things like survival because thats in right now so more people will buy the game.

For me it feels like af 50% move to grab some cash and 50% like they want to push new stuff to their existing userbase, they just have the priorities turnd 180 degress.

So do not buy unless you can live with some major bugs in a 4 year old game."
21255,"Two issues with the current game atm
1 - Multiplayer lag
2 - Bugs and Glitches
Was playing with my friends, early game was a bit of slog but it started to seem like it might pick up. Then our car phased through the ground and we lost hours of progress...
Do not recommend until developers make the game more stable."
21256,it is  vary good but hard when starting
21257,"Great game, fun with friends. As of this review the survival is pretty rough, but still playable. Creative is fantastic. A bit slow on the updates. I'd say it's worth $20"
21258,it was in early access for mad long but its still a good game for creativity
21259,I've been waiting for survival to come out for so loong
21260,"Physics are horrible....
I get this is a ""cartoon game"" but a 4 wheel'ed car should roll like a 4 wheel car...
This is basically ""Human Fall Flat"" goofy physics game..."
21261,"Seen the videos on the store so I thought id try it out with an open mind and no spoiling by watching Youtube videos beforehand.

Gave it 44min less than an hour and the game gave me clues with the crashed ship and you need to make food but further than that nothing. In the ship you are supposed to after putting out the fires, bring a battery but no indication on where to get it or get more tools.

I guess this is fairly easy done but for my first player experience and knowing its in Early Access still, a normal text tutorial on what to do and build your first vehicle is missing thus I refunded the game."
21262,good game
21263,i yes like
21264,This game is amazing. It's games like this I want to spend my quarantine playing.
21265,"400 blocks but most are just different colored squares.  Out of interactive blocks that move there is a piston, a bearing and that's it.  No gears, no hinges, no proper driveshafts.  Tutorial doesn't exist, there is a handbook with a few pictures showing how to make a basic car.  Character kept glitching into the car I was building and getting stuck.  I also didn't care one bit for the first person perspective in creative mode, you can't copy/paste parts of the vehicle, you can't use symmetry when building and you have to mess with the lift all the time to reach parts of the vehicle."
21266,yes yes fun
21267,"This is an easy 6/10 from me, decent status ""coop"" game.

Doesn't click with me, but looks to be a fun little game to play with friends."
21268,"I love the tinkering and building aspect, there are some buggy parts but that's tolerable, but the multiplayer falls short a little...too much lag sometimes. I still very much like the play style and look forward to it maturing more. The lack of a way to make/create/unlock mapping capability seems like a shortcoming, but there;s talk of making beacons or something to mark important locations would be awesome....look forward to many more hours of playtime!"
21269,fun
21270,"the new survival game mode is amazing, can't stop playing it!"
21271,fun fun funny
21272,it is very fun good graphics survival is great
21273,great fun .  if you love inventing and building machinery .
21274,its great game i havent yet checked out the survival but if its as good as creative then it makes it twice as good this is easily a 5 star HIGHLY RECOMMEND
21275,really fun
21276,gud
21277,very complex game if you dont want to waste well not waste your time then this game is not for you but other than that pretty good

would 100% recommend, worth the price"
21286,idiot game
21287,dun
21288,gud game yes very
21289,"No thanks, I was so lost trying to figure out the simplest things on survival. You eat to gain water? Wish I didn't have to look that up."
21290,Good.
21291,its nice
21292,Game is very much poggers
21293,great game! still has a lot of stuff I cant wait to see them add but its such an immersive game! Would like to see a faster way to E on metal out in the wild while youre exploring like an upgraded peeler. and Mousing over items in the craft bot should show the name of the required items. Other than that amazing game

2) die from starvation
3) make car, accidentally remove driver seat, watch car rev into the distance with all your possessions

10/10 would make car again"
21310,"It doesn't quite get a recommend from me, yet. Currently it's a bit buggy, not very user friendly and doesn't have much content. There's no map and the crafting menu doesn't tell you what things are so you're left wandering around aimlessly until you stumble across the resource you need which isn't a very rewarding experience. Visually the game looks great though and runs great most of the time but there's some stutters and slowdown when exploring or going into the warehouse. With a bit of polish and more content it will be a great game.

Missing Features/Nitpicks:
No map
Crafting menu doesn't tell you what items are
Can't cancel crafting
Food doesn't tell you how much hunger/thirst it restores
No pause button
You can't build/delete blocks over an area, only a 2D plane which you have to toggle the direction of
No aircraft parts despite having a thruster in the game
No boat parts despite blocks having a buoyancy stat
No way to sort inventory or quick stack to chest
Shift clicking to transfer items between inventories doesn't fill stacks if there's no space, it just won't transfer anything
No way to quick drop items so you have to drag and drop
No indicator that an item can be picked up
You can't place suspension directly onto bearings and vise versa
No way to craft building parts so you have to salvage them and missing recipes for lots of other items
No way to recycle parts so you end up with lots of junk and nothing to do with it
Only 5 enemy types and 2 animals
Grindy resource collection that has to be done by hand because it can't be done by vehicle or automated
Very limited logic setups
It's a game about building vehicles yet there's only 3 different wheels (one of which is never worth using)
No way to mirror building
No way to copy/paste settings or sections
Very limited building range when you click and drag
Very floaty vehicle physics which leads to low tyre grip and vehicles that like to wheelie

Bugs:
Vehicle controls getting stuck in reverse
Suspension not rendering
Vehicle wheels falling through the floor
Items despawning
Missing items names
Typos in item descriptions
If you try and move a vehicle too far with the lift the vehicle despawns
Player names not showing up sometimes
Drag building cancels sometimes
The vehicle wire frame being rendered on top of enemies
Friends can't connect to game sometimes
Framerate drops when you explore too much of the world
Picking up a non empty chest in water stops you from placing anything or eating until you swim back to land to place the chest
Getting ragdolled across the map from getting out of a vehicle or getting stuck against the lift
Animals escaping from pens when you leave the area
Regular crashes
Getting stuck in the elevator after a crash
Elevator doors not opening and getting stuck inside. That's how my last run ended."
21311,"Bought and played through survival with a group. Would recommend it in its current state, but it lacks any meaningful end-game. We did some of the final instances and the loot was boring combined with no boss style fight. Very much a let-down but also understood that this is an early access game.

Looking forward to see how this game ends up!"
21312,Multiplayer is far to buggy to even consider it a good buy.
21313,fun game
21314,"don't like it it's too difficult to learn
"
21315,Fun for some
21316,good
21317,yes
21318,"fun game,  great set of building options,    gameplay loop is pretty basic but its early access."
21319,"Great game, ive played it since 2016 and even though I don't have as many hours as most I still enjoy it alot and I'm so happy that they've finally added survival and so many more creative options since its initial release"
21320,"great game would recommend
"
21321,"this game is very fun, does not require great computer i assure you just turn the quality down, when i first got it my PC almost exploded until i turned off godrays, good game worth 20$"
21322,"Wow, I saw the video for this game and already knew I was going to love it. I downloaded it yesterday and already have about 14 hours in the game and I have barely scratched the surface. It is AMAZINGLY addicting and will keep you entertained for HOURS. 19.99 for this game is a steal. I have paid 60+ for games and lost interested after a few days. That is not the case with this game. 

TO THE DEVS! The only feedback I would like to relay is maybe adding an option to change the outputs for your audio settings. I figured out that if I don't have my headset turned on BEFORE I load the game, it will just default to my PC Speakers and the only way to use my headset for audio is to exit the game completely and reload. Other than that, awesome job and I am excited for any new content to come!"
21323,its pog
21324,Survival is great for a game mode still early in development. Lots of fun so far.
21325,"Would not recommend until the Devs get off their asses and fix things. I have made it to a point in survival where none of my three vehicles are usable. Anything I do either makes the wheels freak out, or they shake while stationary and literally shake themselves away from my base. If I look away for more than 10 minutes they can just dissapear. Only ONE of those three vehicles has suspension on it and it still causes this issue. Removing all suspension from my game didnt fix it. This game is BROKEN and the survival loop is BORING AF. There are only THREE kinds of enemies (4 if you include both types of the same enemy) one of which is a literal aim bot that two shots you.

All I can say is Im glad I didnt pay the full 15$ for this dumpster fire of a game, its not even worth the 7$ I paid
"
21326,"This review is based specifically on my experience in the Early Access with Survival having just been released. The core mechanics of this game are fantastic. The physics engine is engaging and enough to inspire. If you're the kind of person who used Redstone in Minecraft, this game will absolutely appeal to you.

As a con, it is a little short in terms of actual content before it gets repetitive, but if you're someone who's able to invent the fun out of Minecraft, you'll find your way in this game."
21327,It is best Game
21328,"Devs please fix the glitch where you cannot pick up raw materials as well as the bots themselves. The RMB pickup will constantly loop and not be able to pick up the bots and raw materials. 


I just want to say thanks to the Devs of this game. Axolot Games, thank you for answering our calls for bug fixes. You guys waste no time in fixing the game. This is a great game and with devs like this. This game is definitely worth the money. You will be spending a lot of hours in this game as creativity has no limits."
21329,ss
21330,"First let me say that this game can be really fun, until it's not anymore. I am basing this review off the survival aspect, since that's what caught my eye. After a large learning curve for not understanding anything about what to do or how to do anything, I took a very slow start at the beginning. Once I understood the foundation of how the game works and crafts, life got a little better but be aware the grind in this game is stupid real. I didn't feel like I was playing a fun crafting survival game, but what was turning into a meaningless job to gather resources, just to gather resources for the sake of gathering resources. I was still somewhat enjoying it nonetheless, but the more I played the more and more bugs I would come across, to the point where I would just rage quit every night. It was either the Lag was extreme, or vehicles wouldn't work correctly, or items would just leave. The only way to know where your base is located, is just die and not empty out your bag, so good luck spending hours building a base, to go off exploring just to realize an hour later that you forgot how to get back to base. Aspects of the game aside, since some people are perfectly fine playing with those conditions listed, this game need a lot of work in survival, I mean a lot in my opinion. The creative part of the game is fine, and can be fun if that's what you are looking for. I'm giving this a negative review for the fact that is does have a lot of work to do for the price tag. i will recommend it on a sale, ~$10 is perfectly fine for this game. Since the game is still in EA I will revisit in a few months to see if they have patched the game to make it run smoother."
21331,Good game!
21332,ITS GOOD GAMERS!!!!!
21333,"Everything is possible!

Fun in the game is limited to your creativity!!!"
21334,"The game punishes you severely for exploring before you have unlocked certain features. IF you get killed with all of your good crap on you and you are  a forever away being camped by a robot that can shoot you then good luck.
"
21335,"really good game, not as good as minecraft but still a very fun sandbox game"
21336,"i liked it, it was fun. a bit hard to get kits though. if they made a way to make them then it would be cool."
21337,great game :)
21338,"time passes by so fast on this game, one creation after another well worth the cost
"
21339,"fun, free, creative"

21345,you can make things
21346,"I unknowingly purchased this game thinking that it was a good idea. Apparently this game has not really been working since 2016. I looked in the forum threads on the issues and it seems this dev team cannot or will not fix the game. Pass on this one, I regret this buy."
21347,Fun game. A lot to do and i hope for more cool updates

21349,niceee
21350,You can build a G-Force Centrifuge. Your character goes WOBBLEWOBBLEWOBBLEWOBBLE as it picks up insane speeds. It's great :)
21351,best survival game and creativity game
21352,I love making cars that don't work and watching the unspeakable flying objects my friends make. Great physics based engine. 10/10.
21353,it good
21354,Game is stupid fun.  I didnt like it for the first 15mins but after a while it grew on me hardcore now I cant stop playing
21355,realy fun game there is so much to do and create there are endless possibilities now with the survival its also so much fun
21356, its a very good blow job game
21357,I like everything about scrap mechanic.
21358,"  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes video games in general.
Originally when there was only creative mode it was still very fun to play,
especially because I personally like building/creative games.
But i'm sure you will like it too, since you can play creative mode or survival mode now.
  This means if you're like me and like taking it slow and building things without the worry of enemies attacking, and engineering the finest race car or a transforming house or whatever! You can have the perfect sandbox game by playing creative mode.
If you really like survival of the fittest and fighting off hordes of enemies and attempting a journey across a vast wasteland of abandoned farm land, exploring abandoned buildings and finding a forgotten city, then survival mode is for you. I actually loved both, I've played both or an extensive amount of time, and have had a total of 306 hours of playtime on Scrap mechanic only. And I personally suggest this to those of you who like survival or creative games, or even if you want an even mix of both, you can build things in survival too!
So, go out and build something amazing or conquer the deepest dungeon, and please, impress us.
If you enjoy this game as much as I do then please comment to me what you think of it.   :D
"
21359,yes
21360,"Straight to the point. The game is phenomenal. 

        The only real problem myself and my friends have encountered is when playing with multiple people there are significant FPS drops when someone comes across random bots in the world OR when the farm raids happen. Everyone in the game will drop to 15 fps for the duration of the raid until the bots are killed. After they're killed, everyone resumes their normal 200+fps. If I'm playing solo or with only one other person, these heavy FPS drops do not occur."
21361,"This game is a great game, I haven't play the survival portion of the game, only about 2 hours in survival so I cant really go into it (reviewing it wise). Loading the game takes a little it same as loading a game mode. It normal crashes for me but I have no idea why it crashes. overall, its a awesome game."

21374,YES GAME
21375,"Its nice.
"
21376,"Great game, I've had it since the early 2017 days, always has been fun; With survival out, it has completely changed the game, almost as if it's a survival game someone made, and paired up with Axolot and merged the two."
21377,gud
21378,Cool game
21379,"After Survival Update, the game became extremely addictive, and I've bought this game just a week ago. I recommend a lot buying this game, it gives you hundreds of hours of playtime. The building system is very comfortable and easy to learn how to use the tools and other interactive items, its easy to learn how to play for new players. Im satisfied with the graphics, the game looks good and they're not a big thing, and I appreciate that  bc I dont have a pretty good PC.
That is another point, the game will work in almost any PC, and the developers still updating the game and fixing errors/optimizing the game.
Im really satisfied with the game, its one of the best games i've played in my 5-6 years in steam, and it became one of my favourite ones.



Oh I forgot, the only thing I want in this game is a way to make legally RC cars without glitches *-*"
21380,Poorly made multiplayer. P2P Connection makes it impossible to play with anyone over 50 ping away. Input lag and latency is beyond unplayable. Physics are also unstable. You are unable to drive in a straight line on a flat map without the wheels jumping and glitching. Game is missing many key functions like WASD wiring controls. Game requires a bunch of mods to make it playable. Most of the mods dont function and are just as glitchy as vanilla. My refund was declined so i'm out $16 now.

21383,Yes
21384,amazing
21385,"This is so much fun, plus the new survival which i've waited years for. I highly Recommend it if you have some money lying around."
21386,"Hard coding keybindings makes this entirely unplayable for lefties.  I would love to play this game, but simply can't.  This isn't something that should be overlooked by any gaming company at this point.  Remapping is live in game but so restricted by your coding that it isn't even workable by those who really have the interest."
21387,its just a fun game all around
21388,"good game

21390,Honestly a great game. It can get a little bit grindy in survival but besides that its very fun.

21392,this game is cool and i think it would be nice for others to play because there is a lot to do and you can make some awesome builds with or without people in your server.

Improvements for CREATIVE MODE

21410,"Really fun when it doesn't crash entire survival saves, lag consistantly with only 5-10 enemies on screen, or drop massive amounts of frames in perfectly fine areas. I wouldn't do survival with friends yet until some issues are fixed or you could lose hours and hours of playtime as my friends and I have. Creative is cool tho"

21417,YES I WOULD
21418,"11/10 would spend 7 hours looking for the mechanic station again
11/10 would spend 1 hour waiting for the crops to grow because we didn't find a water bucket (They didn't end up growing, we had to find a damn water bucket)"

21420,i liked every single thing about it
21421,Amazing Game 10/10 Would Recommend Not many Limitations to building apart from your imagination
21422,"Fun game. If you like building things and figuring things out, this is for you."
21423,Potato
21424,can we get cool stuff in creative please?
21425,"Try building contraption. Give up. Spawn things from workshop. Crash world. Leave game.
"
21426,ITS AMAZING
21427,Good Game
21428,"Absolutely fantastic game, I'm loving every minute of it.  Sure there are a lot of things I would like to see in the future, more parts, wedge blocks, more story, but it's a great start and I'm super excited to see what new stuff the devs add!!"
21429,"the game is really fun, the physics are a little silly but it fits with the game, the recently added survival mode is a fun challenge."
21430,"Scrap mechanic is a really nice and creative game where you can build really cool machines. Literally, the only limit is your imagination... and survival's grinding. There is something for everyone here. Creative, for people who just want to make stuff. Survival, for people who like grinding for materials and surviving the attacks of the farmbots. Also challenge mode, which has now been made unavailable (for now), where you can make and play challenging levels which require a clever mind.

Absolutely love this game. I love surviving and I like making stuff so this is perfect for me. Absolutely loved playing this with my friend. We both loved it. Of course there are still some things that need fine tuning, but apart from that I 100% recommend this game. Despite being in early access it has plenty of content and I am constantly discovering new things. Worth it."
21431,"I Loved this game and even love it more with the survival update, I loved the new inventory of items, now I only have one issue, with the sandbox capibilities it allows players to create mods and makes it more modifiable players are able to do /unlimited and other commands for survival mode which basically makes them creative... but in a survival world, now I have no problem with this I just wish it leaves a permanent watermark saying ""cheated"" to worlds which were modified in their code, this gives players more purpose to play the survival world in ""survival"" without cheats, a way to think about it is minecraft, once you have the world with cheats on you cant turn them of, pls fix this soon so I can get back to playing my survival worlds :)"
21432,"This game was on my wish list for some time now. But when they just released survival mode, it became too much to resist. So I bought it. Very addictive game-play despite it being a little grindy."
21433,—ã–≤—Ä–∏
21434,"Great game, not a ton of content right now but huge potential and it looks like they're working towards it.  If you like open world games, and you like physics based games where you can make contraptions you'll love it."
21435,"Scrap mechanic was one of my first games on steam.
I spend lot of time playing  with my friends building amazing or just stupid things
With survival update this game becomes that, i was waiting for very long time.
I recommend this game for everyone."
21436,"Still has some bugs and glitches but overall super fun survival/building game. Excited for more to be added, keep up the awesome work!"
21437,"
After 50 hours of playing, I can say that I got bored only after a 5-hour session.Big up"
21438,A good survival game but a big grind
21439,such a dope game
21440,"This game is super addicting. I bought the game two days ago and I've already played it for 33 hours. As a mechanic/custom fabricator myself, I was surprised by the ""Real World"" physics that you have to deal with. Things like suspension travel, wheel binding, center of gravity and the like. It actually makes Scrap Mechanic one of the most realistic vehicle building games, I ever played...aside from Car Mechanic Simulator, of course. This game has so much potential and I can't wait to see what these highly knowledgeable devs, implement next."
21441,"General advice: This is an early access open world survival/crafting game. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, these types of games are notorious for spending years in early access only to end up abandoned or pushed out as ""1.0"" unfinished. You should treat the current state of the game as the full product you're buying and don't pin your hopes on future potential.

Only recommended if you want to play around with a powerful and complex system of automation including controllers, logic switches, etc. Very good if that's what you're interested in, but as far as actual gameplay goes I found it frustrating, repetitive, buggy, and poorly paced.

Early game doesn't explain that you have to find a building in order to unlock the full set of construction options. Tip: don't set up a long term base at your landing point. 

Mid game expects you to farm a lot of crops to unlock defensive guns but farming spawns enemy waves which are a pain in the ass without guns. You also have to gather underwater materials which is tedious, time consuming, and un-automatable.

Late game has big buildings with enemies that kill you in two shots and force you to restart all the way outside, requires you to use a free-energy kludge [spoiler]pistons[/spoiler] to travel the distances required or spend IRL hours farming fuel for gas engines, and finding a mandatory rare resource [spoiler]trapped farmers[/spoiler] anywhere near you is completely luck of the draw. And once you've got all that covered there's nothing new to see or do.

Bugs range from annoyances like losing loot through the ground or animals somehow escaping completely walled in enclosures, to progression-halters like multiple enemy waves per day instead of 1 or being unable to turn in the rare resource mentioned above. Performance is good except rare cases that are acceptable for an in-development game, seems to be related to a lot of loose objects stacked onto eachother, enemy AI pathing issues, and something when loading into the big end-game buildings.

For some people the crafting system will be enjoyable enough to carry the day. But if you want an actual game beyond that you should wait and see if things improve."
21442,"It's nice

21443,Fun game with cool mechanics. Love it
21444,Is good game to play with friend

21447,"Hello Axolot Games!  Your game update is certainly amazing and I have been playing it and developing for 2 weeks in one world.  My problem is simple, I went into the water but did not start swimming, but for some reason I went down the bottom without wasting oxygen, then I fell under the map and still fall.  As a result, the whole world went down the drain because I can‚Äôt die and be reborn again, I will be very happy if you fix this bug, it's simple, you can do it so that if a player accidentally falls under the card he dies or as in creative mode returns to  the same place where it began to fall.  I ask you to fix this bug so that I can continue to play your game and possibly talk about the beta version flaws.  It would also be very cool if you made Russian subtitles in the game.  Thank you so much!

21449,well its a great game for those to want to pull out the mechanic inside them
21450,"good game but you can get lag from time to time

21451,This game to me is if you want to further your knowledge in mechanics or technology then its for you
21452,"Find yourself a partner and play some survival, one of the best building games out there right now! :)"
21453,"At the current state of the game i would not suggest this to others. When they smooth it out with less lag and fix the not so great things of the game.  I always play multiplayer and i get lag more often then i would like and some times down right freezes and dies. Not mention my friend gets tons of lag, sometimes to the point of un-playable. After they smooth out the issues yes i would recommend to others. This game is fun and Challenging. I have mostly played survival and barely played creative but know enough that it has its own issues to be fixed."
21454,This game is great
21455,"Honestly this is such a great game and now that survival has been released, it is one of my favorite games of all time. I highly recommend playing this game as it is so much fun."
21456,build
21457,"At this point in time i wouldnt recommend the game because after a fresh download/install with default settings and creating a world. Upon entering, the game crashed several times at 10% on the loading screen."
21458,"yep, mhmm."
21459,epic game
21460,One of the best builder games I have ever played. Has fun physics and is a great game to play with friends. There is also a great modding scene for the game which gives you even more stuff to mess around with. Even though there are some bugs many of them make the game really fun.
21461,"I really like how fun and creative this game is and the survival is amazing, I do feel like the scrap metal is a bit hard to get."
21462,very fun game if you like making car buildings and exploring in your very own car and survival wow an adventure that takes weeks
21463,Too many survival games now then 4 years ago at launch..Hope they take multi out until the address Many unplayable issues in Multi...
21464,the game is so fun. but hard to get a good world.
21465,"FUN

I love the ability to freely to create and engineer multitudes of things, if anyone is looking for a relaxing, fun, and a blast of a game I recommend this game!"
21477,cause it cool
21478,this is a fantastic game 10/10 they just added survival mode and am eager to check it out
21479,The game is fun to mess around in. Really cool that you can play the game with your friends. Overall very entertaining
21480,"So much fun, creative is wicked fun, allows me to test builds for survival, 30 hours on survival loving every bit, A little grindy, but still fun"
21481,"Love being able to unleash my creativity!

Do not like when my vehicle glitches out upon loggin in and some of my things are missing off of it.

Every 20 minutes i will end up getting a Blue screen without fail i will get one. I think iv'e had 8 blue screens or more in the past 4 hours of gameplay....


(edit)
After managing to fix the issue after hours of trying all i needed to do was reinstall my graphics card drivers and i have yet to have a blue screen. 

Absolutely in love with the game and couldn't recommend it more highly!!"

21510,"I bought this game back in 2016,hardly touched it until the survival mode came out in 2020.Theres a relaxing charm to the game as you gradually design both your base and vehicles.The pleasure in figuring out why a design is failing is great.
However,the game still needs alot of work.Particularly in regards to its U.I ,The lack of tooltips or identifications on recipe items is a frustration for new players.
Sadly there is no crash destruction physics.
Both of these things can be rectified.
I have high hopes for the game."
21511,FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
21512,"Crashes often when using explosives and sensors, medium sized builds will slow the game down noticeably."
21513,Enthralling game. has a slow start due to resources needs but once up and runing its a great game to spend some time in.
21514,"Very fun for an engineering game. The only issues I've run into are different free floating items occasionally glitching through walls and floors, and mouse freezing. Farm bots are enjoyable to deal with. They are easy individually, but large groups are a challenge, and are not repetitive. There is a lot of grinding for resources. I would appreciate a wider variety of joints and gears. All in all, an addictive and fun game."

21522,Pretty Good
21523,nice game
21524,Clunky at times but maybe thats my hardware. lots of fun to play though.
21525,"just get space engineers horrible devs that instead of making a full game release other incomplete games
"
21526,THE NEW MODE SURVIVAL IS VERY UNFINISHED
21527,Fun game but Co-op is very disappointing. Heavy stuttering for client
21528,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
21529,Masterpiece
21530,"Its a bit hard to get the hang of and most things i didnt know how to obtain or find and i had to look them up on the internet, i would prefer if there where a few more informative things when you first start the game such as where to find the better crafting stations, but it is in fact in early access and its still a fun game regardless, would recommend for people who like a survival game, and also love a good building challenge
All in all its a good game but i feel as though its quite unbalanced as there are powerful enemies and no armor that can be made or even better weapons other than the spud guns you can trade for which still take QUITE a bit of time to obtain, and you cannot just simply cook raw foods as there are only three recipes in the game and none of them are simple by ANY means"
21531,"Nice game. Hard to learn, easy to master"
21532,"Pretty great early access. Took a long time for me to have my first crash. A few bugs around of course but very solid compared to other early access releases. Exploring was fun early game, good variety of destroyed buildings to explore. By the time I was over that I was already doing other things so that worked. Fun game play loop involving building bigger and better machines and collecting more exotic clothes, weapons and plants to grow. Great creative tools, with lots of potential to add lots of extra great features, already includes a bunch. 

Only negative is water physics are lame and I can't find a way to make collecting of oil significantly easier while most everything else can be automated or made significantly easier."
21533,Good Game.
21534,Best game ever
21535,"fun game if you like to ""grind"" for parts, if not. always fun to create stuff in creative."
21536,Ye Very cool
21537,its good
21538,Very creative game.  Lots of opportunities to build and explore.  Some of the Bots are annoying and its a bit grindy on materials but fuN!
21539,SO FUN!
21540,IDK
21541,Awesome game for creative guys :p
21542,"I really Enjoy this game alot! there are a few things that they need to balance out, and there are a few things they need to add like a Map System, with waypoints! But for those few this wrong, there are alot more Great things about them game! My Son and i have played over 50 hours together in game, and it has really helped he and i work better together as a team! So i give this Game a 4.5 out of 5 stars, and as soon as they fix and add the few things that they need to, this game will gat a 5 out of 5 Stars!!!!!"

21545,"Great sandbox game very nice and well optimised would reccomend. If you like games like this I reccomend you play stormworks.
"
21546,"It's pretty good
"
21547,Really fun survival mode with fun posibilities.
21548,"Lots of potential for a fun game. I enjoy the play style and the way the game works, but the physics makes the game impossible. When I build a 4 wheel vehicle with a drill on the front to mine rocks, it works just fine until I get close to some specific rock nodes. When I get close to the rocks, the vehicle turns into a jelly like state and makes the game unplayable. It should be noted that while this happens, the framerate of the game lowers to around 1fps, Note that this does not slow down my computer, but rather seems to be slowing the game only, making me think there is some simulation speed limit that is lowered when I try to drill rocks."
21549,best game ever
21550,Its a pretty fun building game and the only limit is your own mind.
21551,great sense of survival game play with creative crafting mixed in. Looking forward to updates
21552,"Decent game, well thought out here and there but incredibly flawed and bland survival mode for the time being. Mostly: 

Bunch of performance issues, no proper server hosting (have to be in-game permanently to host for others aswell), terribly grindy gameplay with little reward (e.g. running out of fuel too often). 

Good parts are the way you can collect stone & wood but the other resources are just meh."

21555,Its awesome
21556,Good game
21557,the game is easy even though it looks intimidating.it could use a map and a compass in survival and a multiplayer menu option other than that its an amazing game thats got me hooked.
21558,Very very good game buy now I make you
21559,"its a great creative game, and now its a great survival game too!"
21560,A game with endless modding potential similar to Minecraft or the Arma series. I look forward to what the developers can accomplish with multiplayer survival in the next five years.
21561,this game fucking sux dik
21562,"i like the game ,you can do some very awesome creations ,but to be honest there is not much to do in survival ,a think i dont like about the game is that you have to wait for the next ""episode""    like cmon the game was releast in 2015 (im not 100% sure) and the survival came out in 2020 and now we have to wait for the next episode 

let my know what you think"
21563,e tare ba baieti
21564,Waited for survival before I reviewed and I have to say this is a studio you can trust when it comes to early access. Creative was cool but survival is amazing. Keep in mind that this game is not done and everything isn't optimized yet so I would recommend high specs for survival as it really chugs.

21569,"I think I have now played the game enough to give a helpful review about the new survival update.

The new survival mode in its core gave us new features such as procederal world generation, dungeons and it also added enemys just as well as a health and hunger bar.
Engines now consume fuel and batteries in survival.

There are two main focuses you will have in survival, one is to build vehicles and machines that will make farming more efficient (keep in mind that when I talk about farming, I dont just mean watering crops, the game also gave us the ability to cut down trees realistically and you also got the option to mine rock formations),
and defending your crops from waves of enemys.
The size is calculated by the value of crops you have per field in a chunk btw, so for anyone that just started the game, don't go above 9 crops because after that the game will spawn enemys every night.

Anyways, the game has quite alot of pros such as:
the game now has a purpose that gives you motivations to build vehicles,
the game allows you to edit settings such as crafting recipes or looting chances which greatly reduces the grind aspect if you're not into grinding,
the games world generation is one of the best ones ive seen so far visually, exept for the road generation (con),
they managed to make boring tasks such as farming fun
and I feel like the general Update was definitely what the comunity expected and far beyond even.

but here is the thing about the cons:
the games water physics only calculate boyancy but on such a basic level that building a realistic boat is basically impossible,
it doesnt introduce newcommers to anything important really which frustrates people who just bought the game,
the netcode is aweful now, like... before the update it was relatively playable but now its mostly impossible to not encounter a laag every 3 seconds,
the game does not have beacons (jet! they are working on it) and the only way to make beacons is by being killed so you can see your bag,
the game forces you to stay where you are kind of, having a base that is really far away is mostly impossible because you need to bring really heavy robots with you which means having a base on islands is mostly impossible,
the game does have many bugs right now and you get a crash message everytime you leave the game.

but still, would I recommend it? 
Personally I would yes, but if youre someone that just got the game, you WILL need a friend to teach you the game for sure, otherwise you wont know what to do.
"
21570,"Survival mode slaps. I had not played this game beforehand, but making goofy machines with the boys while trying to avoid getting murdered by robots is a great way to spend quite a few hours."
21571,"I want to like this game. It's hard to imagine that this game has been out for 4 years and it's this buggy. It needs a MAJOR update; like a complete overhaul to the engine before I could ever recommend seriously picking this up. Game performance basically dies after playing in Survival for varying hours (Computer specs do not matter at all). Entity's on screen and just blocks/parts in general lag the user to the point where it becomes impossible to play. If the devs ever optimize game performance and multiplayer, my vote will change."
21572,INCREDIBLY CREATIVE GAME I LOVE IT
21573,Awesome Gmae!
21574,great game
21575,I like it a lot because of their survival mode.
21576,"I am doing a Review on Survival.

Sorry but i can't recommend this, it's such a waste of time of pointless craft and same enemies all the time.

The craft is grinding as hell and same goes for farming, farming takes a lot of time to just get the food you need and also at night there's always a wave of robots to attack and destroy everything, the more you Farm the worst it gets...
i am getting like 10 enemies at the same time and Tape bots to just destroy my life.

The Warehouse is also a waste of time, killing all the tape bots and you can go to 5 floors, on the 3-4 floor you get secret loot but when you reach the top there's literally nothing....

It's still in ""Early Access"" but i was expecting something good and not THAT Grinding for a Survival game, don't get me wrong it's a Great game but the Grind takes my life away.

Please if the Devs are seeing this, PLEASE Fix the Grind, it's INSANE! (5 Oil for 5 Gas, it would be better 2 oil for 5 gas)

what i still don't understand why make the game this Huge if there's literally nothing, all you can see is the same ""Store"" with ""Fresh"" sign and 2 same Bots.

Weapons are good and bad, good because is fun to shoot, the bad because waste too much Potato for killing 1 normal enemy, 4 potato for the farmerbots, 3 potato for spiderbot, 1 potato Headshot the Tape bot, 2 potato if you hit Tape bot in the body, Big Red Robot you take him with like 50 POTATO!!?!?! BUT WHY?!?!

SORRY But no, i am looking for more Updates in the future, Speaking for the game RIGHT now it's a BIG NOPE from me!

You can get more playing Subnautica if you are hungry for ""Survival games"" with Story.

Scrap Mechanic Survival is fun but I wish for a Story like Final boss or something."
21577,The game is so Nice
21578,This game can help you learn physics and have lots of fun playing the game
21579,Loving every minute I spend on here!
21580,this game is better than crucible
21581,"I have played this game long enough to say, its a great game. the fact that there is so much to do it really sparked my creativity for the first time. I give it 10/10."
21582,it is a good game really worth getting very creative and has good survival mode i recently got it because of survival and it is worth the money
21583,Loadsa fun
21584,i like the game
21585,Its fun and has endless possibilities

21589,very nice
21590,"This game is a great way to express and utilise your engineering mind, there are endless possibilities in terms of what you can do in this game. If you like creating machines and buildings, this is definitely the game for you."
21591,"bought it for co-op with my brother and was unplayable!! Watch out, it crashes ALOT and will LAG like crazy!! Only got 5 MINTUES before it would kick me from a local game mind you!!"
21592,nice game
21593,"it is highly additive, and resource grindy. but fun with friends!"
21594,"If you like falling through the floor of the map and losing everything in your inventory with no way of getting it back, then my friends this is the game for you!"
21595,great game
21596,"Game is horrendously buggy and unplayable unless you like having you valuable time wasted. Stuck in elevators, death barriers, glitching all over the place, if you die while crouched you than are perma crouched and can only move supper slow... and on and on...
This game has amazing potential but also still needs a lot of work... and yes I know it's early access but it has been around for years... maybe the devs should hire more staff to get it done rather than blowing money on whatever it is they are blowing it on... cause it sure ain't coders..."
21597,There's a high satisfaction of building your invention and having it work as intended. It takes lots of planning and trial and error sometimes but I love building something functional and getting ideas from the community.
21598,fun game
21599,dope af
21600,"i have to admit its a fun game and when it was just creative i got borded a bit but i got adicted again when survival came out i just have one problem, no waypoints or any way to find your bace in survival if your a long distance away and lost. Edit: waypoints have been added"
21601,"Fun game to play. Would like to see dedicated servers, but they do have steam friend option."
21602,it is a fun game that has so many posibilitys for creative peapole (P.S:sorry for the bad spelling)
21603,"was fun until my craftbot, vehicle, and my farm just disappeared entirely"
21604,SHIT SLAPS
21605,good.

21607,its so laggy with playing with my friends can u fix that please.
21608,fun

21612,Fun to just murder the bots
21613,"Although, I never played prior to the Survival release, but I'm really enjoying the game. I do wish more of my friends had it, b/c it's much better played with others. The building & figuring out how things should go together is amazing. It is a bit 'buggy' with the connecting of bearings, engines, steering etc. Vehicles will sometimes not work properly after sitting in the seat, and sometimes will only go in reverse. You can keep entering and exiting the seat until it works, or just removed the ""bugged"" item and reconnect it, seems to work.  For all I know, it could be something I am doing wrong, not sure. Regardless, the game is fun and worth it when on sale. I've really enjoyed it so far."
21614,Love the creative side of things and survival is alot of fun
21615,"Pretty fun, I'm a sucker for these collection/survival/crafting games.  The uniqueness in this game is that you can build your own vehicles and contraptions. Absolutely worth the lost price of this game!"
21616,It is a fun game...for a little while. At this point the survival is missing too many quality of life features and a lot of the content is locked behind an excessive amount of grind. If you have a few friends to share a world with and can tolerate a lot of lag then I would pick it up but if you plan to play solo then wait for a few more updates.
21617,good
21618,"With my experience only really being with Conan Exiles for ""building"", this game scratches an itch to actually put some designs together.

Creative mode let's you test it all out, without being bothered.

Survival adds enemies, and maintaining thirst/hunger while keeping the creative but you have to actually go work for the items you need.


It's still a bit basic, and I'm sure the devs have more planned.   I recommend survival with friends!"
21619,"FUN & 
AMAZING"
21620,beans
21621,"its cool?
"
21622,Good game. I liked the part where the game
21623,"- start survival
- grind resources for the first car with round wheels and real suspension
- test the prototype, decide the driver's seat needs to be moved slightly
- remove the driver's seat without putting the car on the lift
- without controller the engine switches¬†to constant speed mode, with speed previously set to max
- watch the car driving off into the sunset on its own, with God knows how much fuel left
- grind resources for the second car with round wheels and real suspension

10/10"
21624,"A very good game.
"
21625,"I wish there was an option for Not Yet instead of just No for these reviews.

As somebody who bought the game for the Survival Update and hasn't played in Creative at all, keep in mind that my perspective is from a fresh, new player with no prior experience with the game.  I bought this game hoping that it could be the next in a line of survival building games to play with a group of friends who all enjoy these types of games together.

Jumping into the game as it is now, there's no tutorial of any kind on how to play except for a cute little handbook on how to build a car, which the game doesn't even indicate exists until you open the keybinding options and find it yourself.  You spawn next to a flaming wreck of a building and are just let loose to figure out what this game is with no instruction or indications from the game itself.

For example, there's mop bucket looking items that you can find to put the fire out after figuring out that holding right click will pick certain things up, (there's no overlay to teach you this, or indicate the object you're looking at is interactable) but you can't put them down again unless you look in the keybindings and wonder if the ""Force Build"" key is for placing things.

There's a small farming area by where you start that has a sign that teaches the basics of farming through pictograms, which is great and cute and fine as is, but the items you grow have only the barest of descriptions in your inventory and don't tell you what they'll do if you consume them.  Some food items you find in the game can't be consumed by you at all, and there's nothing to tell them apart unless you try.  Except food is a precious resource with the hunger mechanic being as brutal as it is.

I understand that this is Early Access and still in Beta, which is why I'd rather leave a Not Yet review rather than just No.  But it's those little things that feel like the game just expects you to know how to play it already that have really turned me off of it as a new player.  They're little things, just simple UI features or overlays that'd explain things better, that I'm sure will be put in the game eventually.  But they were enough for me personally to not even try to get a multiplayer game going with my friends."
21626,I definetly  recommend this game....great fun
21627,"just a 10/10 open world sandbox, would reccomend"
21628,"Recommended for those who enjoy making contraptions and tinkering of all shapes and sizes now with the newly added survival its incredibly fun, however one thing that is really disappointing is the stability issues, you will usually drop in frames a lot if your creation is overly complicated or there are a lot of items collisioning in to each other. Another note if you are playing with friends or even just yourself i've found limiting the FPS within the NVIDIA Control panel to 60 FPS has helped with crashing and stability."
21629,NICE GAME
21630,"Amazing,just amazing
why?
cz it is a game u can play if u are 6 year old and build a car 
or when u are 35 and u actually build cars this game stays fun till these days!
Also the survival is just fully new game.OR it is just minecraft with MUCH better graphics and gameplay :D"
21631,Yeet
21632,Super fun
21633,"YES & NO 
Needs a controller setup
Servers or a setup for one with a pie hosting has a issue with distance
building is a charm & really nice.. collection oil is a pain atm
driving is really hard hosting 3+ friends
Fun building game that has it's glitches but that is expected with a Early Access Game as long as they keep rolling out them patches & not wait over a year to push content like other Early Access games should be g2g.

Wait Try & get it on sale!"
21634,good

21639,fun
21640,its fun and has potential
21641,"I've played 27 hours of game, I've  car i made an amazing off-Road car but when I craft resource collector I got back to my car and couldnt find it that simple , WHY!!!!????????????????"
21642,"Very good game, ever since survival came out its been very very fun and definitly worth the money"
21643,I'm having a really good time on survival mode !
21644,"Great game!
"
21645,Very good and has nice mods to use.
21646,fun
21647,Maybe in a few years when they have some more content but for now it's pretty lackluster.
21648,GOOD WITH FRIENDS!!!
21649,best update ever.
21650,the grind is a little crazy long but still a good game
21651,SeemsGood
21652,"exelent game would recommend to gamers who like sandbox and survival games
"
21653,Worth a minute.
21654,Yeah it's great just want them to iron out the bugs and make it run smoother and it will be perfect:)
21655,One of the best game I've ever played. Let your imagination run wild because you can
21656,Don't recommend
21657,Epic! Endless possibilities. This game has so much potential
21658,love the game
21659,"The game is cool, but if you worked on the optimization, it would be generally gorgeous!"
21660,I‚Äôve only play this game for one day and have loved it. Not much on words and it does have some bugs but I love the game. Before I buy a game I watch YouTube before I even consider it.
21661,"Look no further if you are looking to scratch your minecraft-itch. Whether you build your own base, vehicle, factory or automation, heck, why not all? thats literally what i did. A moving fortress tank complete with your own resource collector and factory to craft all what u needed to help you go on adventure in survival mode. This game has all the cool mechanics of interactive parts using bearing, suspensions, pistons, etc, so you can go crazy on your creations! 

It's the current best alternative to minecraft with physics. This game definitely have big potential with more content update. I just hope they can release the updates fast enough to keep me constantly glued to it!"
21662,"I love similar games like Factorio, Space Engineers, and Satisfactory. This one is a nice, more casual, and more logic driven game. Surprisingly, there is a lot LESS clang in the automation mechanics that its competitors. And that alone is what has made it so much more fun for me!"
21663,"Kinda like minecraft but focused on the building/mechanics part.
If you like redstone in minecraft or so, then buy it, it's a rly good game.
Just a bit hard in the beginning to get started with building and how to do everything, would be nice with a manual or something to be able to look up how to build/do stuff"
21664,Its a very fun game especially for Minecraft players
21665,"I've played too many hours of Scrap Mechanic already. 

Sometimes I'm breaking rocks for materials, fighting robots at my farm, or raiding buildings. Those things are fun, but what's really fun is when I spend 20 minutes building an elevator, 30 minutes to make lights in the elevator that count the floors as you pass them, and 3 hours just trying to make automatic doors for the elevator. There's nothing quite as satisfying as my janky doors. 

10/10"
21666,Amazing. That's all I have to say
21667,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER
21668,its a good game
21669,Been playing this since the survival mode was added and it's amazeballz fun.
21670,I liked it
21671,Really cool game.
21672,"For the price, this is one of the best purchases you can make if you have a craving for building off the wall constructs. Survival is a bit buggy at the moment (5/21/2020) but overall the game is great."
21673,"A great sandbox game, with a lot of potential; 100 hours in, already one of my favourite games. It's a shame about the lag"
21674,"GAME TOXIC, GAJELAS, TAPI MANTAP"
21675,"I've played Scrap Mechanic almost since release. It's a great game that gives tons of hours of fun even just in creative mode. Survival mode? It's just what the game needed. Can't wait for more content.  But don't buy it *for* survival mode. It's not really that sort of game, it's more about the 'scrap mechanic' part of the game. Building weird contraptions or vehicles to help you fight enemies and get lots of resources. 

If you like spending hours making a car, autoturret, crushing trap, or other such shenanigans it's definitely worth a buy. If the idea of probably needing to spend a long time to make a car that doesn't immediately flip over bothers you, i'd say skip it.  

Tl;dr: Not for people with short attention spans"
21676,"i like axolotls

21677,I love this game and play it a lot of the time and highly recommend it
21678,"I love the game sooo much fun
"
21679, i love mods
21680,I acually like this game. I find it kinda hard to create stuff but that isn't a bad thing thats pretty good.
21681,Amazing game! So much potential to do anything you want!
21682,This game is complex but when you get used to it it great
21683,"This game has been awesome and scratches a number of my gaming itches.

The building mechanics are super fun, but be warned there is a bit of a materials grind in survival, so be prepared to constantly go out harvesting. 

If that's not your thing they have an extremely robust creative mode allowing for all manner of unrestricted shenanigans. 

Can't wait to see what else they add into this game! Adventure, hooooooooo!!!!!"
21684,"I'm having a blast with this game even though its a fairly new genre to me and playing solo. Trying out the survival mode is a lot of fun, designing (with a lots of trial and errors and reverse engineering cool stuffs you see from youtubers & reddit) my own car, drill wagon, automatic bots stomper base defence system etc. The game provide interesting mechanics for building cool machines with things like pistons, bearings, wheels, logic gate etc. 

However, as much as the game has huge potential you can see its still in early access with issues like fps drop and limited things to do in survival, after i'm done with warehouse raid. Looking forward for the future updates like dedicated server and more stuffs to do in survival"
21685,"Survival mode and open world creative mode are both really fun. The game lags at times and it seems like the devs couldve put more work into making the game lighter and less of a burden on your machine.  the amount of ways to build and engineer something is so immense and i like how the game has played out thus far. I wish the map was a little smoother and the trees were taller. I feel like its pretty hard to drive through the forest but w/e, i still like it a lot. would recommend to anyone who likes to build their own stuff in games and utilize their creations. wish there was more wheels available like street performance wheels and maybe a wench you could mount to the car with a rope that coils around a spool. you could use the wench to help teammates when their cars are stuck, or maybe get yourself unstuck. survival mode has added a whole new layer, looking forward to enjoying it more."

21691,"Was nothing I expected, find myself wanting to play just to find new things.  Only down fall is they could reduce the spawn rate of robots and give us more food options.  Other than that this game is awesome a must have if you have every played minecraft."
21692,excuisit game recomend for creative minds
21693,u cant join freinds u have to restart the game a couple of times so u can join ur friends
21694,Survival made my computer heat up a lot and it almost burned. I stil like the game but it's sad I can't play it
21695,this game is great
21696,"This is such a great game but it has so many problems right now I can't recommend it. These include:

- In its current state Survival is ridiculously grindy. I'm always having to gather more materials and the hunger/thirst are far too punishing. All you do a lot of the time is forage the same crap over and over and over again. It feels like this might have been done to inflate the game's size (currently it's rather sparse), but it just becomes really annoying. I've only made two vehicles, the mats needed for building & particularly upgrading them are just way too much.

- Metal is so hard to farm. I collect every bit of scrap metal from every Haybot I destroy, and all the metal I can drill for, and it's never enough. Instead I have an entire chest full of stone (the more common material you get from drilling) but never enough metal.

-Your 'automatic' crafting/refinery machines only work if you're within a certain radius to them. I've come back from days-long missions only to have jobs I assigned to them before leaving still incomplete. Why do they only work when you're around? I could be literally out back of the shop cutting wood or something and I'd realized I'd gotten out of range, so they'd stopped working. This makes absolutely no sense.

- Steering/controlling your vehicle is terrible. I have a mostly steel truck (so it's fairly heavy) with a high-level engine, seat, off-road shocks, off-road tires (doubled, eight in total), and the thing slides across grass like it's on ice. This makes complex activities like drilling next to impossible, particularly on a slope.

- Drilling is bad. Really bad. Somehow the drill attached to the front of my heavy truck throws it into the air before making any progress on the stone, flinging it around like a toy while the smallest chunks of stone are practically immovable. The drill has such a small hit-box it's almost impossible to drill anything with it. I have three drills side-by-side, with pistons to move them right/left, forward or downwards, and it's STILL bloody impossible to drill. I just break up the big rocks then do the rest manually.

- Transformations (adjusting the position of an item you want to place) are really terrible. They often don't save, so if you're placing a few of the same thing you have to re-transform them each time, and the transformation options take forever to cycle through. Instead of giving some common positions first it cycles through every rotation along an axis before switching to the next. God, what a time waster.

- The absolute worst is the 'artifacting', where your character gets stuck when pushing against something like an obstacle or a wall. In this game your character gets caught/stuck on literally everything- even seemingly smooth walls or other surfaces. I'm constantly getting stuck, it makes no sense. And for some reason sometimes jumping on narrow surfaces makes you involuntarily jump again, which often leads to more instances of getting stuck. Really, really, really bad. Not sure why this is such a massive problem- it makes exploration in tight areas with enemies nearby a nightmare, as the main (only) melee strat against most enemies is hitting them while backing up.

The crafting part is great. Everything else (at least in terms of Survival) needs a lot of work before I'd suggest this to friends. Can't recommend yet, although I do think this game has a lot of potential."

21702,i loved it
21703,"Scrap Mechanic is an amazing game, both before and after the recent survival update. The feeling of creation and destruction is amazing. The game can be buggy at times, but understandably so.

It's based on your own creativity, so if you aren't insane enough to come up with a trebuchet that launches cows across the map, the game might be a little less fun. The bugs really only come into play when poking the bear a little, and they are almost entirely non-problematic. If you enjoy sandbox games, or the feeling of thinking up some mechanism and seeing it through to it's creation, then you should check it out.

21704,fun game build good fun game good
21705,"Harvest resources; build vehicles and machinery; plant and harvest crops; fight off murderous robots that want to stop farming.

21711,With 100 Hours of playtime in Survival Mode  im really loving and im just speaking on survival mode as of this date of this review the game has a lot of farming and gathering but its also enjoyable to create and survive since apperently you canT farm w/o getting attack which we of survival mode love it and hate it at the same time if you are planing a survial mode game with FREE crafting i highly recomended but remember the Survival mode is still on Early Release as of this post 1 week from survival mode May 2020. give a try and enjoy the game :)
21712,"there is a potential for creativity, devs stopped releasing updates(in beta since 2016), physics are too broken, not optimised for most mid-range pcs, big creations *will* lag even on high-end machines, so the total is around 5/10"

21715,Minecraft but better!
21716,Holy crap this game is fun!
21717,"There are so many game breaking bugs that I cannot understand how this game is getting so many popular reviews. I just don't get it. There is also very little content. There are a few POI's to loot but they all have the exact same mobs, with the exact same loot in the exact same places. Boring. Lag spikes are so bad it is unreal. When asking what I can do to fix this issue, I was told ""Don't use bearings"" ""or Pistons"" or any other number of things. What is the point? The entire concept of the game is to use those things. WTH? Every single streamer is complaining about the exact same thing. The game is so terribly optimized it is almost unplayable even on a high end computer. I spent some time in creative mode and had only a few issues with bearings/pistons. Otherwise creative mode worked fine. I bought the game for survival mode tho. Really hope this is fixed soon. I don't like to give thumbs down on early access games but lately it has just become a joke."

21722,"Rather frustrated with this game. They should not punish you for getting your items. You can get into a state where you die and are unable to walk back to your corpse due to water or food considerations. This should be addressed in later releases. You should carry something over or be able to select options that allow you to retain you inventory on death. It completely sucks if you die too far from your bed and literally lack the ability to retrieve your items because you don't have enough food or water. 

Also, there is no tutorial so you have no idea why you are doing what you are doing AND you are punished for trying to grow things because bots spawn to remove what you are growing."
21723,good
21724,Needs a lot of work. Wait a year and then pick this one up.
21725,awesome
21726,nice
21727,meh not for me but can see the appeal
21728,fun for all
21729,Its very open to creativity and the blocks blend well with environment. Its like LEGO technic 10/10
21730,If you don't like Minecraft type games you won't like this. Also u cannot play this alone.
21731,I like that it is good
21732,i've followed this game for 2 years now and i love it with the new survival update and the small hud and little forced tutorial it feels like a true survival where you have ti find your bearings (literally) and learn the game yourself there is a help guide if you need it but overall i love this game and all the vehicles you can make

21738,GOOD GAME
21739,some of the most fun I've had in years playing a game. Also the most frustration. 9/10
21740,"Can't stop playing it!  Played all kinds of survival games from Minecraft to Empyrion and many more, but am having more fun in this game than I remember having in any of the others.  Lots of fun"
21741,.
21742,"I got this game because I love survival sandbox (Ark, minecraft etc). After 30 hours or so. Very impressed. Love the physics and am amazed by how technical you can get with your creations.  This game has shot up to the top of my fave list for this genre. 

Equal to if not greater than I hoped for!"
21743,"Minecraft but you're a mechanic and not steve.

All around great game, I got it when it was creative only a few years ago, but they just released survival mode and it's so well made and cohesive. Obviously there are some quality of life issues with the new mode, but I'm eager to see more updates and I'm glad to see the devs are hard at work even 4 years after the initial release."
21744,i love this game
21745,"Good game but few minor bugs
"
21746,i liked everything
21747,Good game. Now has human trafficking.
21748,"I have played for 45 hours now and man I love this game! It is a fun distraction from Space Engineers. This game a lot of complexity but very easy to get into. The learning curve is gradual and is good for new players to this type of game and for veterans of the genre. 
It does feel like it is missing something though. It needs more stuff to make it feel complete. BUT. It is a Beta, so I understand that fully. It makes me look forward to the future additions! 
Oh. The animations are soo damn good. They really bring the robots to life in an amusing way. Please give it a try. I totally recommend this game!"
21749,good game
21750,"It feels like no one actually play tested survival before it came out.  No tutorial to speak of at all on how it all works, you'll probably be wandering around for hours before you get your bearings.  The amount of component kits and metal you need is downright horrible for how you get them. (breaking respawning crates at monuments that maybe give you 5-10 per), fuel is gotten either through this or diving for oil geysers that spawn maybe 50-30 feet apart in groups of 1-3, you only get 1 oil from these and your engines suck this oil at like 10 per 5 minutes, so get used to diving.  The same goes for glue, you get 1 glue for 3 of these giant clams littered around the ocean floor incredibly far apart.  for the large chest you need 5, so have fun spending 5-10 minutes bobbing for clams for 1 fucking chest.  the only way to get metal early game is through killing the yellow robots and spending like 10 seconds refining the arm they drop while you hold E. you need to do this at least 200 to get things rolling so get used to waiting between killing robots and standing holding a button.  There are crafting times in the minutes which makes no sense,  why have crafting times in a game all about building huge machines when the blocks are like 1/20th of the size of your playermodel. Just a horrible implementation of things that should be good with a little balancing."
21751,"Survival mode was worth the wait. On a long journey to find a biome that has cotton in my pickup truck a swarm of Haybots murdered me and forced me back to spawn. To avoid trekking out on foot to get back my truck, I built a buggy out of spare parts and a flat bed trailer so I can tow my new buggy back home with me after I find my main ride. 

These random events of your journeys make this game the gem that it is. To fully appreciate the experience, you need to make use of your engineering mindset to find solutions to the various challenges the world throws at you. 08/10, even as a soloist.

Edit/Update after a few 100 hours:
I basically corrupted my save file/world by placing my additional vehicles (engines, suspensions and all) into a garage created on top of a mobile base (which was more of a land crawler). I then upgraded the suspensions on my land crawler and then saved the game. Now any time I load, the game crashes!

I learned this has to do with a bug that causes any suspended creations to bounce upon first loading into a world. My mistake was that I had a creation loaded with other creations that also had suspensions, and I presume this creates havoc when trying to load the world."
21752,"I have logged quite a lot of hours on this game. It was really fun and addicting to play up until the past few hours. I have mainly been playing with a friend of mine but today it reached a point were the game just got too frustrating and it had too many gamebreaking bugs. Every time I tried to join my friends world there would be extreme lag and I could not to anything for minutes at a time, only suddenly to die from robots. To add insult to injury, when I did respawn, I was unable to pick up my stuff from my inventory bag (where I had previously died) because the bags would glitch through the ground and all the items would be lost.

So I am not able to play this game any further in multiplayer and this is the reason for the bad review. I will update this review if this changes, as this game has a lot of potential to be a great game."
21753,It was good with just creative but now with survival (after like 3-4 years) it even more worth the purchase
21754,"Dude...sweet.
"
21755,"Very fun survival game that let's you play how you want and at your own pace.  It would be beneficial to have a little help page to help new players understand where to attain certain items but if you play long enough you're bound to figure it out.  
10/10"
21756,"I hate to give it a bad review, but I just can't recommend this game as of right now.
I have been playing this game with a friend and it is really fun and has huge potential to get even better. But in the last few days we have been experiencing gamebreaking bugs which prevents me from giving this game a thumbs up.
There are some loading issues, where I have to close down the game via taskmanager and reload again. It's slightly annoying but not necessarily gamebreaking.
Most problematic were the connection issues, lags and major delays in the game experienced on client side joining the server. We would try and try again but it wasn't uncommon that the client would experience delays of up to a minute.
Since this game is fun when it works and the intensity of the connection issues varied from day to day, we still got some decent play time. But today it hit a breaking point when we tried for more than an hour to make it work without success.

I will update this review when things get better."
21757,good
21758,"Awesome concept. Not really many out there like it. In fact, I don't think there really is a good comparison. You have got to just go try it out yourself. I bet you will love it."

21760,yes just yes also survival

21763,Reminds me a lot of Banjo Kazooie: Nuts n Bolts. The building and weight distribution is awesome. I really enjoy the terrain generation. The only limits of machines so far are the amount of controls available and imagination. I can't wait to see where this game goes in the future.

21765,WOW I'm hooked . This is so much fun .
21766,yes
21767,"Played for a while now. Well made overall. I like ui, graphics, the gameplay style and building what you want is awesome! :)

Cons have occured while playing. 
- More versatile engines. There's only two. Gas and electric and only 1 slider to choose how it works which sucks. + Engine affects your grip on tyres what sucks even more as using same tyres electric one can pull u up hill, but gas wont even though both spinning wheels or at least it feels like engine affects wheel grip. 
- Needs lot more variety like different wheels more than 2 different kind of. 
- NO BUTTON CONFIGURATOR
- NPC :D
- More solid physics as those are good, but when u umm build too much or try to make truck with trailers it destroys the fps. Physics slider is good alternative, but then bearings starts to flop a lot. 

- More reasons to develop and build thingys as now it's mostly sandbox with warehouses and u can get clothes from those lol (and pineapple seeds)"

also the fact that these maps are randomly generated is so impressive because its almost seemless and looks admazing
cant wait to see what comes next"
21810,It is a good game
21811,Super awesome game!!! very addictive. There are a few bugs here and there and room for a lot of improvement but forgivable because the game is currently in Beta and the fact that it's in Beta in no way a reason to not get into it now. Thumbs up all day!!!
21812,"[Warning | Spoilers]

Things to know going in (things the game itself doesn't tell you about) 

Survival Mode doesn't let you access mods. Much like ARK, many of the things you would hope would already be included in the vanilla game are missing, and only available in the form of mods. 

Creative Mode is great because you get access to a couple of different maps, and a crap ton of mods, and blueprints you can play with. 

It's disappointing that I can't create a blueprint in Survival or use a blueprint I've created assuming I have the resources to build the thing... would save a lot of time configuring control schemes and connecting ""wires"". 

The biggest disappointment right now, is that robots will constantly and randomly wander up to my base / vehicles and just, obliterate them. Granted I could build in harder to reach areas away from my garden, but it's not practical how often I go for a rapid shit, come back and my base is gone, or my vehicle is trashed, and I'm dead a full day and night's walk away from the base. 

Handling the robots is very meta. You can just build a ""smasher"" with ceiling wrapped around my outer wall of my garden connected to 4 pistons and a max-level controller that just smashes the hell out of bots. The bots die instantly when smashed. Not sure about bosses but hay bots and the little spider bots just go splat instantly. 

Potato gun is great, but head shots don't count on hay bots (rip). Hay bots get a massive speed boost when 2 or more of them are near each other so be careful. 

The bed-spawn-mechanic is in this game. If you have a large mining vehicle, have a bed on it. Save you traveling and potentially getting killed several times. 

When you do die with a full or nearly-full inventory, make sure to scroll. The inv screen only shows 3 rows and doesn't expand to show what was on your hotbar. 

Be careful with collectors. They pick up logs, and are extremely fun and save time if you hold right click to pick them up then use right-click to throw them at logs. But if you aim at the wrong angle toward the ground they'll merge into the terrain and be gone forever with all of the collected materials. 

You'll have a ton of fun with pistons, bearings, making interesting joints and mechanisms to control and empower your vehicles and mining rigs. Quick tip, stack a few blocks on the ground near a tree / node. Use pistons to extend your saws/drills and you can even get smart, put your driller/saw rig on a single bearing on that little stack of blocks, then mount a wheel to the side of your rig, let it touch the ground, now you can turn with ease, without wasting a controller or time making some complex design. 

Pistons are OP as hell... I'm sure they'll get nerfed but abuse them while you can for easy mining. 

The fridge is pointless AFAIK. Water is kind of silly in this game so far. Looking forward to seeing more dedicated-use items like pipes. 

There is no tier-2 method for collecting oil. Meaning you have to go get each and every oil node by-hand, 1 at a time. (rip relationship). You do collect -some- gas while exploring/looting but not enough to support a large mining rig with several drills for more than 1-2 runs unless you find a very strong stability design that allows you to plant your rig on the side of a hill to hit those funky-dune/hill nodes. 

Boss bots are easily confused/distracted/destroyed if you just place a wall (any material) between you and them. You can play tag from the other side and shoot them in the head. Then just pick up your remaining blocks and carry on. 

The game relies HEAVILY on components. Keep all you find. 

There is currently no way to drop the ... what is it, wiring tool? You can put your extra(s) into a storage box and make that box useless. The only alternative I can think of is, in the crashed space ship there's a locker with only a few slots. Use that to dump nonsense you don't want to look at anymore taking up your slots if you don't want to craft a storage box just to throw away. 

There's no other way to completely drop or get rid of duplicate tools. PLEASE FIX THIS. 

The game is still very fun. It has a TON of potential. Nearly endless with the massive mod community and YT going nuts. Tons of love for this game. Keep a close eye on it. 

Yes there are bugs. Yes there are QoL things missing we wish it had. Yes it has things we wish it didn't.... but hopefully the devs are watching and can work on some of these things. 

But seriously though, those hay bots, please nerf their buff. <3"
21813,its fun and can play with friends
21814,"I love this game so far. I enjoy the design of the world and like the building part. It is easy to learn the basics but to be a really good builder i think takes a while to learn. there is a bit of grind, but i just enjoy it. 
However it would be nice to have a map in the survival mode because i've got lost sometimes and to find back to base can be difficult. But buy this game. It is great and at a good price!"
21815,be creative in your builds
21816,"Cool game, survival reaaallllyyy good. bad thing about survival that u cant spawn the cars on the lift from workshop nad etc."
21817,all you do is make cars. this makes me angry and upset. no words can describe how furious i am. i hate cars. they are stupid and that is all you do. you make them. why would i want to make something i hate so much. all cars can die and never come back. i hate this game it makes me SO MAD!
21818,"With the launch of 'Survival Mode' I finally bought this game. So far I'm very glad I did. As with all early access games there is a lot of room for improvement but the foundations and mechanics scrap mechanic brings to the table are solid. 
The art style is great and family friendly and reminiscent of platformers of old. 
Grinding early doors is just right as you need to put in the effort to make it easier in the future.
The crafting and building, especially the vehicles, is superb and only limited to your imagination.
For the low price tag and bang for your buck you get this is a great game library edition for all."
21819,really
21820,"Please give us a dedicated server option! T_T

I love it!

The multiplayer needs a dedicated server option though.. as the game seems to become unstable at a certain distance beyond the wolds origin (0.0.0) for any connected clients and gets progressively worse from that point."
21821,fucking amazing
21822,"I want you, the developers, to add drawings of objects, because it is immediately easy to understand what it is, what it is made of... In general, the game is very good! But there are not enough drawings, and the mechanism that scans these drawings, such as in the game Raft."
21823,gooooooood
21824,"Its actually pretty good for an erley access game but there are a few problems:
1: If you are in ragdoll and a bot is attacing you, you stay in ragdoll and can not defend yourself.
2:If you plant stuff the raids get bigger and bigger till they are so big that your game is lagging. 
3: The story is kind of undeveloped, they should make a small story in survival mode to make it a bit more interesting to play.
That was it, cool game and have fun 
"
21825,"The game is fun to play, lot of things to do, build mechanic, always something to do, but wen you build more things lag is appearing and dramatic FPS drop, worse in Multiplayer (especially in Survival), sometimes the game crashes because of lag and FPS drop, bugs , anyway the game have a lot of potential!"
21826,"Cant seem to make anything more complex than tutorial vehicles without crashing every 30 sec to 2 min.
Seriously, if I try to make a vehicle that does not flip every 2 sec the game crashes if I even look at the unfinished work.  Do better please, I ain't made of money."
21827,Love It
21828,"*DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR SURVIVAL IN ITS CURRENT STATE*

This game has potential but survival mode is such an un-fun grind and without survival it's just a sandbox game (which is still awesome fun by itself if you're creative). In survival you spawn in by a farm and all the instruction you get is how to plant vegetables, but if you plant all of them bots will come and raid your farm so you end up starving or at least struggling to find food. Unless you somehow just know that it's illegal to make a crop bigger then 9 or decide to wait around when the scary red numbers pop up.

Also what is the point of scrap wheels?? I spend ten painful minutes harvesting two trees to build my scrap car only to find out that the wheels aren't round so the vehicle moves slower than walking speed, such a let down.

Then there's the next stage of grinding out metal, what a chore. The only way to get it as far as I can tell is to kill the Haybots, The combat against these bigger robots is so basic but its still easy to die if you end up fighting three at once. After you kill them you have to refine their parts for low quality metal that also has to be refined to be useful for anything.

Probably makes more sense to play with a group or just stick to creative mode but i really hope they plan on completely changing the survival mode otherwise i'm going to have to say I won't recommend this game to anyone."
21829,Really enjoying it! Looking forward to where survival goes!
21830,E
21831,Its been a fun play so far. Would be better with friends tho.
21832,this game is biggest fun some lag can ocuur with weaker PCs such as my i5-4670k and asus 720 6gb
21833,"I do say this is a really good game. creative and survival both. especially since survival is so new.
and i have some things to say about future updates and improvements to the game.

#1: gas takes to long to collect, with just one gas engine its ok but thrusters are impossible to maintain its so easy SO easy to make a good fast non-gas using car, i sat down for a hour and found 4 ways to make a gas-less car that works well (pistons suspensions and bearing are so buggy).

#2: i'm playing a survival world with my brother and we have so much lag because lots of entities don't despawn, tote bot heads don't spawn as items so i have tons of those around my world same for cut done trees. if things like those despawned after like a day or so it would help a lot!

#3:  why do tape bots and farm bots drop nothing useful? i would much prefer component kits from hay bots rather then batteries from tape bots or a million keys from farm bots.

#4 i know this is not a easy fix and you've heard this before but please make multiplayer  not so lagy for the other person, its soo much more fun with two people so at least make it playable.

#5 i understand why you can only put dirt on the ground but if you could balance it out (like have plants need light) if some how you could put dirt and have a farm on vehicles, that would be really fun to have a house car with everything.

i really love this game and i'm not trying to say that this is a bad game because its not perfect i strongly recomend this game to other people especially to people who like to build architecture or like engineering! keep doing what your doing!"

21838,"Review
Scrap Mechanic Survival
This game was produced by Swedish software developer Axolot Games. It was released on the 7th of May (American Time) 2020 as an update to their increasingly popular game Scrap Mechanic. If you‚Äôre a regular player of Scrap Mechanic, Survival introduces a massive world expansion (the world is now 16 times the size of the original map). At first progression is quite fast, unlike many survival games. There is no apparent end goal, but there is a clear path that the game is trying to lead you down. Once you‚Äôve got a big base going and all the stuff you need, the choices of what to do are pretty much yours.
 For those who haven‚Äôt heard of the game, Scrap Mechanic is a game in which you can build working vehicles and other mechanical creations in a very open-ended and unrestricted manner. These creations are then able to be operated by a character you control. In Survival the vehicles can now have more of a purpose, for example mining, logging or transport. I find the controls in this game pretty intuitive and straight forward. The game includes an item called The Mechanic‚Äôs Handbook that will allow you to learn pretty much everything about the game in about five minutes. I‚Äôve enjoyed playing Survival a lot. You have to solve all your problems with weirdly engineered contraptions which appeals to my sense of creativity and the kind of challenges I enjoy. But there are a lot of bugs and glitches. Not the ones that you can exploit and farm (like you can in Minecraft) but the ones that kill you and make your movements slow. But Survival has only just been released, so the developers have plenty of time to start ironing out these bugs and glitches. I highly recommend this game, particularly if you like sandbox style games with the element of survival added in.

21877,"Nothing like going somewhere and getting SHOT by robots with SPUDGUNS, and then spawning back at home, 10 miles away, with barely any food or water in your bars. Man, I thought I could go get my shit back, but it's good to know that the devs don't give a shit I can go fuck myself.

EDIT: Tried to build a clothes bot and was basically told to fuck myself. Game crashed. Materials are gone. But guess what? No clothesbot. This game is like getting stabbed by a nice old man."
21878,"Great game! getting the crucial weapon is a little tedious, but it's worth it.

also how do i donate all of my money to the devs they deserve it more"
21879,Fun game
21880,awesome game
21881,Really good gaame.
21882,Fun game. Specifically with mates
21883,"this game awesome because there is adventure action and being able of everything and i am so happy that i got this game
"
21884,Survival Mode been waiting for soo long. and totaly worth it! im stuck! if you love building and survival try it out the limit what you can do and build is your imagination!
21885,Fun Sandbox Game
21886,it's fun
21887,I love the game but the recent patch rendered all vehicles built completely broken by not letting the driver's seat trigger the engine.
21888,great game!
21889,Fun
21890,"yes
"
21891,"Definitely yes, it needs more updates, but the adding of the survival I hope it will get better and better, just devs, try to do more things to automate, like getting oil from the sea or at least that there are more yield of the oil when harvesting."
21892,"good
"
21893,YAAAAAAAAAY
21894,This game is very relaxing when you want to rest and you don't know what to play this is the game.
21895,this game is so creative and I love it
21896,good and funny
21897,"It still has lots of defects: it's really laggy, collisions are bugged and some resources like oil, flowers and shells are a pain to get. Otherwise the game is awesome, i hope the devs are gonna fix the problems and make the game even better"
21898,"The game itself is well designed, it's alot of fun especially with friends but it's not optimized at all and has no dedicated server which makes game hard to play when u build more stuff. At this state is full of bugs and i would not recommend it until it gets proper content and fixes. It has great potential and i hope devs are listening."
21899,fun game for engineering miind
21900,Its a fun game if you like to code and build cool things this game is perfect for you
21901,Great little sand box game.  You can make it as complex as you are comfortable to do.
21902,"Still a little new and rough, but thats to be expected of a game still in beta. The possibilities of things you can do in this game are almost endless. You can build any kind of vechicle or machine and i mean that literally. On top of the amazing building the story and art style is fun as well and the survival mechanics are interesting as you figure out what you can do with the unlimited possibilities you have in front of you."
21903,Good Amazing Game Love it
21904," great little game survival mode with a few mates is great .....BUT NEEDS A DEDICATED SERVER ....the game lags quite alot but still fun

¬£20 game for ¬£15 not bad 
"
21905,Fantastic survival game and ALOT of fun with friends...your only limits is your creative imagination.
21906,epic
21907,"Survival mode is finally here and it was well worth the wait. They thought of nearly everything and the ""mechanics"" of the game are done incredibly well"
21908,amazing game
21909,\deged
21910,"I LOVE THIS GAME! It is the perfect game for me, open world and you get to do whatever you want! Iv'e owned this game for a long time now (I had a previous account that owned that game) and I was so excited for survival!
However, it was kinda disappointing, many many bugs prevented me from playing. Luckily the Devs have fixed these issues :)

I would strongly recommend this game to any one who wants an open world where they can do whatever they want.

9/10"
21911,although it takes quite a while to really get started in the game. Its a fun game that incorporates a lot of creative thinking from the player.
21912,"It's fun for sure, but at the moment quite buggy and not enough content. Good for a couple days of messing around (better with friends). Feels a bit like Minecraft, except much less procedural and waaaaaaay less stuff to do/ways to do it. The engineering part however is top notch, very fun designing vehicles and contraptions. Would like to see this implemented better with more options and goals. Will probably return to this in a year or so, but given how it was ""released"" in 2016, I get the feeling it won't be much different."
21913,"This is a very fun game! Love the ""comic"" book art style, the enormous number of ways you can build things, but most of all, it's easy to learn. Not a million buttons to learn, and mostly self-explanatory. Great game. It earned a place in my top 10."
21914,This Game Is Great Fun and Creative you can share you're creations even build challenges for players to beat and then there is SURVIVAL Survival is great in all but i problem is the bots and the hit boxes those are bad the bots are you're enemies and do not mess with the big red guys with a hammer it does nothing to them so use a Spudgun instead of a hammer you even have the lift witch you can use in creative and survival its what you use to save creations in creative in survival the same as creative but you can not save creations and there is even more out there like Spud Shotguns and even Spud Gatling guns EVEN FUNNY HIT BOXES (there bad in a funny way) So yeah this game is amazing and fun!
21915,its really good the lay out is the best
21916,"If you enjoy games like Minecraft, Terraria, Raft, Don't Starve, etc. then this is the game for you! If you find those games boring and monotonous, this is not the game for you. 

The survival mode is still early on, but it's really solid. Gathering materials takes a little bit too long, but I find it worth the grind. I've played 57 hours in a week and I don't feel like I've done more than get a decent start on my world in solo. It is definitely easier to grind materials with a friend or two, but the game is saved locally to whoever the host is. So, the others can only play that world again if the host is playing. Dedicated servers are on the list of things the devs are apparently adding. You can also edit the game files (JSON format) to change the drop rate of materials in game. 

Overall, I love this game. It feels like the first time I played Minecraft again. Super solid and I hope they continue adding stuff. Please give us dedicated servers!"
21917,Yeah its pretty fun but its hard to understand
21918,"been enjoying the freedom this game gives, the building mechanics are amazing, creating and building with it is extremely satisfying. Survival is fun but imo not challening enough yet. That being said I have logged 80 hours in it this week :D cant wait for more."
21919,"good game
"
21920,"This game requires braincells, something i dont have :("
21921,"nice farm, potato good for shoot and eat"
21922,"Really fun and creative game!

EDIT: Due to the lack of updates I can't recommend this game anymore. For a game in EA the updates are a most and should be consistent. There are fundamental things missing in the Survival mode like MOD/Workshop support or the Beacon feature that was promissed and shown in the twitter when the Survival released and many others. It seems like the game is abandoned by the devs or they just come back when they have free time from other projects like RAFT.


EDIT: 07/12/2021 Still no update after the survival update. What a joke."
21923,good fun
21924,"love this new update, was a tad boring before but  is now very very good"
21925,"Still needs some work but totally unique and different from the typical game being released these days! Needs a tad bit of story line too but otherwise, pretty near perfect!"
21926,Great game!
21927,luv <3
21928,very fun. recomended that you not live in a warehouse.
21929,fun
21930,"Seriously fun and challenging building game with creative and survival game modes. Creative mode has a huge range of materials and mechanical parts that you can use to create your perfect base or vehicle.
Survival mode offers the standard experience with collecting, surviving and basebuilding, but also offers some trading and a pvp dungeon (warehouse)."
21931,"Game has a lot of promise. Needs lots of work done to the balance of survival. The power spikes and material acquiring is disproportional. Otherwise, a highly promising game once the bugs, optimisation and progression system is balanced out."
21932,scratches that creative mechanical itch without requiring a phd to do so.
21933,"this game really tests my creativity and is definitely 
enjoyable

"
21934,wooow
21935,"Very good game, infinitely replayable but it's currently VERY unstable, everything from framedrops to random crashes, multiplayer doesn't work very well (a lot of input delay) and there is a lack of options for customizing world settings etc...
Overall 9/10 if the game was stable.
Still worth it even though it isn't stable."
21936,ITS THE BEST
21937,This game is just amazing !
21938,goooooodddd
21939,this game is huge with plenty to do
21940,survival +rep
21941,It¬¥s fun and developers added survival and the survival is so much fun. In creative you can build what ever you want you can build staff from workshop. I like the game
21942,god
21943,an amazing game with a lot of thought put into it. You can learn a lot from this game as well as have fun building your own machines and base. If you want a great game that kills a lot of time during this lockdown then this is the game for you.
21944,think outside the box and be creative.
21945,Very epic gamer game.
21946,Amazing game for anybody decently interested in mechanics
21947,IT's really good game but survival multiplayer is EXTREMELY laggy for everyone except the host!
21948,"I would recommend this game to people as it can be fun and bring out your creative side. It certainly has alot of potential but be aware of the following when playing survival mode...(Please devs fix these things)

1) Resource grind - I imagine a game like scrap mechanic to be more about the mechanic aspect and not the constant grind for resources. For example to get petrol for your engine you need 5 units of oil, this involves finding 5 different oil resources to make 5 units of petrol, this petrol will last maybe 2 minutes in an engine. So 5 minutes of resource collecting gets you just two minutes of engine drive...thats very boring.

2) Hunger and thirst - This is understandable in a survival game but not to the extreme of this game. You are constantly having to watch you hunger/thirst bar as it quickly drops. If you run out on either bar and your driving along then say goodbye to your car because you will just fall off the vehicle and it will drive off into the sunset.

3) Resource gind....yep this was number one but its sooooo bad. So you need some metal 2 to make a common component (Its a fairly common requirement), metal 2 needs 10 units of metal one (Which requires mining (Which requires some metal 2) or 15 scrap metal) plus some rare component that you need from far across the map....that's ok jump in your car but don't forget the petrol (See point 1 again as to why this is bad).

4) Inventory....please make everything stackable!!! Wheels for example aren't stackable, they take up a single slot each. Not only does this fill up your inventory but it means when you are building a car it either takes up multiple slots on you hot bar or you have to go in and out of your inventory constantly...this is boring and frustrating. Beams, wheels, suspension and many other components don't stack. Devs please make them stack to at least 5 units, I want to build things not wear our my 'I' key on my keyboard"
21949,it gooding
21950,"A fun relaxing game in a colorfull, cartoony game world.  Great for using your imagination to build different machines for various purposes to help you survive. Not too hard. Totally recommend it."
21951,"The progression in Survival feels really good.
A lot of stuff in the endgame is still missing thought.
Building stuff is intuitive and incredibly fun.

What sucks is that fuel is super tedious to farm and bigger vehicle need A LOT of fuel.
You spend more time handpicking oil bubbles at the bottom of the lake than actually dirving your vehicle.

Despite that one issue i have a lot of fun playing scrap mechanic and do recommend it"
21952,"Still very much in Beta, if you like Space Engineers and Minecraft I think you will like this/"
21953,big good much to do build cool car be careful build to much game break
21954,"It's a well made game ,but in survival you don't know what to do. You don't have a goal like in minecraft or rust. after I left the crashed ship I walked to a pond and found a bucket, I used that on the ship. then i went up the tower took the battery and brought it back in the ship and from there it wasn't clear what to do.

The Creative is fun but It gets boring after a couple of hours.

If you realy like the genre you should buy it, but otherwise you should't"
21955,good game
21956,"Very cool game. It's at the perfect balance between customisation and ease of use.
It crashes all the time on my machine though, which is at the recommended specs except the video card is a bit worse. Maybe windows 7 isn't supported by this game anymore, because i played with a friend who was using windows 10.
EDIT: crashes seem to have stopped. thanks!"
21957,"nice game
"
21958,"A fun and creative game, reminiscent of a simpler, more user friendly version of Garrys mod"
21959,I really like to build but i think there are some optimizations to be made
21960,"I've only played for about 20 hours, but It's not bad- especially the mechanical aspect of it. Survival is a close second though."
21961,"it cool.
"
21962,gud
21963,"The game is Freak'n Fun! Its space engineers but not Over the top confusing. farm, fight bots, Raid factories ,and profit. My one complaint is difficulty, and clothing needs more clothing (a Guardsmen outfit from warhammer 40k, JK)but i want to make the game harder with more bots/harder on food... Another thing to game does take a bit to load"
21964,A amazing game to spend your creative mind on
21965,"I love this game in every way shape and form. The server and loading is problematic and sometimes makes the game unplayable, but this game is definitely worth getting!!!!"
21966,good game
21967,idk
21968,"Short Version:
Buy it.
Early Access Rating: 4/5 (marked down for derp AI and big lag problems in both single and multi play)
Overall Potential: 6/5 You've made an absolutely fantastic game. 
- Optimize it in single and multi player modes. Gamer's hate lag, and I know it isn't my computer that's the issue. With 3 players, the game's lag eventually become unbearable. That's with a 1gig connection with high end rig hardware.
- More content. There's quite a lot to do and it takes time to get it done. Though, I'm quite greedy about content and would like to see 5x more than what's currently available.
 
Long Version:
Fantastic game, will keep you busy for hours with farming, building, exploring, and smashing robots. Or sometimes getting whipped/zapped, stabbed, taped, or sliced BY robots.  My only complaint is the lag. It doesn't seem to be using up much CPU or RAM yet the game bogs down really bad when you have a few lots'o-functions-made-vehicles near each other. Or when you're moving really quick. Can't even use the full potential of my gas engine without going through a lag wormhole and appear somewhere completely random, usually in a body of water or stuck halfway into a tree or building. Additionally the enemy AI is unfortunately pretty derp, especially for robots. Don't bother giving the bots a booby-trapped path to your farm. They'd much rather consistently run into a wall hoping that one day soon, they'll glitch through the wall, gank you, and your plants."
21969,pretty good
21970,best
21971,Great fun!
21972,gud
21973,survival mode is the best
21974,"got so into this game i forgot i existed in reality, thereby achieving nirvana and am posting this from the astral plane

‚àÖ/‚àÖ numbers are meaningless here"
21975,"Engineering creations to solve your problems is so much fun. Bought it on sale after watching some of the survival game play and it was well worth the asking price. I am addicted, I am all day thinking of minor tweeks i can make to my creations, I am laying awake all night thinking of tweeks for my farming setup, HELP I have not slept in days! ;)"
21976,"Survival needs a bit of work, but overall a good experience. Creative is nice too however it needs more survival things added to make it truly useful."
21977,"I bought this after Survival came out. It's a bit of a learning curve at first but once you get the hang of it, it's a ton of fun."
21978,Great Game!
21979,Make sure you have a good graphics card and computer before playing.
21980,"Game has some potential, but right now the very limited amount of things you can do mixed with the constant crashes (and subsequent losing of all your build due to no autosave) does not warrant the money you have to spend on it. At best this is a $5 game in its current state. It's great for building stuff in creative mode, but even that gets old fast. I really hope they make this a worthwhile game in the future, for now I won't hold my breath."
21981,This game is super fun. Glad this game is here to make my life right now fun.

21983,This game is a challenging and fun survival game. Really excited to see what the future holds for this title!

21985,"I've played 300 hours of creative then survival came out 50 hours in 6 days that is a lot for me
I heavily recommend it."
21986,"you will never run out of things to do in the new survival, love it! so much adventure and fun to be had. feels like what a survival game should be, always on ur toes while still having fun."
21987,"i built a car and it's pretty fresh.  it tipped, so i made adjustments.  it broke, so i made another.  i upgraded parts and now the car is better.  always better..."
21988,"SUPER fun, i wish it was on console so i could play with more friends, but it is what it is. Great game, super excited to try survival mode."
21989,"Scrap Mechanic is overall a pretty cool game, but there are a few issues. The game has very good graphics, runs well, and offers a lot of fun for multiplayer. The new survival update is really cool and fun but i have a few issues i need to point out. First, its a little too hard. Gathering materials is a serious grind and trees and rocks don't respawn. Some of the enemies also do too much damage, like the tapebot. There is no way to get armor or any damage reduction to stop just a few enemies from melting your health bar. Secondly, there is no guide on what to do. You load in and... nothing. You just have to walk around and figure something out. This didn't stop my friends and I from doing things but it makes it a challenge. Third, there are a LOT of bugs. Engines are broken (they start running on their own without input while connected), some bearings freak out while driving and lose traction, but despite all this i do love this game. Its very fun but need balancing and updates to squash bugs and improve its experience."
21990,had so much fun with multiplayer survival
21991,GOODY
21992,E
21993,fun little game
21994,once we get some dedicated server options this game will be perfect
21995,I love survival mode. It offers creative freedom to make whatever creation you wish while giving you specific problems to solve and enemies to vanquish with the creations you make. Nice building mechanic and logic engine allows you to build some pretty cool stuff.  You can very quickly get up and running with your first rudimentary car and go from there.
21996,It is a really nice game survival is easy and creative just create whatever you want its a good game.
21997,its amazing
21998,"It was a fun game when it came out like 10 years ago when it first hit early access , do yourself a favor and before you dump cash on it just watch youtube streams , they are way more fun than actually playing the game . Just FYI it is still in early access ."
21999,"Love the game!! The games great, Good graphics, and a AWESOME survival. The survival gives you the opportunity to test your skills against enemies (robots)"
22000,this game is awesome been playing it for a long time .... i was so excited for survival mode but ive been having problems i cant use the sledgehammer or any guns .... its an upsetting glitch please fix or help i dont want to stop playing because of a dumb glitch

22009,"The survival is probably the most fun i've had in any game, very addictive and great to play with friends."
22010,this game is awsome
22011,its  a fun game where you can create anything in your imagination.
22012,it's a super fun game but still tricky
22013,fun game
22014,"It's nice. The building, The Scrapping, The Mechanicing. Very Nice!"
22015,"I like creative building games and I have played this periodically since I first saw it on Steam. Now that survival mode was added and I have a reason to build stuff  other than ""I wonder if this will even work"", I've been binge playing it for about two weeks. I don't know why, but I find creating without restrictions (a pure sandbox game) to be somewhat boring. The restrictions placed on me due to resource availability (or more often lack thereof) and having to withstand a bot attack force me to get creative in how I build. I love it! Its a puzzle to be solved, a goal to achieve!"
22016,Think Minecraft for adults. Currently building sports car with advanced suspension that can float and will soon have convertible wings and a booster.

22023,"So, I have been playing this game since 2018 with over 360 hours in total. I can‚Äôt describe how good this game is with words and I have been waiting for Survival Mode to come out in a while, and what can I say? I‚Äôm definitely NOT disappointed at least! You guys have done an amazing job and specially for making such a huge experience in the first sight of Survival Scrap Mechanic.
   I was a bit sceptic to how the Survival version of Scrap Mechanic would work but now when it‚Äôs out, I‚Äôm amazed by the creative way Axolot has made you able to collect resources, craft, explore and don‚Äôt forget the fantastic custom options for your character with the exciting loot boxes, Garment Boxes, to collect.
   So a huge thank you for developing this game and a ginormous thumb up from my side, that‚Äôs for sure! Please tell me in the comments below what you personally think reading this review. Do you agree or disagree?"
22024,good
22025,.
22026,"It's been years since i was this hooked to a game, highly recommend!"
22027,good
22028,"Somewhat complicated in the beginning, but when I grew used to it, everything became clear, 'and' fun!

Building wacky inventions,
Surviving night-time farm raids,
And cooperating with others?

Gosh, I wish people made more games like this.

That being said, the game is really fun!


PERKS:
* Build what you want!
* Do what you want!
* It's an open world! Lots of exploration to be done!
* Plenty of (hopefully soon to be renewable) materials to harvest!

(SMALL, VERY INSIGNIFICANT) DOWNSIDES:
* Large Raids (when you're not equipped, that is. But if you 'are', then they're lots of fun)!
* General things which take gasoline/batteries/etc suck up a lot of said fuel if not fully upgraded! (Better find those component kits!)
* If you're playing online with someone, sometimes the frames can get REALLY choppy. It recovers for awhile, but it's not annoying. (It's just something that happens.)
* Not being cautious!    e.g.: Encountering a Boss Bot unprepared! (Only if you don't know what you're doing!)


Game is an overall 8.7/10! Played it for hours on end, day by day. Never got sick of it once!"
22029,pog
22030,i definaty recomend this game to people who like to build whatever they want
22031,nice game
22032,very nice very clean hah
22033,"Survival is great - when it works. 

There are multiple bugs going around that are bricking players' save files.

Having a craftbot connected to a chest to auto-craft items while you go out and explore has a chance to corrupt your save if you leave the chunk.

Building a car with one too many bearings and/or suspension pieces will crash your game every time you load in - meaning you can't even move to destroy the car to fix your save. Which is weird because shouldn't the physics be the same as in creative mode? - I see people making 10-ton transforming vehicles with glitch-build techniques and nothing happens. But doing anything in survival is a coin toss.

I've had 2 save files and countless hours of survival grinding wiped because of these bugs and others that can't be confirmed. If it weren't for these bugs, this game would be amazing. If the devs address these issues I will update my review. But for now I can't recommend getting the game if you want to enjoy survival."
22034,amazing game one downside is that my friend has so many mods u need a beefy PC cause i crashed and i cant play anymore
22035,Minecraft but engineering.
22036,i got it 3 days ago and i have clocked 17 hours
22037,"i like the idea behind the game sadly my computer is a potato so it has problems running it
"
22038,I bought this game when the survival came out...then played it for 16 hours straight with my friends. Really good game.
22039,"Super fun and enjoyable game, besides the occasional lag"
22040,Well worth $20 bucks. Great game all around. Has some connection issues/rubber banding in coop but still a lot of fun and does not get in the way that much.
22041,"Let's just say I got started playing Saturday morning and 2 days later I have almost 30 hours of gameplay.  It has been a long time since I have felt this compelled to keep playing a game.  

Great alone, better with friends."
22042,goooooood game and happy thy added a servival mode
22043,"its one of the best ive ever played
"
22044,"very cool
"
22045,I absolutely love this game. 77 hours into survival so far.
22046,"i really wanted to play this game however, it would crash before even loading and i installed it several times with no luck."
22047,"amazing game , unleash your creativity. great design as well"
22048,Its a much better product these days.
22049,very funa and relaxing building game
22050,"Very funny game! Let your creativity run wild! Otherwise, feel free to check out my workshop, there you can see what I've already done :P (no ad)"
22051,"The building system is amazing, with a few flaws but hey nothing is perfect, and the survival is super fun with friends"
22052,"Nice, fun and engrossing"
22053,"Fun game, survival is surprisingly well polished so soon after release, and the creative is very good for doing things you want to, with the tile editor for tracks and whatnot."
22054,"Super adictivo, con buen gameplay y mucho futuro!"
22055,
22056,cuz why not
22057,Super addicting and perfect sandbox style creative builder. So much to do!
22058,the workshop is broken
22059,it is amazing you have to try it its easy to learn
22060,good game
22061,good
22062,yes
22063,lots of freedom to do what you want.
22064,amazing game!
22065,great game!!
22066,actually epic
22067,This game is awesome. It's still in beta but gameplay is so much fun. I really recommend this game to anyone!
22068,"A hesitant yes - buy if you're willing to take a chance on a game that offers a good amount of game play for the first bit, but who's early access state (after 4 or so years) gives some doubt. Patches have been quick, but relatively small in scale, focusing on major bugs.

Scrap Mechanic is a fun game. It has a unique aesthetic, a solid game play loop for the first 30-40 hours, and plenty of room for creativity. I'll address the current state and multiplayer below, as I figure that's what matters to most people.

The main draw for Scrap Mechanic is it's nearly infinite mechanical creation system. The game launched some time ago without survival, and much of development up until recently has been focused on that system. Complex, fully automated vehicles, processing stations, planes, gliders, etc, are all possible. Modding was added, and creations can be uploaded to the workshop to be shared, and can be loaded in in creative mode only. 

Survival was added recently, and offers their take on the standard survival game. You must grow food, harvest lumber, stone, and metals, process, refine, and otherwise develop your world to better help you survive. 

Current state:
Scrap Mechanic continues to be in early access. This is a game that has remained that way for 4 years. With survival launching, it is bug ridden, with extremely variable performance, ranging from 100+ fps on highest settings, to <10 fps regardless of settings. The devs have, so far, been frequent in their patches. Some bug fixes were clearly simple. Some problems, such as the insane fuel consumption on thrusters, or the wild cost for components on the same, are matters of balance. Some, like the lack of any feasible way to do boats and other aquatic systems, are clearly problems with game systems that at this point may require larger changes. Bottom line, it's early access, on what is effectively a 2.0 version of an existing early access game.

Multiplayer:
In what is, IMO, the biggest blow against this game, there is no dedicated hosting. Scrap Mechanic offers multiplayer via join through Steam. While the host will not experience (Generally) the same level of lag and delay, my friends tell me frequently that as our world progresses, the game becomes laggier, more delayed, and more difficult to play. While patches have improved some of this, without dedicated hosting I expect that even monster gaming PCs will eventually struggle due to the state of the game. Inventory is saved, character progress is saved, creations are saved. 

Individual game sections:

Farming:
Plant sufficiently large crops, and you will be attacked at night by the farmbots. Farmbot raids range from trivial, to overwhelming, depending on size of farm and number of consecutive nights spent growing. Farming is not only for food, but also to be converted to resource crates to trade for new crops, fertilizer, and eventually, weapons. Should you wish to raid warehouses, a source of high level and rare loot, you'll need those potato guns. This will likely drive automation, which leads to the building loop of design, farm for materials, upgrade, create, troubleshoot, recreate.

Exploration and combat:
The game world is randomly generate with each save. In this world is random terrain, and scripted building styles and types. Combat is moderate to easy, with the challenge culminating in raids on warehouses, which require killing a boss mob to enter, and reward unique cosmetics and high level parts for your machines. Warehouses are challenging, and pretty fun over all. In their current state they are clearly unfinished, as much remained non-lootable, and only final rewards appear to be present. 

Building:
This is where Scrap Mechanic shines. In no particular order, we've built: a logging truck that keeps trees upright when cut, and shreds them for processing via the weight of the tree; a mining truck with a controllable and extendable drill arm; exploration vehicles with independent, floating, adjustable, suspension; various buggies and such; processing stations; automated farms that water/plant/harvest all crops of a customizable size. Each one of these requires that you design, and troubleshoot, from near to scratch. This means each bearing, piston, controller, logic gate, timer, wheel, etc, needs to be placed, and then connected and set up according to what you want to do. Extremely impressive machines are possible in the base game. This should be your draw. If you are curious, I recommend doing a search through the workshop and looking at vanilla creations. What exists is deeply impressive."
22069,lol
22070,When I have started the game recently the game just crashes
22071,good creative platform and very different from what ive played would like to see terrain mining abit like space engineers or minecraft overall very good
22072,"fun game but lags when you enter 9/10 would reccomend 
devs add a larger game mem file or fix crash on entrance screen plz"
22073,"Probably the most addicting and satisfying game you could play, especially with the new survivial mode.
"
22074,its fun
22075,"This game, whicle not as developed as Minecraft, is similar in nature, minus the land changing aspect.  However, what you get in return is a surprisingly addictive formula of exploring, gathering, destroying and creating.  The clear center point of the game is vehicles, though.  Not only to they help with exploration, but allow you to carry and transport things, Run over enemies and just go joy riding (jumps are great!).  Oh, and with the logic system in this game, you can change your house into a vehicle by transforming it, you could make a true transformer or make an all in one vehicle that saws, cuts, then processes a tree into wood blocks just by pressing a button/switch (or two or three). 

This game has a surprisingly deep mechanical system. 

Note: I started playing this game when Survival Mode was released.  As I understand it, it has been around for quite some time with just creative mode, but I do not have that experience.  I would suggest you take older reviews with that understanding though, as I found survival mode to be the very soul of the game.  

Sure, Creative mode would be good for practicing builds and coming to understand mechanics and making crazy machines, but survival puts an actual game around those mechanics.  And this game is amazing."
22076,"The game has stopped working!
""Steam must be running to play this game (SteamAPI_Init() failed)"""
22077,my controller is broken when I connect it to a bearing and a switch it wont let me switch the switch Its a very good game can some help me?
22078,"Buenardisimo

22090,I cannot figure out how to get on my friends world though;-;
22091,yes
22092,"very good game, buy it"
22093,"I love this game and with well over 350 hours logged it pains me to write a bad review. But I feel I have too. This this game is great value for money and it can be supper fun BUT the bad review comes because it does not get the love it should from the developers and I truly cant figure out why. 

If on the off chance you get a dev blog its normally filled with things that never seem to make it in to the game. updates are very few and very far between, almost laughably rare! The game has a great fan base and has the potential to be one of the all time greats but Axalotl games treats it with an almost mild neglect at best.

Buy this game and have a blast, it is so much fun, but buy it knowing that it will probably never get finished and all ""future content"" must be taken with a large helping of Scepticism."
22094,"aw man this game is like ya know the best game Eva you can build you can craft and you can even pick a PILE LOAD OF POOP. and im MP you can ask your Friend for a ""Loan"" So you better Loan the Game and Have Fun With the Dots and Comma
Did i Mention that it has also Redstone like Minecra.... shhh no one here for that"
22095,"Oms this games survival is amazing. Its so diffrent from the normal Scrap Mechanic we all know and love. But for me it still stands NO Friends NO Fun. But if your a person that likes doing thing solo go for it. I still love this game now more than ever.
I highly recommend this game its amazing."
22096,JUST BUY IT
22097,great game love survival
22098,"This seemed a really great game looking at the videos and reviews. 
In reality it is poorly documented and implemented, had to google how to drink water after dying 5 times in 20 minutes.

Steep learning curve, you just seem to have to farm stuff in order to farm some more stuff. (I get that this is the point of the game, but I couldn't find the fun in it)
Very poorly optimized, it really grinds medium rigs, and the graphics isn't that good.

Maybe I didn't have enough patience to get to the ""fun"" part, but I am sick of half finished games being in early access for more than 4 years and priced like A label releases.
Refunded.

22100,"Exploration, building, combat, survival. its all great."
22101,ITS FUN
22102,"sure, the game has some minor bugs, but it is super fun! Really looking for the new updates.. and maybe a dedicated server :-)

update: I have to change my review. The game would be fine, just... It lacks content, and there is no update a long time making the game boring after a short time. 

What a shame..."
22103,Now with survival this has the potential to rival minecraft
22104,"The thrill of discovery is great, it is still very clearly in Alpha but I really like it. I can see how great it will be when it has more of the future features added in, and how some people are frustrated with the lack of introduction and how complicated it is. SO much potential, I hope they go far with it! Easy to hop in to though, it really is."
22105,really good
22106,"the game is fantastic, it still has some bugs and problems that need to be fixed but, its mechanics and its unqueness makes Scrap mechanic an game that need to be appreciated"
22107,"Great gameplay and for the price, its amazing for what it is, cant wait to see what it brings in the future."
22108,Fun game with friends!
22109,Very nice and addictive game
22110,"One of the best games I've played since ""The Forest"". Still a lot of bugs, but it will get there as all new games do."
22111,very good game for da potato lovers
22112,Needs a tutorial. similar to the game raft. having fun learning how to play.
22113,best flippin game ever
22114,It is a very fun game but it makes a lot of time to finish what you started.
22115,"this game was good af, im interested in it. but the only issue we need to fix is the lag and stuttering on survival mode. please dear dev, fix it soon."
22116,"I really can't say enough good things about this game. Survival mode is excellent! 
Thanks to the Devs for their ongoing dedication to continually improve the game."
22117,Fun to play with friends
22118,Love the survival mode if i had one suggestion remove the glow from cut logs So we can use them in base building instead of having to refine them the glowing is annoying
22119,This game is so fun when you play with people
22120,THis is  a very good game survival mode is superfun
22121,"it is a fun game, and inspires a lot of creativity"
22122,sedtgeerfgfgsfgsegrh yes
22123,Needs more things to do
22124,is good. 4/5 DJ Kevis
22125,"Stupid game, don't ever explore high tec buildings or you will get 2 shot by some enimies and not be able to retrieve your loot"
22126,ITS AWESOME!!!!!
22127,One of the best games I've ever played.
22128,i shitted myself and scrap man made fun of me
22129,"The game is amazing and well thought out, AXOLOT did a extremely good job at mastering creative thinking with this unique game. the only downside is the need for a good computer for the game to run well. the Scrap Mechanic community is very large with some popular YouTubers  basing their entire channel around the game. it has a few bugs because of early development, but the thought of survival mode and bots, farming, new blocks and parts, new weapons and an entire new map 100 times bigger than what we where restricted to in creative. the addition of water opened up so many new possibilities of boats, submarines and more! it is sure to be one of the best a funnest games i have played in years. great job AXOLOT for creating this master peace of a game!"
22130,"If you enjoy open-world survival games, I definitely recommend picking this up!"
22131,I loved how much you can make and do in this game
22132,Yes..but in due time.. too early for release.
22133,nudhiybF
22134,da best
22135,Its gud
22136,"If you have a Minecraft/Mad Max itch, get it!"
22137,"Fun and interesting, survival is still a bit lacking but has a good production team. If you like minecraft redstone but wanna try messing around with physics objects and leavers then you'll probably have some fun."
22138,Very enjoyable survival/problem solving game.
22139,Yea it's good.
22140,"Survival was fun until I farmed for a couple hours to build a really nice car for my standards, which worked great until it started glitching, took off, flew into orbit and never returned."
22141,e
22142,AWESOME BEST GAME EVER BETTER THEN MINECRAFT
22143,"Kill, search and destroy"
22144,great
22145,it cool
22146,Its FUN
22147,The combonation of simplicity and fun really made this game a Lifetime experiance. SURVIAL WAS AMAZING TO PLAY.
22148,C r e a t i v i t y
22149,A gem of a game.
22150,"if you are patient you will like this game. It is a bit grindy, but if you play the likes of ark and other survival games then nothing to worry about. The build mechanic with the connection tool is genius. I play with the fam and it's a blast."
22151,"have only played survivor mode, looks good, plays good, for an early access title it is a good game
am patiently excited for their continued work
a 15 dollar bargain"
22152,bery nice
22153,"some bugs yes , i wish there was a map. Incredibly fun to play with friends as well"
22154,"still has some rough spots, but they dont keep the game from being fun!"
22155,"It's great fun but severely unfinished.

This game has been on early access for 5+ years and STILL doesn't have at least a release date in sight."
22156,"Great game! Had a lot of fun with the new survival mode. Mosty bug free and very polished. In contrast to other games (eg. Space engineers) you currently need to do a lot of grinding to progress.  For example, you can only get oil for gas by collecting it manually. Its ok at the beginning of the game but I wish there would be other more automatic ways to gather gas in the late game.  However as for wood,stone and metal there already are more advanced ways to collect resources by constructing own machines for this purpose. This is great and I have no doubt that the developers will add a lot of similar content in future updates."
22157,"Zaman ge√ßirmek, bir≈üeyler √ºretmek i√ßin g√ºzel bir oyun"
22158,best game ever
22159,"Such a waste of time and money. If you do have TONS of time to waste, go for it! That's all I can say... and yeah, I wasted my $20 for this, but it's a never ending learning curve of life!"
22160,i like the game i think players who like minecraft and creativerse would also like it or should atleast try it
22161,"Super fun, totally worth every cent!"
22162,Very fun 10/10
22163,"Great game. This game potentially has endless content only limited by your imagination, as you can literally build and engineer anything you can think of. My complaint is that for survival mode, a lot of the places in the world are copy pasted.  Once you play for an hour, you pretty much seen everything. Loot chest around the world are nothing special other than to gather component parts. That being said, gathering component parts is a big chore, as the only way you can obtain them are from the chest and enemy bots (and you need component parts for literally anything essential).  Other than that, you can easily get immersed into a project, whether it be making a simple car to a piston powered engine that runs on no energy."
22164,Typical survival game with some interesting/unique elements. The crafting system allows you to make some really interesting creations. Definitely worth the $20 price tag.
22165,"Great game, even in early access. Let those creative juices flow."
22166,"I recommend this game, but I'v been having a problem. It keeps freezing, and I have to force-quit it."
22167,good game
22168,i love this game its coming along great
22169,Awesome and with survival its even better!
22170,if you want a easy game not for you but if you like a game that test you for skills this is for you. Just try it why not
22171,survival is cool
22172,Adicting
22173,"The new mode gives a real reason to build things and improve. It's wicked fun to explore all the areas. 
The only issue I have is the inventory NEEDS a sort button."
22174,Amazing game love the survival mode please add a map.
22175,its fun.bit buggy but its pretty fun and just a good experience
22176,oh man you would not even BELIEVE how many scraps i mechanicked.
22177,"I only recommend this to intelligent people who understand the state of pre-alpha/EA and are ok with taking a risk. It's a really neat idea and fun base for game, but def needs a lot more attention and updating. Would like to see things added I'll mention below, but overall this is a really great concept. I'm left slightly confused as to if you are a dwarf, or hobbit lol but that doesn't really matter. Really hope the devs keep at this game. It gives you lots of freedom to be creative in building and I haven't even begun to scratch the surface. 

- More character customization weather that's done by crafting or just available through the game menu
- >>>>*****Being able to use a switch or button while sitting in seats.********<<<<<
- ****Adding a functioning block feature when wielding your hammer in combat
- Lock block feature you can toggle so you dont remove something by accident on a vehicle or base
- Changing weather with storms, maybe even like tornado storms in the desert, or avalanches in a snow biome. 
- More attention to AI enemies more specifically their aggro range and intelligence. Kinda annoying how far some can see you and they never stop chasing even when your in a vehicle faster than them.
- Overall better optimization and fixes to multiplayer (can get random drops downwards to 1fps at RARE moments) does not happen often. 

Overall I really like what I have seen, and hope to watch it grow into something great. Hope this doesn't become another dust collector."
22178,this game is great
22179,Wihoooo!!!
22180,survival is fantastic
22181,My friend bought it for me and since survival has come out we have been playing it a lot
22182,Great game in general. Promotes Creativity. If you can imagine it you can create it.
22183,This is good because you can build lots of things... this is like stormworks but with more land.
22184,fits grate
22185," You can do anything. performence is better than most physics sandbox games. its verry simple and verry intitive to learn. I love my heart out to survival and find it one of the best things to do to let my imagination run wild in creative. both modes are great, and dont even get me stared on challenge mode and the escape room community. GET GAME ITS GOODZ"
22186,Best game I've played since survival came out.
22187,big pp
22188,This game is awsome! Everyone Should Have This Game
22189,good game even batter now that there is survival.
22190,Game has really good singleplayer and multiplayer creative and survival
22191,"a very unique game, needs a bit of work in terms on Multiplayer"
22192,"The netcode is broken and it was unfortunately unplayable for me and my friend (in coop mode through the internet). We couldn't play an otherwise interesting looking game. Maybe future updates will improve things.
"
22193,"So let's break down this game now that survival has been released. 

[b]Disclaimer: [/b][i]This game is very much a work in progress game, so some of the features or issues listed in this review may have been changed, removed, fixed or altered in some way by the time you come to purchase this game[/i]

[h1]Positives[/h1]

[u]Creative Mode[/u]
- Well made creative mode
- Many different parts to make creations from
- Easy mod support
- Easy to design & create your own world
- Amazing integration of Logic & control systems

[u]Survival Mode[/u]
- Well thought out survival system
- Great non-intrusive tutorial section
- Easy to learn & advance
- Well balanced loot crate system
- Good random loot generation
- Well balanced enemies, huge bosses don't appear too often at the start
- Great world generation
- Well optimised. Doesn't lag too much unless your settings are too high for your computer


[h1]Could be better[/h1]

[u]Creative[/u]
- Doesn't include all survival parts, so prototyping for survival in this mode is not fully possible
- No easy ability to fly makes building slightly difficult but doesn't at all damage the experience

[u]Survival[/u]
- Very grindy. Takes a lot of resource gathering to build decently protected bases and higher tier vehicles
- No map or navigation tool makes it very easy to get lost in the world


[h1]Conclusion (TL;DR)[/h1]

A very well made game, few improvements can still be made but for a work in progress game it's one of the best i own.
"
22194,"very good, yes"
22195,"If you like sandbox games, this is for you. If you don't want to spend time collecting resources or building, this is not for you."
22196,"*1/24/2022*
Finally I have good performance.. After upgrading my CPU to a i9-12900k. That's all it takes to run this game consistently well folks, a 3090 and a 12900k. With a locked 240 fps, it still drops to 160 while near my base though.

*11/27/2020*
I feel it's worth noting even with my brand new EVGA 3090, and overclocking to 4.4Ghz I still get awful frame drops to below 45FPS consistently.

*NOTE*
Game crashes multiple times, I will have to load this game at least 2-3 times just to get into my game.
And when I do, textures take quite a while to load with a NVIDIA 1080GTX & i7 4.0Ghz


Survival is currently barely playable online with others. Rubber-banding and lag is excessive, so if you plan on playing with your friends you may want to wait to pick this up.. 

Game also has many gameplay bugs and QoL issues still. Has been in development for many years so if you're thinking ""Ah, it's early access they'll be fixed soon""- 'soon' may be a while.

The general concept and game itself is very fun despite these things but I would not recommend it unless you're okay dealing with something that feels unpolished at this point. If; and when, these issues are ironed out, I would recommend it whole-heartedly."
22197,amazing
22198,"Its just fun try it out. I played with a friend who was already pretty good, so I suggest you do that so you can get the hang of it."
22199,Its good buy it if you want to i didnt but its still good none the less
22200,Love this Game If you cant figure something out just go to the youtube channel Kan gaming and He has so many helpful videos on it
22201,very cool
22202,m i l k

22213,"Fun game, purchased with the survival update. Can't wait for more updates and some QOL improvements. Devs seem to be very quick with bug fixes too. Really fun trying to figure out how to make things work mechanically.
"
22214,Very fun game
22215,good
22216,I would recommend this game if u play it wiith some one else because it is boring when you play by yourself
22217,"Well, for now, the survival mode is just a huge mess. I have no idea what to do, there is no guidance and the help says literally nothing apart from the basic controls. At the moment, even Minecraft has more content than this. Or, perhaps there is something, but the game makes sure to keep it a secret?

Anyway, I am done with this for some time now, but I hope this game goes somewhere eventually, because I think it has some potential."
22218,very fun game it keeps me sane in lockdown
22219,over 500 hours and not done yet! This game is simply marvelous and I don't know if it'll ever get boring for me
22220,i mean mods are fun i guess
22221,"fun game
"
22222,Played for a week  i'm addicted to this game. VERY grindy as resource gather rates are super small
22223,Great game to pass your time
22224,wa
22225,ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUN
22226,This is the best survival and creative game i have ever played i would 100% recommend playing scrap mechanic
22227,It's really fun to play and I love that You can make anything you want
22228,hi
22229,The game overall is a great game. Only trouble is getting the hang of the more advanced interactions. However once you understand that better this is a great game. The survival mode is a lot more fun with a friend.
22230,"Tried out this game, spent four hours on it. Personally it was rather boring. Also be wary you can't receive your refund once you pass 2 hours. This is speaking only on the survival mode. There really isn't enough in the game in its current state. I'd say the survival mode is a bit more annoying then it is fun."
22231,yes
22232,"No real instruction beside a book that tell you how stuff work that you don`t have. And as far as i experienced, never will get. Because whenever you reach a point of interest those blue bots just two-shots you. And thanks to the point that they move kinda soundless the only warning is your health drop to 55%. Next thing is you lay on the ground and then respawn and then the great challenge. Don`t die of starvation while you run to your stuff and try not to get killed by these silent robots strolling around in the wild.

i give this...""Thing"" a hard pass for now, until they fix stuff like they should do in an alpha game."
22233,AWESOME GAME! I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TRY IT!
22234,"Scrap Mechanic's survival mode is probably the best survival game I've played so far. Compared to other survival games I've played (7 Days to Die, Minecraft, a few others) the gameplay loop is incredibly refined - you're always working towards acquiring more resources so that you can build better parts/components - it's this great treadmill of getting just enough resources to craft something new, or build a new engine or something, then you use those new components to build something that increases your resource collecting efficiency; and the cycle repeats. 

Then there's the vehicle building, which is absolutely fantastic. I really can't overstate how great the combination of vehicle building and survival is - It gives you an outlet to creatively solve problems by building awesome vehicles and contraptions. Sure you can chop down a tree by hand, but what if you built a vehicle that has a giant sawblade on it that chops down trees for you? What if you were then able to put a collection bin on that same vehicle so it chops and collects the wood simultaneously? All of this feeds back into that great treadmill/gameplay loop. It's also worth mentioning that the way you build the vehicles is pretty intuitive and easy to dive into.

Beyond the mechanics the game is also a joy to look at, and runs extremely well to boot. All of these aspects combined equate to an extremely impressive package - this feels like a super polished 1.0 release, not an early access first-showing like it actually is."
22235,Very Good
22236,"You can't be more than 20 meters away from a friend in co-op until it starts lagging to shit.

The host is running a i9-9900K and a 2080 Ti, this should not be happening.

Needs the option to host a dedicated server desperately. Please for the love of god.

We've stopped playing the game completely because of this."
22237,TIS GAME LAG MY LAPTOP
22238,Better game
22239,keep doing a good job
22240,"This game is a lot of fun with the new Survival mode.
Treat yourself."
22241,it SO GOOD YOU CAN USE IT TO WIPE YOU|R BUTT
22242,10/10 would play
22243,very good game
22244,it very good
22245,yes
22246,"Pros- 
-Sandbox
-Multiplayer

Cons-
Primitive graphics
Buggy at times"
22247,EWEA
22248,"It's fun and charming. So close to giving it a thumbs up but it's too bare boned right now. Survival was good for a little bit but there is so many bugs and missing features. Also a lack of parts for having the word ""Mechanic"" in it's name. Games like Storm works is so much more in depths in terms of systems and engineering. This is like a very rudimentary version.


Things that need attention.
- Not enough propulsion parts.
- Not enough engineering parts, diffs, gearbox's or ways to route power
- Grip is very low especially when using really heavy Vehicles.
- Wonky simplified physics
- More content, right now it's the same deal as slim rancher and a little of trailmaker.


This WILL be worth a buy very soon, wait a little, the devs will make this game great from here. It's just not ready yet, but  if you want to support the game and get it there faster, buy it."
22249,great
22250,E
22251,Its a very nice game I LOVE the survival mode!
22252,5 star
22253,rly good game. very much worth the 19$.
22254,"Great game, the survival aspect added a whole new level of gameplay it is very fun and even better with friends."
22255,I recommand the game 10/10
22256,truly epic
22257,"I like this game, Its not a copy too! I got this game from SpyCakes so thanks to him! The only complaint is that my computer doesnt let the tab fir the screen!"
22258,"This game is very fun. But some of the features are better for people who are good at electronics and problem-solving. You can build basically anything from cars to carnival rides that send you into orbit, all the way to working computers able to solve complex mathematics.
Edit:
Also there's survival I guess
Basically just regular scrap mechanic with machines and crafting
(and obviously finite resources)"
22259,Its great game
22260,meh
22261,I loved it its fun!!!!!!
22262,"Its fun

22263,i enjoy it soooooooo much i pooed me dog
22264,the game is amazing the things you can build
22265,NICE!
22266,The only thing that will limit you in this one are your imagination
22267,its fun....
22268,No
22269,good game
22270,REALY GOOD ONLY IT CRASHES RANDOMLY THATS WHAT I HATE AND TOO BIG % OF SPAWNING RED BOTS PLS FIX
22271,"This game is a ton of fun solo and with friends, only downside is the expected crash that will occur for one reason or another. So far worth the purchase, will update when I'm closer to 50+ hours."
22272,Very good game. It got even better when survival was realesed. Recomended if you like building stuff.
22273,Really great with a lot of content. Especially with the survival update!
22274,Build cool thing and stuff it is very yes!
22275,looks and is fun when it wurks but me fps go to shet so i ceant hav it anyore it hurt eyes mucho.

22277,Survival is buggy but its fun to play
22278,awesome game. love the physics. havent played survival yet cause im trying to get used to it. was going to get trail makers(really fun) but im so glad i got this. so much better but more fun with a few mods.
22279,"Lame. Survival needs tweeking. Lost everything just trying to raid my first warehouse. Had a boss respawn and wreck my vehicle. Gas consumption is a little much. I'm done with the game for now. I ntow it's in early access. The other game mode is worth it cause there you're just  building shit with unlimited resources and down really have to worry about investing time to just get wrecked.

Maybe at a later date I'll get back into survival. But nah. Can't recommend this game in its current state."
22280,"Enjoyable game, fun with friends. Still has some glitches to sort out. Multiplayed can get a bit laggy, it desperately needs a stand along game server as save games stay on the hosts computer. Obviously targeted at younger players, I'm 32 and not too fused with graphics in general but this borders what I would play and makes up for it with the fun aspect. Another thing that is desperately need is a lever that sets a control to a certain amount, like the on off switch but it keeps for example a bearing at a set degree until you increase or decrease the lever."
22281,"Summary:
Scrap Mechanic offers the very best mechanics from variety games and puts them together beautifully. You can easily enjoy this game in it's current state for hundreds of hours. However, it is no secret that this game is early access. It is not fully featured, balanced, or smooth.
Pros:
- difficult enemies
- satisfying progression
- diverse+engaging gameplay loop
- good physics for a building game (if your creation doesn't work, it's your fault /most/ of the time)
- excellent building
- loot tables, dev tools, enemies, etc are all available in plain-text lua files to view or edit
Meh:
- early access. clearly not done, but still fun.
Cons:
- loot tables are not refined. you end up abandoning common resources (looking at you circuit boards)
- CPU intensive; quality degrades with too many entities which is common.
- bugs. at the moment there are very few, however some bugs exist that can waste tons of player time and ruin the fun
- gasoline collection cannot be automated and takes hours to collect the needed amount. it is borderline necessary to edit the game files to increase oil collection rate. again, this is early access."

22285,Modded engines no longer work

22287,"bars, movie, its good!"
22288,"Forgot to sleep for 2 nights in a row. Not cool game, not cool....

Survival is mad fun but also still working in progress, the end game isn't here and that's about the only reason to wait some more."

22292,"i think my playtime reset but yes i enjoy building random things and seeing what the game will let me do. 

survival is a nice addition too. but feels like it doesnt give alot of tips on the new mechanics directly.

22299,O for Osome
22300,"Quick note for everyone: The new Survival Mode is very fun, but it is designed for multiplayer. You can obviously still play it single player, but it will be a little bit more ""farmy"" to get everything. Still fun in single player though, with maybe a little bit of patience, but nothing too bad. (:"
22301,"I strongly recommend this, even more so with the new survival update."
22302,i realy liked the way that its survival but whith teck
22303,"I think this is a great game, also a very good survival mode, great for sandbox players!"
22304,fantastic sound design and visuals
22305,good
22306,love the new survival mode been waiting for years... excited to see this game grow and hopefully they add more stuff and fix bugs!! lets hope they stay on top of things for the next few years!
22307,"I'm not sure why this game is so highly reviewed. I purchased it with several friends and the enthusiasm was lackluster at best for a couple of days and now we've all moved on. The graphics are entertaining, the combat is a bit repetitive, the number of bugs that still exist is astounding, the farming is probably the most hashed-out aspect. I'd return it if I could but since I can't I'll give it another couple of hours and if something clicks to make me change my mind I'll update this review. For now, for me anyway, a real dud."
22308,very nice
22309,Hello People of the internet This game is only for The hardcorest of gamers Ive spent 13 hours playin and I made my first engine.
22310,"Survival is too buggy this game also crashes alot. After playing for 10 hours building a car that took ages it glitched through the bottom of the floor and now i cannot get it back.  i have also noticed that sometimes when im deleting items/blocks objects attached to the block disappear and they are not in my inventory or on the floor.

"
22311,Love this game Takes some learning and after that you Creativity Can be limitless
22312,"I got this on sale because I was sold on survival mode. The construction mechanics are fun. Unfortunately, there are tons of problems that make survival dull and unrewarding. I'll do the cons first.

Cons:
[list]
[*]You have one weapon (a hammer) for hours and it's super unsatisfying to fight with.
[*]The first wheels you get are worse than nothing. I'm not being snarky; I guarantee you will choose running over using a car with the first wheels. This isn't game breaking, but it's a terrible first experience with vehicles.
[*]The game guides you away from the sole farming tutorial which is probably the most important information a new player needs to see.
[*]You obtain gas for your vehicles by slowly swimming underwater and collecting oil bubbles. There's no way to automate it, it's boring, and you will feel stupid doing it.
[*]Same goes for glue, but replace oil bubbles with clams.
[*]A decent sized vehicle can use a container of gas in seconds. So if you don't want to spend time diving for oil bubbles (you don't), you're literally driving a cardboard/wood vehicle with no cool effects.
[*]Manually refining takes too long and feels like an unnecessary task.
[*]Bots will just as soon chop through a wall as they will walk through a close-by opening. You can build a cool trap only to watch a bot attack a worthless corner of your base for no reason.
[*]Can't test vehicles in creative since the rules and items are different (no guns or chopping trees in creative)
[*]Grindfest. Materials take so long to build up, that no one builds a house and everyone who plays ends up living in the mechanics shop. 
[*]Lack of control. If you're looking for Space Engineers-like control of your devices/vehicle, you will disappointed.
[*]The ""tutorial"" seems like it was made before survival existed.
[*]I could keep going...
[/list]

Pros:
[list]
[*]Building vehicles is fun and you can make some neat contraptions
[*]Many of the problems I experienced can be fixed
[/list]

I wouldn't recommend Scrap Mechanic for now. I haven't refunded it because most of the problems I have with the game are fixable and I'm curious to see if it changes. I'm hopeful, but this game is 4 years old so it's a gamble. In my opinion, Scrap Mechanic isn't worth your money now, but it might be with more time in development."
22313,good fun
22314,"Trash game, waste of time playing, short, bugy."
22315,"Pretty good, but it's pretty complicated. The only major problems I can find is the lag produced when a lot of things are going on at once, the fact you can't place survival blocks in creative and tile maker, and the fact you can't place water in map maker."
22316,Fun and its a creative game. I recomend it to kids that like to explore and build.
22317,very fun
22318,"Neat game, almost a perfect title. The only issues are random lags and fps drops. Very very few bugs encountered, Otherwise, you will have hours of fun in coop or in solo. Definitely worth the money!"
22319,like it little boring
22320,I CAN'T STOP PLAYING!

22322,"I've found a lot of resources! *promptly dies* 
I've found more resources! *promptly dies* 

solid 5/7 perfect score."
22323,This game is great  if you like minecraft you will love this game. the only bad part is it's sorta hard to learn to make a car but just search a video on you tube and it will be easy
22324,"Devs, my pc shut down and all my clothes went missing. whenever i try to recover my clothes by using a dressbot, it gives me nothing ad the dressbot is broken. can you fix this?"
22325,Great game in creative. Survival has issues but they are working on it.
22326,"This is my potato gun. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My potato gun is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my potato gun is useless. Without my potato gun, I am useless. 
I must fire my potato gun true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. 
I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will ...

My potato gun and I know that what counts in war is not the potatoes we fire, 
the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit ...

My potato gun is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. 
I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. 
I will keep my potato gun clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. 
We will become part of each other. We will ...

Before God, I swear this creed. My potato gun and I are the defenders of my country. 
We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory is our's and there is no enemy, but peace!"

22329,"no,but yes
"
22330,Very fun and addicting i've had it for years and survival makes it even more fun.
22331,"I would like to start with that I asked for a refund for the game...
So you would ask yourself why are you recomending?
The game has nice graphics and is fun to play with a friend, for a solo player like me, it lacks a goal.
Also, one thing that trew me off right in the begining was the absolute lack of a navigation system, went exploring far from the initial crash site, and after I gathered resources, was a 30 min strugle to go back to the crash site to begin building something.
I DO RECOMEND THE GAME however, if you like playing coop games, if you have a kid that you would like to play with, because it is engaging, and the complexity that you can achieve with the veicles would spark your kids creativity and problem solving, but for me, as I said, didn't spark my interest for long."
22332,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME (yet)

Great concept but to much bugs to enjoy (specially in Survival mode). And not ""little"" bugs, I really mean ""game breaking bugs, like the elevator not working in the warehouse and clipping trough walls.

May be fun in a few months"
22333,"In this chill survival game you play as a beefy gnome who's soul purpose in life is to build a car with reeeallly shitty tires.

You soon come to terms with the fact that planting tomatoes is *I-L-L-E-G-A-L*
Soon, every Orange Refrigerator in the neighborhood is going to want your small body.
Don't worry though, you can build robots, but more importantly, you can build better tires.

This ones going on the fridge:   9/10"

22335,ver guud
22336,"It's a good game, full of potential but currently difficult to play for very long, since they added the survival update I have frequent crashes and a lot of lag, especially in games with friends, even in creative with few objects I've crashed, but I have faith they will work to fix these issues, and there were a few patches in the last week that has fixed many other issues. But overall it is an enjoyable game, with a lot of physics and engineering components to build all sorts of things, but it would be nice to see some water physics, so you could build a boat, and not just a platform that floats and doesn't move, or perhaps aerodynamics so you could make a plane or helicopter, and not just rely on thrusters for vertical lift in the future."
22337,amazingly fun
22338,minecraft and satsifactory bastard child
22339,I love this game! If you're a fan of game likes Brick Rigs and Minecraft you'll really dig this puppy. Performance wise its solid. Beautiful artwork and world presentation. Builds are fun and intuitive. Survival mode!
22340,"Some people criticize this game because of the survival update making things laggy, but that's not the games fault, it's your computer. Plus, the update is new. so Axolot will make it better later. Even unskilled players can enjoy it with easy multiplayer and workshop access."
22341,Clean ass game
22342,"What a great game. This game can be enjoyed alone or with friends. 
The possibilities in this game are endless and you are limited only by your imagination. 

The only flaw so far is the occasional lag when playing with friends. They have said they are 
looking into this and plan to fix it. Apart from that i highly recommend purchasing this game."
22343,fun

22352,"Gameplay is very good. Lacks a solid storyline, but you can easily end up spending countless hours building awesome vehicles and exploring the map. You can encounter issues with lags and frame drops from time to time but playing with your friends is the way to go for sure.  Solid 8/10"
22353,"Very fun game. Got this about 2-3 years ago and it was pretty good, opened it up again recently to find out there had been constant updates and I hope there will be more."

I definitly recommend this :D"

22363,it fun
22364,"So far loving it. The basic premise you are a farmer ... against the world  of robots early game this equates to random encounters until you take up your green thumb and the robots find you have made ... an illegal farm ! after that its timed waves and defense. Make cool vehicles and contraptions defend your farm the veges must flow ! 

There are some quality of life improvements that could be made before adding new content but honestly so far this is a solid early access especailly at the $20 dollar price tag !"
22365,epic
22366,"I am loving the new survival of this game. I only barely messed around in creative in the past but the survival has totally got me all in now. I love seeing the continues updates you are providing based off the feedback from players and youtubers. I wanna know tho if there is gonna be some type of armor or way to increase our health to defend against more attacks? Only being able to survive one tape bot hit then needing to heal seems fine early play but I would like to see garments provide a small defensive boost to allow being able to withstand maybe one or two more hits. Raids can still be laggy, but otherwise no issues so far."
22367,Very realistic.
22368,its a googame where u can be very creative but making robots or using logic gates is a bit too complex and  there should be a guide how i hope but  anyways its it worth

22379,"Very addictive builder game. The ""survival"" aspect gets taken care of quickly and from then it's gather resources and build cool stuff"
22380,"Survival Mode: Well thought out gameplay loops, a deep creation engine, and an engaging multiplayer experience. The first couple hours of learning the ropes can be frustration but it's well worth it."
22381,CARS CAN BLOW UP
22382,"Steam recommended this game to me when the survival mode came out and 50 hours later, here we are.

First off this is not a game focused on survival. This is a creative sandbox physics simulator game with a survival mode added to it. This means that the focus is on building things and doing creative constructions to solve your survival issues. You build your own vehicles and you will probably build a lot of them. You will want harvesters for trees and rocks. You might even want to build an automated farm, since farming produce is the main currency in the current release. This is also where the survival mode feels a bit incomplete, because there are many areas that do not feel fully fleshed out. For a game encouraging you to build your own vehicles, gathering the fuel for it is ridicously tedious compared to how you can gather everything else in the game.

22383,
22384,Game really turns me on.
22385,It is a great building game with basic mechanics to build veichles
22386,It is creative and fun.
22387,Great game except i get lost with time in it.
22388,"This is an amazing. If you love survival, creative or games in general you need this game."
22389,"I mean scrap mechanic in creative is fun and all, but survival. Ooh lord! Definitely the best game I have played in years. I think this is the best value I have gotten out of a game considering the low price."
22390,"The game crashes on startup.
Reinstalling and cache checking as well as loading the old version in the beta-versions tab does not help.
I literally had to launch the game like 30 times just to have the five game-time minutes so i can write that negative review.

If you open the steam discussions, there is a pinned thread for that issue on top of the list.
The thread is opened in January 2017 and as you can check is still alive and receives a lot of crash reports from steam users up to this day.
Sooo basically the developers haven't fixed a bug that does not allow to even LAUNCH the game for not less than THREE AND A HALF YEARS.
The fixes proposed in the thread like replacing the concrt140.dll file, turning off Afterburner, running as administrator, reinstalling the game and reloading my PC did not help.

Upd.
After like 5+ full reinstallations the game randomly launched once. 
Dunno if it will ever launch again now.
I'm pretty sure the launch issues still deserve a negative review."
22391,"Dear Developer....
Please give us the Offline Mode!!! I'll Support you for the rest of content!!!

Best Regards..."
22392,"Game is lots of fun! Could use some better tutorials on how to build.  Once you figure out how to make everything work, what you can build seems endless.  A few bugs, one being vehicle will not move or start moving forward or backwards on its on when you get in it. counter that by pushing direction it was moving in to fix."
22393,good gem bro
22394,Bad did not enjoy got a refund
22395,This is a great game and well worth the money sightly laggy if you have a windows 10
22396,"I disliked that I occasionally get kicked and lag =, but maybe it is because my computer is to weak.
Great game with a variety of things to explore adn there is major progression ot do and it feels so much better once you have machines. The grinds and desire to finish the car keep you going for hours without realizing it. I'd reccomend this to anyone in need of a new survival game and creative is fun to!"
22397,This is a great game. Cant wait for Survival to be updated more!
22398,it is hard and fun

22402,This game is amazing and there is so many things you can do.
22403,This game really opens up your imagination virtually allowing you to create anything and the fact that you can go onto the workshop to download a build if you're to lazy to build it yourself

hmmm gud"
22407,Good game
22408,it is really fun and i like the feature about the raids at the farm
22409,best game ever the new survival is great but the game bugsplats alot so be ready if you think this is going to be a smooth player
22410,"I like the design premise of the game. Physics based vehicle construction in a survival setting. 

But...
Super grindy. Wayyyy too grindy. The material return on resource collection is insanely low relative to both construction costs AND the fact that it is way too easy to lose items. 

There's no forum for this game, so it's hard to understand where the creator's are getting feedback or how. If they read this, I'd say...

-Allow for the creation of planks or large plates of construction items. The tiny blocks you use to build things are insanely expensive considering how much time must be spent harvesting. For example, maybe a allow for half-depth blocks like 2x4's costing only 4 mats. 

-Clarify durability ratings. I have no idea how much HP different levels of materials possess. I know a haybot hits for 30 and a tentacle bot hits for about 15. I have no idea how that correlates to wood, metal, stone, etc. I have no idea if a block is damaged or not. There's just no good way to begin conceiving a base, not knowing how many hits anything can take.

-Add customized controls. Right now, you can't even customize how the WASD in a driver seat maps to different bearings. That would at least allow for a simple driver controlled turret....but it's unnecessarily complicated to create even that. 

-Create a forum on your website. I have no idea which problems other people share or if they have decent workarounds. Right now all of the information is on YouTube from people who are wayyy too dedicated to making this clumsy game work. 

-Allow saving of blueprints in survival.

-There's no consistency in how the physics of the world works. When the player hits some world objects, they're indestructible, but when the robots hit them they disappear forever. Players and bots should both do similar damage. This would at least give the player some consistent understanding of how materials work. 

-Haybots look clanky but they're silent in motion, only making noise when they grunt. 

*Potential Pros:

-There is a tiny, yet short sense of progression in the development of better vehicles. Say, from knocking down trees yourself, to building some form of harvester. It's somewhat satisfying, but the satisfaction is short-lived due to there being little to do after that. There's no better blocks to buy or craft, no wedges, no shapes, no panels, etc. Everything is blocky regardless of how long you've been playing or how many mats you've collected. I think it's mandatory that the devs focus on making things fun to build by adding useful panels and aesthetic vehicle parts. Right now, everyone is showing off the same functioning vehicles (offroad explorer, drill harvester, saw harvester, and hauler). Without aesthetic pieces, or protective panels, there's not much reason to differentiate designs in survival. 

It's hard to understand the creator's intent here because this feels like a couple genres mashed together without a lot of careful consideration. Can't recommend this after trying to give it a good go. 

The world they have here is a bit of a mess and I don't see it being cleared up unless there is a major overhaul. Save yourself the cash, this is not worth the price even on sale as it doesn't seem like a game that can be completely developed with all its various frayed strands of genre.

The Tower Defense nature of the raids has a lot of potental...except that these robots are too smart. And, they dodge weapons. Not sure why there isn't a scaling of their AI. As it is now, they spawn from all around, attack everywhere. It would be better if they just followed a path of least resistance, like dummies, and let the user develop hilarious ways to defend their base. Currently, you need a massive amount of resources and experience to even consider leaving base defense automated. Missed opportunity.

22432,AMAZING!
22433,not finished game not buy
22434,Very fun. Survival in this game is very fun and frustrating at the same time. lol
22435,fun
22436,The idea of having this many parts that are almost completely compatible with each other is a really good idea for a sandbox game.
22437,"Survival needs a massive overhaul for optimization. This would be (by far) one of the most addicting games I've ever played if it wasn't for the increasing dropped frames the more you build and grind. 

-Loose resources on the ground cause dropped frames
-Ground collision is half and half.. sometimes something will clip through the ground into oblivion, most times they won't
-Tension on heavily weighed down pistons causes dropped frames
-Raids cause massive dropped frames
-Loose stone boulders (all stages including the final stage that produces resources) causes dropped frames

Basically, anything that's not physically attached to something will cause dropped frames. It's not too noticeable at first, but the more you fill a tile, and the more you start to leave things lying around, you'll eventually start to not have fun.. This is a single player playthrough review, multiplayer has its own issues (its own issues that are extended from single player bugs). I'm currently still fighting through things, but its increasingly getting more frustrated. 
etc. etc...

I know it's still in early access (BETA), and the dev's are killing it with patches and reading reports. I have hope that it will get better. But, the state that its in right now is in need of massive improvements.

EDIT: Played another 10 hours or so after I left this review. I've changed my mind on recommending this game. I find new bugs constantly, and my vehicle just de-spawned for the second time so.. I think I'm done with Scrap Mechanic until it gets out of beta.

UPDATE: The dev's gave up, wouldn't recommend still.."
22438,"I am addicted.
Surviving is amazing. Called my save ""Fuckbots"" because they fucked me up pretty good in my first survival world which led me to deleting that world and look at me now. I've got a stable base and a multi-purpose jeep and a nice farm to keep me stocked with food. And there is still so much to do. I can express my creativity into something with purpose."
22439,Great game
22440,"My rule of thumb for a game is to get about 1 hour of entertainment for every 2$ that I spend, so if go out and get a $60 AAA game, I expect at least 30 hours of fun. I picked this game up on sale for about $14 and reached my 7 hour requirements within the first 7  hours of owning the game...

Scrap Mechanic feels like the combination of My time at Portia, Minecraft and Astroneer, with its own unique spin, specifically when it comes to building/designing. Devs are constantly pushing hotfixes and patches as they get feedback, with some bigger changes on the horizon. Certainly a group worth supporting, and at a very fair price, even when not on sale."
22441,"To be honnest, I didn't really like the game before the survival update. This game have been sitting in my library for over a year and i barely touched it, it felt very limiting even in creative mode. 
That Survival mode really saved this game, it has a lot of potential now. 
"
22442,"some gitches but its mostly fun cool game
"
22443,Its good fun to play with friends but can crash and has a few minor bugs

22453,Very fun
22454,Awsome game
22455,This game is simply a masterpiece. I've played this for 2 years now and can confirm that even before survival and challenge mode the game was still worth buying.

22458,very god game pga bajs
22459,"i've played the new survival mode for like, 10 minute's and WOW, it was ACTUALLY worth the wait and then some! 10/10 even though ive only played the new gamemode for 10 min"
22460,this game is nice!!
22461,survival be vibin
22462,It's Great.  Just needs more content.
22463,ye
22464,GOOD GAME
22465,"Never heard of the game before last week when a buddy told me to get it. I've played 110hrs since Monday. It's an awesome game and the devs actually listen to the players! Few bugs and has been a bit laggy around my base/builds lately but hopefully its a bug that's fixed! Awesome again love the game!

EDIT: The game is now unplayable. Complete lag and crashes. Can't do warehouse raids as I just get stuck in the elevator. Starting a new game is pointless as they've added new things for ""new games"" that are useless but didn't add them to old game saves. The game is still ok but they need to put an update ASAP, the last one ruined the game."
22466,its great
22467,good game play now plz now buy now
22468,THIS IS SUPER!!!!!!!
22469,"This is, broadly speaking, exactly the kind of game I would like to play.

I appreciate the Survival mode, but a lot more work needs to be put in to find the right balance between struggle and sandbox.

My experience thus far has been the despair of realising exactly how creative and innovative the building tools and systems are in this game - while possessing neither the time nor the will required to bring myself to grind for hours on end to experience it.

A glaring lack of world options leave all but the veteran, the persistent, or the very clever players struggling to enjoy playing for very long. As many have pointed out, you can change the lua game files directly if you like - but this is a poor solution for something so simple, yet so impactful on player experience.

I am, however, prepared to wait for a content patch or two."
22470,I LOVE this game it is a BEAUTIFUL piece.
22471,Bugged mechanics.
22472,this game is too good
22473,i would recommended this game its a lot of fun to mess around and build crazy/weird creations and just messing around with friends.
22474,"There are plenty of reviews for Creative Mode, and I like it for that.  I was really surprised that they didn't offer Survival mode as pay-DLC, as they certainly should have.  I'm glad they didn't, because I would have paid for it and then, well...  The game is beautiful, expansive, with some creative scenes and graphics, but they seem to have forgotten one thing when they made survival mode:  People should enjoy playing it.

1) It's almost impossible to injure a mob with a thing you built.  It's been transformed into a first-person shooter, and not a very good one at that.
2) They show all these pictures of multiplayer, but the lag is simply atrocious even when playing over a LAN.  It's *always* been this way and they've never been able to fix it.
3) Did they not notice that the lack of a map is seriously painful?  My son and I spent 3 hours this afternoon struggling to find a Biome with cotton in it.  Really, we couldn't find an entire biome; in his seed the only one was really far away.
4) You couldn't make tooltips in the crafter menu?  Really?  No ""Cancel Build"" option in the crafting bot?  Really?  No Auto-Loot feature?  I gotta right-click everything?  So many simple little quality-of-life things that just weren't done.
5) I saw a reddit comment where somebody complained that gas engines were too thirsty (and that's a fair comment).  The main response was ""well you need to turn the power down to where it'll just barely crawl up a hill, then it'll be efficient!"" (and that's true too).  But they might as well have said, ""Find the 'Fun' slider and slide it all the way down to 0!  That'll fix it!"""
22475,Fun Game :)
22476,Its like Minecraft and Gary's mod had a baby and it then  adopted and raised by Kerbal Space Program. Super fun for creative people but can get a bit laggy in Survival or when there are a lot of objects in your map. Would highly recommend!
22477,THIS IS A GOOD GAME HAVING LOTS OF FUN BUT REALLY NEED A MINI MAP. THERE IS A LOT OF SAMENESS AND GETTING YOUR BEARINGS CAN BE A NIGHTMARE
22478,"Jazzy game. 12/5

22479,Very fun. Would like to see more stuff *Head lamp perhaps*.
22480,Addictive way to be creative.
22481,i love this game and recomend it to all everyone
22482,good
22483,"Just isnt ready, Buggy, Poorly Optimized, but still fun when everything works. if you do want an early access wait for it to go on sale, cross you fingers for a 1.0 as its been 4 years already. 

Update with 12 more hours: the more you explore and the more moving parts you have in a world the more unstable the game becomes, lagging during mob spawns, connection issues,  High end machines and the game is utilizing one core, i mean its been 4 year, shame these guys got away with stealing my money and my friends."
22484,"yes
"
22485,a
22486,fun
22487,Hilariously fun!
22488,this game is super fun
22489,Amazing fun and innovative
22490,"Great game, has this nostalgic feel of minecraft, while being something entirely different. Overall I recommend very much in a state that the game is in right now, I belive it will be released eventually."
22491,"This is an absolutely wonderful game. From crafting vehicles, fighting robots, farming, exploring, it has it all. I highly recommend it. It can be played solo or with friends"
22492,"Gave it a good shot, but it lacks content."
22493,"I really like this game, and i've had it since the early release. But while I do enjoy the game, it really seems like the developers are not listening. I've waited for them to release survival, and when it got here it seemed uncomplete. It is so hard to get resources, I mean really hard. Their is no tutorial for survival, all you get is how to plant crops. Which I really just don't understand, because before you can progress in your game you have to get to one of the shop things. I like the building idea of the game, but it feels spoiled because farming seems like it something extra that wasn't complete. I mean you can't plant more than 8 crops before starting a ""raid"". Also their is no way to stop the raids so your kinda just stuck with robots attacking you. Components which are a big part of the game are so hard to get, you get a silly usless amount of circuit boards but like 1 component after killing 4 hay bots. Also you can only get the potato gun, and stuff like that if you fall into the farming. I wanted to play this game in survival for the building and mechanics of scrap mechanics not to fight a robot everytime I place crops. I really enjoy creative, but once again the developers just left it in the dust. I mean You only get the infinitely generated maps if you play survival. I do think this game has potential but, only if the developers start listening to more than just the 7 odd famous youtubers who play the game. Don't mistake this for a hate rant which I know it sounds like. I do understand it is early access, and has room to grow. But I have owned this game for a year or two now and it still leaves me sad at how slow and unprogressive this game is porceeding. I want this game to be more, and I love the concepts but, you need to know what your buying. When things change I do plan on changing this review, but only if they make the game better, and not just keep adding stuff to it rather than changing the mechanics. As of know I do think this game is good, and something you should buy if you like games like minecraft and rimworld, but know you are getting a game that will take forever to update, and you will get ""Devblogs"" of what will happen. But know it is slow updating, and a little buggy."
22494,"Creative, fun, glitchy and vast range of technical ventures from an auto farmer to a automatic sentry tower, what's not to love."
22495,"fun game, challenging but fun"
22496,AMAZING!
22497,"BEST, GAME, EVER.PERIOD. If you like Adventure and Sandbox AND SURVIVAL, YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME. I swear."

22504,Unique and more fun than I even expected.
22505,"Casual play which very fun.

22506,"Has potential, but I can't recommend a game that does not let you save your progress.  It may be survival, but it shouldn't be hardcore survival unless that is the way I want to play it."
22507,"Im not gonna write i massive review im just gonna say, I enjoy and i recommend"
22508,"Its a good game in graphics and gameplay they did just add survival which is great!
"
22509,"ITS REALY FUN
"
22510,yay
22511,10/10 would buy again. ha quite a bit of multiplayer lag other than that it is a great game
22512,"It's nice. Reminds me of that Banjo& Kazooie Nutz'n Boltz game. Survival is fun, but a bit grind heavy and fairly shallow. Good start for developement. Just needs a few more years!"
22513,Bought this while it was on sale during their new Survival Mode release. Really loving it. It's a surprisingly clever game.
22514,"A great looking world with a nice art style and tons of things to design, build, and have fun with!  I've played over 60 hours so far and still have so much I want to try out.  Definitely a bargain for me."
22515,"I had not played this previously, but watched a lot of Creative mode game play and HAD to try Survival. 40 hours in and I didn't even scratch the surface. So many opportunities to build unique vehicles and buildings using all different kinds of materials. I lose some frames with complex builds but its not horrible. I love how I can just be like ""oh I'll take that"" or ""I think I want a wall... here"" and boom it works."
22516,"I love this game so much now. Survival really truly honestly breathed so much life into it. 

It's still a bit rough around the edges, and a little slow at the start, but I'm sure it will only improve as time goes on.
Not to say this game wasn't good before, it just got boring really quick, because well, the only gamemode was creative.

There's so much to do in this game. It encourages creativity and problem solving like no other.

You can:
Automate farming, bot killing, crafting, resource gathering and more!
Create complex logic and automatic systems with the various components at your disposal. 
Build convoluted or compact transforming machines with pistons, bearing and controllers.

I love this game, I love what people do with this game, I couldn't have come across a funner game.

It runs extremely well for such a good looking game.
Even the lowest settings don't look like blurry barf, it's that optimized.

Making it so you can only turn off foliage in creative is a little weird, but the game doesn't look as good without it."
22517,good game son
22518,it is a amazing game with endless amount of things you can make as a person that likes these types of games this is the best out of all of them
22519,"The game has lots to offer, i understand many things need fixes and additions, but i still like the game play."
22520,this game must be played if your wanting to build stuff
22521,"This game is really cute, and I have enjoyed playing it, despite how long it takes to load and that is crashes if I'm doing anything else in the background.

Suggestions for updates/additions

- This game would have been AWESOME with a more steampunk skin - perfect for pseudo-science and contraptions.
- A means to turn off or mitigate the farm raids in survival. While I understand this is a part of 'survival' it totally inhibits exploration.
- Beacons... omg beacons! I've gotten lost so many times and have no way to get my bearings.
- A compass at least?
- You ABSOLUTELY need to have a tooltip/rollover for the blocks/items when it tells you what you need to craft an item. Many of the blocks are so subtle in their differences it can be difficult to identify them.
- Subscription mod support - manually installing them is onerous and can lead to corruption.

Am still playing, and look forward to updates. <3"
22522,Nice
22523,"Hey guys, I love scrap mechanic and I have been waiting for survival to come out. I was gone for a little while but now when i try and load the game it just stays on the loading screen. I would like to find a solution so i can try this awesome game"
22524,"i personally liked the combat/raiding aspect of the game the most, but building, roaming the vast landscape, full of enemies and loot, and destroying buildings as I go on my way was pretty amazing. i would give this game a 10/10, as ity is also really easy to learn how to play, and runs amazingly on my piece of junk computer."
22525,"This game is one of the best I have ever played, by a long shot. The game is easy to learn but hard to master, and it gives you the power to do whatever you want. A must play in my opinion."
22526,"After 69 hours of playtime, (mostly survival,) I decided to write a simple early access review as someone who has no prior experience to Scrap Mechanic.

First off, bugs. Though it's a fun game with lots of interesting mechanics that are new to the survival/sandbox genre, the game is currently full of so many bugs that it can take away from the experience and sometimes be downright annoying. (Yet expected from an early access game) The devs however have been making daily patches for all the problems, so it's improving.

Second, multiplayer. Single-player is pretty boring and grindy if you're playing survival, so I recommend playing with friends. A lot of the current bugs are centered around multiplayer; especially ones that cause lag, but nothing is more fun than driving around with others in your wonky constructions.

Third, survival combat. In my opinion it's annoying; the robots have a very basic A.I that sucks at attacking, which you think would make combat super easy, if it wasn't for when they push each other. When more than one robot tries to attack you they run into one another and get a little boost toward you which they can then repeatedly attack you and kill you in seconds. No blocking, dodging or backpedaling can save you. (Blocking isn't a thing in survival yet.) Hit and run tactics seem to work but you'll still get hit.
I imagine that this isn't something the devs wanted to happen and if it is then that's a cruel way to make robot swarms overtake you.

Besides all of that, the robot designs are really cool and I hope they will create more than what is already in the game.
I can't wait to get far enough in survival to start making traps to kill bots with.

Fourth, crafting. With no tutorial it took forever to figure out how to craft, not to mention the fact that I completely missed the farming tutorial area because it blends in with the forest when you start. It also doesn't tell you what any material is in crafting blueprints, so you just have to guess by a little picture it gives you.

Fifth, mechanics. Building in this game looks complicated, but really it's only as complicated as you make it. You can get by with a simple little car or go with a hovercraft of masterful engineering. I highly recommend this game mainly for the building mechanics alone.

Lastly, I know this whole review sounds negative, but I've really enjoyed this game so far and think it was worth the price.
I can only imagine what this game has in store for the future as it has so much potential; I wish the devs luck.
(I'll probably update this review in the future.)"
22527,"Played before survival mode was introduced. Was a very fun and enjoyable game, however got boring quite quickly. This new free update added a ton of content and puts a new fresh feel to all the mechanics. Incredible effort, with a game that most devs would have let die in early access. Totally worth the buy."
22528,best game ever i really recomend
22529,very gut
22530,fuckin fun as shit
22531,"Incredibly unique and fun survival game. It is in beta at the time of writing this review and as such does not have all the content and is a little buggy, but I am having a complete blast. This game is not super easy, but it is extremely rewarding to use some time and creativity to make the most unique solutions to problems you could make in any game. For example, I have already made an automatic water turret that waters all my plants automatically when I activate it. There is so much you can do with this game, and once you get the mechanics down, you can make just about anything. I understand that some people are upset with the way the devs handled the development time and marketing of the game, but I say look at the current product. Sure mistakes were made, but what came out of it is incredibly fun, the devs have been super active and on top of fixing bugs and working on content, and there is only more content to come. I am actually impressed at the detail and size of the environments and terrain, and it really stood out to me compared to other survival games I have played. Also, this game is very much centered around farming. It is how you progress, but also attracts more attention of hostile enemies, creating a balancing act that scales with your skill and the equipment you have to defend. There are some genius concepts in this mode, and the concepts for new content that are being worked on will only add to this incredibly fun game. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes survival games, and once you get used to the wacky idea of a physics-based survival game, you will have a blast."

Yeah, the farming is boring and takes longer than it should, I'd rather focus on delving into the building things more so than repeatedly planting and farming. BUT, the amount of vehicles / tools / machines you can create is immense. Will be spending a lot of time playing."

But just ""creative mode"" had it's limits and I moved to other things after 30 hours.  Since survival mode dropped, I can't stop playing it.  It has a lot of the usual features of a survival crafting/building game, but some interesting twists... there are key resources you can't craft, but have to farm from enemy bots.  You can't build any weapons, but trade your crops or rescue captured farmers for them.  Building custom fortifications, traps and complex vehicles (including mobile mining drills and battle cars) are a key part of the game.

But I think the most interesting thing the game does is take farming, which is a key but boring component of nearly every survival game, and turn it from drudge work into the central mechanic of the ""survival"" aspect... you need to farm to live (and to trade for gear), but unauthorized farming is prohibited, and you, my short farming friend, aren't an authorized farmer.  Every time you plant a crop, farmbots will show up within 24 hours to wreck your farm, and you, if you get in the way.  So when you plant, you have to be ready to defend, and the larger the planting, the more bots will show up.  It's both disappointing and exciting when you lose a defense and the bots destroy all your crops, as well as leave holes in all your defenses.

When you've gotten your base established and can trade for some potato guns, there are well-guarded warehouses to explore....

9/10, will plant my crops again."
22565,fun
22566,"Let me start of by confusing whoever starts reading this. This game is great and many kinds of awesome!
....in potential.

Sadly I cannot recommend it in its current state. Main reason is optimization.

When you first start this game, you will most likely not notice anything wrong, the game runs smooth as a feather. The graphics are great, gameplay is fun and all of this get multiplied when you play it in Survivalmode with your friends. 
Which is exactly what i did for 54 hours, thats how much I loved it.

But as my friends and I were playing in our world. Each of us contributing to our ever expanding base, making it more complex. Building our cars, bikes and trucks to get around the world. My game would get more choppy, more laggy everyday. 
Up untill the point where with a heavy heart I had to say goodbye to the world my friends and I built because the game didnt run above 12fps anymore. 

My rig is not the most recent but still beefy enough that this shouldnt happen, I meet all of the recommended specs. 
In my search for a fix I came across more people with the same issue scattered on Reddit and Steam.

Granted if you have the latest NASA computer this likely wont be a problem for you. Neither will this be a problem if you are content building simple stuff.
However if you are looking for a good multiplayer experience where you can build untill your hearts content, my advice is to skip this untill the developer has optimized the game further, because there is nothing worse then being forced to say goodbye to something you like doing."
22567,"nice
"
22568,"it is an endless sandbox where you can build anything, what else is to say also survival mode is very coolio"
22569,"This game has tons of errors, you should wait until the game is better."
22570,i love this game it took a long time for survival to come out but its fun and thats what madders
22571,esta buenardo
22572,great shit
22573,"This game has the potential to be the next Minecraft like phenomenon. An incredible experience solo, or with friends."
22574,"With survival mode out Scrap Mechanic is finally a game I can recommend to people. I'm really excited for more content, but the things I specifically really want expanded on someday are better boat building, more places to explore, and flight without glitches. Having a waypoint system would be very nice, if it's a tool you have to craft, or something you have to build in the world, or if you just get the ability from the start, I just want to be able to travel and know how to get back to my base. The current game is fun and future content will make it even better."
22575,its an amazing game hasnt even been 7 days and ive spent 18 hrs i totally reccomened it
22576,computers
22577,"good game very fun
"
22578,uuuuu przejmujemy jutuby
22579,"First time playing this game, but I have watched Neebs Gaming play it on YouTube. The survival aspect is fun, and I'm enjoying exploring the game."
22580,yum.
22581,"Decided to send it on this game because I have enjoyed other survival builders in the past. Bought it right after survival came out, well worth the money, on sale or not. There's so much to do and I'm already pretty deep into a couple saves."
22582,its cuul unlike juul
22583,The new survival update has added so much that I honestly forgot the game was about building while venturing the vast world. This game is super fun and I reccomend!
22584,one time i built a car in this game
22585,its ok i guess
22586,It gud
22587,"Bought the game when I saw the survival update and I must say, its very fun. However, the game needs to be better optimized so I wont lag every 5 steps"
22588,good game
22589,It is a great game to just build and have fun and with the new survival mode it is awsom
22590,good game
22591,"super fun and creative possibilities are endless if you know what you are doing, has amazing potential if given lots of love from devs and fans"
22592,.
22593,"I really really love the new survival, but it would be a lot more fun and less frustrating if there was some sort of world map, or at least a map showing where you have been. When  exploring, it is so hard to find your way back home. Also, it is extremely hard to get enough food to be able to truly explore, there should be an easier way to get food early on. Again, I love the game, but I hope these things are added/fixed. Oh, and warehouses are super hard, and the lower levels should be made easier. Thanks for listening!"
22594,"LOVE
IT"
22595,amazing with friends fun to just design cool cars and stuff
22596,good
22597,It Is A Very Fun Game. Sure It May Be Laggy At Times But Its Still Fun
22598,"fun survival mode, its all ive been playing recently."
22599,GUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
22600,"I bought this game a week and a half ago and I AM HOOKED! Thanks to Neebs Gaming for playing this game while i backwatched nearly their whole series. Then I found out there was a survival mode coming out and I was like, ""BET!"" I'll admit, its a little buggy here and there but it's still such a fun game!"
22601,preety cool
22602,"My buddy won't stop t-posing on me with his bucket. Help, I'm scared and I'm crying and pissing my pants. ;-;

All in all, good game for some quick laughs with the bois."
22603,Its just a truly amazing game. The graphics are simplistic but the gameplay is addictive. The new survival mode gives the sense of progression that creative didn't have. The parts given allow you to just unleash your imagination and ideas. If you like sandbox games this is a must have
22604,very good
22605,Fun game all around
22606,"For such a virtually limitless potential it's impressive how well this game handles itself. just so long as you dont plan on any demolition derbys you should be fine. The new survival update has brought so much life back into a game ive loved and played for quite some time. If you're looking for a creative platform with high potential i strongly recommend this. Even if you're new, youtube has plenty of people to teach you"
22607,Best game i have played in a long time
22608,Great game survival made I a lot better but the game has a lot of physics so very lagy and glitchy recommend a powerful CPU but still very fun.
22609,"LEGO AND ROBOTS AND LOGIC GATES, OH MY!"
22610,yes
22611,it is good
22612,very good game if you like sandbox based games easy to build in
22613,It was already a great sandbox game but with the survival update recently it's been a lot more fun!! It still has a few bugs here and there but i really enjoy it!
22614,"10/10 game -

It can be a little buggy at time but is otherwise amazing. The nearly limitless possibilites of this game really got me hooked on it. Great for players who like creative building games or building complex machines."
22615,yes its good
22616,There is so much to do.. Good game to waste time on and feel no regrets
22617,"NOOOO!! you cant just use a highly advanced building game to make stupid things!!!!

haha sensor go beeeeeeeep"
22618,it goo
22619,It is a great game.
22620,i played this for way too much
22621,"I started game, not long in my character got stuck in a piece of a building and could find no way to fix it.   So I erased that one and started again.. did not get too far in and I got stuck again... not playable yet."
22622,"Hey survival mode sucks, you get nowhere in eight hours and you don't even know what you trying to get in the first place. 2/10 (And that's generous)
In an attempt to be constructive here's the things I think survival needs fixed:
- Combat: Hammer is clunky, slow, and unsatisfying, and in 8 hours I couldn't find a single other weapon. Melee enemies were to simple to kite and ranged enemies were impossible to kite within a range you could hit them with the hammer. Make ranged weapons more plentiful and add a bit more intelligence to the AI.
-  Better Tutorials/Hints: Tell what I need to do and what I'm looking for on something other than signs in the middle of nowhere. Current tutorial is a holdout from before the update and is comically unhelpful. Just a popup next a resource on where you'd usually see it is good, a compass system to show exactly where they are is great.
- Movement: Make the decent cars cheaper to make or make the cheap cars useable on the weird geometry. Sprinting for five minutes to get back to my car sucks and is a drain on the whole experience.
- Cooking: WAY further in progression than it has any right to be. Bump it down two tiers or add a cheaper but less useful version of the station.
- Grinding (Literally): Should not take 20 seconds to get 15 scrap metal, and the constant stops to grind out resources murdered any and all flow the game had. Make refining quick and painless, or better yet just remove it entirely for getting scarp metal.
- Grinding (Figuratively): Make resources more plentiful, I want to building cool machines that help me take hoards of robots, not spending sixty minutes holding down E. Grinding enemies sucks because the enemies do, and ruins are as likely to have a gold mine of resources to two turnips.
- Performance: If you had tab open of any kind outside of the game framerate drops were as common as oxygen, and even without that the game struggled in areas with more than a few particle effects.
- Chests: Make them bigger, make bigger chests cheaper. I want to struggle to find ways to build whatever crazy shit I'd need to optimize resource gathering, not to struggle to store all the random trash I need to craft shit without running thirty miles every time I need whatever random bullshit.
- Navigation: Who decided on not adding a map of any sort? The best you get is the countdown timer for the hoard or suiciding a at base to leave a sack. Add a minimap, give that minimap markers."
22623,"Great physics, neat construction possibilities."
22624,"Survival mode has been in development for 3-4 years, and as of May 2020 is an amazing start to a survival game, but right now is incredibly shallow.  The only real goal is to build a car, but there is no automated oil harvesting, so you will spend half your time swimming under water for oil resources if you want to use your new car.

You can also farm for crops that you can turn into a trader for a couple guns, and then there is no reason to trade any more.

The devs have implemented a difficult boss that drops a key to a huge, beautiful warehouse.  But at the last minute stripped the ability to take anything from the warehouse.  So there is absolutely no reason to go to the warehouse.

On the plus side, the game is beautiful!  The draw distance is massive.  The lighting is fantastic, with lots of options to add your own colored lights.  The game runs buttery smooth.  And the animations and noises that the bots and few NPCs make are hilarious!

I felt like I was running out of things to do in survival after about 5 hours of game play.  Perhaps in the future if MUCH more content is added with rare resources, refining machines, an oil refining method, and exceptionally rare resources in the warehouses this game could be something special since the engine is so great.  But right now it is a big disappointment."
22625,"Requires good pc, but is still a very interesting and versatile building engine"
22626,"i lovde the mechanics of the game. There is one thing that I hate is the survival mode, because the hunger and thurst is not good"
22627,I don't know...
22628,funn
22629,"An incredibly buggy, poorly balanced mess. But it has so much character and promise to it that I feel like its still worth a shot. Plus its literally just not finished. Quests n shit will eventually be added so thats cool.

"
22630,awesome
22631,it's just FUN!
22632,this game is just so well made that you can do stuff while scaveging
22633,gg
22634,fun
22635,good game
22636,This game is the best its simuler to minecraft. But I think I like it more.
22637,"good game
"
22638,Its Good
22639,it's fun to play with friends and its also epic
22640,"i feel that this game is well on its way to becoming a great game. its multiplayer, sandbox, and a sort-of adventure game, all in one!"
22641,"Very good game, very fun"
22642,great with friends
22643,"its very fun
"
22644,This game overs everything you could want out of a sandbox builder game. Designing a car and driving it is one of most fun things i've ever done.
22645,"Amazing experience, Thanks god they waited so long to release survival mode, its awesome"
22646,"So much fun! With the recent Survival mode update, there's so much more to play around with.


P.S. Raid the abandoned buildings to progress faster."
22647,good gam
22648,This has always been one of my favorite building games out there and the recent addition of survival made this game 1000x better. There are still quite a few bugs and performance issues but the devs are constantly pushing updates to improve the game.
22649,good
22650,"Tons of potential, survival mode is really fun with Coop. Look forward to seeing this game develop more."
22651,"Been playing this game every night with friends until 5am and I've never regretted a single minute of it, sure there are annoying bugs, low fps from said bugs, and shitty multiplayer lags, but don't let that stop you from getting the game."
22652,"Fun game, mixing the easiest building system, with single player survival. Make your own contraptions to help you in a bad situation. The combat is fun and exploring is fantastic. 

Build a 3x3 and only plant turnips and tomatoes, the bots will not raid you. Till you grow more at a time, or start growing higher tier plants. 

bots can be squashed, and you can build things that do that with a level 2 piston and a switch. 

fuel can be rough, check out piston engines. 

This game rocks, it still is early access, so there are some small things. I really could use a pause button for single player."
22653,good gaem
22654,"I'm not one who leaves reviews that much but this one is so good that I am bound to leave a recommendation!
When I bought this game, I was looking for a game I could get immersed to. Something I really want to keep on playing and want to resume as fast as possible after my other duties.
If you're looking for the same thing, don't look any further! 

I started this game and haven't been able to put it down for well... 39 hours now. 
It starts of as a basic survival Minecraft hybrid. You need to collect materials and seeds for your farmplots, harvest some food and eat/drink it to survive.

The thing is, this gameworld is set in a world where Farmrobots have taken over the land and will not authorize anyone else for farming. So if you put down too much seeds or a seed that is worth a little more, a countdown will start on your plots for robots to come and destroy them.
You will need to defend your farm at midnight! So defences need to be setup, lights so you can actually see..

But that's just one part of the game. Another one is creating your car! And I truly mean creating your car... Everything can be customized and its weight will be important because your engine needs to be able to pull it forward. There are many things you can do and many things you need to take in mind.

You will also need to lodge wood and cut metal from trees and stone with sawblades and drills. These can be mounted on cars or machines that you design yourself!

There are many things I need to explore still, like the trader and the warehouses but it's truly worth the ride!"
22655,"i love it 
"
22656,"Man, the controls in this thing need work.  Driving sucks.  I mean suuuuuuuuucks.  Yeah, it's a jalopy, but that should mean bumps and wonky steering, not fighting between driving controls and viewpoint controls all the time.  Plus, the vehicles flip way, way too easily, they're too easy for critters to smash up, and your backpack is too small to carry all the spare parts if you have really anything else at all.

Loading is really, really bad.  Allow at least 90 seconds before you assume things have hung, and in particular, allow 30 seconds after hearing audio start before you expect to see any visuals.  Once it's actually _running_, performance seems to be fine, so this is almost certainly due to very poorly optimized, highly fragmented resource files-- if you forcibly quit and restart the game, it will load about 20X faster, working entirely from the OS and drive caches.  When that's the case, that clearly indicates that optimized data files would have a huge effect, and that no effort has been made.

The artwork is gorgeous, and a really nice change of pace, but the rest of the game needs A LOT of work."
22657,"ITS A GREAT GAME
and they recently add survival!"
22658,"AWESSOME
"
22659,fun game
22660,its cool
22661,"great game, survival is super addictive, yet buggy still. so  be prepared and dont destroy it in comments because of a bug. lol"
22662,survival is super fun
22663,"I've been with this game since the beginning and survival is great, but I keep getting this bug where when I hop onto a driver's seat, the car moves in a random direction and only stops when I get of."
22664,Lock. Your. Doors.     ITS COMING
22665,this game is the best i recommend playing

22667,"I've been waiting and hoping for this game to recieve a survival mode. I have bought it a day after the survival update went live and I've been playing it every day for several hours since then.

[h1]The first few hours [/h1] were... interesting to say the least. There is no tutorial that covers the survival aspect of the game, only a few tutorials explaining the technical/engineering side of the game like how to build a car, how logic gates work etc. This made the starting experience feel a bit confusing and I felt like the game hit me with a ""you're on your own now, gl hf bye"". The game could use a tutorial or two about how to fight the robots, their weaknesses, raids and just generally the basics of survival.
For me, it wasn't the end of the world as I am fine with a game not holding my hand, but it wouldn't hurt with some basic guidelines mentioned above.

[h2]After you get a hang of it[/h2] the primary objective becomes clear. Gather resources, build bots to automate your tasks, expand your building possibilities and start farming fruits and veggies.
Now, this is not as simple and as quick as in Minecraft for instance. Early game you'll have to make due with gathering scrap metal from defeated bots, ""cut"" down or rather break down trees with your sledgehammer, manually refine everything (as in, convert a log into wooden blocks, a haybot's arm into scrap metal blocks etc.) and gather corn for the cows so that you'll have something to drink/eat.
Yes this is the tedious grind part of the game and I think at least some grind is needed so that survival won't become just another creative with health, hunger and thirst bars. Think ahead; what do you need, what do you want to build and where as well as what will you need to make it.

[h3]Crafting is a core feature[/h3] of this game and I personally feel a bit neutral about it.
You craft items through a craftbot that you'll need to... craft in the mechanics workstation (abandoned workshops that you'll need to power up by finding a ""master battery""), I don't mind this part as the craftbot is not overly expensive to craft, there are however some items that are maybe too expensive for what they offer/do, in my opinion.
Other bots that can only be crafted from the workstation include the refinery bot, which automates refining resources for you, foodbot which for now can only make three meals and the dressbot which helps you look fabulous by making you some new clothes.

I won't go into too much detail about what's expensive to craft and what's not. For now I think the biggest issue is with what the farmbots drop. You'll have tons of circuit boards from totebots (green spider-looking robots) but haybots (orange-yellow'ish pitchfork wielding robots) also have a chance to drop circuit boards and what feels like a way smaller chance to drop component kits, something you'll always want to have a lot of.

[h3]There is also a looting[/h3] which consists of you exploring ruined warehouses and other building which will have damaged crates (aka lootboxes) and chests (crates respawn after some time, not sure what's the respawn time though). Crates can also be found scattered around the world. You simply smash them once with your sledgehammer and they drop 1-3 items.
They can contain component kits, fruit/veggie seeds, other crafting components, gasoline and more.
I really like this idea because it gives you the incentive to explore but also an extra way of finding valuable crafting components (which you won't have to craft) and seeds.

[h3]Unauthorized farming detected[/h3] is the message you'll recieve on-screen when planting more than a specific number (and type) of crops. This means you will have a robot raid incoming at 23:59 to make your life miserable and try to deprive you of your dreams of becoming a farming king.
The size of the raid and the types of robots that will come and say hi depends on the size of your farming operation. The more you plant, the bigger the delegation from the ministry of agriculture.

[h3]Co-op multiplayer is here[/h3] but players that actually play mp report desync issues as well as lags. Devs are constantly working on fixes and they have recently fixed a lag issue within mp but don't take my word for it. I wish I could tell you more about mp but I am currently stuck playing solo. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[h3]TL;DR[/h3]
A colorful survival game with building and engineering aspects as well as looting and farming.
I did not mention graphics and optimization but I can tell you right away that it works really well on my system (i7 4790K/GTX1070) with an occasional temporary fps drop when exploring  the map far away.
Survival is not finished, there are definitely some balance issues and perhaps some missing features/objects but if building contraptions, vehicles and automation is your gig, then you'll love this.

Update regarding performance: Game can become a slideshow with bigger raid groups (5-6 robots +), it goes back to normal the more robots you destroy."
22668,Noice
22669,"Can't play offline. A single player game, and you can't play offline?!?!?!?!"
22670,"great game 10/10 but a few flaws you need to be able to refine water and more ways to get metal over all great game make more
"
22671,"Got the game years ago, messed around in creative, but then lost interest. Now that survival released, though? Holy heck, it's like, one of my new favorite games. Still has some kinks to work out, but wow, deserves the ""Most Improved"" Award 100%"
22672,It gets even better with Survival
22673,"nice game fun to play but it can be very laggy
"
22674,very good
22675,"Scrap Mechanic its a game of creativity and adventure and can be extremely fun to play with friends. Basically you crash in an unknown planet filled with bad robots and some strange creatures and must use your imagination and knowledge to build your own transport systems, vehicles, defences and home to survive.

The game features a very insteresting way of creating objects moving parts, and logic, and has a cool atmosphere and artstyle.

As is, the game still needs a lot of work and feels a little unfinished, there are some things that leave a lot to be desired for example:

  - Physics needs correction and are very inconsistent;

  - The game misses some optimization and has some multiplayer bugs and glitches;

  - Weight and buoyancy values, crafting/upgrading and survival mechanics are very unbalanced and poorly planned;

  - The world feels empty because of the lack of creatures and robots variety, and repetitive structures;

  - A lot of content from creative mode(parts (crafting) and blocks) is missing in survival and physics are different in the two modes that can difficult prototyping.


I hope the developers correct these problems and drawbacks as soon as possible, and continue to add new content to this game.

I will still be playing because is still a very fun game to play and I recommend to everyone who likes creating stuff and exploring with some friends."
22676,"I dont often say this about a newer EA game....and I know this has been out for a while but holy shit... this game... is amazing. The good stuff is locked behind the requirement of needing a brain but its there. The survival is a tad brutal and needs work... allot of work but the bones are there. The meat is there now axolt give it the potatoes and you have a cash cow here. 

Well done you have briefly restored my faith in EA games... this once."
22677,fun small game
22678,"very much impressed with this game. I'm looking forward to seeing how the development for survival progresses. i feel like the game could benefit greatly if it had a way to run engines, bearings and other parts while on a lift. maybe a way to toggle individual parts of a creation while locked on a lift. [when something is on a lift, physics are disabled] the dance of placing and lifting to fine tune your creation is a bit irritating, but not to an extent that it affects the game too much. i just feel like a quality of life improvement would serve us well. also, devs. we need cogs. like properly modeled and coded cogs. mods solve this issue, yes, bu cogs should really be something in the vanilla item list, given the whole premise of scrap mechanic"
22679,The perfect creating survival game
22680,really good game
22681,"You want an engaging chill game, well you can all ways get Scrap Mechanic. In Scrap Mechanic, you can make vehicles, elevators, farms, and more. You can either play a chill game of Scrap Mechanic in creative or fight for your life in survival, I have already wasted 88 hours of my life, but don't take it from me just look at the 19,500 positive reviews. For 20.00 dollars it's a great game to buy and it's in beta so there are still updates coming so buy it if you want I'm not you so I can't force you to do anything I'm just saying."

22686,"would recommend. Look up some beginner guidelines and tips, but the whole fun of it is to figure things out yourself"
22687,"Great game, There is so much to do and still adding more features"

22689,COOL GAME CAN BUILD AWESOME STUFF
22690,"-_-

22691,"This is a good game, however there are still many bugs to be resolved. Now that survival is out it can be adictive to play. 

Survival is action-packed and really fun, not when a boss attacks for farm tho. lol"
22692,p gud game poggers
22693,Still clearly in development for most of survival but definitly fun!
22694,Like the game very much except there is no world map. That's kinda a huge no no with something like this. It's far too easy to get lost and then frustrated.
22695,Love this game
22696,The survival mode is damn fun. Early game survival tip: give cows corn. You're welcome.
22697,"Looking for a game that allows you to be creative in every way? Well too bad that doesnt exist, Not like this is basically that"
22698,"Incredibly fun with tons of content to mess around with. Honestly spent 10 hours just making cool cars and I'm still not bored yet. Really enjoyable with friends, making crazy contraptions and then fighting with them. So good and is 100% a buy if you enjoy games like Minecraft or Space Engineers."
22699,"Instantly fell in love with this game. The crafting/construction is very deep, though quite a steep learning curve. Once you master the basics, your inner creative comes out, and you start to build ridiculous looking machines, and spending allot of time working out efficiencies. The in game help is also very easy to understand and is good at getting you started. Everything else is up to you to discover, which appealed to me, but could see how some people would be put off without the hand-holding you usually get in these kind of games. 

With Scrap Mechanic, Google and YouTube are your friends."
22700,verry good

22707,great mechanics for a builder/survival game
22708,"I bought the game on the day that survival mode was released and it's pretty good.

The grind is not terrible, however if you do not already understand how the game operates and how items are obtained, the grind may turn you away from playing if you're not committed to learning the game yourself as there's no tutorial.

It was fun for a few days and I learned a little bit about ""mechanics"" and how pistons/engines function on a basic level. After a certain point, you'll find that you've built yourself an empire and have made efficient systems for collecting resources like water, food, and electronic parts, etc. But there's nothing beyond that right now. It's early access, so that's easily overlooked.

Here's to hoping there will be multiplayer soon and that the developers continue to listen to their somewhat small, but dedicated and constructive community. Axolot is an impressive team of devs."
22709,Coop lags the fuck out. Ples fix
22710,amazing game but i get kicked out at random times
22711,love the game its verry fun
22712,goood
22713,"Creative is okay, but survival is where the game stands out from all those other crafting / building games. It is soooooo much fun, despite it being rough around the edges in the current state. There¬¥s some grinding, but i have literally never before had such satisfaction from progression / comming up with efficient solutions to problems in a game. The variety of ways to master challenges is huge ! Definitely recommended if you always thought games of the genre should give you something to do with your creations."
22714,Trash servers.
22715,"I started playing Survival blind with a friend and within two hours we had built a hookuly-bookuly-mobile with no less than 3 bright signs that say ""FRESH"", underglow, a radio, two antennae, an external A/C unit in the front AND back of the vehicle, a milk vending machine,  a cash register, and an awning reminiscent of the Flinstones. This thing sputters to life like trying to pour hot peanut butter through a vacuum hose and does a wheelie EVERY time it takes off that, two out of three times, you won't be able to recover from without putting it on a lift. I've been gradually slapping every item I want to keep onto the side of the Fortress of Fresh. Absolutely incredible experience."
22716,One of the best games i played!!
22717,"It's just a good game with a nice, simple concept. Also survival is just absolutely amazing and really fun."
22718,"this game is perfect in every way, aside from unstable multiplayer and small physics issues"
22719,Amazing Game!
22720,"survival is quite fun and addivicive, it is also fun with friends, i haven't had much experince of creative mode yet, one thing i would critisize is survival, there isnt really an end game persay, what i would recomend axolot games do is do something minecraft did an ending that you can do if you want an objective to complete like repairing your spaceship but you can stay on the planet too and contiue playing on the world, the ending would just be something for those who want an End goal in mind"
22721,good
22722,"Absolutely love this game, couldn't recommend enough.  Haven't childishly enjoyed a game like I'm enjoying this in years.  
>devs please add stuff for powering boats in survival uwu"
22723,good game survival just came out
22724,Fix multiplayer please
22725,good game after the update
22726,Fun
22727,very fun solo survival game i got it on a sale but 20$ would be worth it.
22728,Amazing game!
22729,Im in love
22730,This game is really fun and i like that they added a survival mode
22731,"owned this game for a while, the new survival update is awesome. Truly recommended!"
22732,Amazing games endless hours of playing and very relaxing to play. id buy this game over and over and over
22733,"Great game, stability in multiplayer needs work. Wish the mod items for creative mode worked with survival. Survival needs more love, big patch on the way... at some point."
22734,FUN
22735,"Amazing Game especially with survival, i am impressed with the improvements. Just that there is a ton of lag/ glitching playing with others on survival."
22736,idk it is fun
22737,its really good and fun
22738,It is an incredible game with minor bugs
22739, its fun
22740,LOVE IT SO MUCH FUN!!!!
22741,"This game is tons of fun! I have only played it a short time as of writing, but the amazing variety of things you can create is awesome and I hope this game will continue to expand. Awesome sandbox game"
22742,tons of fun!!
22743,its FUN you can run wild
22744,"I bought this game expecting it to be a fun building game but i cant get past the very first vehicle, i find the controls to be incredibly hard to get a handle on. I hope i'm missing something and this game is actually worth the $30 at the time. The controls need to be overhauled, building and controlling vehicles needs to be more user friendly. A tutorial would also be very useful so i actually know how to do anything at all without having to pull up a 20 page in built wiki which itself is not easy to follow and feels clunky."
22745,"This game

Kinda epic"
22746,THEY GOT A BETTER ENGINE AT LAST (Survival is also great)
22747,i love gaming like this with these modes
22748,They added way points & beacons so my new rating is 9/10!  Great game!!
22749,".
"
22750,nice game!
22751,ive had over 1000 hours on sm and it always fun
22752,:)
22753,"I've been watching for years, but I waited until Survival came out to buy Scrap Mechanic and I am really happy with my purchase.

What you can build is almost limitless. It can be super frustrating at times until you get an idea of how things work....Or you watch some guides on youtube, which there are plenty and very helpful.
I spend hours just building random vehicles and contraptions in survival, to the point where I feel like I don't actually do much of the 'survival' part of the game, which is perfectly fine.

The survival side of things definitely has it's issue, but this is also their first public test of Survival, something they've been working on for a long time.
Even with the issues it's still great fun.

Just remember when you go into this that it is still very much so a work in progress...But there is still a lot of content to keep you happy.

Couple things I feel like need to be looked at a bit more:

(This is fairly common with the community) I'm happy with the Fuel consumption, I feel like it's fair...But what I hate is the process of getting oil to make the fuel. I would have to assume the devs are going to add something in that will either automate or make the current system better.
The same thing can be said about batteries.

Water Physics I hope get a bit more attention. Currently there is Buoyancy which is great...But that's it for the physics. So, yes you can make a raft with thrusters which works fine...Making a rudder or paddle system on the other hand doesn't work as there is no propulsion system for that in the water.
Same thing can be said about wind/lift.


I can't wait to see what future updates bring..This is an amazing base for survival which already has some good content, so the future is looking great so far."
22754,scrap mechanic has overall been a great game from the start and is pretty much endless fun if you can think of enough things to build...the new addition of survival mode has added a whole new layer of fun to the game when you run out of ideas to build. Overall i give this game a 10/10
22755,yes yes yep
22756,"Great Game
"
22757,Been having a blast. So many ways to build just about anything you can come up with in your mind and then add in survival on top of that... big thumbs up. Still some early game bugs but nothing too serious and seems to get updated frequently.
22758,"greta game love te addition of survival, now just waiting for it to come to console"
22759,"This is an amazing gem of a game, Wow factor off the charts and way underpriced. So much better than any AAA title out right now. I'm in awe of how much stuff is packed into this small indie title. Highly recommended if you like unlimited building opportunities and endless fun. I would call it Minecraft x 10, Survival mode is absolutely just one more minute fun!"
22760,looking forward to seeing survival mode grow like satisfactory is
22761,"It's fun with a friend, it has major issues, bugs, incomplete features.
This is a game dev that really seems to be putting the cart before the horse. 
Potential is there, but I can't recommend someone to spend their hard earned cash on this yet. Not unless they get this game closer to something that makes sense, and has, you know, fully functional basic features, like UI menus in crafting stations."
22762,Awesome game
22763,"this is a fun sandbox game, and has lots of opportunities, the mods give extra opportunities. plus, the workshop has amazing."
22764,"While it's frame rate can be an issue, I'd recommend this game as it is a very unique experience compared to other sandbox titles out there like minecraft, gmod, roblox, etc.
"
22765,LOVE IT
22766,Scrap Mechanic has some really cool physics and with the addition of survival the game has just even better!
22767,"Game is amazing, takes a bit to learn how things work but WOW the amount of fun is endless. I just purchased it 5 days ago and already put in 78 hours... wow..."
22768,its so fun you can make so cool stuff
22769,its super fun and creative
22770,Scrap Mechanic Survival is a wonderful survival game. I am thrilled by this release and look forward to the continued development!
22771,E
22772,amazing
22773,is good
22774,"Okay i have not played a lot of this game so far and only got the game with the release of the Survival update.
I received the  game as a gift and did not buy it myself. with meaningless points out of the way let's get to my thoughts on the game, Development teams and any issue a new player might have. Please note the game is in early access so i will be forgiving a lot of things i would otherwise consider issues. 

To start off my review I will be talking about my thoughts on development of the game and the teams behind it. So The game from what i have been told has been almost completely revamped and most textures being revamped. The team sends out minor updates that constantly fix any bugs reported. I have encountered several bugs myself, and before i could send a bug report it would be fixed in an update after exiting the game. The team works on updating and solving issues, balancing everything in the game. They pay attention to the community and care about different issues in the game regardless of how small the bug may be. 

When i first loaded up the game i entered Survival mode off the bat to see what the core game would be like and how it teaches a new player. I was surprised by the spawn, a burning ship, boxes all over, fire and a lake. The game takes no time to show something is wrong in your situation. A player with intuition puts the firs out and sees the basic farm guide given. What they do not tell you or warn you about is that if you plant  and farm too much you will be raided by different robots for unauthorized farming. The game doesn't hold your hand but rather forces you to screw up to learn, something I enjoy personally. The gameplay after has you infer things and often makes you wonder if you have enough materials. Spoiler: you never will have enough. Everything I've encountered so far has had a purpose, something also enjoyable. Destroyed buildings contain robots, loot boxes and sometimes contain Master Batteries, used at the ship from the start and Stations to get better friendly bots.

Now i won't pretend the game is a godsend, it has its issues although i am being far more forgiving as i said due to Devs constantly updating issues in the game. Now if you plan to do things in creative you can't access survival bots and few other things. Want to plan a vehicle in survival to have resource collectors on the back? you can't. The game also lags incredibly when two vehicles collide or interact with each other. The multiplayer lags just with having people in the world, while not unbearable it can be a little annoying at times. While in the creative mode some vehicles will make other people lag or spawning larger more complex vehicles can almost make the game crash. I could list a few other issues but by the time i post this it will most likely be fixed. 

Now reviewing this game has been hard due to me having only 38 hours at the release of this post, but I find that the game has a lot of good with very little bad. I find the game has some of the best development teams I've ever seen, only due to the constant support of the community and updates constantly fixing any issues. They also have amazing mod support in game. I find the game a very solid 7.5/10. It has issues and they will most likely be fixed by full release.  

"
22775,"Save your money until the full game comes out.
The game's current state is a frustrating chore."
22776,Amazing game!
22777,"learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it is then super addictive!"
22778,great new game play and loads of entertainment.
22779,has good physics
22780,amazing game and whould totaly tell you to splurge a couple bucks and get it with the addition of survival it is even more worth it
22781,Easily The Game of the Year
22782,"The design was nice but I didn't find the gameplay fun. Others may like it, but it's not for me."
22783,ye
22784,"I like the creativity of the game
"
22785,i love the new survival mode its fun to play with friends
22786,"The game does have potential, HOWEVER, at the current state of survival, I cannot fully recommend it, as it has A LOT of bugs, some of which seem to be fixed with these quick updates but a lot of the game could use refinement and some tooltips or tutorials to explain certain parts of the game."
22787,very good game
22788,great game. could use a no clip ability to catch run away flying creations.
22789,"good fun, nut can be complicvated
"
22790,"It is just a really good game... for survival. think of rust but with amazing building capabilities.
For creative, you can build everything you can think of. If you enjoy minecraft,ksp, space engineer or anything of that nature you will not regret buying this.

- BlueMischief approved"
22791,Lots of fun if you like building things with little instruction and a lot of mysteries.
22792,Awesome Game i love it. 10/10
22793,"Scrap Mechanic is a well-developed game; dating back since before I started doing game development myself. In fact, these guys were one of my inspirations for me to make games!

The newly-added survival mode has added more than 15 hours of playtime within the past day. Their hardwork of 4 years has most definitely paid off and I could not be more proud of the product they have created!

If you're wanting to play a survival game made for technical-minded individuals, this is going to be their paradise (LOGIC GATES INTENSIFY). I would highly recommend this to those who aren't technically-minded just as much!"
22794,"very gud now it has survival
"
22795,it is very acictive
22796,"Great game so far with quite a bit to do, it has a lot of potential."
22797,"Don't get why this game and its survival mode is so hyped.
It has barely any content, is EXTREM grind heavy and looks and feels like a incomplete copy of muliple other games like i.e. fortnite.

Want to know more about why you SHOULD NOT BUY THIS 15% FINISHED GAME ?
- Graphics are too kiddy imo
- Boring grinding 86% of your playtime (FUN?!)
- Crafting is SUPER SLOW (up to minutes to build single parts, and you have to wait for it to finish)
- Can only craft at 1 or 2 locations in the world
- NO Story, not a single piece of lore, you just spawn in the world and thats it
- No goal to be achieved, and no real ""survival"". As long as you plant only 8 Plants, NO ENEMYS WILL ATTACK AT ALL, so where is the difficulty? It's just boring and that's it.
- No inventory sorting
- No compass or map
- repetetive environment
- ....

I think i mentioned enough, but  there is much more. And as for the creative mode.... you can build a car, that's it. 
No planes, helicopters, ...
It's fun to play around for about 30 minutes, then you have seen everything there is and deinstall it.

Sorry Devs, usually i don't want refunds or write negative reviews, but this needs to be said.

Thanks for reading.

"
22798,like death
22799,"TL/DR: A few problems but I'm loving Survival mode and I can't wait for more updates.
I originally got this to play with my kids. When I first got it the creative mode was a reasonably fun and deep sandbox toy for making machines with blocks. The lack of gameplay progrssion, wonky physics and godawful network code was to be expected in an alpha build but it also meant that it didn't hold my interest for long. We came back a few times to play challenge modes and mods and there was definitely some incremental improvement. My oldest son kept talking about a future Survival mode but I didn't expect much. I've seen too many games like this left to rot by developers who lost momentum. Well to my surprise and unexpected delight the beta build of Survival mode has finally arrived. I've been hooked this week. So far I'm fairly impressed. Survival mode is simple but fun and even 30+ hours in I can see plenty of future progression. It feels a little grindy after a while but there is a good sense of progression. Most exciting is that I can now see a purpose to making machines and I'm having a lot of fun with the tools, imagining things I can build to ease that grind. Unfortunately I still can't recommend the multiplayer. My son and I have been slogging through it but constant lag and desyncs make it difficult. The promise of sharing a vehicle and playing cooperatively just isn't there yet. Single player has been pretty bug free though. There are tons of room for improvement and the developers have been patching the game often. I see regular improvement even in little things. It is a fairly minor thing, but I really hated Cookbot. I was so excited to build it and have more cooking options but the few options provided are way too expensive for what you get. If only it had a simple meat and potato option or the ability to make sun shakes I would have been happy. Oh well maybe the devs will make it useful and not disappointing some day."
22800,good
22801,great they it good there is a few glitchs in surval
22802,"The game is very good  , Needs Dedicated servers to make MP  better .
The good :
Lots of features for an early access ,game .
lots of fun to play.
The bad:
Lags at times in MP.
No Dedicated server yet.
IMO, Farming can only be done on the ground .
IMo, balancing is off you take to much damage and you should deal more."
22803,this is an amazing game and almost no violence free {except for survival
22804,"I already really liked this game, but the new survival update just added another level. It added so much more. stuff - There's more story, more gamemodes, more blocks, more everything.

Love the game."
22805,it been my most play game and i have 30 game and ever sence the survival update its my fav
22806,Simple mechanisms allow you to design to your hearts content! I spent three full days making a big green tractor to plop around my farm!
22807,Amazing graphics but I had some lag spikes. It was overall a good survival update. The only thing that is a difficult aspect is the farming and having to eat almost every 15 seconds. I'm glad that I got this game and I hope that it keeps improving. The creators are doing some amazing work and I hope to see it improve even more!
22808,"it good yah :D
"
22809,an EPIC GAME
22810,Game is very fun and is great in multiplayer as well as survival not many bugs and it super fun!
22811,"This game wants to set my graphics card on fire. My first computer's graphics card blew up and caught on fire before while playing Witcher 3. So hearing the fans go crazy and it starting to emit heat makes me shut down the game in fear of that happening again...







Besides that, I've played it a good 7 hours and it's a pretty good sandbox game."
22812,the game isn't optimized and even my 2070 super strugels sometimes but it's a good game (still some work to do on the camera and on the resource management and it would be cool to add some things to take the building posibilites more varied)
22813,great game to play with friends and family
22814,Skam good
22815,"What an incredible game.. Saw it a year or two ago and had it wishlisted. Finally got the alert when survival came out and it was onsale. What an amazing buy, put in almost 2 days worth of time so far and loving it. Straight survival, havent even messed with creative yet.. ^_^ cant wait to see how many more amazing things will come from this game. Oh and did I mention the devs are doing daily updates!!"
22816,"Great game, single player or with a friend. Totally fun, safe for kids, climb mountains on the toilet ! 

"
22817,it is cool
22818,"Great game, amazing mechanics"
22819,DAMN SURVIVAL BUY. DONT HESETAIT BEST GAME NOW...

22821,it guuuuuuuuuud
22822,"Play start to finish without stopping, the game gets boring if you get bored."
22823,Great survival game with some serious fun with friends
22824,yeah its good new update yay
22825,+659112
22826,the game is fun but it is really laggy
22827,very fun i am not far into survival mode but its great so far in creative mode there is so much you can do with the tools so if you have the money i highly reccomend buying this
22828,"Real nice
"
22829,Its a really fun game and the only thing that I dont really like is how component kits are kinda hard to find
22830,it's really fun. i can't wait to see what the future holds! really enjoying the survival mode.
22831,it is a great game
22832,This is the best game ever
22833,"easily 88hrs in a week this quarantine with 2 of my friends.

this game is still at EARLY ACCESS and shows so much potential and room for improvements ahead. expect lots of bugs and crashes, and survival game imbalance, but that's all part of playing a beta game (v.40) so stop whining and complaining and expecting a full game experience just yet."
22834,v
22835,"Honestly it is very fun and perfect to play with friends, if you have any unlike me ;-;"
22836,awrtg4e
22837,yes
22838,The addition of Survival mode took this already great contraption builder and created a truly awesome experience. If you love building crazy functional machines and automations in a clean survival format this is a must play. Devs have been quick on fixes and have more great stuff planned.
22839,Fun with friends. If i had any
22840,very nice game
22841,THIS GAME IS SO FUN!!!!!!!
22842,good game
22843,Very good game
22844,"With survival now out, the game is BEAUTIFUL! I Feel so good that this was the first game that I bought. Ive had this game since like 2016 it feels. I Totaly recommend this to people who like survival games, and freeroam games."
22845,its fun
22846,THIS GAME IS JUST ABSOLUTLY TERRIBEL
22847,"I'm not a big survival game fan but this game gets me hook after 5 minutes. The cartoonish art, sound effect and amazing building system. With friends it's really fun.

"
22848,I'm not good at writing reviews but the game is good and you can spend many hours just messing around with each of it's special game mechanics.
22849,gud
22850,"This game was amazing when it was only cretive, now that we've got survival its become something even more impressing! I get that some people think that the farming and survival aspect is very repetitive and I hope that future updates will make it more entartaining for otehr people. Overall, this is one of the best survival-creative games that are out there, might I dare say its getting close to being Minecraft 2."
22851,Great game gives you the feel of playing MC or Ark for the first times
22852,it was good
22853,i loved the sandbox theme
22854,"after the update. I find the menu, inventory in creative and interactive bits worse. For example logic gates. Before you could see wat everything did. or has to have one or both inputs to go on. and has to have both inputs to go on. I really hoped that the would learn and test more for beginners because its a lot harder than it was. these things make scrap mechanic scrap mechanic. you build things that do stuff. That's why interactive parts are in the game. please just return it. gamemodes are lovely but for beginners. Terrible, just terrible. There are also a lot of bugs because al lot of creations don't work anymore. character options are poor. torso, legs and shoes are don't have them or have the standerd option."
22855,good
22856,It is great
22857,potatos fly  10/10

22862,me likey
22863,laggy but fun co-op
22864,"Space Engineers meets survival, game has great potential. If you havn't bought it put it on your wish list!"
22865,A great and enjoyable game (besides the glitches).
22866,It's realy fun and creative
22867,please come out for apple please
22868,"IT food
"
22869,amaizing
22870,old good game
22871,"its been 4 years waiting for the survival update. it's not bad but too grindy for the single player experience 24 hours in and I feel like I have nothing. There is no map of any sort. the combat is clunky and buggy. I don't really see the point in setting up a base the game seems to want you to keep moving but it takes so much fuel to do anything. At this point I would not recommend sadly. Ill come back in a few months and see how it is again. I have high hopes and the devs have done well but they sure are taking their time.

** update**

after waiting a few weeks I can say the game as improved a bit but it is still a pain to gather oil and glue clams."
22872,"MAkes your rusty cogs spinn.
Does feel empty tho"
22873,bruh moment good game
22874,Fun game

edit. ive had this game for about 2 years now i DONT regret this."
22878,THIS GAME IS VERY WELL MADE
22879,The survival is awesome but kinda glitchy as it just came out.
22880,down thumb
22881,"This game is if minecraft had a child with terraria and this was the baby, but the baby was also cocaine because this is addicting to play. If you don't like how the game is played, then its super eazy to mod and play your own way!"
22882,its good theres no voilence id say its suitable for all:) have fun.
22883,"ITS AMAZING
"
22884,"Its worth a buy

22885,Amazing game. Especially now that Survival is released. The survival has definitely surpassed all my expectations for that update.

Under controller configuration and then community and then use mister griimm layout pattern which I want to say thank you to that personI just had to change one button and that was the select button to f"
22900,"Always been interested in the concept of this game, the survival mode finally gave me the incentive to try it and it's great.

That game got so much potential. At the moment there's still some technical issues but nothing that completly ruin the experience and the survival content, as in the point of interests and different enemies, is a bit bare but depending on where the devs go from here it could become so much more.

Been enjoying playing that game a lot and can't wait to see how it evolve in the future"
22901,<3
22902,Good game but survival mode makes it GREAT
22903,Minecraft v2.0

22924,"PLEASE OPTIMIZE MORE SOMEHOW!!!! /////////// okay so ive had this game for a long while and creative was quite fun, you could build just about anything youre mind would let you... ive recently came back to the game and put like 40 hours in in the past 4 days trying out the new survival mode and it is a very addicting experience the feeling of progression is way more than the feeling i get from minecraft these days. the only issue i have and it has been an issue for as long as this game has existed is that you are limited, you can never be overly ambitious with this game, in my old creative days you could build roughly 5 well sized vehicles before your game drops to 5 fps... ive been playing for 40 hours roughly and i have a nice base and a few vehicles and the game runs decent but during midnight when i get raided by robots i drop to about 5-10 frames per second and im running an amazing cpu with a pretty good gpu and 16gb ram, the game has always had this issue and i do not see it getting any better sadly, i highly recomend you get the game as it is super fun and even better with friends! but dont think after 5 months of being addicted that you will have what you can achieve in minecraft, dont get too ambitious"
22925,"I love this game and have ever since I got it, and now it has survival which makes it even better."
22926,nice
22927,It is fun
22928,this game could of been so great with some basic balencing for survival
22929,Yaass slaayy v√§ruy nasjjsjsjsssssss
22930,"One of the best games out there, even before they released survival this game was amazing but now with survival this game has become 10x better its a little grindy but other than that its amazing"
22931,yeh
22932,"Has quite a few bugs, but is still such a magnificent game with beautiful design and fun and interactive gameplay that I really don't care! I has a fun and encouraging community and great developers! This game really lets you express your creativity whether by having unlimited resources and fuel in Creative Mode, or the paying in the new resource/grinding intensive Survival Mode. It is soo fun to play and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival, physics, sandbox, or multiplayer friendly games!"
22933,"play
nuf said"
22934,"big goood]

22935,"Good game, i still have a lot to learn, in terms on both how many parts work, and making my designs not look like a knock off lego car, but can't wait to create mu new ideas


also floor gang approved"
22936,great game althogh the survival can be a bit of a pain when in the first stages of it its still an amazing game and ive played it a lot!!!!!!!!
22937,it is an amazing game and I enjoy every second of it
22938,"Played this back when I was young. Kinda liked it?
Would explain the long playtime. But now that the game has survival I am just confused? 
So many things you can't actually do and blocks and items that aren't in survival but in creative.
I don't really know what i liked this game for but now that I came back to it it made me realise that it is not really the game I expected it to be."
22939,Great game on STEAM just wish I could use my Xbox controller.
22940,it smelled good.
22941,Very nice although I am not that good of a mechanic!
22942,"This game needs a tutorial, a compass or map, but otherwise is amazing!"
22943,Review for steam
22944,"a very fun complicated and beutifull game and despite having some great graphics it runs so smoothly on my computer
"
22945,it has survival and creative and is fun playing with people
22946,very cool especially with survival

22960,scpar
22961,i like it!
22962,Very yes cant wait for new updates and fixes but this game is already amazing. if devs read this plz focus on the multiplayer experience.
22963,"             I think that Axolot has been super unnecessarily quiet for the past year or so when it comes to news. But now I see that Survival would only be this fun ha they kept quiet. Now that Survival mode is out, Axolot has been pretty good about posting patch notes. Great work on Survival Axolot, it's awesome. The materials needed for anything is very balanced and reasonable. All of the materials make sense too. It's not like you need corn to make a wheel or anything. 

             Some suggestions are to make the game easier to run for slower computers and add more roads... I wish there were more roads. Also I want to see more spud guns. Three is a good start but we need more to make the characters unique and have their abilities stand out. Another cool weapon would be grenades that are popcorn bags that explode with popcorn or something. That would be cool. Also an underwater enemy would be super cool. Like a bot that used to collect oil. I don't know.

             I love Scrap Mechanic and hope that it will continue to completely blow our minds. Great work Axolot!

10/10"
22964,"if you enjoyed games like minecraft, an open free roaming world where anything is possible then i highly recommend this one !!"
22965,Love this game. I would only like to see a way to dispose of unwanted items other than just dropping them and waiting for them to despawn. Really messes with my OCD. But other than this Really awesome game as a whole.
22966,mmmmgod like
22967,game
22968,Survival needs updates but it's only a week old. Creative is fun. Can't wait for more updates.

"
22989,yaaaaaaaaassssssss
22990,"fun
"
22991,"This game is extremely fun in both modes as it is right now. There are some quality of life things that can be added in updates but being in beta it is a pretty finished game. A few minor glitches here and there, nothing too game breaking though. Being as fun as it is in beta this game has the potential to be something great."
22992,"With survival mode finally here this is worth playing.  It has the best vehicle building engine i have seen.  The interface is slicker than Space Engineer for vehicle building.   If you are trying to get components the game can get way more than a bit grindy. But that's ok!  With a decent vehicle build or 10 every piece of this is fun.  

Love the game.  Survival mode is truly a blast.

Hate the physics engine.  It is perfectly acceptable for survival mode.  You can just turn the engine power down to where your vehicle works fine and isnt a buggy pos and its great.  except for the suspention wheel glitch.  that fubars absolutely everything larger than a couple blocks large.

Challenge mode.....   get rid of the timer devs.  Your engine isnt ready for time trials yet.  If you try to push for performance on your vehicles the physics engine breaks hard to the point that challenge levels break down to finishing the build of the vehicle and then doing a thousand runs to see if it randomly bounces correctly this time with exactly the same button inputs. Steering is usually completely optional because the control gets THAT BAD with a high performance vehicle.  If you are ok with 25-30 secs for completion its fine and relaxing and fun.  I have 1.85 seconds completion time on level 1 as an example.  Turns out is really frustrating to attempt time trials in this game.

I tested it thoroughly.  I used a macro of me successfully running a level in challenge mode.  The start was a unchanging fixed position.  the macro was an unchanging fixed macro.  the results were random garbage.  Just holding forward from EXACTLY the same start position causes the vehicle to turn hard left OR hard right  OR flip wildly OR yeet itself off into the distance OR randomly win.  The physics engine is RANDOMIZED and contains massive addition of forces to the vehicle that have nothing to do with actual physics.

Fun fact:  you can arbitrarily dial in how elastic your tires collisions are based off your engine power level.  The engines introduce enough magic ""torque"" that should your vehicle end up lofted into the sky you can reorient it midair with your throttle."
22993,The new Survival Mode is fantastic. Its like Minecraft but you can build your own cars!
22994,"this game has some amazing building mechanics, literally make creations as good as you are smart.,
only one thing that bothers me in this survival game is that you cannot drink water , cant eat corn or meat. players must farm vegetables and fruit to eat and gotta make cows eat corn for milk ... i die constantly but have food and water all around me that i cant eat. basically forces you to have to be raided by bots constantly"
22995,good but i have bad pc so rip
22996,because it is fun
22997,"Its overall a pretty fun game especially with survival mods it is kinda like Minecraft but more ""mechanical"" If you got the money you should get it. :)"
22998,Modern Minecraft 9/10
22999,Game Do NOW!
23000,great game
23001,epic
23002,super fun game but you need a good pc to run it smoothly
23003,it is the very many good
23004,"Scrap Mechanic has always been an interesting game even before the survival update. It presents a sandbox which lets players test the limits of their imagination and create contraptions and vehicles of unfathomable proportions. (Or well, unfathomable within the limits of your Hardware in most cases)

Survival However, has been a breath of fresh air that really revitalized the game after several years of waiting. Survival mode at the moment has almost no hand-holding or tutorials other than a handful of in-game signs. To some people, this aimless ""being thrown into a river"" is rather jarring, but for others this presence of trial and error, and freedom to open interpretation is perfect. The amount of content present in survival actually surprised me and surpassed my expectations with the generous content delivered (Namely Massive, randomly generated worlds, a decent combat system, a newly implemented water system, etc). Despite all the bugs present in the current build of the game, and the arguably irritating endeavor it can be at times, Survival is an astoundingly fun experience made even better(?) by multiplayer.

On the said topic of multiplayer... it works... Mostly... Starting in a fresh world with a handful of friends will likely generate no problems and the experience will probably be relatively smooth for all clients; however as you progress and attempt to build larger and larger constructs the latency may become unbearable for continued play. This is especially so if you attempt to build contraptions that, ""screw with physics too much"".

Anyways, It's a good game made better by the Survival Update, and with a little duct tape and some time will probably get even better."
23005,other than the fact that this game is kinda laggy when playing with friends its one of the best games ive played in my life
23006,fun game
23007,"Great game.  It has the best survival game play loop I've ever experienced, and I love the building system.  My only gripes:

1.  Not having a compass or mini map makes getting lost frustrating, but perhaps it was intended to make the mode more challenging.

2.  Some of the materials required to make things are a tiny thumbnail with no description, forcing the player to google or ask on forums to find out what they are.  For instance, the glass block appears as a dark black cube for some material requirements while it shows as a greenish color in the block list, making a visual match impossible for the uninformed player.  And when making your first seat, cotton is required, but the odd looking icon for it has no explanation to indicate that it is cotton.

3.  My internet went down the other day, and I found that the game absolutely will not let you play single player without an internet connection."
23008,survival is fun wish there were gears and some sort of car build saving in survival
23009,fun
23010,This game is very addicting so I would recommend it to someone that wants a time consumer or to anyone that even thinks this game looks interesting. 36 hours in and I still feel like I just started this game there is so much to do and there is definitely more to come and I am very excited for the future of this game.
23011,"Loads of fun.  A cute and amusing graphical style (sort of kid's cartoons meets World of Warcraft) with amusing creations, animations and enemies.  It's got all the things we love in survival.  Food and water constantly draining, loads of resources to collect, lots of things to craft.  And, like some of the best building games these days, your creations can actually work, with rotors, pistons, switches, logic gates, etc.  And, you really need these creations to solve problems.  

Auto watering your crops makes life easier and more fun.  Defensive traps against the ever angry farmbots.  How the heck are you going to get these caged farmers back home?  Some kind of forklift?  So you've got a lot of crops grown and want a potato gun (trust me, you WANT a potato gun!)?  Well, you'll need a vacuum system to inject them into the packing station and create fruit crates.  But wait, there's more!  How the heck will you get these fruit crates to the vendor?  Guess you need a truck, or trailer, now!  

Seriously, it's loads of fun.  I was really surprised how deep it sucks you in fast.  It's got some issues.  There really could stand to be a lot more you can do, and more enemies to face with varied rewards.  You'll spend a lot of time underwater getting oil and glue clams to fuel your thirsty machines and keep them held together, but, besides swimming around collecting this resource, there's really nothing to do there.  Hope they update that with some shark bots, and underwater gear, and perhaps a way to automate oil gathering.

But, despite minor complaints, honestly, it's smooth, polished, funny and fun as heck!"
23012,it good and epic like fortnite im  9 years old and i approve
23013,is good
23014,"its got great content so far in the new survival mode, and the potential is definitely there. its money well spent"
23015,it good
23016,This is one of the best games i have ever played!
23017,"after they added survival this game has actually been alot funner, me and the boys have been enjoying the grind
"
23018,yes
23019,THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN AND MULTIPLAYER IS AMAZING.
23020,good game
23021,overall a really fun game has some small lag here and there but a game i would recommend to my friends to play
23022,"its an artistic style game that is good for the brain to be creative inside
"
23023,A great game to play with friends and family!
23024,"Despite my inability to create a janky train, the game is a blast on it's own, and that's without playing with friends."
23025,is nice game
23026,"it is good
"
23027,"I change my evaluation to : don't recommand as, the game sold millions of copies, but the studio refused to grow their dev team, there hasn't been a significant update in a year and a half, the survival mod was a great addition but the dev are way too slow at bringing us content, the optimization of the multiplayer is AWFUL, the game is so buggy it's unclear how they can spend that much time bringing more content."
23028,"Obviously this game is still in the beta version, however it has so much potential and has still managed to wow me at times. Great game to kick back on survival and cast away on a journey with you pals. Can't wait for whats to come later."
23029,"everything liked
"
23030,"What an awesome game.. I literally put 40 hours into it in 5 days... I couldn't put it down (still cant). The survival mode is so well done. Challenging and relaxing at the same time. Want to fight endless days of Robots or would you rather build a base with no danger? Well you can have both in this! Its grindy sometimes but building some crazy contraption feels so rewarding. It took me a whole day (IRL) to figure out how to make an automatic water gun system so i can save 10 minutes each i game day, once i turned that thing on and it actually worked it made me feel like a legit mechanic haha. GET IT! I got it on sale but i would 100% pay the full amount! So much to do and survival JUST GOT RELEASED so there probably gonna be adding a whole lot more!
"
23031,very fun theres always stuff you can build
23032,"With a bigger emphasis on building than survival, this is a fun and addictive game. Took me a little while to get the flow of it but I am hooked."
23033,good game
23034,Now that there's survival the game is amazing.
23035,"It's great and has a lot of things to learn. Be careful, it gets extremely confusing but it is a fun game once you get the hang of it."
23036,ths fun
23037,"The thing that makes this game great is what also makes it so frustrating. The frame drops from your vehicle sliding or too many collisions from semi complex joints, makes the game unplayable. If you want to drive basic machines, which is counter to the actual content of the game, then the game isnt bad. If you want to actually build cool stuff, the game says no. Shame because I really like the game."
23038,"This is a clever and quirky farming sim, robot fighting, lego vehicle building survival game. If you like the sound of farming mats, building mad max style mining, shipping vehicles block by block, having to deal with weight distribution and never having quite enough component kits to get your suspension to carry all the weight you're asking of it then this is the game for you."
23039,"[h1] Beware before buying [/h1]

23040,"So much fun, so much to do....so many creations !"
23041,"I love this game, it runs very smoothly even though i have a slow pc."
23042,ok
23043,"we""ve only had this game for a couple of days. The kids love it !!"
23044,beutiful game definitly worth buying!!!
23045,MUST.... PLAY..... MORE........
23046,"When you look at this game, it doesn't really show you what your going to get yourself into. i was expecting something like from the depths, and instead i got one of the most interesting takes on a survival games i've seen. and i love it. buy your friends this and mess around for a few hours. and even if you don't the survival worlds are challenging and rewarding if you can get anything done. 10/10"
23047,Yes
23048,build with dads rusty metal
23049,this game is fun
23050,GOOD GAME. It has a lot of exploring.  Building your first car and other stuff is super satisfying.  I would def recommend if you like explorer building games.
23051,"This is actually the first strand-type game, and it is great."
23052,"Creative mode is good fun, and the new survival mode is something new, that you can't really get elsewhere. Survival is not 100% polished, but me and my friend have about 24 hours on a save at this point and we've had a lot of fun with it."
23053,"I kind of like this game, but the core game play loop has some issues.  
I play survival.
""hold 'e' for 10 seconds"" is not a compelling game play mechanic.
The doom timer on your farm does not feel good.  You have to choose between doing something active away from base and risking getting home late to find your crops getting wrecked, or sitting around at your farm waiting for the wrecking bots to show up at the predicted time.
Also, the articulation seems pretty clumsy.  I may be unfamiliar with the full capabilities of the control blocks, but it seems like pistons and pivots are missing options that are standard in any real-life backhoe."
23054,This Game is fun worth the money.
23055,BEST GAME EVER!
23056,Its just an awesome game there is nothing not cool about this game
23057,good
23058,"get it play it it's refreshing
"
23059,"I just spent 40 minutes looking for bearings. Bearings are the corner stone of this game. You cant really build anything without them. You cannot make them yourself (or anything for that matter it seems), at least not with any starting equipment. So I refunded before my hour was up. I also saw NO co-op mode or options anywhere. I might try again when there is an actual survival mode. But for now my money is going somewhere else. Will put it back on my wish list though...

PS: Needs a bald option for characters ;)

Edit: To be clear, I am certain the game is pretty good once you figure things out. But if I am forced to google everything other than how to use AWSD I don't think the game is ready for me yet. I have 30+ years of gaming experience and all my previous knowledge accounted for apparently not much. This isn't a bad thing per say. But when i only have 100 min to test out the game and the only hints I get are the obvious and not very useful ones, bearings rotate.... Frustration tends to set in and I refund. Will give this another shot with summer sale. Cause it does look promising."
23060,dis gaem nice
23061,"HONESTLY .. i am annoyed at this game .. due to the lack of map or crafting system. I can't seem to figure out how to craft or find any of the parts i need. i spent most of the game exploring and collecting ingredients .. .. just to have my inventory full and have no idea how to craft any of the items that i picked up. I couldn't find a bed or find any of the components to make a car. there is no storage container.. .. the crafting system needs a big redo in my opinion. wish i could get my money back honestly! I am a very fluent mine craft and sandbox player .. so skill is not the issue. You should at least be able to have the basic crafting in a UI  from the beggining .. for things like the bed , and a storage container .. to put stuff in."
23062,I like every thing about this game.
23063,Good game
23064,Good gaem
23065,"I love Scrap Mechanic, it is a fun and exciting game that challenges your mind"
23066,"The game is extremely entertaining and gives you a lot of room to build, craft, explore, and create. Great value for great price.

That said, the game DESPERATELY needs a better tutorial and needs a single player level difficulty. The tutorial as it stands is basically 8 pages telling you the same thing, the wiki is minimally helpful, and I don't have hours to sit through youtube videos. It is also very grindy, with minimal direction. Lots of potential that could be fixed with: cheaper recipes, respawning materials, better automation, tutorials that actually explain how things work and what you're supposed to do, and several SEVERAL SEEEVERAL bug fixes."
23067,"Best survival game ever made, next to minecraft :)"
23068,"if you want to play singleplayer then the game is great but if you want to play multiplayer the game is just terrible,until they fix the multiplayer issues you are not going to find multiplayer fun at all"
23069,ooga boooga
23070,its fun
23071,Has an very fun creative mode. Fun to play with friends.
23072,...
23073,ITS FUN
23074,iTS FUN
23075,good game missing a little something but still fun to play
23076,Very much¬§
23077,This game is so much fun. The limit is your imagination.
23078,"So i don't write many reviews but here goes :)

I was looking for a game that i can jump into and relax, running around a world and exploring and building, this was on sale and seen survival mode and thought this sounds fun! best money iv spent! having lots of fun and love the little snippets of music that come in every now and again, it kinda reminds me of a toned down Kerbal Space platform mixed with a on a land version of Raft with more options.

I'm only 4 hours in and plan to play many more with my partner and am looking forward to the new and exciting things to build!"
23079,it very fun to play but i very bad at it
23080,Awsome game and can't wait to check out the new update!
23081,it is a good game
23082,"The game is very good, but one caveat is the painful update times."
23083,this game is so fun
23084,"gud
"
23085,Its a fun game i would recommend it.
23086,FUN WHIT FRIEND
23087,It GOOD
23088,great game it has come far from when it was primarilly creative world it now has a world generator for its survival mode over all the game is amazing yes it does need some ironing out but i recommend it
23089,great game would reccommend with great price!!!!
23090,"The first time I played this game, I put 23 hours into it.  Version 0.42.  This game is awesome, and with it being this good this early I am excited to see what the developers have coming to it.

You have a lot of creative freedom to build whatever you want.  I started to build a treehouse base on an island with a walk out ocean glass floor deck, a drawbridge and a helicopter pad.  I am doing this in my friends game and were both new to this game so we are a little bottlenecked on supplies.  We have our crafting bots pulling from the chest they build things into for an endless loop of construction, building on an island puts us in the perfect position to harvest oil and glue.  We have one all in one harvesting vehicle to process trees and rock, and we plan on building a jetboat soon.  I plan on building a helicopter as soon as possible, although with the current selection of parts it might be difficult to get suitable rotor blades.  There are a few bugs here and there but nothing totally game breaking that I've encountered.  The way I view games is if I get $1 per hour of entertainment it is a good investment.  I've gotten a better value than $1 per hour so far, paid 21 played 23 and I can't wait to play some more.  The resource pickup mechanics are also great and deserve praise.  Hold down the left mouse button and you'll rapidly pick up everything around you.  Crafting games which have a specific time to pick up items are annoying since you spend so much time doing nothing but waiting.  This game doesn't have that problem, you swing your mouse over the item while holding rmb and its in your inventory with no need to individually click on every item.  It makes for very fast and efficient harvesting.

If you like to build things, this game is great.  The survival mechanics are good also, they don't interfere too much with gameplay.  You starve to death FAST when your hunger gets to zero, but it's very easy to keep yourself alive.  What is very nice is that you respawn at the last bed you sleep in and you can craft your beds so you can put them on vehicles and always be right by where you died so you can loot your corpse.

The graphics are cartoony, but very good and you feel right at home in this world.  Character customization can lead to some funny looking characters.  I made my character look like a middle aged man facing a mid life gender identity crisis wearing a wig and wanting to be called Wanda instead of Tony.

Great game, highly recommend it.  These developers are worth supporting."
23091,CUZ ITS FUUN
23092,is nice
23093,"Fun to play in bursts, but easy to get burnt out. Good game overall, just make sure you have the time to play."
23094,tytdg
23095,"i like it
"
23096,The attention from Devs when survival came out is top notch
23097,may be the Best game I've ever played
23098,hbftdjhmdfjgmdf
23099,"this game is terrifying, not only are you afraid of losing your creations, but also the robots make very low sounds, you almost can't hear it, and also they are very fast and do a lot of damage, a cardiac can't play this game, please fix this."
23100,"Would I recommend playing this game? Yes.

Would I write a review explaining why? F that."
23101,"I love this game. it is AWESOME. i think? no but seriously, this is a really great game, esspally with the addition of survival mode."
23102,"Since the time of my last review the play-ability of the game has definetly gone up, though there are still glitches but most of the game breaking ones are fixed. Now, I can comfortably say for everyone to give a try (or another try for those playing day 1) because it might just change your mind on what this game really is."
23103,"NICE
"
23104,It is very good
23105,good gmae
23106,x
23107,"Doesn't work with Linux anymore after the survival update, prevously it worked just fine. Obviously I can't thumbs-down for just that, because they never advertised the game as working on Linux. But this is symptomatic of a greater problem. Just sort by recent negative reviews and read a couple reviews, and you'll get what I mean.

Hold off on buying for about a month or so, let Axolot iron out the kinks."
23108,"For an early access game, it's already great and definitely worth it! Minecraft, Besiege, Survival and it seems like it's only going to get better!"
23109,nice
23110,Greatest Game i have ever played also survival mode is out and is super fun to play would recommend this game to everyone who has a brain
23111,Plays really well. there are bugs but its early access. loving this game want more enviroment  destruction
23112,"I am having too much problems with this game. 
I couldn't even start it in the beginning, and then I found a solution to bypass that problem, then it uses super long time to render everything. I am also having problems with opening other programs after opening this game once, and I think this as I have no problem or lag with other problems before opening this game, but it appears after I have opened it. Also my harddrives are making a weird noise while this game is running"
23113,"The game is good, but lacks optimization. There are also some items in the survival that are missing in creative. I also want to note that there are too few types of enemies."
23114,"still a bit rough around the edges and by that i mean that the multiplayer servers have a bit of lag for the people joining, and that can be disturbing if you have friends that only wants to play single player because it is laggy i hope you buy this game because its a very fun and creativ game where you can do almost anything you want with your creations and now there is survival/campain(i dont know how to write campain) there is a lot more content"
23115,i liked the survival mode
23116,"I was pulled in by the new survival mode trailer and I see others whom have done some great things in this game. The thing is I just don't have the time to grind and discover like they do. two hours was sadly not enough time to realize this. I spent most of my play time trying to establish my self. I used that entire time to build my first and only vehicle. This would normally be fine but... It's garbage and I know how to make a good vehicle I usually love playing these types of games but you are literally unable to with the parts available in your first 2 hours of time. I fully expected it to take a while to get to a great one. Not in this game, In this game you play for hours just to get a standard-ish car. Then days in play time to get something enjoyable to drive. Yes, I know there is a creative mode but I was looking forward to the challenge survival would bring. I already have other great block based building games to play. I was hoping this would be a unique and fun experience. sadly for me it's unique but not fun."
23117,The surivial mode has made this game 200% better
23118,.
23119,"I have been waiting for Survival for so long, and while it is still a work in progress in terms of features and quality of life improvements, I love this game for the creative freedom it allows. There are pre-made items by the game designers, but there is the freedom to create tools and toys of your own making unlike many other games out there. I expect to enjoy this game for many hours to come.

My main issue with the game currently is the multi-player, which honestly is more of an impatience for dedicated servers. Once they introduce the dedicated server functionality, this game will be all that much more fun with friends."
23120,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
23121,COOL
23122,"Its amazing, get it"
23123,"amazing, fun, and pretty relaxing! whether you are looking to kill time in creative or kill robots in survival this game is a great way to kill some time. The devs are constantly keeping up with the game and there are new things added very frequently. A must have!"
23124,very excelllent game love it lol
23125,Really fun in vanilla or with mods. For whatever.
23126,Too many bugs and the game itself is just some hot heaping dogshit
23127,"veri good
go buy game"
23128,crap mechanic
23129,".kujgbl,uyijyvfuy,k"
23130,Its a great game (the survival mode need some more fix and stuff to do )
23131,"Suprisingly difficult, but  a great game. Tons of fun."
23132,E
23133,"JUST FULL OF BUGGS
GAME IS LAGGI at one point of the game / my pc 2x 1070 and  a 7700k 
UNPLAYABALE AFTER YOU SPENT SOME TIME ON SURVIVAL
"
23134, this is a good game for any granny wanting to cyber bully their 3 year olds.
23135,"The game is so hype i love it, but it keeps crashing. :/ I have a brand new gaming desktop, there is no way its my computer."
23136,"Yea ... this game is a keeper.
I play this with my kids."
23137,"I would recommend this game, however be warned, there are extreme performance issues, I run this game on a AMD 3950x and 2080ti and my FPS sometimes drops from 200+ to sub 20's. It seems that the AI causes massive lag when there are a lot of enemies, there may be other cases, but It's difficult to pinpoint why the FPS drops to almost nothing for no reason, and then comes back after traveling more. 

The game is fun, the gameplay loop could be improved a bit, and there is definatly more work to be done to make this a full fledged game, but it's got the core mechanics down and is fun."
23138,"one of the best games ever,
optimized for low-end PCs/laptops"
23139,Is very nice
23140,"its has a grind to it but when you really get in to the game with friends it can be really fun at times and it has the funny times to it (when i get shot up in the air about 431 blocks by a red bot) BUT ya its fun 
"
23141,So fun.
23142,fun
23143,"GREAT GAME WITH AWESOME PHYSICS ENGINE, NOT FOR LOW END COMPUTERS/LAPTOPS. SURVIVAL IS AN AWESOME TEST TO SEE HOW WELL YOU CAN BUILD OUT OF SCRAP AND OTHER RESOURCES."
23144,"The new survival gamemode is fun, but it does need some decent buffing to resource gathering, it's a bit grindy because of it. I would still recommend this game though."
23145,"This game is great, especially with the survival update. It is very time consuming, however, but rewarding and 100% addictive nonetheless. Go ahead and give it a whirl (IF YOU HAVE THE PC SPECS, YOU NEED A REALLY BEEFY PC, WARNING) and you probably won't regret it."
23146,very fun game both in survival and creative. recommend.
23147,"Ok When buying this game, a buddy bought it and said hey lets have some fun in this new building game. Him and I adore playing building games together and having a good laugh. Little did i know this game was gonna be amazing. At first it seems simple enough until you get into crafting and it opens wide up i was blown away at the creations and piston cars we were building. O did i mention its also a tower defense type game too where you need to grow crops for supply and demand and well farmbots dont like that. They will come in numbers at night to try and destroy your crop so this is where combat and defenses come into play. I could go on forever but take my word grab a buddy and go have some fun its a must buy!!!!"
23148,Its simple and fun. Survival has just enough to keep you busy right now survival is new.
23149,√•h blyat veri good game yes
23150,It tries to be like Minecraft.
23151,its another open world game with the building creativity of a more complicated minecraft with complex creativity options and options for the more simple player it could be a plane a car or a boat maybe you just want a factory build it to your hearts content but you wont see results without hard work grinding takes time so if you want a game that fills you with accomplishment this game with cover pretty much everyone unless you play fortnite with a finance from mommy and daddy then your fortniters will run away screaming with a hurting head cause you don't understand a good game
23152,"Fun to play, for sure!"
23153,Amazing game that i wish i found sooner! even better if you have a friend or two to play with :)
23154,It's here. Survival is here.
23155,this game is like a version of minecraft with circles and moving parts 9/10
23156,"Spend 20+ hours just to design best multi-purpose vehicle, good time indeed!! 
Hope the Dev can Iron out the bugs and improve the game optimization so I can invite my friend to play."
23157,this is the best game yet
23158,"super fun and creative game, really fun to mess around in."
23159,The game is wonderful!!! Nice Phisics with gameplay!
23160,Ebic gem
23161,love it
23162,It's really fun to make your own creations or get some from the workshop.
23163,"good game
"
23164,"Although scrap mechanic is still being developed and has many bugs, the game is still very fun to play and I'd recommend it to my friends. The game allows for a lot of creativity and lets the player progress in a way that will likely keep them playing for a while."
23165,great game! good mix of creativity and directed gameplay.
23166,it is awsome sooo many possibilities
23167,the new survival mode is very intresting
23168,"amaizing game, new update completely redid it"
23169,"This has some fun action from the start, though a bit grindy. Once you get the hang of the gameplay mechanics, you can progress fairly quickly, I personally got the hang of it on a couple of days. There are only a few things that I dislike about this game, and most are very minor. 

1) There is no ""Map"" for easier navigating around the world.
2) The Tape bots are too overpowered. [they literally kill you in 2 hits]
3) Hungry and Thirst drains a bit quicker than I'd like them to.

But I have found ways to mitigate these issues, and are only minor inconveniences.
This game IS in full release, but ""Axolot"" is still working on it. There has been almost daily patches since survival was released.

Over all I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Open World, Survival sand box Multiplayer games in a heart beat, Well worth the $15 U.S. price tag.

It has Elements Similar to Minecraft, mixed with Space Engineers, and Empyrion.  Scrap Mechanic Shuold be Nominated for a ""Game of the Year Award"". It's is one of the best Indie Games I've played to date."
23170,epicly gucci
23171,Good mechanical skills and gameplay environment.  decent learning tool built in.  It is a bit grindy especially at first you'll need to gather materials manually for awhile.
23172,Good update   Fun with friends!
23173,fun game
23174,yes
23175,"pretty lit game, been there done that with all of it"
23176,i love this game!!!!!
23177,it is a good game but need fixis
23178,Good
23179,"The rag doll physics alone are what made me want to keep playing. It's like a crossover of Minecraft and goat simulator, except with actual robots."
23180,cool
23181,survival..... yes
23182,"i loved the creativivty of creative mode but now that they have survival it adds a whole new mode to play with.
you can get a wide selection of blocks and parts to build with, allowing you to build anything. this game also has a map editor which you can upload workshop maps or make your own to share with the community. i almost forgot to mention the challenge mode with its 40 maps (aprox) increasing in difficulty over time.
these maps can help u build vehicles you never knew you could build. overall scrap mechanic is a great game for creative builders and thinkers."
23183,brilliant. especialy now the survivel
23184,y
23185,yes imi place zau
23186,"I like the sandbox-ness of this game, and tho physics can be a little whack sometimes, that's part of the fun.
My only complaint is the game crashing on display changes, and since my monitor has a loose connection port that's quite frequent ;-;
All in all, I like the community and the modding that exists there. A public forum for suggestions and for modders to meet up and do fun things would be awesome!"
23187,"I got the game after a friend showed me some youtube videos on it so I went in not expecting much more than a design game like TerraTech but the game is that and so much more. I've played the game for just under 30hrs as of writing even though I've only had the game for 4 days, it's extremely addictive and is very fun.

Now that I have personal feelings out of the way I'll talk about gameplay and survival mode. The game has very cartoony graphics which aren't bad but you should keep that in mind if you want realistic graphics this is not the game you want. The starting of the game is somewhat confusing you're dropped in a burnt forest with only a hammer and lift with no instructions, if I hadn't watched some gameplay before hand I don't know how far I would have gotten in the survival mode before quitting. Although at the beginning it's difficult once you understand how things work the game becomes more of a soothing and relaxing experience. There are some manuals underneath the help menu which give you all the information you'll need for your first vehicle, although these manuals are very easy to miss unless you have a keen enough eye to see the small icons in the bottom right corner they are necessary for a new player and I would have been lost without them. The normal person will treat this mode like any survival game but scrap mechanic is very different it is derived from a complex creative mode and needs to be treated as a brain puzzle otherwise it'll start to get grindy fast, if you don't save for a drill you'll find yourself moving further and further to grind out farm bots for metal, if you don't save for a harvester bot you'll find yourself using most of your time on refining resources. 

In conclusion it's a fun game but is not for the average survival game player and if you go in expecting that you'll get board fast."
23188,"had this game since 2016, good game"
23189,best game ever
23190,Really fun and allows to express creativity
23191,Its a great game the farm raids how ever need to be optimized but I love it.
23192,I like it
23193,The best crafting game i've played kinda like a better mine craft but for smart people. with a big enough imagination you could almost build anything and the survival is pretty neat so far has good elements but being early access needs more content
23194,"Much loot, Evil Robots, Cool Inventions. would recommend even if you dont have imagination or ain't a mechanic"
23195,Best game ever <3 LOVE IT
23196,fun
23197,"Scrap Mechanic is a good game overall. I really like the mechanics of the game like the parts and bots. Bots were challenging at first, but I quickly got used to them. I think that anyone who likes Minecraft should try it out."
23198,pp
23199,this game is amazing I would love for more people to come play it and I think it would be amazing if there was an option to host an online server for anyone to join that would be amazing.
23200,"fun creative game, lots of bugs but thats to be expected"
23201,"i hate you

23211,"Such a brilliant and different look at a sandbox game and now as a survival aswell, thts a game changer all together"
23212,"Amazing
"
23213,"Ok to begin. I loved the look of the game when it first came on steam a yearish ago. 
I loved the look of it yet something put me off that i still now cant remember what it was.
Now i picked it up on sale and instantly fell in love with it for a plethora of reasons.
It has survival mode that challenges you on a daily basis.
The game make you balance between, survival, building and collecting mats. 
All in all (dont have the time to list all that is great, i want to play the game) its near perfect survival game that if it was put onto a pvp mmo (rust) style game it would blow the socks off the competition. 
(do it as an update DEV's or another game) omg...

all in all its three thumbs up and no bugs to even mention.
"
23214,Very Good game with good mechanics
23215,"Games awesome.,, Hope they add some more baddy boys! <3"
23216,Awesome game. It is really fun if this is the kind of game you like and the new survival mode is my favorite thing to play right now and I don't see it getting old any time soon especially with all the updates they are doing.
23217,"A limited game at this point, but the potential is sky high. Much better than other failed building games with potential (those that will not be named). Don't be fooled by the youtube videos tho, there is not a ton of content to this game in its current state. Few enemies and few things to really do except build."
23218,been folowing this game for a while but the new survival really hits this game out of the park. well made and lots of fun by yourself or with friends. It does feel like a decent processor is needed especially if playing with friends for some reason. 10/10 would highly recommend.
23219,its a great game ive spent about 30 hours on the game even though it say only 10  the only issue is they are to many bugs stil to say its been in early access for a few year  but defo playable if you like factorio and statifacty then youll love thos
23220,A meticulously crafted gamed that you'll find yourself lost in for hours
23221,AWESOME concept and mechanics!  Needs an in-game map/compass...  Spent half of my six hours chasing my tail being lost.
23222,"amazing gameplay love to build way better than minecraft
"
23223,Meh I don‚Äôt really have a lot to say about this game but it can be really fun you just need a good or middle class pc
23224,"Slow grind, but satisfying for those who like the idea of free form creation of vehicles and machines to help maximize efficiency of your resource gathering. Chill soundtrack, nice stylized graphics with decent view distances and a huge randomized world to explore.

The mob variety is minimal but fine for what it is. This is a sandbox game, if you are looking for a story driven narrative or in-depth characters then this isn't for you. If you want to figure out cool ways to configure a rock harvesting, tree chopping, spud shooting Herkimer Battle Jitney then this just might be your thing."
23225,I havent played this for to long because my computer is to lagy but from what I did and what I have seen it pretty good id deffently play it for hours maybe days if I had the right pc I can't wait to upgrade my PC
23226,perfect but have problem in multy player yet
23227,It's like the dark souls of farming simulator

23229,This game's survival mode is very very addicting. The way the game is made makes me want to keep on playing and get even better stuff to make better things. If you got some time to kill than definitely check this game out.
23230,1
23231,"Faking warehouse lift glitch !

Dont buy now until the new update ."
23232,Yes
23233,"I am the farm man, all i know is food, robots try take my food, but I take their lives"
23234,"Bought it for the survival mode. I'ts still very new but already amazing! there isn't that much info on the game yet, wave mechenics, automation tutorials (you know what I mean), but its already amazing. It does have a long way to go, but if updates with new content keep comin' this is definitely worth more money than the game costs rn ;). Survival items in the creative mode would be nice though, just so we can test out mining and everything without having to grind in survival for it to then not work."
23235,"The Games really fun and with workshop creations and mods it makes it much more fun. With the addition of survival mode it make the game way more fun and entertaining, but they probably could have added survival awhile ago as a lot of people including me have been waiting years for it to come out.
Although for the 3 years I've played this game i still enjoyed playing creative."
23236,i love it in previuse relese have so mach bugs but now i dont find one bug
23237,Good game :)
23238,its 2 am and i ate 3 cans of chef boyardi
23239,"Slow to start off as there is very little instruction to how to start. Theres no Info on what the important things are that you need and ther eshould be a tutorial at the start of the game that says something like... This is how you build stuff, this is how to grow food and all the parts needed to complete that as its important."
23240,it has good graphics a fun playing experience and a bit of bugs but the devs are working to fix most of the
23241,"Scrap mechanic is a great game, but multiplayer is almost unplayable. The hosting player experiences a lot of sluttering and freezes, and the client player experiences a huge number of bugs, rollbacks and disconnections. 
I HIGHLY DISRECOMMEND you to buy the game if you plan to play in multiplayer on a regular Internet connection and on a regular computer (actually even a powerful gamer computer). However, that game remains a GREAT SINGLEPLAYER game and I recommend you to try."
23242,THE COWS ARE BACKWARDS
23243,"Having one of the most fantastic building systems of any sandbox game, it's a ton of fun to spend time trying to make the perfect vehicle."
23244,It Is The Best Survival for you imagination
23245,IT IS GOOD
23246,Don't listen to the grindy whines. This game is exactly what you would expect from the videos ... amazing! Get it ... you won't regret it.
23247,.
23248,It is laggy when you star but its very fun to play even after 650hr.
23249,"Except for languages that use English letters, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Russian are all garbled."
23250,"This game was already amazing even before the survival gamemode. The only negative thing is some minor bugs that don't affect gameplay much, like occasionally walking underwater. Those bugs will most likely be fixed in little to no time. Definitely recommend. 10/10"
23251,"its good apart from a few bugs here and there i've been wanting this game for years and waited until survival came out to get it
"
23252,Its good
23253,I like building things and the little challenge you get from the bots.  It's nice
23254,"this game is very funny, survival should have been added years ago

23257,its very fun
23258,it is really good
23259,this game is amazing you can build almost anything from cars to planes and even small games like tetris and pong(but that is very very hard to build a game) id say youll need a bit of a mid end pc to play without lag
23260,is a cool game
23261,"Tried to drown my friend while he was afk, instead he died of hunger before I got to the water. 10/10 Would recommend."
23262,Very good. Car go vruum
23263,oof
23264,Fun. Thats about it.
23265,"This game has potential but after playing, it has little to no direction. mostly an overpriced fuck around game with no point. If there was a objective to work toward or any story what so ever. it would go from a 1.5 star game to a 3.8 easy."
23266,I enjoyed this game
23267,"This is a great game!, purchased yesterday and enjoying it.. gonna be my new go to game! small download for such a pretty well done game for an Alpha! Wish there was an ingame way of inviting other players but inviting via steam app works fine  for multiplayer :) Keep up the good work! so much potential!"
23268,"This is not a minecraft clone! I repeat, this is not a minecraft clone!"
23269,‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏¢
23270,"Amazing Game, super fun. Can't wait to see what they add next. :)"
23271,not very fun.
23272,"great game + survival came out recently

its definently worth buying"
23273,GG
23274,Just like Forza.
23275,love game  needs more placices to exsplore n more vender options
23276,10/10
23277,"Good, fun game especially now that survival is here."
23278,A great game. There are minor bugs (early access) and getting started initially is a challenge. This is similar to minecraft meets simpleplanes  but with much more. If you enjoy those games you will love this one.
23279,"It,s a good game and good job game Developers."
23280,The survival update has made this game worth the wait. It's amazing what we now can do from when this game first came out.
23281,Playing this game with my boyfriend. Fun and relaxing and not too punishing. Great concept will keep playing for a long time to come.  About to play right now actually ;)
23282,good game
23283,"Has a lot of potential for a great survival game with janky creations. What other game can you make your own tractor to haul materials across the map?

Needs more updates to flesh it out, like adding more resource tiers, give you the option to change collection rates, let you improve your health/weapon/armor, etc. If survival wasn't so new, I'd give this game a thumbs down, but the devs are working on it and I hope to see many more features added. Feels barebones atm.

Most survival games let you build stuff, but generally hold you back with premade pieces and stuff like that. Building has a lot of promise in scrap mechanic, but atm with the way the game is balanced you're held back by just how slow resource collection is."
23284,its good stop making me wright a actual review its a good game there im done
23285,Brilliant!
23286,"Cool game if you like creating things or something like Minecraft. However there's too many bugs that pissed me off to keep playing. There's no canceling an item if it's being crafted. If you're inventory is full and you remove an item off your creation, it's gone. Move your creation too far while holding it on the lift? *Poof* Everything you put into it. Gone. No map, so you can't see where you are. You can't find basic materials sometimes like cotton; no one's world is the same so you can't look for help. It's fun but just be prepared for a bug to piss you off and waste some time you put in."
23287,love it !!!
23288,IT DONE GOOD
23289,shj f
23290,I had a lot of fun in survival over about 25 hours. Remember this game is early access so set your expectations accordingly! It still needs a lot of QoL fixes. If you treat it like a demo it won't disappoint.
23291,"If you're planning to buy Scrap Mechanic for its Survival Mode, don't. It has barely anything to offer."
23292,its awsome
23293,Bought for Survival - great fun solo and with friends - Solo is more of a challenge of course
23294,"I starved to death, got revived far away from home, had to run 100 miles across the country while dodging agressive and toxic robots just to die of thirst at my doorstep. 

Great game, 10/10"
23295,"i buy this 4 years ago and add survival its amazing , 100% recommend"
23296,rdtg
23297,"is good
"
23298,it good
23299,"Good game, does need some work"
23300,"Game is good. KAPPA.

Don't buy this game until they add a Minimap and a gps.
Update : I realized the survival mode have no water phyisics , YES LADIES AND GENTLEMENT,  the map is over 70% interconected by water and has no water physicis. if you add that to the fact there are no oil pumps, This game has no future. 

Btw To the devs, There are some mods on the worshop you could be using to fix survival lack of content. Please use them , instead to rendering those usless.

Not updates yet. i guess someone died out of covid."
23301,"i like the building mode and survival but the constant robot spawn in survival is a little annoying
"
23302,very fun survival mode
23303,idk
23304,"TL;DR: As of now, this game is a ""Wait"". Why? Gas is scarce as the Vacuum Pump doesn't work on Oil nodes. 

At 20~ hours, I've been eating up gas faster than I can get it, as there's no way to automate it. So you have two options- Break open boxes, or swim underwater to collect Oil. Your swim is half speed and the Oil is 1:1 to Gas. Breaking down a resource boulder and transporting it, takes about 15-25 gas. 

Community response has been to create an exploit piston machine. It uses no fuel source, just broken physics to travel. Fine for some, not for me. I want the struggle that leads into surplus in Survival, not just exploiting my way through the game.

So for now, wait for a bit more development. But those 20~ hours were a blast! I expect great things of this game 'down the road' and will change my review then."
23305,"Waited years for survival annnnnnnnd maybe you should make sure everything works, coulda took an extra year as everyone for the most part forgot about this game and it would have been fine. Multiplayer is constant disconnect issues, maybe you should let us rent dedicated servers? Loot system is garbage, there is no reason to go to factory to get seeds i can get from the trader. the yellow bot 1 shotting you is a bit over the top i feel. Overall in its current state, no, wouldnt recommend to anybody, forget about it for another 3 years and it may be good then. Also may wanna include everything shown in the trailer as well."
23306,Me make car go fast but keep get hurted by robots.
23307,bug. keybinds are wacked
23308,"I had to wait a year for survival and honestly I find myself more annoyed than satisfied. Sure I like this game but I just feel like survival was cobbled together last minute as I feel as if there are a lot of features that are just missing or are honestly just annoying. For example in one of my worlds I died far from my base, I had a lot of good items and had my vehicle there too. Because you don't spawn with max hunger or thirst I couldn't get either back and when I eventually did get there I was killed again as the bots did not despawn or even move for that matter. I think that could be fixed with a command to disable losing items on death or something to switch from survival mode to creative whenever the player wants. So as of now I don't think survival is a finished product and for that I can't bring myself to give this game a good review yet."
23309,"Super fun game, def recommend it."
23310,I have HIV and I'm dying
23311,It's just really fun. It's really good and if you die it's not that big of a deal. The robots aren't too hard to kill. It's really fun going and collecting everything
23312,Only thing keeping the game alive is the mod community
23313,Overall an excellent game with excellent mechanics.
23314,"gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
game"
23315,Active devs and an always evolving game. let your creativity loose.
23316,"This game is kinda grindy, but I enjoy it."
23317,"This game could be good but it's pretty unfinished (especially the survival mode). It has many glitches, bugs, and 95% of the time it black screens on start up (yes, I've tried everything and no, my computer is not bad but we can talk about that if you'd like.) Get it if you want, try it out, and see if you can look past that."
23318,i like it
23319,yes good
23320,its really neat
23321,"The game was fun in creative. But survival changed everything! A lot of fun  in single player or joining a friend's game.
Can't wait to see what will come in the future!

Great job to the team!"
23322,"My wife and I are playing it together. Roughly 40 hours in and enjoying the game.  There are some areas that still need work but that is to be expected for early access.

The one thing I find missing and feel is an absolute MUST is a dedicated key binding in the settings for controlling a vehicle. The game has drivers seats. Once seated, you can control steering and acceleration easily with WASD but it you make anything complicated, you're stuck pressing buttons 1-0. That is simply horrible for a game about creating fantastic machines. We need to be able to assign keys for our vehicles... Please. The ability to label 1-0 would be nice too. A flying machine needs 1 for main thrust, 2 for lift, 3 left, 4 right, 5 counter clockwise, 6 clockwise, 7 forward, 8 back.... Get the point?

Survival is fun and the variety of landscape presented already is impressive. Can't wait to see more.

If you like tinkering and had fun with redstone in Minecraft, you'll really enjoy Scrap Mechanic. Well worth the price."
23323,"A great game, imagination is the key. Think it then try to do it!"
23324,"Hard to get use to everything, but really worth learning how to play."
23325,Seems like it needs a lot of work still. Hard to play with friends.
23326,It is everything that i never knew i always wanted.
23327,"As of this date the game is still a bit empty in the survival world, so far there's not that much enemy robot variety and even with big buildings to go in there isn't much to do.

However the mechanics o the game work well enough and serve as a great sandbox to get creative in vehicle and automation. Highly recommended."
23328,Game is full of bugs and the multiplayer still needs a lot of work.
23329,its realy boring and the story sucks
23330,"Update: The bug has been fixed. Great work devs.


[strike]There is currently a major bug that prevents use of trader, only fix people seems to say it to basically restart and of course  hope its working that time.
Until this is fixed for current saves I'm can not recommend this game.
[/strike]"
23331,"Very fun game. Easy to build contraptions and vehicles, along with the survival aspect make this game very addicting. I've been looking for a game like this for a while."
23332,"just need to fix lag issues
"
23333,"Good game, survival is new and still being developed but already a good start with it and hope to see more
they need some better systems to give more control more easily 
and work on fps issues we get some times"
23334,Multiplayer isn't worth it because theres no dedicated server options. Game is double the price it deserves to be. Wait for sale and only buy when they add dedi server support.
23335,"Needs some more automation work to take out some of the grind, but overall a solid survival game with your imagination as the only limit."
23336,"very fun and addicting to play 
"
23337,"I'd like to know if anybody else is having issues opening the game. almost every time ive tried to open the game it crashes either after the dev banner, or it instantly crashes before it even gets to the banner. the 5 times it hasnt crashed, the only time id get into a game is if i choose creative mode. When i picked survival, it would fill up the loading bar, then sit there with a full bar indefinitely. I have a PC capable of streaming some demanding games and yet i cant run this small beta? Guna be honest tho, the bit that i did get to play, it was a blast, really cool idea and approach to a survival game. Its just really unfortunate that I've only been able to play it once after owning it for a few days and trying to play."
23338,fortnite burger
23339,"tl;dr - the game is fun, albeit a bit confusing at the moment of writing. give it a try.

Survival mode is interesting and I enjoy playing it, searching more and more to find new buildings/items.
With no tips or hand-holding going on, it is a bit of a struggle to figure out which direction to go in next.
""There's no right or wrong here!"" they say, while giving no instruction.

There's a large variety of construction blocks as well as decorative items, and I especially enjoy being able to place every item in the world knowing it'll stay there until I move it again. I think there's a lot of potential for future updates as well."
23340,my 8 year old loves this game.
23341,its gud
23342,Gud Gam
23343,think minecraft but with alot more technology  its filled to the brim with alot of fun things to play around with and the survival mode adds a nice survive or you'l probably lose everything vibe
23344,The best build mechanics out of any i have played up to date. 9.5 out of 10 on the poolface likey scale.
23345,like
23346,"pretty good
"
23347,"Me: If only there was a futuristic minecraft with better graphics. I'm so sick and tired of those pixels...
Axolot: Say no more!"
23348,awda
23349,"A wonderful game with amazing potential, great mix of survival, building and adventure. look forward to seeing how it develops over time!"
23350,"big fun

23351,Great but a little rough around the edges
23352,great game but survival so far is just dropping you in and not telling you much i believe they will update in the future since its early access. also get some friends to play with
23353,"It's honestly a good game if you like survival building games or just building games.

Truly robust building mechanics and amazing mods that only add to the building fun.  I do wish there was a mode without Hunger or Thirst but you don't always get it your way and that still doesn't diminish the quality of the game itself.

Graphics are good and have a simple feel to them.

I've had some small lag with extremely large or complex constructions but otherwise performance was good."
23354,love it
23355,an awesome game!!!!
23356,"Before the Survival update, I'd say that this game was just ""meh"" with the ammount of stuff you could do in it.

After the survival update, I love this game. I'd rate it a solid 7-8/10, because of the lack of content currently. I'd love more enemies than just 4-5. Specifically flying/climbing enemies would be cool."
23357,fun to play with friends and defend against attacks
23358,"still YEP
"
23359,yes
23360,"cool game wit da cool building mechanics
"
23361,This game is great! I recommend this to anyone who like creating things and goofy things.
23362,Big learning curve but once you understand the basics an awesome game for sure
23363,"Fun game, more complicated than I expected in the way of building vehicles but that's an upside for me. Survival is fun especially with friends. I recommend it, especially if it is on sale."
23364,"creative is fun
"
23365,Great game. Just needs more content and optimization for survival mode.
23366,"The major game mechanics are fantastic! I like both Garry's Mod, and Minecraft, and I felt this was a good combination of both. There are some lag issues though, especially with raids."
23367,"Game is really smooth, been addicted since installing! 
Still limited because of early access but HUGE POTENTIAL!!!  

COULDNT RECOMMEND MORE!"
23368,game goood
23369,i love the creative freedom you get with this and the new survival mode is awesome
23370,"I love this game! At first I was a bit lost but then got the hang of it.
Is super fun to play with a friend :)"
23371,"It is a cool game especially with the new survival aspect, the only thing I would add is more story and just more content in general like flying enemies."
23372,Minecraft with emphasis on physics based engineering is a very good idea
23373,awsome but cant find cotton
23374,this game didn't look like much at first ... my friend wanted me to play with him but i wasent sure... so i bought if after seeing all those good reviews... and let me tell you! this game is FUCKING AMAZZINNGG! if you like creating stuff you will get addicted for SURE! must have!
23375,Fun game
23376,this game is epic
23377,"It's pretty bad, sometimes you place a block, and it vanishes below the surface of the map, if  you die, you start back with no health and no food, parts randomly disappear while building. Maybe with another 4 years it can be better, but right now I do not recommend."
23378,"game have long life
"
23379,Lack of Content by Devs. LUL
23380,this game is well amazing really good game and alot of mods and i recomend it
23381,"I found and started playing this on a whim, and fell in love. Then, so did my entire family. There are endless possibilities only limited by your mind, and I believe with more time and updates, you won‚Äôt be limited by blocks either. There is a lot of potential for this game! If they listen to the community that plays, this game will be possible game of the year status! I love playing co op with my kids and husband, makes playing so enjoyable! My kids are tinkerers and love building on Minecraft but felt limited, this game gave them some of the cool aspects minecraft didn‚Äôt provide! I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds! 

Cons: it‚Äôs still a work in progress and buggy, laggy, has horrible noise underwater that I fixed with turning off ambient sounds and bad lag underwater that drops frame rates to 1, which I fixed by turning particles up to high. There are a lot of things I think should be added or fixed but all in all, we are enjoying the game as it is but I can‚Äôt say it will last a lifetime if things are not fixed."
23382,im finna whip dis hoe
23383,Waited till the survival update to review. I have been quite enjoying it. Needs a lot more optimization but its a brilliant start.
23384,Very fun and lots to do!
23385,"This is a wonderful sandbox. Creating anything imaginable with the tools they have... and surprisingly simple and not overwhelming. Great physics and mechanics! I can feel the addiction starting as I create new things, wondering what I could potentially create. It would be nice to have less lag when complex figures are being created, or when playing multiplayer. It would also be nice to have a ""toggle"" switch to enable destruction of our creations. For instance, it would clearly not be likely that a cardboard box could withstand getting hit with a giant piece of metal. Lastly, BEWARE of no ""undo"" ... Save your stuff frequently in case something happens in game and you lag a lot. It will freeze up.

Definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes creating things, designing things, or just want to make wacky vehicles and structures with different functionality."
23386,deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez  nutssssssssssssss
23387,"it is a good game
"
23388,"At this moment I feel we are being trolled. 4 years of development, and not even the creative blocks all put into game. 

This is a game about creating awesome builds and fighting robots. BUT, guess what 2 things completely lag the game?... yep.

I did recommend this game, but the game needs optimized sooooo badly. They couldnt test this before release? I have a pretty new and high spec PC and cant build too much. For a building game, thats lacking horribly.

Bugs: Glowbs disappear, Cows walk out of my 4 tall pens at times. Totebots  become invincible, Items and chests disappear after grinding mats forever. Several more smaller ones that shouldnt be in game w/ any testing before release. 

Dont get me started on fighting 2-3+ haybots, You cant dodge or block and they push each other so much, you cant really fight w/o guns, which isnt early game. 

There is also dead spot in water and on land that make your bearings go limp and you have to pick up your build and carry out of the area. Which has turned out to be a completely destroyed car once because the farmbot. 

All in all, this could be an awesome game, but after a lot of optimization. You have to grind way too much to lose stuff from random disappearing or game glitches. ( I dont mind grinding if there is a reason, MMO fan) But to just lose it because of lag or random glitching is pathetic."
23389,love it
23390,dis game good
23391,Fun game to begin with. The survival update brings it to a new level!
23392,This game is still in DEV but i cannot say how amazing this game is. Ive already spent 24 hours and I feel like i am just getting started. Must have this game!
23393,LAG
23394,"Is the scrap mechanic, just waiting for mods in survival."
23395,I really thought this game was left for dead when I backed it as early access. I let it go as a Loss. I recently got a change to replay it within Survival Mode and was actually impressed. I like the two ply building via Blocks and Items. This is Much needed. I do wish they would improve the Welding Tool when deal with Complex moving Joints. While I can clearly understand joining a single modeled piece to another location or Bearing Forget matching up Pairs of Parts. its a Nightmare for building . Otherwise I enjoy this more than Minecraft and Rust.  Can't wait to see what else they come up with.
23396,"pretty good
"
23397,"very good game just a bit laggy
"
23398,Awesome with the new update. Creative mode sucks in comparsion. Its missing a bunch of items and is just as glitchy as before still good though.
23399,"amazing
"
23400,"It's fun, survival just came out"
23401,"People say that killing haybots is hard, but thats a lie. Its really fun to smash them because its like smashing that dang corana virus."
23402,"Very glitchy, almost unplayable."
23403,"This review is solely about Survival Mode (SP), which was released 3 days ago or so. I'll be brief:

[h1]ZE GOOD[/h1]
[list]
[*] Charming graphics and audio design;
[*] Large map for exploration (plenty of POI's and space for creations);
[*] Reasonable amount of resources to be collected and processed;
[*] Creative enemy designs;
[*] Building system is somewhat flexible and allows for a lot of possibilities;
[*] Shiny metal bars;

[h1]ZE BAD[/h1]
[*] EXTREMELY grindy. Everything takes forever to do, is costly and a chore (hammering trees, drilling rocks, crafting, etc);
[*] I'm a mechanic but can't craft by hand.[i] Bruh [/i](or any of the most crucial items, really);
[*] No information on how to progress, devs expect players to be clairvoyant (feed cardboard to sea creatures, see what happens);
[*] Planting literally ONE crop creates waves of enemies so planting early on is near impossible;
[*] Over punishing death makes getting into a death loop very easy (drop items, respawn with only 50% of hunger, thirst and health. Health uses up hunger and thirst to regenerate, so you barely have time to do anything before you start taking damage again, which prevents using vehicles, btw);
[*] EA Games lootboxes (crates have essential but random spawns, so you have to grind them);
[*] Combat is dumb and uninteresting (swing your hammer and thats it, no extra weapons until much later);
[*] No low quality readily available foods in the wilds, so... lootboxes :/
[*] Many possibilities of vehicle designs, but 90% of them will flip over;
[*] Extra [strike] thicc [/strike] large map without an actual map UI or indications means you'll get lost frequently (so make landmarks, people);
[*] POI's are just different iterations of the same kind of activity (run and loot everything you see), with very few of them actually being more relevant than lootbox sources;
[*] Just like in Raft I have to eat EVERY GODDAMN MINUTE;
[/list]

[h1]ZE CONCLUSION[/h1]
The games is cool and all but survival mode seems waaay too rough to have been released, although I'm sure future updates can easily solve some of the aforementioned issues. Until then, would'nt recomend it unless it's on sale (I'll definily edit this review once that happens)."
23404,very fun and challenging
23405,efsane oyun single bile g√ºzel
23406,Fun game but the minimum and maximum requirments are not true. You need at least ryzen 2600 or higher to play the game with your friends without roasting your CPU
23407,good
23408,it fun because yes
23409,"Currently I can not play survival with multiplayer as any one joins just lags, out and same if I join someone else's game. My computer is more then capable and so is my internet. Very frustrated cause was really enjoing it."
23410,fun game with lots of possabilities
23411,Really good game... With Bugs
23412,definitely worth the 20$. like combat? you can shoot or hit robots. like farming? you can farm. like building? thats a huge part of this game. theres pretty much something for everybody. tip for new players who go to survival: look at the bottom right of your screen
23413,If you want to achive [h1]STRONK[/h1]. Buy the game
23414,"Very very good good

23415,"Really playable, easy to pick up and lots of fun already after a few hours play."
23416,a
23417,"I am enjoying the game so far on survival. There is a little bit of learning involved, but tinkering and learning is part of the fun."
23418,good
23419,"This isn't a ""bad"" game so it feels weird giving it a negative review. It has so much potential. The endless possibilities the game offers and the engineering aspects are fantastic. Here comes the BUT... But, i wanted a ""why"". Some type of objective, some type of story, a reason to want to create things and use them other than just creating them. Maybe progressing to the point that I can build something to fulfill the purpose my original ship did? more enemies maybe? Increasingly difficult enemies/tactics? areas of a map that I need to colonize or collect survivor logs or plot points? something? Bueller? Bueller? Sorry scrap mechanic, you are a good game, well done on everything except for a reason to continue to play."
23420,"Bought this after Survival Update, and it is an excellent sandbox building game, good amount of challenge, and a lot of potential as it continues development. Future updates will include viable water craft, more crafting, etc., but it's already a lot of fun.

Graphics are reminiscent of cartoony games, but that's the whole premise anyway. It's literally possible to drop an anvil on enemies.

Still has a lot of work to go to be a ""complete"" game, but not much reason to wait for that if sandbox building/engineering games are your thing."
23421,"yes, and yes"
23422,"ever since survival came out it's been a completely different game (pun intended) and I am loving it, tho it is a buggy mess at times I would still play this over and over again!"
23423,It allows you to express your creativity and it's only limit is you.
23424,good
23425,survival mode is insanely fun! CANT STOP PLAYING! LOL  (though plz add a toggle key for run! The hand cramps are real.)
23426,Very good. Survival is the very nice as well as creative. :)
23427,gaem good
23428,AN AMAZING GAME WOULD RECOMMEND TO FIND OUT HOW TO MAKE A CAR IN CREATIVE BEFORE PLAYING SURVIVAL
23429,"Cute, Fun, great vehicle building mechanics, and you kill robots."
23430,"I love this game, it's a imagination and architecture game. I haven't played a game this fun in my life."
23431,"This is a hard one to review and I may update my review when I play in the future.

I've put about 20 hours at the time of the review and I can see a lot of potential in this game. Despite the 'Thumbs Up"" I am giving it, I have to recommend you only buy the game in support of the developers. There is a lot of good here but I don't believe the game is there yet.

I am speaking solely on the Survival part of the game. The creative portion of the game seems extremely extensive from what I've viewed and if you're into just a creative experience, I think you will LOVE this game. Scrap Mechanic has a well polished crafting system where you can build literally everything. Unfortunately, it feels like the Survival mode is more or less slapped on haphazardly. Sure, there are some genuine moments of fun to be had here. I just think it needed more time in the oven. 

Most of my grievances are quality of life issues. There are things that could be explained better and systems that could be streamlined. I don't mind having to look up youtube videos for some things but to truly get anything out of the game, you absolutely will need to. This game, for better or worse, won't hold your hand and often times you feel like you're wasting time when you could be progressing.

My overall suggestions:

1) Please add maps, minimaps and/or map markers. I don't enjoy getting lost or being afraid to travel away from the road because I might get lost.

2) Tool tips are a necessity. I can't tell what certain items are in crafting if I have never seen them before. 

3) Subjective, thirst and hunger shouldn't be affected if you die. Let me run back to my marker without having to worry about my hunger and thirst. 

4) Quests or a task list would introduce players to concepts easier and quicker. I often times feel like the pace of the game is way too slow or grindy, often due to not realizing you COULD do something and save a ton of time. I get that the developers may have been wanting to go for that but I think a little bit of an explanation on certain mechanics would help.

5) Bugs, even more so the one that causes items to be below surface and unable to be picked up, should be fixed. 

6) More variety of interactions. Even after just 10 hours, many things just feel repetitive. 

7) Polish. There are probably a thousand things I could have mentioned but didn't. The whole game needs more time in the oven to go from 'okay' to 'great'.

In short, I think the game has a TON of potential and I think, in time, it will be an awesome experience. However, I would hold off for now."
23432,the new survival mode is really detailed and full of content with endless possibilities
23433,its an amazing game i play it almost every day!
23434,Very fun survival is really great buy it now!!
23435,"bEST GAME EVER
"
23436,"Now that the survival update is out, it's much much better. creative is still not the best, but it's  getting better"
23437,have fun but play around in creative so you know how to bild stuf before survivel
23438,Very slick. Lots of fun. Everything works how it should. I don't usually buy Early Access games but I'm not regretting this one at all and even bought a copy for my son so that we can play together.
23439,Great game
23440,really fun
23441,its pretty boring.
23442,"great game, period."
23443,"After a few hours of playing, converting a building into a base, and creating a work vehicle, the only question I have is what else is there to do?

The game art is new and creative. The mechanics are fun and interesting. But where is the content?

At the point where I'm at now, just a couple hours in, I have access and unlocked ALL of the content this game has to offer. At this point, the only thing there is to do is to.... make bigger vehicles? Farm for literally no reason? I can make the base look interesting with the limited blocks available but in the end, there is just no end goal.

I'm trying to understand the hype, but at this point I cannot. Simply not enough in the game, especially after how many years of development this game has had.

If you would like to change my mind, or inform me on more goals of this game, please comment/message me. I really encourage that."
23444,yeet this game is good
23445,i like makeing cars but its hard
23446,yes
23447,Lag
23448,"This is a great sandbox game for the budding engineer. The world is combined with light combat, efficiency farming and an infinite number of building techniques. To achieve an ever greater level of world interaction you must work at every problem until you find the elegant solution. Or you can just build a small car and kill stuff! Fun for all."
23449,"I can be a man baby.

10/10 would reccomend"
23450,"I don't get it. It's like Minecraft, but hours of work to build a single chest and wooden car that can run for 20 seconds. You spend more time fighting the physics engine than accomplishing anything.

Oh, and in a game about engineering you can't make any guns or explosives. Nope, gotta shoot potatoes. Can't have kids making bullets, no sir."
23451,it is a great game!!!!!!!
23452,good game
23453,"They do not allow support for Nvidia GeForce Now, which is really a shame because I now cannot play the game. Absolutely disgusted."
23454,I'm speechless.
23455,it's fun
23456,hu
23457,This game is my new fav its a fun game to build and in survival you can build fight and make minygames if you want
23458,its a blana game
23459,"Simple yet challenging building/survival sim. 

Same as other survivals, watch your meters, build a home, gather resources... However farming will attract robots left on the world you crash on, these will try to destroy your crops, home, and life. Good news is after a bit of grinding you can make your first junkpart vehicle! Bad news is shortly down the road it will be torn apart with you inside from enemies you're too overweight to outrun. Exploring the procedural world has been okay, lots of different pieces in the generation but it all kind of feels samey from what I've explored. 

You're also some kind of short dwarf man-child, some of the face options are less unnerving than others."
23460,"its a really fun game and is great for imagination

23487,This game is very fun and i like the new survival mode. also pls add achievements.
23488,"havent seen a game this creative since minecraft, loving it so far and I've only played creative"
23489,THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!
23490,"Incredibly fun game. Solid 8/10 in its current state, and likely to become better as it updates.

Survival progression works the exact opposite of other games. Instead of becoming less fun as time goes on, this game will start out slow and progressively get more fun. Survival mode is my favorite since it gives practical incentive to build. I love thinking of new ways to combat bots and or defend my base or irrigate my plants. The progression and exploration blew my mind. Every time I learned something knew, my brain was like ""wtf?? I can do that???"" and it felt great. The atmosphere and feeling as you explore the world also blew my mind. The further you get from your spawn point, the bigger things get. You fight bigger and bigger bots and find larger and larger fields and hills and structures. I always asked myself ""How much bigger does everything get??? Am I gonna be fighting godzilla next??"" and let my imagination run, similar to the way scrap mechanic has always let my imagination flourish. I don't want to spoil anything, but I think everyone will like the environments and feel of the game's world.
Much like minecraft, late game is essentially building things to make the game play its self. You build automated farms and machines. However, unlike minecraft, there is always ways to improve your machines and continue learning things you never knew about. Survival scrap mechanic is survival minecraft on steroids and crack.

Creative mode appeals to a different kind of player, and the divide between the two modes and people who play them have become increasingly apparent to me as time goes on. Creative mode solely exists to let players build whatever they can imagine. Every bit of machinery is very organic and plain at its core. There is no ""space ship box"" that u put in your build to make it fly. Instead, you have to use pistons, jet engines, and suspension to find a way to create this so called ""space ship box"" by yourself. I personally love the organic mechanical building blocks of this game, and creative mode puts no limit on how you use the tools given to you."
23491,"Multiplayer has server-wide lag spikes which as far as I can tell are unavoidable. Animation bugs look silly, certain items cannot be picked up if placed in certain places, among a myriad of other small issues.

Survival is not ready for public consumption. Certain resources seem to simple have a chance to never spawn, and it lacks an overarching ultimate goal. What more is that the balance hits this uncanny valley. This game's greatest strength is being able to create interesting contraptions. But just getting to that point requires a ton a resource grinding and luck. My GF & I literally spent 4 hours between us just looking for cotton, and could never find a single one. Making basic things should be cheap and easy, and those basic things can be used to harvest enough resources to feed into advanced things.

Otherwise, creative mode is pretty good if you can motivate yourself to create. 

Maybe it'll be worth it in 1-2 years, but please avoid for now."
23492,"worth the ¬£10 had a great time so far , shame about the bugs in survival/multiplayer right now but its to be expected.

"
23493,"yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssss
"
23494,"its fine, but it crashes SO MUCH"
23495,"The survival part of scrap mechanic is fun. It makes you need to use combat and logic because you can build vehicles. Overall, this is a good game."
23496,build!!!!!!
23497,yes
23498,Love playing this with my Daughter. So far very very impressed. Love the building freedom. i can see this getting bigger and better in the future.
23499,good
23500,A lot of fun especially if you like suvival games and builders
23501,"I honestly adore this game
just
yes

also there's a T-Pose bug that they SHOULD NOT FIX! PLEASE DO NOT FIX IT"
23502,good
23503,"Great game! Keep up the great work Axolot. Both Raft and Scrap Mechanic are worthy of your Games Library. Building, surviving, the ability to build whatever creation you can think of and shooting robots with potatoes. This game was made for me!"
23504,"There isn't much to do in game as of 5/12/2020. It has a lot of bugs, and doesn't launch from the play button in the Steam Library claiming that steam isn't running or I need to buy the game."
23505,Kinda thought this would be another one of those Early Access games that fall to the ground. BUT then they actually released survival mode! And I am very happy with the result so far! Definitely worth the wait
23506,"Great game, having so much fun with survival."
23507,Good game.
23508,THIS GAME IS SO AWESOMELY FUN!!!!!!!
23509,no dont get this if you whant to play survival cuz you hammer gliches then YOU HAVE MAKE A STUPET NEW GAME I Have SPENT 12 HOUWERS ON A WORLD AND YOU KNOW WHAT MY HAMMR IS GONE I HATE THIS GAME devs pls fix the hamer glich
23510,"This game is amazing!
"
23511,I enjoy being able to create whatever you want and roam around a map with nice looking places. I bought this game after the survival release because there is now a lot more excitement in it with the story mode/survivals. And lots of new blocks and features were also added.
23512,Build Stuff
23513,good game
23514,"It is a fantastic game i have played it since i got my computer en i still love it.
I have played survival and i love it even more. 
I just wonder i you can add a feature that makes it possible to have two owners on a world or make it so you can choose who that can join the world because i play it with my friend and we want to play it when the other one is doing someting else.

Thanks for the beautiful and fun game"
23515,Don't buy the game to unstable in its current state to enjoy i purchased to play with my friend and everytime i try some new bs comes along 10 second delay unable to eat i lag around the place i love the game but to buggy and broken to have fun on
23516,"Very cool game, you have endless possibilities of things to build"
23517,:)
23518,"love  make in game :D Xdxdxdxdxd Im game r pro subskribe to yT mi name is ...... .  Erorror
"
23519,Great Game I really hope the devs keep adding more content for survival.
23520,Play survival w me! Very fun! Creativity is rewarded. 10/10
23521,"FUN, FUN, FUN!"
23522,"The New Survival is Fun. little tough at the start. but over all very fun solo, but better with friends"
23523,"its cool





"
23524,"good but i cant join friends through steam for some reason
"
23525,How do i use a controller in survival?
23526,WE NEED DEDICATED SERVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
23527,"I really have enjoyed this game for the time I have had it. (About 3 days) The survival game mode is what compelled me to purchase the game. Despite a few minor bugs, it has been an awesome experience playing. I hope to see more features added for the survival. 

Please make the game available offline as I don't have a way for a continuous internet connection. As of right now, I have to start the ge while connected, and then instead of completely closing the game, I just minimize the window to bypass this."
23528,"I got this game in the earlier stages of early access, and it was very fun then. But now that the survival update has been released, my expectations have been vastly exceeded. Engineering your own vehicles and machines in this game is so fun, the physics are impressive and quite reliable. The survival experience is already very fun for the first public build and I'm sure it will get a lot better. Sadly, I don't have any friends who have this game so I haven't been able to try out the multiplayer but I'm sure it's fun."
23529,the best game i have ever played
23530,"I only play survival mode.
As of today (12.05.2020) the game is pretty much unplayable.

I'm playing with my roomate, on the same connection (400k) on 2 high end computers and the lagging is just unbearable.
Combat is just not enjoyable this way. 
There are tons of bugs too, it just overall feels, like an unfinished game. Very sad, because there clearly is potential.
For now we both decided to stop playing, because the fun we are having with it is  just not worth the frustration. 
Maybe we will resume in a couple of patches."
23531,"survival hard but epic

23532,i love love love this game
23533,Awesome game love the new survival mode
23534,"Is fun
"
23535,"Personally, it's to laggy to play right now. There are many glitches and it has shut down my friends computer multiple times and kicked me out of the game time and time again. The machines are just to laggy and glitchy. I'd recommend waiting a few months or so before buying, I hope they will fix it by then. Not worth it to buy now."
23536,good game
23537,Cant change settings. trash design
23538,Survival is pretty ebicc but a lil unplayable when with friends.
23539,I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this game for Survival until the developers figure out the direction they're taking it. Currently it's very sloppy and doesn't resemble a game designed to be enjoyable.
23540,LIKE

23549,A great survival game with a unique take on crafting and base building. I love finding and exploring the world. I also have really enjoyed exploring the rules of this world like what you can do with these machines that you craft. The only negatives are that the game can be a little grindy and that the darkness of nighttime seems impossible to deal with and many nights I find myself just waiting in game for the morning to come.
23550,YIS
23551,game is alot of fun and having a great time with some friends on it!
23552,"This game is a great balance of complexity, and simplicity. Within the first hour of play time, I was able to build a simple car. I slowly learned the mechanics, or the, Scrap Mechanics :P, and was able to build Rubik's cubes and useless switches. I could also make fully working FNAF offices and a AI path finder. After I did all that I could with the vanilla game, I found mods on the steam workshop. Some of these were, The Mod Pack (great mod btw), All of the other mod packs like the mod pack polygons, and the Legendary Mod pack. After I got bored with the mods, it turned out that the vanilla game had plenty of updates, they added explosives and spud guns, so I got a mod that added HP to the players so I could battle my friends. Finally, survival came out, the biggest update for the game. This update added so much to the game, so much, that I am still absorbing it all. I recommend this game to anybody who wants a easy building game, with a lot of future potential builds."
23553,it is fun
23554,"I started with the survival update, and for a game mode that is only a few days old, it is surprisingly stable and fun. It has a few necessary tweaks to go, but the devs appear to be updating and fixing very regularly. Creative mode also appears to be a lot of fun but I have yet to explore it fully."
23555,its very nice survival game
23556,"the new survival mode really gives the game a purpose, but i however dont see an ""endgame"" or a reason to play after youve made your first vehicle. i do however expect more updates and since this is early access, i have no right to complain"
23557,—è—à–∞ –±–∞–º–∑–µ
23558,"Don¬¥t really write reviews but here I am.
To make it short: the survival mode is really addicting especially with friends. You always want to do more than you can handle but thats the addicting part.
So definitly a recommended game also theres already good mod support for the survival mode so you basicly aren¬¥t limited with your ideas."
23559,I love this game
23560,great game so many posibilities runs well and i love it
23561,the best because you can play with other people
23562,this game let me drive the boat
23563,"Extremely fun to play. Instructions on how to play the game optimally were a bit vague however, with only 15 hours on this game so far, this adds to the overall enjoyability of the game. Very minor lag spikes plus other small glitches (which we can expect from an early access game) most of which have already been patched. Fun to play solo or with a wingman,

When it comes to houses, vehicles or machines, the number of possibilities are infinite. Great game!"
23564,"I've had this game on my wishlist for so long and finally took the plunge with the release of survival mode and am now regretting it. The UI is incredibly clunky and intuitive, the tutorial and in-game help all but non-existent and the movement makes me feel as if i'm moving slightly to the left rather than straight ahead. 

From a gameplay/survival mode point of view, there is nothing which other games don't already do better. I gave it a chance, too long for a refund otherwise this one would definitely be going back."
23565,"I would recommend this game to others, just needs otimized"
23566,gREAT
23567,Its a great game but in the first hour or so u dont know what you are doing but after that its so much fun
23568,Yes. It's a good game.
23569,"If you're buying for the creator mode, sure, go for it. If you're buying for the survival mode, it's a no from me. The survival mode feels more like an afterthought with forced, streamlined goals, rather than something akin to Rust or Minecraft. There's one resource that's based off of RNG drops on monsters, and you need an ABUNDANCE to make anything of use. You also have to keep your food/thirst bar up, which is typical in any survival mode, but your food bars get absolutely demolished in such a short amount of time. Want to make a farm so you don't have to rely on RNG food drops? Well have fun with robots being sent your way specifically to destroy your crops. It's a tending simulator more than it is a game."
23570,potato gun go brrrr
23571,trash game
23572,"My review:
..."
23573,This game is just epic. cartoon graphics but rely high quality. good fun recomended
23574,BONK
23575,"I brought scrap mechanic the over day and I have only played it once and it turn it's self off while I was playing it and now I can't play scrap mechanic anymore 
Anyone know why I can't play scrap mechanic anymore could you let me know please as I have now wasted money on a game that I only could play once I would appreciate if anyone knows what it could be wrong with it could let me know thanks"
23576,survival update is great
23577,Good game its worth the money
23578,"Bought this game a couple years ago, left it in my library after maybe an hour of play. Then, survival got announced and since the release my hours have gone up and up in this game. I actually love it, and have even delved into creative to build funky new vehicles and other contraptions. Definitely can be a little buggy, but dev support is there to get fixes out. If you're looking for a game to really push your ingenuity, this is the game to buy."
23579,i like the survival mode to the game because you have to grind to get the things you want
23580,"so, i bought the game to play the game, unfortunatly thats impossible. between the constant need for food and defending yourself. theres no time to have fun. just when u think ur all set to do something... no. you will need to defend or farm for fuel and then once thats done ur back to needing food and water and then fix what the robots have broken, then food and water more robots. i did eventually finish building a car. i go on a adventure to have my car all of a sudden want to spin the wheels on the bearing that steers. so i accelerate and the steering bearing just keeps spinning. hard to drive when you front wheels just go around in circles. i dont get how this game is 4 years old and suffers such a ridiculous problem. short version = make the game fun."
23581,gud

23586,"all of it
i love this game"
23587,"**UPDATED hours: 111.3 on Sep 06,2020**
Do I recommend this game? YES
the lag has been fixed tremendously, my friend and i can be as far apart as we can, there's still hiccups in terms of lag a few times, but nothing like how it was before. haven't had a crash in 7hours of continuous gaming (with one friend), and although there are still some bugs, it has come a LONG way since my first review. Only 4 months and the devs certainly make it worth playing! I have since made a new world due to my first one getting corrupted and unplayable. but since i started the new world, it's been a blast!


**FIRST REVIEW hours: 25.2 on May 12, 2020**
Do i recommend this game? Not right now, no... but i can tell you that, once ALL the bugs are fixed, THEN HECK YEAH!

my friend got me this game, and we enjoyed it so much we really want to play it! but multiplayer just isn't working great(solo has some stuttering now).

exploring the world, figuring out how to make a car with so little info and absolutely no tutorial (except for the billboard for farming), it has been a blast until the LAG started taking over. the more stuff/creations/explored areas we have in the world, the lag just kept getting worse and worse, til action response would take anywhere from 30seconds to 4minutes. yes we timed it! it got extra bad when we were apart! whats worse, we tried creating my world on our second day of playing and the game kept crashing soon after about the time i had 3 bots made(craft, food and refiner),then soon even when my friends would join (after the initial crash) it would crash again. it's sad that we can't play it together. even on solo, there's a little bit of a lag once in a while, and we've tried many solutions that google/forums and other sites could offer us. nothing has worked to ease the lag we have been experiencing. it's such a shame, we have such big plans with our worlds, but we can't do anything and are forced to play solo. survival is so much FUN when played with friends! so until the DEVs fix the servers(we believe it's the servers), don't get the game just yet.

solo was sad and lonely.......

what's even more sad and lonely was the creative mode (no water, no buildings, no berserk robots, no farming, no explore-able shanty towns and sci-fi structures, no woC's or glow bug pets that poop glow poop to make into glow sticks!), just you, a book and unlimited blocks."
23588,Very good
23589,"me and my friend just did a 10h session for our first time in this game, its amazing, it really is a must have in your collection, i have laughed so hard playing this that my ribcage hurts"
23590,Buy The Game Now!
23591,Simply no instructions what so ever how to play the game. sad cus i had high expectations.
23592,cool
23593,"Survival mode is really fun! 
The bots and bugs are annoying."
23594,its a very fun game its just amzing
23595,"This Game was my absolute favourite 3 years ago, so finding out that they actually released a survival mode!!! This is amazing, already the creative mode is absolutely playworthy but now this is THE game to play if you want to play an engineering game! So many possibilities and so much fun to have! :)"
23596,yes
23597,great snadbox game to play aroumd with. new survival game mode adds alot more substance to the game. you are able to build any shape or type of vehicle you want from scratch. great game highly recommended! is a must buy espicially for the price.
23598,"a lot of fun to mess around in but beware there is a lot of complex things needed to be done
"
23599,5
23600,my favorite game

23602,"GREAT GAME TO PLAY

23603,Great fun
23604,Good game.
23605,yes
23606,"i just started playing this game and i been going non stop. the survival is freaking amazing, i dont know how the game was for just creative but i do know that i am now addicted. some things dont make allot of sense and there is no direction as to what to really do and going on youtube is kinda pointless if you are trying to find something on the map because every map is random. besides that i love this game and i cant get enough lol. i now have a car thats fast and a car that can just carry heavy stuff that i am going to make a mining rig. damn this dame is just so good man. and im a 30yr old man and this does not fill childish, its intense and you always have a reason to get on and play. but the devs need to add more stuff quick also (you get hungry and thirsty wayyyy to fast considering the type of survival mechanics this game has) when its fixed it will be almost perfect."
23607,"I have loved this game ever since i bought it, it is a lot of fun just to mess about."
23608,"The game is rather fun, especially with friends.  the only problem I have faced at this moment is some lag in multiplayer, but the developers have said the they are working on a fix and that more content are on the way."
23609,20/20 Most difficult and linear game progression I've ever played with. You always will work for your stuff.
23610,"while playing scrap mechanic survival i accidentally created 3 connect tools cause i thought i clicked on something else and i wasnt paying attention and clicked collect on one of them and then i realised it was a connect tool and i couldnt throw it out so it was stuck in my inventory and i didnt wanna take out the other tools cause then i would have inventory slots i couldnt even use cause you cant throw out tools :( 

please make a feature so u can throw out tools"
23611,"jkl;


"
23612,tHIS IS A VERY GOOD AND FUN GAME(oops had caps lock on)
23613,"i would definently recommend this game, most of the problems i had got fixed but the rest arent too bad, like lag in a server with 4or more people"
23614,still very buggy. would not buy
23615,Runs a lot smoother with the latest patches. Now we just need a beacon or something to attach to bases so its easier to find your way back.
23616,yeet
23617,"I followed Scrap Mechanic closely for many years - having a great time as I did it. The lack of updates always bummed me out but I just accepted it as the reality.

Then the Survival update came out.

Are you **kidding me**

This update is unbelievably brilliant - I'm amazed at the amount of content dropped at once - easily far more then I would have expected from them releasing frequent, small updates all these years. This game is a blast, the mechanisms are simple to learn but have unbelievable potential."
23618,this is my new favourite game
23619,Lots to learn but once you get the jist of it all it becomes non stop!
23620,"I'm going to write a review for the first time in many years just to reach these developers as they have made a great game that I really enjoy playing with my friends. 

You want to make goofy shit with your buds?           This game is for you. 
Does it offer something unique?                 Absolutely. 
Tons of playability?                    Yep. 

So why the hell am I writing this? Because despite this masterpiece of a game and relatively great day 1 / day 2 survival experience. 

- There is a bit of an issue with server lag during raids (Which I am sure they are aware of.)
- Food is not the hardest thing to get, people complain about it a lot, I don't think it's a problem personally except for the fact that the above complaint really does not help because to get food, you have to lag your ass off to fight a horde of robots, that may destroy your food or vehicles during the time they raid.
- My biggest grievance though so far.... is the lack of renewable energy. I ABSOLUTELY cannot understand why there is no automated oil or anything to that effect. Getting oil is tedious as the only way to get it is to swim for miles to stock up on oil, which bigger machines guzzle up like it's nothing. The end game at this game state should revolve around your creations, and you can't really power them up without a tedious oil grind. I might not even have this problem if I could even recharge batteries and use a metric butt ton of electric engines.... I can't even do that though. Even if you gave us the slowest oil automation, I wouldn't mind grinding away 2 days for a machine that gave me 1 oil a minute. Anything is better than this. I want to make my cars. Sure, piston engines are a thing that you can make, but by design they do not have nearly enough thrust to make them viable for bigger builds. 

Otherwise, this is a good game, it's worth the money, the developers are transparent on twitter, I am happy with my purchase, I hope this is all fixed soon."
23621,GOOD
23622,yes
23623,I have to say the game LOOKS great.  The survival gameplay is RUBBISH.  As many others suggested (after I bought this turd) the food and water system leaves you looking for eats and running out before your plants actually grow for harvest.  The loot you pick up is indescript and the gameplay is REALLY lacking in survival mode.  Games like this need to ease the player into more difficulty.  The help tab was a nice thought but not really as helpful as one would hope.  As someone who has a full time professional job I don't have hours and hours to figure out all of the mechanics of a game.  Call me short sighted of impatient but spending 30 minutes exploring to end up dying 4 times (all without an actual map you carry) got annoying REALLY quickly.  The trailers look GREAT.  I have no idea where that gameplay is.  I felt like I bought a toy based off of the commercial and I'm already wanting to throw it in the garage sale free box.  Wished I could do a refund but I know that's not happening.
23624,retty goood
23625,","
23626,"lo compre por comprar un juego nuevo, no sabia nada de este juego, y realmente es muy buen juego lo recomiendo"
23627,"Don't buy this game right now. Don't get me wrong its a great game, but that is the problem because it is such a great game i just want to play it all the time. It just simply has too many problems with it in its current form as of 5/11/20. There were many bugs and issues we ran into that took away from the fun and immersion but when a car that took 4 hours to build just disappeared while trying to place it on the lift that was it. That was when me and my 3 friends exited game hopefully to look back in 9 months to a beautifully polished piece of scrap that we can take and make our own. 

TLDR: fun game, but its in beta so be warned if buying now there will be bugs. Glad I purchased but only if the game gets better from here.

EDIT: after putting in an aditional 300 hours into this game in its current state I can indeed say that this game is still fun even despite some issues. Just beware suspension they are crazy!"
23628,"It's a lot of fun, can easily become addicting, I mean it lags so bad, and there's so many bugs, and yet i didn't quit playing. Thumbs up to that. From the point you're reading i'm sure they've improved the game a lot."
23629,ITS AMAZINGF
23630,"We're having a ton of fun with this game, me and 8 of my friends.  Just needs to work on the lag, there's tons of lag when the robots spawn and when using elevators in the ""dungeon"" building.  Otherwise super fun making vehicles and parking garages and giant harvesting vehicles!"
23631,nice
23632,"The survival mode is awful. Completely irredeemably terrible. Near unplayable. It gives 0 direction, combat is samey and boring, and it's overall, a tedious, boring chore to play. 

The creative mode on the other hand, is incredibly fun, with lots of ways to use the parts and tools at your disposal. It's very open, and rewards creativity in a particularly satisfying way. Though slightly janky at times, it is still very enjoyable to just make whatever pops into your head, figuring out how to accomplish what you set out to do. It does, however, have a somewhat limited selection of parts, but all that does bolster your creativity, requiring you to think outside the box to get your creation running. Essentially, it is what every sandbox game should try to be.

Overall, it is definitely worth your time, energy, and money. 
Just avoid the survival mode."
23633,"fun game love giggles physics

23634,"If you're thinking of purchasing this game for the survival mode, please stay away."
23635,its a fun s game the a fun c game so i think its the best game i played

23641,nice nice nice!!!
23642,game is just amazing.
23643,ITS FUN
23644,ITS GUD
23645,This is some of the most fun I've had in awhile in any game. 100% recommend this! You can literally create anything.
23646,"Multiplayer synchronization needs some work, but the rest is awesome. Really nice survival mode for casuals with the option to turn it into a crazy defense battle. I really like the balancing and the survival map feels nice too, much nicer than what the creative mode had us expecting. The game offers the players enough time to explore the map, before the need to plant food/the survival mechanic kicks in. Recently I often tried games with my fiancee, but most games failed to be fun for us. The games we tested, often offered the option to build a base, but often the base is either untouchable, useless or both. I like that in this game the difficulty is set by the players and their base. Want comfortable food? Fight for it. Need advanced stuff? Search the¬†world for it. I love the idea of the evil farm bots, that only attack in waves, when you do something ""forbidden"". The base is practically always in danger/destructible, but not as unfair as in for example Arc. We had a blast in this game from the get go, like never before. Visually pleasant and very well done game mechanics. We love the building system, it is a nice mix of minecraftish blocks and whole structures, but whose¬†placings are not restricted into¬†huge blocks. You can just reuse everything (unless it was destroyed by the farm bots), so you don't loose resources when trying things out. Ram usage is much lower than we expected and it also runs well on older hardware (xeon 1230v3 and gtx 780). I really hope the devs will put a lot more time into the game, just for more world gimmicks/to make exploring even more fun.

- feels adventurous
- it is fun exploring the map and the map does not yet feel too small as other comments said
- again .. I love the wave mechanic, it is so great that we can decide when we want to defend 
  and fight or when we just want to explore. 
- even building the first verhicles is very fun and they are already quite useful

CONS: 
- Everything looks nearly the same, not that there is not enough diversity, but you will find the 
 same buildings, big stones in lakes and trees and biomes with very similar layouts, which 
 makes it incredibly hard to find your old base without a compass or map. (We wasted nearly 
 3h today just to retrieve what we produced yesterday .. in 3-4h, because after picking up what 
 we lost, we were not able to find the old base) 
- needs a ssd or you will have a lot of loading stutters, but they will decline over time, so it is 
  not unplayable but a lot more enjoyable
- I would really like to have a map or at least a compass

PS: With more hours ingame, I will further update."

23663,Good
23664,"Great game. I love all the game mechanics. With the incorporation of survival mode now, this gives the game a whole new mechanics which makes even more fun to play alone and with friends."
23665,"I love the physics. You not only have to bust down a tree with a hammer, but also have to break the tree into sections (that are cylindrical and don't roll). They are then broken down even further into half cylinder sections (also don't roll), then finally you get a 4X4, that rolls.... makes perfect sense! i love it. Seriously though it's a great game, can't wait to see what else is planned. Maybe some items like coffee or an energy drink/boost can be added in the future to give your character a possible speed or damage boost. Especially if you don't have a mobile base and you died quite far from your spawn location."

23667,good

23669,"Great game, especially if you have friends! basically bug free and content loaded!!! what more can you ask for?"
23670,"The game itself is very fun, in both creative and survival. There is lots to do but currently creative is kind of lacking. It doesn't have the same items as survival and a cheated survival world feels more like creative than actual creative. They have been putting lots of effort in to bug fixes and I can now happily say that I can recommend the game once again. There is lots to do and with the addition of code mods (kind of annoying that survival doesn't have full mod support), you can really be creative and make some awesome machinery. The optimization has improved a ton and this game has tons of awesome things to grind for. Making fully automated systems are super fun and it's a great game to play with friends."

23680,"This game really isn't ready for Multiplayer yet. There are no dedicated servers and there are so many bugs its unplayable. I spent 8 hours making a piston powered motor yesterday got into it today, drove 30 feet and it just vanished."

23686,"MULTIPLAYER IS UNPLAYABLE!!!

I received this as a gift from my younger brother with hopes of playing with him. I joined his world and he started teaching me the basics of the game but I quickly realized that there was a solid 5-10 seconds before any input from my mouse or keyboard was received. Kinda weird considering we are on the same router via Ethernet. My download speed is around 1GBs and my upload speed is 100MBs. This is unplayable. Early access means that a game will have its flaws yet this seems to be a basic function of other ""multiplayer"" games. Minecraft had better multiplayer in 2009 while in beta and that was made by a couple people. This is straight up fraud, blatant false advertising! How the fuck do you fuck up something so simple and basic??? It's comparable to fucking up the front menu, like what if the front menu just didn't work but don't worry it is in early access so its fine guys. At least let us host the fucking servers. It should take a day to fix something so fucking simple, and if the dev team is having a hard time with it then they need to re-approach the way multiplayer works or they need a new fucking dev team. and i think the latter of the two is the correct choice. I am pretty sure a quadriplegic could write better code by smashing their head into the keyboard. 

if you can put aside the whole multiplayer thing aside then the game seems like an enjoyable game. 

If you are thinking about getting the game, DON'T! if this is a ""early access"" thing that needs to be fixed I'm scared what else they probably fucked up. ITS BEEN in development since 2016!!!! This game gives off DayZ vibes were the dev team is just made up of a bunch of wild monkeys who don't reinvest the money into the game. 

FIX THIS FOR FUCK SAKE!"
23687,do you know da way
23688,"The survival is a bit buggy still, but the future is bright for content updates."
23689,Its good. Give it a try. Survival is really fun. Hope there will be more Content coming soon.
23690,Best game ever

23694,A LOAD OF FUN WITH FRIENDS OR ALONE
23695,it is FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
23696,This game is so fun! I love that you can create any thing you can imagine. and the new survival is a little hard to understand at the start . but you can look up a guide and learn how to get started in the new survival mode. and it was 100% worth the price. this game is for sure one of my favorite games
23697,"I don't know about creative, and don't really care, but if you're planning on buying this for survival multiplayer - hold out on it. The experience is not rewarding or fun in any way at the moment.

Oh, except for walking up to swinging doors, hitting them with a hammer and getting ragdolled. I laughed so hard I gasped for air.

Also, this game seems to already have a rabid following who get triggered at every negative review left here, to me this only goes to show that the positive reviews should probably be taken with a grain of salt, as there doesn't seem to be a culture of healthy critique towards the development of the game, which at the moment feels like an early alpha."
23698,I have only played the survival but it's a fun little game. More fun if you play survival with a friend or two.
23699,it is trash
23700,"it good game
"
23701,Its very fun and I hope other people can get into it
23702,"I love this game. Creating machines and the like is a blast. It isn't without bugs though. They are so few and far between that they are easily ignored. The creative mode is great. Survival is as well; however, I believe it is unplayable till a map is added. It is way to easy to get lost and the map is pretty large. Using certain points of interest is useless since there are only like 5 POI that can even spawn so you may think that shanty is close to your base but in reality it is across the map. Since the map is also random then it compounds the issue. This game is a solid 8/10. When a map is added to survival,  this will be my go to survival game."
23703,much pro game

23712,"Ugh, the amount of creativity is mind boggling. I love the building and connecting system! Yes, there are a couple bugs, but they're not game breaking by any means. Some are quite hilarious, actually. 

I have more hours logged into this than what Steam says, probably closer to 100. With that being said, I still don't know the half of it when it comes to the sheer amount of things you can create. 

I recently found out that you can power a vehicle without any engines whatsoever.. 

Ha, that's cute... Really wish I knew that a long time ago.. lol


*SO*

It's on sale for like 15 bucks after tax.. Take some of that Stimulus cheese and get it.. 

YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED (assuming you like these types of games..)

Oh, yeah. I was referring to Creative Mode while making this review. They just put in Survival, and.. 

Well, take all of what was previously stated, add a dash of tasty survival with a delicious back story, and bake it at 350 F until golden. Voila!

Multiplayer is fun as well."

a new idea.. got bugs but I see a better future for this game than all the other"

23717,good
23718,:)
23719,Fun game just play it mans
23720,The game is actually very good but the multiplayer is very clunky and needs some work the only way you can have fun in multiplayer is if your the host of the game
23721,"The game itself is great, the survival aspect is not. There is not much to really do besides your creativity. The progression is fairly small and there is like only 3 types of enemies with 3 types of shooting weapons. If you are buying this game to try survival, don't expect it to be good in the beginning because you basically need to know a lot about how scrap mechanic works through creative before jumping into survival. One thing to note also is that the buildings that are randomly generated are very repetitive. Graphics look like fortnite, nothing special, sounds are alright. Its quite gpu intensive and has pretty cool ways to make vehicles. Just please don't buy it for the survival, and buy it for the game mechanics/creative"
23722,i mean its pretty cool so idk :/
23723,Yes.
23724,I fun
23725,"NOTE: I played solo in Survival mode

Do you like figuring out basic gameplay loops and features though trial and error?
Do you like having to get your character a drink every 10-15 minutes?
Do you like navigating via landmarks since there is no map and no compass, nor any way to make or obtain a map or compass?
Do you like surprise attacks by robots that must be part ninja since they make no sound when moving?
Do you like building hilariously ramshackle vehicles that are sometimes hard to control, yet are charming in their own special way?
Do you like alien cows with wobbly bits on their heads?

If you answered ""Yes"" to these questions, then Scrap Mechanic is the game for you!"
23726,good game
23727,cool game
23728,The survival starts a bit slow and lacks direction but once you start to figure stuff out the snow balling really hits it off. I enjoy the game and have found it relaxing to play. The combat isn't bad and the customization of the stuff you can build is stunning. If you enjoy survival building games you should give this one a try!
23729,"Been looking for a new survival sandbox game. Been searching Minecraft mod packs for ages..never finding one thats just right. This game scratches that itch. You have chill farming, tower defence like waves to defend your crops, exploration, loot runs, building, tech...it has it all. Looking forward to seeing where this game goes with updates. Definatly recommend."
23730,best game ever and worth the price
23731,yeah aight
23732,"Good game, would recommend, few issues though.  First off, starvation is way too bad and cotton is rare so you can't even make a respawn bed easily.  Tape-bots are WAY too strong, doing 55 damage, they also are ranged and shoot rather fast...  At least they go down really easily, one potato or two and they're dead.

The game overall isnt bad though, you can make vehicles, traps, entire bases block by block, there's farming, combat, and a lot more."
23733,This game is AMAZING i really love this game! I think if you play games like MineCraft then i really think you would like this game.
23734,its gd
23735,"Its kind a good game, believe me"
23736,Love this game wish it had a map or a compass fun to play and spend hours in the game

23748,YES
23749,"So far, really enjoying the game! I love the mechanics, graphics and world and it has So much awesome potential! Right now, the biggest complaints I have are only about multiplayer, which I know is new, so I'm sure it'll get more sorted out. Its definitely a bit buggy with other players, and I so desperately wish there were dedicated servers. I Love the game though. Can't wait to see where it goes! Keep those updates coming! I'll gladly support!"
23750,oui
23751,"awesome game, its been a long time since i've been focused in a game"
23752,its just addictive tbh

23754,Survival good.
23755,You will love it
23756,chairmanship unquenchable subsidiary candidate xjvahdvw
23757,"I'll make this quick. 

Pros: A wonderful outlet for creativity. You like building in Minecraft and other games? You will enjoy this. You can build anything you want, block by block. You can download things other people have built and share your own creations as well. The added survival mode has given the game a much needed 'reason to play' and things to do. 

Con: LAG! This game lags to the point where it becomes unplayable. If the dev team don't find a way to fix this, this game will die off. While in creative mode, the more things you build the more and more lag you'll find. Up to the point where the game stutters to a stop. I tried playing survival with my son, and we had a never ending lag fest there as well. The host is fine, but who ever joins them gets a rubber banding lag to them. Please Axolot, FIX THIS. Survival with an online buddy seems to work fine, as a friend and I played lag free.

TLDR: Like creating stuff, you'll like this. Prepare for lag."
23758,cool
23759,"If you like the idea of building your own mechanical contraptions to move around, to protect the base, to water plants, or to do anything that you can think of, including testing, improving, failing, and discovering that the thing that you want to build is impossible to build in this game,
then this game is for you.

But if you dont like a game where you would feel like so much important things are missing, then i'd recommend you to buy it later, just follow the news."
23760,Gud Game.
23761,great game so much fun!
23762,"lots of stuff you can customize to fit you. runs well so far as well... hasn't dropped below 120fps (which I limited to) and no crashes.

"
23763,"This is just minecraft but made for children go back to mining diamonds if you want a real challenge at least thats what I will be doing as an adult white male in north america. I cannot be stopped I will not be stopped feel the bern as you allocate resources amoungst your gamer friends and by that i mean farming materials for 3 hours only to have your closest friend and brother wife spend all the metal making his 5th go kart which he then loses to a hay bot. Dope game also has a very interesting and highly customizable water pump system that will improve your multiplayer session greatly.

9 failed attempts to save my garden out of a possible 12fps"
23764,"This is the first survival game I've really gotten to sit down and get into. I so far have enjoyed it very much. Some bugs here and there that need to be fixed but overall very fun. The building is very intuitive and the amount of creation that I have experienced so far is limitless. It is a lot of learning on the go, but it is worth it."
23765,"Plain ol fun. AI isn't that challenging but the game itself is fun, good introduction for younger crowds I guess. 

My only complaint so far is the refining time is super slow and the amount of bots could be more considering they are a prime source of needed materials. Get's hard to find materials with 4 people playing."
23766,This game is basically single player because the servers are trash. Anyone who is not the host will lag the entire time.
23767,"played 2 nights with my buddy... damn its fun! - it has a lot of the building and thinking from minecraft.. but it feels alot more fun! it feels like you're dropped in the middle the movie Robots! it's great fun that it is robots and not zombies for once! 
it seems there are endless posibilities in this game.. how to build, what to build. 
if you like building games, exploration games and a bit of survival.. get this! if you have friends to play with.. GET THIS GAME NAO! 
"
23768,"Like Ratchet and Clank meets Mine-craft, had a child, but better!"
23769,this game is the perfect mix of creative and survival
23770,is big fun yes very
23771,"Great game, but sometimes it crashes randomly, without any lag before."
23772,"it is fun
"
23773,"The game was really fun as just creative, but the new survival mode is great and really, really fun. If you've liked games like space engineers, the redstone-y side of minecraft, or trailmakers you'll love this game too"

[h1] The Ultimate Sandbox!!! [/h1]

To date the best sandbox I have ever played,
+ Can give you a lot of hours in Survival (more if it's with friends)
- The negative part is that the way to obtain some resources like fuel (Gas and Batteries) its so difficult especially metal.

[b] Bugs i have found [/b]
- Sometimes textures take seriously time to load
- When in Coop Mode [Survival], some players get in a great lag
- Occasionally when other player eats it gets in T-pose
- At times you stop listening to the game audio suddenly
- And when you enter to a lake or ocean sounds like a great meme (earrape)

[b] Personal Impressions [/b]

in Creative Mode 9/10
-You can¬¥t cut threes in this mode

in Survival Mode 7/10
-few bugs mess up the game experience

*As a personal opinion i think It would be really great if they added maps, scuba diving items, more forms of energy (like solar panels) not only the gas and batteries because there are so limited items."
23776,"I had my eye on this game for years... Survival is out and its fantastic!

built a diamon sword with wheels

23786,This game is obviously still in development but has great potential for greatness and further interest. I'm anxious to see how the rest of the game will be developed and how the multiplayer function will work with the creations that each player creates. The game does need a little more instruction in regards to tutorials and purpose when roaming around trying to find the next thing to do in this graphically pleasant world.
23787,yes
23788,really good
23789,this game is fun but laggy but after a bit you get used to it and its very fun.

23818,"Scrap Mechanic... Now were do i start

I Bought SM back in 2018 The game needed some work but it was still in its early phases. i did the usual attempt to build a car and fail, then i found that scrap mechanic had a workshop and thats where this game took off for me finding all these amazing creations and builds blew my mind i proceeded to play over 200 hours of this game just by looking at stuff off the workshop. 2 years later survival releases and i play over 40 hours in 1 week and have continued to enjoy SM through the Years. Overall SM is a slightly buggy game but being able to enjoy other peoples builds and Mods have been worth my 20$.
The Devs of SM usually listen to there community such as we WANT OIL they gave us oil. If you are thinking should i buy SM? YES the answer is yes theres just so much to explore in the workshop and the possibilities you can create are endless.

23819,"I am waiting for Multiplayer Update , i will play with others such a game :)"
23820,another promising game turned survival....ugh
23821,very fun game to play with friends. countless of things to do and very fun survival game also
23822,"is neat
"
23823,.
23824,it's good
23825,It good
23826,Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
23827,Fun way to waste a few dozen hours building lots of CRAZY things
23828,"Game is solid, there is a sense of progression to be had, and the gameplay is responsive. The game does reward creative engineering to solve certain problems, but not all of them. That said, the game has its share of bugs, which varies in severity. 

Where this game begins to have trouble is with the early play experience. It can be difficult to simply ""learn"" for yourself where things are, what certain things do, etc. For my experience, I had to watch a video explaining simply where to find a key location as it wasn't explained very well. The clip was only 6 seconds long, but solved an issue I had that lasted about 20 minutes. This isn't a game where you should simply ""wander aimlessly"", and you will find your experience to be less than rewarding simply because of that. The game wants you to find these things in a certain order, but if you should happen to get poor world-gen, you may get lost.

picking out a location to set up your base can also be a bit of a mixed bag, as that depends on world generation. You can't edit terrain in Survival, so setting up soil plots in a ideal and defensible location can be hit or miss. It goes without saying that your plants need water.

Building is good fun, and you can build a lot of different vehicles and machines using various forms of logic allowing for automation, or for certain tasks. However, you shouldn't build until you are confident the machine you are building won't get torn down for parts later. 

Is the game good? Yeah, it is good fun. Enemy variety is there, though more enemy types would be cool, and there is a progression system in place. It is (obviously) better with friends to play with in survival or creative. However, the game is also shallow, and the new player experience can be difficult to grasp. If you like building survival games, this may be something worth investigating to see if you may like it. I personally, despite the issues mentioned, have enjoyed the new update so far, love the aesthetics (things like the guns and ammo-projectiles could use a VFX update), and the soundtrack (would love to see more songs on the radio).

Edit: Fixed some grammatical errors.

Note: I am not certain if it was part of the base-game, but during earlier years it was possible to add a gyro to help stabilize flying vehicles in creative. It would be a great quality of life addition to see a Gyro-Stabilizer added (back?) to the game, especially in survival. As it stands, while thrusters are neat, they simply are too unwieldy to utilize without glitches and serve very niche uses. As always, additional blocks, parts, and logic would always be welcome. Underwater-based vehicles are not feasible due to how water works in this game (A plane that expands infinitely down), but It would be nice to see some form of underwater vehicles become a thing.

The majority of parts and lights are primarily aesthetic only, and serve no purpose for plants (outside of defensive purposes). It would be neat to see light fixtures that have a set light amount/radius/brightness that positively impact the growth of plants within said radius. These lights could be very fragile and found in green-house like buildings. Planters would also be a neat (rare and semi-costly) addition to help those who may have uneven terrain plant seeds where-ever. Boxed Planters would be a carried object, similar to Robot legs and filled chests, requiring a vehicle to transport. When moved, the player would unbox the planter, where it cannot be relocated until it gets boxed again (maybe Tape from tape bots with some folded boxes?). These additions would be nice for players to have, and would offer some additional end-game content to chase after. Alternatively, these greenhouses could become hard-to-defend bases (no water barrier or mountain barrier), with more aggressive raids when farming within the greenhouse."
23829,"Yes, dont rage when you ruhn out of water because it like you have a contant 10 stage disentary up you ass. Other than that, I love this game!"
23830,"I really like this game, i really enjoy it but there are a lot of bugs."
23831,"7/10

The game is pretty and promising. However, I feel like it is lacking some content, especially things to explore. I've only played Survival for 5 hours so far, but that is my impression. Perhaps add some elaborate caves and thicker forests with hidden beauties in the center. More robots would be nice. The game is Early Access and I hope more things are added quickly. Especially if the devs feel comfortable adding sales to attract people.

Edit: After playing some Creative Mode I realize now the game has a big system for customization and creating inventions. Derp. I think it is amazing! But I will stand by what I stated earlier. That as someone who prefers Survival, I still hope for more focus there. 

I have not checked out mods/workshop just yet. And I want to make it clear that the game is worth it(which I base on getting it for 50% off) despite a lackluster Survival mode."
23832,This game feels really polished for being in beta. The engineering aspect is very gratifying as you move from a barely functioning scrap vehicle to a mobile mining / gathering beast of a vehicle.
23833,"It's a fun environment and theme, I enjoyed playing it with others.  I'm looking forward to hours and hours of experimentation and a dedicated server."

23835,"hello
"
23836,","
23837,New gamemode is a bit grindy and has a bit of bugs but is vary enjoyable and I really like it.
23838,i love the game because of its because and the way it feels
23839,build fun good yes
23840,i think this game is great it is like minecraft but so much better and you can make cars and there's a survival
23841,it gudd
23842,Survival mode is really fun and time consuming.
23843,this is cool
23844,"This game is very fun. Although I received as a gift I would definitely say worth the money. There are bugs and performance issues that I hope will get ironed out, but as far as early access games go I would say I'm definitely impressed with Scrap Mechanic. There is the potential to be very creative."
23845,"Buggy, laggy. Things in my inventory, on the ground and in chests randomly disappear. The ""rules and laws"" of the game seem to change without notice. I'll come back later when the survival part has been smoothed out."
23846,"Great game, even on my garbo of a potato it runs well. Of course there is A LOT of input lag and sometimes lag in general, but its playable. Would be nice if I could exchange more quality for fps though."
23847,"so much fun, love this game"
23848,"Very watered down version of Garry's Mod.  The progression in the Survival Mode was pretty frustrating and needlessly drawn out with big open expanses of useless map and painfully long ""refining"" animations, on top of being confused on what to do next to the point I had to look online to figure out what to do. I was hoping the Farmbots attacking your crops would make for a better base building experience and add a sense of urgency to upgrade ASAP, but I honestly couldn't stomach the slow pacing to get to that point.  Soon as I planted my first few crops only to realize that I had forgotten to pick a spot close to one of the designated pools of water, I gave up.  I wasn't about to carry 2 buckets of water back and forth on a several 5+ minute one way trips until I had 12 watered crops in the hopes someone would attack me.  

Sandbox mode was fun for a minute; building a functioning car that doesn't flip over every 5 seconds was enjoyable, but I can't imagine going through the pain of trying to build it on survival mode.  I seem to have lost my patience with this sort of stuff, I don't know.  Hard to go from Half-Life Alyx to this, I guess I'm spoiled.  Not a fair comparison, I know.

I'm kind of starting to hate these massive barren maps after playing through Alyx, where the maps are small, easily digestible, and have a ton of detail and love put into them.  There's no wasted space with it.  Everywhere you look there's something to take in and appreciate.  I know that's not really a fair comparison, they are completely different games after all.  But still, that's how I feel.  I'm pretty sure this game is at it's best when you're dicking around in Creative Mode, but that's not my sorta game.  Personally I need clear direction and incentive.

Once again, as with every god damn game under the sun right now, there's certainly a lot of potential here.  And maybe after 5 major updates it will be a grand ol' time.  But nah, not right now, not for me.  It did make me want to go play GMod though."
23849,it is really slow and complicated but if you take your time you my in joy it
23850,i like the game allot but it still has some problems but its s lot of fun so try it out
23851,fantastic game 10/10 would buy again if my steam account corrupts
23852,it goooooooooooooooooooooooood
23853,"i think its realy good
"
23854,"I love this game. It is a lot of fun.  I only have one complaint; There is so much lag.  I will say I don't have the best pc, but even after trying to change settings and graphics, I could barely get 15 fps."
23855,Honestly just dull
23856,perfect thanks axolot
23857,good
23858,"Survival mode is neat, but pretty weak as is, try it out for a couple hours but stick to other games until this mode gets a lot more content and polish. 

The Pros:
+I keep finding myself loading the game and trying to build my silly ideas.
+Although limited in many aspects you can create a bunch of amazing stuff ***if you mod it.

Cons:
-The tools the game provides just are not up to par with most creation based games and you will find yourself wishing for more features you'll find in most other design programs/games.

-Editing anything is a chore and extremely difficult.  You're better off starting from scratch or deleting the majority of your project.

-The game does not have an ""undo"" function.  This is a big deal because you may delete a connecting part ""THINKING"" it was still connected by a different piece and you'll watch the whole section fall of your project and you're SOL unless you saved your project recently.

-You cannot grab parts.  *there is a ""weld"" function used to join parts together which I thought would be useful but it is not.  Due to the fact you can only press 1 button to cycle through rotation options and you cannot tell the game which side of block you want to mount said piece you will find most often you will never be able to join sections together where you want.  So, you end up rebuilding everything.

You may be able to get away with less rebuilding by constantly saving your project as a blueprint so you don't start over completely (again even this isn't that simple)."
23859,Gud
23860,good
23861,It's amazing! Fun fun fun! And fun!
23862,Great game. With the survival update I am hooked once again!
23863,Pretty damn fun so far!
23864,"Love the game, allows the player to be very creative in how they build whatever their heart desires."
23865,"Got this game with my friend the other day and I really enjoy it. Yes there are a bugs, but that is expected in early access games and it doesn't bother me. I really look forward to the future updates that are to come."
23866,"a mechanical version of minecraft, it is much more enjoyable playing with friends. but you can still have loads of fun on youre own. Enjoy"
23867,"let's just say, iz gud"
23868,"I like the graphics and physics, also the gameplay."
23869,GHFG
23870,pretty dank would recommend

23872,its a fun game and new the survival mode is amazing
23873,Good game
23874,"Game constantly crashes on start-up.
Verified cache & reinstalled, but that didn't help. It's a shame that I have to leave a bad (and my first ever) review considering I have been looking forward to playing this for a while.
Getting a refund."
23875,:)
23876,"I feel as if they gave quite a good attitude to the game.
Farming has now become illegal.
Bots makes cute noises and its just pleasing to play. 
Creativity is endless as usual. 
They could still add more fun stuff to the game, but its not missing any for now.
Ive played 2 different saves with about over 12 hours in each, in survival mode. And i have yet to see everything. just messing around, gathering resources and building stuff. 
I have to say, survival hooked me up real good with this game. it finally bring a sense of purpose for every item in the game now that you have to craft stuff and feed yourselfs. Its just way more fun now then ever.
The game felt quite fairly balanced, ignoring the illegal farming... (that just annoys me)

Keep in mind, ITS STILL AN EARLY ACCESS. 
It will have bugs like it or not, but from my experience, it was quite slim, and those that i encountered will most likely get fixed in the upcoming updates. 

I lost a box of material under the map once, and ever since ive been careful at how i place my vehicles and such because sometimes item placement can go in weird directions which would spawn whatever you are placing, under the map. 

For the price, id say grab it, its a very fun game and with friends its even better. Theres enough stuff to do to keep you busy, and if your imagination isnt limiting you, then you can create stuff endlessly. 

"
23877,nc
23878,This game has come a long way.  It keeps getting better and better with each update.  Lots of development support.  Devs keep adding new features and new gameplay modes for free.   Artistic style is very unique.  Very fun and relaxing game.  Most recent survival mode made game a lot more fun to play giving more purpose to the things you are building.
23879,"finally got this game on sale when survival came out, by far one of the best physics based games ever"
23880,FZDXGHJNBHGJIO;
23881,"i mean, i dont have enought hours on the game to give it a propper rating but at times it for some reason runs about as well as stephen hawking."
23882,vary fun but kinda grindy
23883,here is the key to life in this game
23884,yes
23885,"This game was so much FUN 
I have 300 hrs of gameplay and i would play this game every day after work 
but one thing that always turned me down was the lag issues.
This problem has been issued for a very long time but still hasnt been fix at all
In this case, i cannot recommend the game  because as soon as you make too much mechanic going on at the same time, it will lag like crazy, and i mean it CRAZY that the game is unplayable. Dont even mention Multiplayer, tried to play the game with my friend, my game just deleted the game. 
Its probably been almost more than a year before i quit the game, but i've heard the lag issues didnt changed at ALL and not much content has been updated ever since the day i stop playing the game. 
It is sad to leave a negative game for such a game i played and loved so much. 
The game had so much potential but the optimization of the game such bottom :("
23886,Well survival is prett awesome.
23887,This game is so fun to just mess around with friends in. The ability to have a group work on a single project is very nice.
23888,nice
23889,Survival is hella fun
23890,"I want to like this game, I want to enjoy this game but it seems I cannot play it. I got a good 4-5 hours of gaming in with a buddy of mine who also purchased it at the same time. We had a blast building and learning in this game. Then my buddies game started to get real choppy. He'd disconnect and come back into issues. Then my game did the same thing. Now whenever I load it up, it just stutters and I can't move. It's a real shame because we were both having a really good time. If they can get this issue fixed, this would totally be a recommended Scrap Mechanic,  but as it is right now, I can't recommend it."
23891,cant play it keeps crashing help......... stll cant play crashes bugsplat report 17/5/2020
23892,"Very good game, includes multiple amazing things."
23893,Survival Mode is fun with friends
23894,its just cool and you should play it
23895,bom demai
23896,"This game has come along and it's great to see how much time they have put into it. I just have to say, The game has had some good polish and things work fairly well. The physics is wonky as with all physics games but that's what you get for trying to simulate something on a little wafer with infinitely less complexity compared the reality we experience. It's about the same kind of game as ""Whatever""-Engineers or Factory games just low on the Factory and more on making kinetic and actual mechanical means to get things done to an extent... but most things are just put inventories on it and set it to craft. The types of things you can do will keep you busy for hours. 

Most things are fleshed out and the enemy bots move pretty smartly. They can be hard to hit but I think most things are calculated as a chance to hit, such as building blocks, instead of a damage or health amount. That makes sense, because you don't have to have a variable keeping track of every single block in the worlds health. 

The sound is really quiet compared to everything, so I find headphones a must for a lot of things. The funny thing is, most games that have either too little sound or too much sound need to hire an actual sound engineer or producer to use the engines built in audio systems which can boost and cut based on the need. Gotta billion saws or drills going at once? Speakers blowing out? Compression and Limiting are your friends! I digress.

Yes get this game if it's worth it to you. It's much less Early Access but still many bugs and I get one or two crashes per play session. If you like gather, make, build, destroy... You'll like it."
23897,"Really enjoying survival mode. There are quite a few bugs and lag issues at times but we are still enjoying playing and the game is still in early access so to be expected.

I only purchased the game when they set a final date for survival mode. My son has owned the game for years but creative really wasn't my thing. Since we've been playing survival I have now also gifted it to my daughter and her friend and we're all enjoying playing.

The main thing I wish the game supported now was proper servers, which would probably help with some of the lag issues."
23898,"its a very fun game with endless potential, it brings updates often and if there is a long wait between updates, it is going to be a really good update, just like the survival update. i give it a 9/10 the only thing is that updates take long but they are really good anyways, definetly recommend it!"
23899,"If you like lego and like to build and get creations from other people on steam workshop and get mods, I guarantee you will like it. In my opinion its a 9/10 because they still need to fix the bugs."
23900,"Very fun multiplayer mode, its just really laggy"
23901,c
23902,Pleasantly surprised by this lil game
23903,fun
23904,"I've played this game since  release, and it has always been an amazing sandbox game where you could build any kind of machine or vehicle you could think of. Then they added mod support, and the range of possibilities became even wider with mods like wings, and bouyancy. and now they released survival mode a few days ago. It's incredibly fun, and if you want to see gameplay of it, I can recommend Scrapman and kan gaming on youtube, they are my favorites and have been making amazing creations since the game came out. 10/10 :)"
23905,i lover  this game it's worth to buy it
23906,Gut!
23907,"Fun game to play on when you're bored and want to mess around a little bit.
Some of the mechanics are strange, such as you can't use a lever or anything to control the speed of the engine.

I've not even figured out how to use brakes yet, not sure if I have to make them myself or just connect the wheels to something else but I'll figure it out.

Anyways, great game to play on and have fun with."

23925,"I first played this game in 2017, just came back because survival.
The game is much more polished now, I really like it. 
Survival is enjoyable even if you know everything about the game from creative gameplay.
I easily get myself very involved in my creation, and time flies by. I don't even realize i played 3 hours, for me it's like 30 minutes have passed.
It's just a very enjoyable game, good for binge gaming on rainy days, or serious building with friends."
23926,"

Awsome game with great building mechanics and a fantastic survival mode. If you are getting the game I reccomend watching som scrap mechanic youtube videos first."
23927,"Game is not bad , it's been ages since i played it.. Survival drew me back in.  

I'm really not in the mood to write a in depth review so i'l make it short n sweet.... 

Good :
Cute and easy to learn 
Imagination is your only limitation.  
The robots sing when they work. funny really. lol 

BAD : 
you CAN play alone , but the game is more or less for friends.

23937,"I normally don't leave reviews until I've played thru a game for a while.
However, I will make an exception with Scrap Mechanic.

I was eagerly awaiting the Scrap Mechanic survival release so i could get into the game because it looks nice and interesting.

Before i realized it the survival release happened and the game went on sale at the same time.
So, I spent the funds to purchase the game.

I was SORELY disappointed. 

You are thrown into the game with no guidance. 
There are no tooltips.
There is no introduction.
You have to go to a ""help page"" ingame that isn't really helpful with the things you Need to survive ingame...
Such as :  How do I attain water?  Where do I get it?  

I had 9 jugs of water I found during my playtime. . . I couldn't drink them. I couldn't find any information how to drink them.
I found dozens of ears of corn... I could not eat them.  I could not find any information on how to convert them to something edible if possible at all.
I couldn't even stack them in the shack i took over.
No crafting menu available.
I found steak and the Description in the backpack said that Wocs love to eat this...
One, what the hell is a Woc? 2.. if Wocs can eat this steak, why can't I?

The gardening was neat. You drop your piles of soil and plant your seeds on top. 
But... it would make more sense if you could till the existing ground to plant items Vs having to Find bags of soil to be able to plant things.

The building mechanics are nice.. but rotation options Suck badly.
If machines are needed to be able to cook, or craft gear, or make specific parts for building with... There is no guidance on how or where to make these machines.

When chopping down a tree... oh i really like that order of events. The way the tree falls and you break it apart into manageable pieces. You can pick them up, set them down...
However... Why... WHY would someone make it to where you 1: CHOP the tree... 2: BREAK down the logs... 3: You then need to spend an even longer amount of time with some odd looking laser potato peeler to ""refine"" the wood so you can use it to build.  That's too much. Way too much.  Chop, collect and then build would seem a bit more legit. 

But to harvest the stone I found... I couldn't. I got a message that the sledgehammer can't mine the stone... I would imagine a Sledge would more easily break up stone than chopping down and cutting up a tree. Just sayin' that doesn't make sense to me. Can't even get stone at the start with the Sledge you start with.

The game definitely has potential
I can see how some can enjoy the creative side where you have everything at your disposal.
However... This survival release was very Premature.  The newcomer was Not taken into account at all.  They seem to have made survival for people that have played creative for a while and sits and watches all these videos Outside of the game to see what's what.

I don't pay for games to go to the internet to watch tutorials and instructional media on how to play.
I pay for a game and expect to dive in and be instructed how things work as I go. 
A simple tutorial mission would easily dissolve any issues I had I am sure...
But this is not provided.

Now, for those of you that are fanboys or just devil's advocates in general... YES I do know you can pull up a multi tabbed help panel in game. Tells you how to do things such as building and such.  However it tells you nothing else regarding Survival play.
Most of the hotkeys indicated in the help section also do not work.  Q to rotate.. ok, Shift+Q to rotate.. what? Why? You already have Q that works and again.. The rotation mechanic blows.

Refine this game... I'll likely come back. 
For now, the recommendation is a solid NO unless you are one of the people out there who only play Creative mode in games. Not for me."
23938,i don't remember playing this
23939,"Bought this game a couple years ago when they were still building the foundation of what it would become. They took a long time to make creative as good as it is but when they released survival that's where the game really took off. Create your own vehicles and machines to aid you in gathering resources and explore the awesome world and fight off the robots. If you enjoy creating things this is the game for you, I can't stop playing."
23940,This is a fantastic game if you like building and designing crazy machines this is for you. There are a few bugs though i have not found anything game breaking yet. Also they just released the survival update which is a lot of fun the only concern i have is updates do appear to be few and far between. Hopefully the developers keep coming out with updates because the game is great and i would hate to see it abandoned.
23941,"This game is awesome! It's like the best mechanics of a lot of games pushed into one.
I bought it for the survival mode and, although the on-boarding process required me to do some Googling in order to find out what to do, the in-game guide did assist me in building my first car.

Apart from a few network/sync issues, this game is far more stable than any competitor product was at this phase and it offers endless fun! Especially when you get to see all of your creations working together to streamline the process of mining, manufacturing and building (and eating). Oh, and the PVE is pretty damn cool."
23942,is good
23943,"It's a great game if you can get it running.

I used to be able to play this game and it was very fun with friends despite some lag in multiplayer, now though I am unable to even start the game, I click play and I don't even get to see a loading screen. All I can do is send crash reports when prompted by the bug splat window.

If I can get the game running at some point I will change this review."
23944,"If your wondering should you buy this game

You like the creative mode,
Creative in this is great, your given so many tools along with mods to create anything if you want it for creative go ahead,the only thing to remember is the game is poorly optimised, my pc can run besiege with crazy big and complex machines at 144 fps, if something in this is more complex or bigger than a car,  can only get under 30 if not under 20, i really like this game and i hope they do some optimisation patch because its sad to think that your all the games potential goes to waste with poor optimisation
the mods are great though

if you want to try this game for the survival mode, dont

i know survival is only new, and i really dont want to tell you to avoid this game because as long as the devs keep working and improving it, it could be great, same for the survival mode, it has so much potential it could be great fun, but it sadly is a boring slog right now on release

For a game about building machines to solve problems ( its literally called mechanic) this game really does not want you to build or use machines untill really late game, i play this to use machines, not sit through hours of boring sub standard early access survival first to do that

1st fuel at the start is very limited, but everything you need to advance is so far away unless you risk it and get lucky finding some fuel on your adventure dont bother, you can craft fuel but the requirements are really grindy and the sound underwater is broken so thats not fun

to build a bed you need cotton, otherwise if you die in combat (oh boy do i have thoughts on the combat) and your miles and miles away from home looking for cotton (which seems to be rarer than gold),  and you die because of a haybot, be prepared to run for 10 to 20 minutes or more to get your stuff back becayuse you will not have the means to build more than one vehicle for hours

Looting is pretty bad, everything you need is only found in loot crates scattered across the map and you only get 1 to 3 items out of the twenty or so you need, so good luck getting gas or fertilizer in an actually useable amount, but the worst is component kits, in a game about building machines, why have you made the one part needed to build and upgrade every machine so rare, that is what holds back building

The resource yield is too low, dont expect to be building anything like what you saw in the trailer unless youve played for tens to close to a hindred hours, refining by hand takes too long to be fun at the start but i do like the concept of transpoting the raw materials to a refiner bot, butwhy did refining have to be down to one robot, why couldnt we have been given somehting like the drill for efining so that we could build our own refining machine, that would be way more fun

finall the combat is awful, you dot=nt get a gun for many many hours in so expect to be beating things with a hammer for most of the time, the haybots will kick your ass unless your constantly jumping backwards and swinging and dont expect to have fun if theres more than one of them, the block mechanic doesnt work in survival, lie its literralynot there, but it is in creative for some reason, then theres the dmn tape bots, too much damage, too fast of a reaction time, and the big red robots are a push over, just build a wall and you can kill them with 60 potatoes

this game could be great, and i know the survival is new, thats just what i see is wrong with it and need to be changed, om gonna keep checking in and seeing what gets changed but for now i quit the survival its a boring slog of a game at the moment"

23970,This game is epic. I highly reccomend it
23971,great game and fun
23972,This is a realy cool game that u can play on ur own or with friends if u have 3 frieds it is realy fun in multiplayer
23973,yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
23974,reallly fun
23975,very creativity based games creations end when ur imagination does. early access was great but full release is amazing love this game survival mode is op.
23976,I bought it years ago. it was fun in creative but after a while it got dull. but now with survival I cant stop playing. there is just so much to do.
23977,"The devs are dedicated, which is nice to see in the sea of low effort early access games, all in all fun little game"
23978,"Survival is very fun, farming is the only problem I have with the game, not because its too hard but because it throws more robots at you than the game itself can handle. The frame rate plummets making it extremely hard to fight off the robots."
23979,Fun creative suvirval game.
23980,"Scrap Mechanic is genuinely brilliant. It's genius! You've given all the pistons, logic gates, bearings and tools that you need to create just about any machine you can think of and a dead easy and visual way to hook it all up. I opening up creative mode and set myself to making a car, and then got carried away.

I made a car that flips over. I made a car that doesn't care if it's flipped over because it can drive on all angles. I made a helicopter that kept falling over. I made a helicopter with controls for horizontal tilt vertical tilt, lift, left momentum and right momentum that doesn't crash. Now, I want to create devious and comical traps for farm bots.

I've been playing survival mode for hours now and I'm having fun. It's still got some deficiencies - but still it's more than already worth your time and money. While still in early access, I've only experienced the most minor and unintrusive bugs. If I want for anything at all, it'd be for a map to help me find me way back home after adventuring."
23981,Gud
23982,"Despite the fact that I really like the game, at the moment I can not give a positive rating. For me, the problem is not a small amount of content. Although, I would like more things and types of enemies in survival mode. I have a technical problem: when I go down under the water, a terrible noise begins. Then the game starts to hang jerky. Before writing a review, I checked the above at the minimum settings. The same thing happens. System Features: Core i7 -6700, 16 GB RAM, GF 1050Ti. 
P.S.Sorry for my English."
23983,"I have always liked scrap mechanic for years and even creative mode has been endless and has had a lot of things to do in it, they released survival way later than they expected but now I think survival was totally worth the wait, survival mode has completely changed scrap mechanic and gives you way more things to do if you don't know what to do in creative mode and it can give you a whole different perspective of the game, overall this game has served me well over the years and I highly recommend it."
23984,i like the fry shotgun
23985,its's a great game
23986,Noice
23987,4 years later and the game is finally amazing
23988,Game breaking bug in survival that makes it utterly unplayable. Your sledgehammer (the first and most basic tool in the game) doesn't work.
23989,bdfzx
23990,201
23991,"Good game
"
23992,this game is an amazing game that mixes survival creativity and physics in a prefect way in harmony
23993,this is a well put together game you can be free to build what you can think of to do the task at hand
23994,"Simple to learn, hard to master.

Game is lovely, doesn't take big brains to make wheel go forward but it does take some in order to make a mech, a giant moving fortress, so on. 

Survival is fun! Can't at all enjoy creative mode, dunno how anyone has enjoyed that but good for those guys I guess.

No tutorial, but pressing H brings up a little book with pages in it you can read on how to play. That's right, no cutscenes or anything. Play as you wish. 

No real story or quests either, again, it's really up to you and where you want things to go.

Probably would be best for kids but can easily be fun for all ages."
23995,Good Good
23996,yeah it good
23997,the games is 99%perfect
23998,very fun sandbox game with mods and an entire community that puts out a ton of creations and mods to play around with. i don't think anyone can get board with scrap mechanic
23999,very good game
24000,"Highly addictive, very fun to play with friends game, medium-range crafting, beginner level surviving, if you have a gang play this game :)

Creative mode is not for me, so i dont know the ""you can do it anything you want"" stuff. But people seem to do lots of things in this game, so i say give it a try. 

And devs fixing issues in 2-3 days."
24001,fun but need some brains
24002,"Can't recommend. 

Wanted to like it, looked really cool, and the developers have obviously put a lot of love into the art, the physics, and the array of blocks and items... 

But survival mode needs a LOT more work. 

There are only two mobs that I can see, and only one of them drops scrap metal, which is the crucial component you need to build metal things like engines.  To build a very basic vehicle with a drill that would allow you to start mining and actually gathering materials beyond killing the haybots, you need probably... 200 scrap metal?  At least?  Which is like... dozens of haybots. 

So you'll spend hours running across the map looking for haybots, dying from hunger, etc. just trying to gather this one material from the one mob that drops it? 

Sorry, but no.  

Survival needs a LOT more polish before it's a playable experience.  I hope the devs get there, this game shows a lot of potential, but it's not ready."
24003,"Excellent game so far I cant wait to experiment but I think multiplayer needs some optimizing, both on respectable rigs & weve only built a basic car placed 20 soils with a chest high wall around them & already my co-op friend is complaining about really bad lag which wasnt the case when we started a few hours earlier."
24004,awsome game!!
24005,"The game's either dead, or the developers are VERY lazy. Progress is about as fast as frozen molasses, last update was MONTHS ago."
24006,i love the new survival mode but i found a glitch where you can get a lift and go through a celing in a building
24007,Love the game! Excited for chapter 2 of survival mode.
24008,10/10
24009,good game and survival in.
24010,10/10
24011,"If you like minecraft and it then it had a baby with Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts, you‚Äôd get this awesome game. Also, it has an insane value especially when discounted so please pick this up to support the amazing devs!"
24012,Misto!
24013,Great game tons of fun!
24014,You need a pretty strong pc to run this game but its more optimazed with the survival update. I strongly reccomend this game.
24015,"ok over about tons of hours there couple things but they been fix it ...but if they can add admin stuff where we can kick people who don't want on the server and add optimise when there tons robots on-screen I have a 2070 and a 3900x and was getting 1-12fps when robots came to att my farm even put it on lowest....also be cool to add Y angles , beacon place on car or base to tell where it is, be also cool get some scuba gear when your farming under water help u move fast and stay down Lil longer, and prob pushing to far but dedicated server we can pay for my buddys and i will be willing to pay if that happens so I don't have to leave my pc on all day but other than that been loving it a lot took over my life short of..... as always will get back to ya anything else keep up the great work"
24016,fun game
24017,"Needs work, but you can make a car."
24018,no
24019,they did good...
24020,"As of this review the game is still extremely buggy, multiplayer is very nearly unplayable. There is also a lack of parts, enemies and other features. But what is here is very promising, a relaxing Lego/Mechano style survival sandbox with rudimentary survival and combat features. Definitely has huge potential for the future."
24021,Only recommend if you can play games that don't have objectives like Minecraft. And make sure to back up your saves every session. Only negative right now is that when you have too many things on your world your vehicles stop being able to drive with the spaghetti glitch (this includes sometimes even just mining a node).
24022,Very Good
24023,epic
24024,"You get to milk cow's scalp nipples, and warm milk shoots out of their puss-puss. 10/10"
24025,"My wife and I absolutely love this game, even during the Beta stage. Worth every dollar we spent."

24030,"Liked the engineering , dislike the lack of music variety.
"
24031,cool but needs a mini map
24032,"One of the best survival, build, exploration games I've ever played. It's not without bugs and the inability to keep the game online at all times - like minecraft server - sucks, but there are work arounds and it's worth the hassle."
24033,"Really fun game. Just got it, 30 hours in so far and it's kept my mind turning, which is exactly what I am shooting for. Excited to learn more and build more with my friends"
24034,i love  the concept of the game in genarel  but there is this glitch where it says your in water but your not
24035,10/10 better than fort nut and much funner
24036,"Honestly kind of boring. Nothing is explained to you in survival, constantly had to google stuff, and the world feels absolutely lifeless. If you're a fan of building cars you may like it but the survival is cheeks magunda."
24037,FUN...  COOL BUILDING
24038,its so fun
24039,dont buy it
24040,great
24041,"The game is a lot of fun, however I should point out, that with the 0.4 version (release version of Scrap Mechanic Survival update) my save file got corrupted where I couldn't place any block and couldn't pick up any items off the ground. The save file with 18h put into it had basically been corrupted and no longer playable. It was fixed with a 0.4.1 patch and I really hope that issue won't come up again, because I don't mind bugs in early access games, but if it's game breaking and I can lose 18 hours of progress, it's bad."
24042,Very good so far. definitely buy
24043,refunded this trash so fast. It crashes on launch 50/50 and after spawning 3 vehicles it slows to about 6fps
24044,"I know its ""survival mode"" but I currently dont recommend this game  (at least now in current state).  Food and water levels go down wayyyyy too fast.   Needs a map desperately with maybe levels of difficulty colored areas.  Worked up a nice vehicle and got one shot killed by a bot with a potato gun after some short travels.  Lost everything I had in my inventory and don't even have the energy or the will to go and pick up my loot since all i have is my hammer?  Farming is a pain since the bots come and easily tear down defenses while another bot shreds your crops while dealing with the first one.  Wish I could refund but will wait and see what the creators do with the problems."
24045,it is gwate
24046,its awesome plz play
24047,The new update was basically another game. It went from fun and goofy machine builder to versatile gameplay and creative base defense (with the goofy machine engine still in creative mode).
24048,"good graphics, doesn't use up too much processing power"

No map, no compass. When you go out with survival you can't even tell there is your home. If you bring a bed with you on a car. Nice, once your car is destroyed, you will never leave that place cause you can't respawn anywhere else before you thirst to die....
No food from loot, no food from any where other than your ground...
I ""like"" this game so much..... including two of my other friends...."
24050,I've played and had this game for a while. I quit but seeing survival now has made me want to get back into the game. Thank you too the devs for their hard work!
24051,good game
24052,I love this game
24053,"Soooo laggy, just fix ur game, its been four years. just get some servers lmao"
24054,"Really cool game. Love the creative freedom. It doesn't seem to support very stable multiplayer, even with only moderately complex builds, e.g, including a few suspensions or rockets crashes/freezes everyone but the host, and we're all rocking decent pc builds with strong internet connection. This instability is a real shame because we purchased this game for an interesting new multiplayer experience. We still love it, but hope to see some stability improvement."
24055,"While most may find the survival aspect grindy, personally I enjoy the grind and the mechanics in the game are  amazing for custom creations.

Mining out rocks using my own design of a drilling vehicle makes it so much more satisfying."
24056,it is fun
24057,fun game now that they added survival
24058,This game is my favorite game so far
24059,Super fun with overly complicated mechanics. I love it!
24060,very fun to explore
24061,Would not recommend at this point for multiplayer lag.
24062,"fun and entertaining
"
24063,"its aight
"
24064,"This game has alot of potential. Really love how meticulous crafting is. Although, the lack tutorial did make me feel a bit lost when I first started. I had to look up online to get the gist of things. I'm the type who would like to play the game as is without looking up online things. I hope they can add more to that. Not to mention, the difficulty curve is a bit steep, kinda grindy, the fun started when I was able to get by after a few hours of exploring then finally giving in to google search. (Just a little pet-peeve of mine. but all in all, If you are into open-world, sandbox, survival game with lotsa creativity potential, this game is for you."
24065,Bullshit doesnt run at all with my high end specs.
24066,The dev is hard at work and TRYING to make an awesome game capable of being enjoyed by yourself or with friends. It does totally rock but sometimes weird shit happens and physics get the best of your frame rate. Overall easy to run game with little issues and a solidly devoted dev team behind it
24067,"it fucking laggy
so fucking laggy

"
24068,great game.
24069,pog
24070,There better be a plushie of the little water creatures ASAP.
24071,It's a must have with the new update. I see no reason not to buy it unless you can't afford it.
24072,"it is fun
"
24073,"I
LOVE
THIS
GAME 

But seriously this is probably one of my favorite games even though i started playing it on crappy laptop i still enjoyed it. This game was so fun to just do random things and mess around. I love all the crazy community creations. i still don't fully understand how they do it but there still super cool."
24074,.
24075,"Pretty rad tbh, not sure if it will having staying power but it's good times for now!"
24076,i love the new update cant wait to play with my friends
24077,Close your eyes... AND BUY IT!!! :D
24078,Yes
24079,I really enjoy all of the games from Axolot that I have played so far. The survival mechanics are great and the art style is GORGEOUS. Right up my alley!
24080,CARS
24081,the possibilities in the game are very wide and you can do anything you set your mind to
24082,yo the only problem ive been having with the game is that it relies on your own network to run online with friends. and when your buddies are too far away from you everybody rubberband lags like crazy! otherwise its one of the top survival games in my list! great work devs. really enjoy my time with it so far.
24083,Epic game especially the new survival mode that came out.
24084,good game
24085,it good
24086,"The game idea is great. I bought it because of the survival mode, but the problem is that in this actual stage, it is lacking a lot of content to be playable."
24087,survival is decent but on youtube if you search for some cool things people do and then get that mod you can do some op things also music is cool and its the best logic i have ever seen
24088,"Did i start up the game and instantly build something awesome, no i built little junk cart and spent 3 hours having a blast driving around 

very fun,
interesting potential for making weird and wonderful machines,
cute killer robots

"
24089,Good Game
24090,awesome
24091,Its a very fun game to keep you entertained for a while
24092,It is good
24093,"No progression, no map, no lvl up, looks like a child game.

refunded . Thanks anyway"
24094,the game is extremely laggy in survival when you play multiplayer almost anyone in the game that isnt the host will have constant lag spikes rendering the game unplayable
24095,Yes.
24096,"Very interesting.   Needs some multiplayer stability, but brimming with potential."
24097,"Needless to say, I'm addicted to this. It's got a steep learning curve, but once you figure out how to build your very first car (I got more info on Reddit) it gets a LOT better!

100% recommended. I'm shocked It's only $20."
24098,"I bought this game for survival mode and I really regret it.

It's just so unfinished and the grind is simply unreal, but there's no goal in this game and all the resources you collect are used up in an instant building even a basic vehicle.

Everything is so damn janky and unfinished. 3/10"
24099,nice
24100,This game is really good and will be better when challenge mode comes out but i have a feature you might like add a gamemode command so you can be like :gamemode survival
24101,Styrk og krister spiller dette med meg velldi bra
24102,"It's like a hybrid of Astroneer, Besiege, and Unturned. I am always suprised by how well the physics work in this game, as well as being very self aware with janky ragdolls. Very fun with friends and I can't wait to see more added to the survival mode."
24103,love it
24104,A good game for a creative mind.
24105,its boring compared to other games of the same type
24106,awesome
24107,"They finally came out with survival and its awsome
"
24108,orsum
24109,its great
24110,"very good game, played non stop for seven hours in survival with my mates, although sometimes when we're on survival the server becomes glitchy and starts to lag, this also happens when you're joining the survival world, other than that it's a good game"
24111,absolutly amazing
24112,"Awesome game, perfect for survival players and builders!  There is already lots of replayability and content. Can't wait for updates and even more content to come!"
24113,"good game yes
"
24114,fun game playing with friends is fun
24115,"Game kinda litty
"
24116,"Buy it if you want it lol  butt ho
"
24117,"Great game, so many possibilities. I have laughed so much that the laughs alone made the game worth it."
24118,Very easy to build and to program things to work.  Needs better instructions.
24119,yes
24120, W A R E H O U S E
24121,nice
24122,"Its a fun game that you can play with your friends or solo and create allot of stuff like cars, planes, rockets and other crazy stuff that you can create, and a new survival mode has been added so now you can survive and build with your friends."
24123,Super fun game!
24124,THIS GAME IS AMAZING
24125,amazing game it is fun even though it's still buggy but there is lots of things on the workshop so fast!
24126,ez
24127,"Very addictive
"
24128,This is fun and even entertainingly difficult too but hey if you like building and making anything you can with the tools your given then you'll enjoy this.
24129,"This game was pretty cool and innovative before, but is 10x better since survival mode was released.
If you like mechanics and survival crafting games, I highly recommend this title."
24130,great creative outlet
24131,"a rolling haybot pushed my car into a chemical pool
11/10"
24132,Tons O fun
24133,"Turn on offline play. You can do this. I believe in you. This is the only game I cannot play offline while my wife uses my library, and it's because you don't understand piracy. There are bugs I am willing to overlook, physical conundrums that confuse me but make we want to learn. I cannot advise this game to anyone who wants to play anywhere without an internet connection.

Remember Sim City? Remember how they lost everything because Maxis thought everyone was an overprivileged rich kid who could have internet connectivity all the time?

Also, remember dialup? You had to get off the internet for someone to make a phone call. I have to do that every time my wife feels like playing a game.

Turn. On. Offline. Play."
24134,"Has great potential, worth a buy if you enjoy crating/engineering games. The game of a mix between space engineers, banjo-kazooie nuts and bolts and mincecraft. 

The new survival mode is great, especially with friends. Although tricky to start out, its easy once you have get the basic gameplay loops down. Defending your base at night is fun, gives you a reason to create a fortified settlement. Creating different vehicles for varied tasks, such as chopping trees or transporting goods to the trader is a great way to blend the survival gameplay loop with the vehicle creation loop, 

The game does have a few problems with multiplayer and de-sync, but this a rarely taken the fun out of the game.

9/10 would get all of my crops destroyed by Farmbots again :("
24135,it good
24136,yes game
24137,"I love this game! From the simple to use building to the bright and cheerful graphics.
I can't suggest this game enough!"
24138,it's good
24139,"Single player perspective

I will recommend this game, but there are some serious tweaking that needs to happen. I can say I really have seen no bugs, which is impressive. Then there are things like how much grinding you have to do to build anything. Once it is built, the amount of gas it takes for vehicles is ridiculous. Practically driving around the block empties my gas tank with a tier 4 engine. There is no map, so you can easily get lost or lose where you built your base.

There seems to be no block shapes and the block sizes are VERY small which makes the idea of building a huge fortress a daunting task when you think about the 10,000 blocks you have to farm for and build to create it. 

You have a hunger bar and a thirst bar. The hunger bar depletes faster when you are damaged because it is used to heal you. The thirst bar depletes faster when you are doing work. Though, they both deplete a bit fast for my taste. 

In Survival, the size of base attacks seems to be determined by how many farming plots you have and the quality of plants you have. Going passed 10 plots bring a pretty hardy number of enemies considering you only have a sledge hammer."
24140,Best ¬£10 i spent this year
24141,"I really can't recommend this game enough, its so fun!"
24142,ITS GUD
24143,"Honestly with 13 hours in and many tutorial videos on vehicle construction my game does not allow me to reverse the car. Very annoying bug. installed and reinstalled still having that issue. Game shows promise, but until they patch that bug and multiplayer stability I cannot recommend this game."
24144,"I never played before the Survival update, I had no understanding of how to build and what this game would be.

My gf and I have had loads of fun exploring and figuring things out as we go.

We found corn but realised we couldnt eat it, so we placed it on embers and hoped it would cook, we also placed Woc steak on embers to cook - it obviously didn't work.

It wasn't until over an hour later that we learned that the cows would EAT the corn and produce MILK.

Small discoveries like this gave the game a lot of life and got my partner really interested while I was more concerned with farming materials cos I wanted to make a car.
Even after making a car it took a lot of tuning and mistakes to learn how to do it properly.

I am really enjoying my time in this game and I know we have only just scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.
Highly recommended but its definitely more fun to play with others if you can"
24145,Is great!
24146,Very Fun.. Survival Mode is a blast and was certainly a pleasant surprise
24147,top
24148,This is an extremely fun game especially when played with friends. Survival could be a little better with allowing you to drink water but grab enough corn and you'll be fine.
24149,Awesome game :)
24150,"i bought it on sale not knowing the survival part was so recent.
- very unbalanced recources: food, metal
-can get so bugged you have to restart a 10 hour game
- critical machines are so big you'll have a hard time fitting them on your vehicle.
-there's supposed to be a spudgun but getting it is so difficult and can get bugged so you can't get it( the restart thing)
i would not suggest it for the survival mode. not right now."
24151,"Really original game, love it.

And now with the Survival mode it's even better."
24152,"super fun you really have to use your brain when building stuff lol



"
24153,"Loving the new Survival update!
Pretty good gameplay and building mechanics, unique sounding mobs, lots more things have been added and its pretty much a whole new game now, you can customise your character if you play long enough but at the start all you'll get to customise is your hair, face and the default clothes.
You can make flying machines, boats and cars, but you can't make a motorbike, well I can't at least.
Pretty fun to play with friends and there's no lag and only one or two glitches I've seen so far but probably due to connection.
The start is a little confusing though, needs like a small skippable tutorial at the start of the game with arrows pointing you where to go to get you started or you'll end up like me and building a base from scrapped buildings on a tiny island with a farm for a good 3 hours before I realised the spawn had a means of crafting."
24154,"Game is pretty fun...  also so glitchy you either cant play or have to play with a 15 second per click delay. Endless rubber banding, exploding physics mayhem. Funny but mostly unplayable. Multiplayer connectivity kinda works 1-10 tries, multiplayer lag is INCREDIBLE (1GB internet conn).

Overall My enjoyment of the game was made difficult by the lack of function"
24155,","
24156,The survival update broke compatibility with Proton/Linux and there isn't a native Linux client. Previously the game ran fine.
24157,This Review is just about the survival mode as the rest of the game is fine. If you grow food to survive things attack you and your gardens. If you are hurt your hunger and thirst drops fast to heal your self over time. Currently no other way to get health. To get hunger or thirst back to full you need to eat. Here is where the main problem is... As i wait a few days for tomatoes to grow i'm dyeing of thirst and drop to the ground dead. all other food and drink consumed and i have 5 FULL BUCKETS OF WATER in my inventory but the only way to hydrate my self is to wait for food to grow and hope i don't die from things trying to kill me when i go to pick the food when its done growing. Cant grow food in safe place/cant drink water/cant heal your self with band aids. you are not a scrap mechanic in survival mode. you can ether grow tomatoes and get shredded by robotic farmers or die of hunger and thirst because you didn't grow tomatoes and you cant drink water for whatever stupid reason. Hopefully the future is brighter for survival mode then it currently is. Grow hundreds of tomatoes non stop OR DIE AND SUFFER.
24158,"I recommend this as its cheap and fun.  I dont care for creative much. Kind of reminds me of 7 days to die.   The game being from 2016 still feels very early access to me BUT I will say they are active from what I can tell.   

Anyways its a crafting survival type game and if your into that this will satisfy you.  Its kid friendly to, my 7 year old enjoys it a lot.

My least favorite parts would be that there is no map, and no servers.  You just join your friend through steam."
24159,awesome
24160,"its good to learn some logic
"
24161,Would recommend for sure. Although after the survival update a lot of scripted mods have been broken and it seems there are tons of glitches.
24162,yuh its pretty cool
24163,FUN
24164,"Kjekt spel for folk som har ein liten ingeni√∏r inni seg. I dette spelet lager du kule maskiner og fart√∏y, med alt fra motorer til logiske kontrollpanel. Kom akkurat ut ein survival-modus som eg no har blitt heilt hekta p√•!"
24165,"SURVIVAL IS AN AMAZING ADDITION, SOO FUN WITH FRIENDS. CREATIVE IS ALSO SO COOL WITH NEARLY ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES. (i did caps lock on purpose)"
24166,Great Game for enginerring.
24167,Simply love survival.
24168,"Pretty interesting game. Finding, Building and trying not to get killed."
24169,Better than ever with the addition of survival mode. Me and my buddy couldn't stop drinking milk and picking up components.
24170,So I played 22 hours in 2 days aaaaaaaaand I had an exam yesterday... This is like Minecraft with vehicles. There is a lot of content right now I can't imagine what they're going to add next.
24171,AMAZING
24172,"I liked the new survival mode, brings a lot more interest into the game and I will start playing it a lot more as it has more to it. Honestly, I felt that it was worth the money because you can build what you want just with some work."
24173,"good game, hard on pc"
24174,I recommend not playing this game or buying it because it's broken and it crashes a lot and it's buggy and it's just not fun at all
24175,fun
24176,It's pretty laggy. Especially when playing with friends but it is a fantastic game and I 100% would recommend this to other players. I've slowly been convincing my friends to buy this game and play with me. Even when you feel like you're getting nowhere on progress when you inch even the slightest bit it feels rewarding
24177,"graphics : 10/10

Edit at 114hrs: the raids need to be optimized"
24178,"very nice game
"
24179,at first its kinda boring not that boring but then you will start getting to the fun part when you get metal and stuff and unlock things.
24180,"The game is fun but the multiplayer is crap. My friends crash, lag and has delay when they join. So if you dont have friends this is a game for you."
24181,"it is good
"
24182,"Took longer than expected to learn how to craft in a crafting survival game. The survival game mode may be a worthwhile update for fans who want more than just sandboxing. However to an outsider, the lack of a tutorial or direction in the survival mode left me and my friend clueless.

Regarding the survival aspect: We spent way too long learning how to replenish our hunger and thirst bar when it should be quite obvious. There was a farming tutorial but on our first run through we easily missed it and started chopping wood and gathering resources. The ""loot"" in this game is very strange to me as when I go through chests and large buildings I find only maximum 3 farming/computer items per drop which feels unrewarding. I would expect something along the lines of new blueprints for different engines or different wheels and weapons from the get go, something to look forward to building and improving but I'm left with a pack of tomato seeds and a circuit board which I have no idea what to do with.

Regarding the building and vehicle aspect: I have played Trailmakers before for a while and I feel both games share a pretty fleshed out system for building whatever you can imagine. I like how in this game you can attach almost anything to your vehicle from the environment however the options are limited and I feel Trailmakers give players more control over how vehicles feels and also the complexity of them. 

Overall this game has so much potential but still needs work. 4 years already in development and a tutorial to explain the game thoroughly is a big oversight. The only way to learn the game is to watch others play it, the manual inside is almost useless sadly."
24183,one of the best games I have ever had the gift to play 10/10
24184,"I crash host computers whenever I build, Many other people are having the same issue. I haven't heard anything from the developers at the time of review, will change when things are fixed, at the moment I cannot play the game with friends as advertised and reason why i bought the game.

5/12/20 update:
Multiplayer and the warehouses are trash, constant crashing, lag, lag and more lag. cannot recommend this game for multiplayer game. Single player is great.

5/25 Devs continue to ignore the multiplayer issues and provide ""Other"" things and content. I would not recommend this game for multiplayer or expect to have a good experiance in Multiplayer."
24185,good gaem
24186,"I never leave reviews, but man this game is fun. If you love the freedom to build creative mechanisms then this game is for you. I started the day survival was released (haven't played any other modes) and the sense of progression is quite amazing. Definitely recommend!"
24187,This game has endless ideas that you want to do most likely you can do it. Love that it gives you a sense of wonder and exploratory that soothes the brain.
24188,it is a fun unek sandbox
24189,good job
24190,"The survival is piss poor, they give you no guideline and no tutorial. don't waste your money until its on sale or they improve on this garbage."
24191,So glitchy and optimized terribly. But otherwise it's fun if you like some amount of engineering
24192,its a focking sick game
24193,"This is an awesome game. Tons to explore, challenging, and plenty to build. This is my new addiction for sure."
24194,"It was 11 hours straight of torture, degeneracy, delusional maddness, and everyone shit their pants at least once. I fucking loved it."
24195,survival is awesome
24196,I would recommend this game to anyone who likes minecraft and similar games
24197," 
  At first tests, Creative was a fun experience for all of my friends and I. That was until it was...only creative...for hours...and hours. There was just no new fun to it so we eventually moved on to mods and that was amazing! Then it was only mods... and more mods. 

  But when I tell you that Survival changed the game, It changed it GOOD. I love the game now and have not stopped playing the game since it came out because it comes with so many new features. Sure, there are a little bugs, but that can easily be fixed. 

  I can't wait for the next update of scrap mechanic. There is one thing i'd suggest. If we had the materials to build something in our workshop little place on the Lift, then I feel like we should just be able to build it there  and not from scratch.

 Other than that, 5 stars from me!
"
24198,Don't buy it for multiplayer
24199,This game is a blast. I've been playing coop survival with my friend and I think that's the best way to experience it. It has minecraft-ish game loops but with lots of fun engineering challenges and a setting with some interesting flavour. I can't believe I picked this game up for fifteen bucks. One of those games you can't stop thinking about when you aren't playing it!
24200,"Solid game, the multiplayer is a bit buggy but the survival update is fantastic"
24201,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game if it comes to it's creative mode. It has a lot of different parts to offer and it comes with mod support for all of the creative minds to show off. I've been playing it for a very long time but I need to say... I'm DISAPPOINTED. Through all these years I've seen all of the developer blogs about the new Survival Mode that is coming. Axolot have been developing it for literally YEARS and it is just.. empty. There is no introduction, no tutorial, not even any objectives. The only activities in there are farming, surviving the farmbot raids, exploring and in the end-game clearing the big warehouse that is pretty challenging but also quite empty. I'm kind of ashamed also, because after seeing the trailer for survival mode, I've persuaded two of my friends to buy Scrap Mechanic 'cause we're gonna play it together.. And now the 3 of us are just disappointed. I can recommend the game, of course, because I had lots of fun playing the creative and building all kinds of crazy machinery but I just had to express my opinion about the survival and warn all of the players that are hype-overloaded for this: Guys, you will be shook by what you'd see.. unfortunately, not in the good way"
24202,Its good.
24203,"I Have not tried the Creative mode, i was recommended the game by a friend after survival was released, and after a small 3 hours of gameplay so far...I LOVE IT! 

I can see this game going SOOO far! great new style for a survival game, fresh clean colourful graphics. I have noticed the game can be played as a casual player who wants to enjoy or you can go really deep with designs. Looking at the weight of items, what can and can not be carried or lifted.. the creation of vehicles and your own miners, this game requires some common sense but also the ability to think outside of the box when it comes to making things.

Highly Recommend to anyone!"
24204,"Game full of lag, we have been waited for 4 years for a survival, And they're still not able to give us a stable game."
24205,"Took them 4 Years to get this garbage out called ""survival""

-very basic gameplay
-No story, no guide and no objectif 
-Way to much grinding and boring pvp
-Multiplayer laggs a lot, my friends have a 30 sec delay or more

let's wait another 4 years for the next update
"
24206,"Started in Survival and within 3 minutes the audio broke when I went underwater. Came out and the audio still played underwater sounds. 2 minutes later, I try to jump on top of the starter ship to put out the fires and got stuck in it. Actually unplayable. So disappointed."
24207,its just AMAZING
24208,F
24209,"This game is becomming a cash grab. Don't spend you money yet, the devs don't care about the game anymore. The newly released survival is rushed and had no objective. Multiplayer is bugged. And this took 4 years? ...."
24210,FUN
24211,broken game nothing is good about this game
24212,"Played it in 2016 when i got it, came back to it in 2020 and its still empty. Well done developers for not much."
24213,Here you can be creative and create new ideas
24214,"Game crash rate kept increasing the more I played, until 5 hours in it was crashing 30 seconds after joining a multiplayer game every time, making it unplayable.

EDIT: game hasn't crashed in about 7 hours after the last update, I've been having a lot of fun."
24215,it is great but me and friend made game and 2 real life days game with friend stopped working but i can still join i cant hit the slegghammer laged but i am geting 100fps please help
24216,i love this game now it has a survival world
24217,FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN :))))))))))
24218,fun fun fun I love it alwase wanted it
24219,it's a good game
24220,it fun
24221,great game the survival mode beat all expectations
24222,"Took me a while to find out that there's really not much here, it's INCREDIBLY bare bones. Not very many parts, most of the mechanics seem unfinished, not sure where it's getting all the positive reviews from.
Just seems like a cutesy and even more spartan space engineers with really annoying farming mechanics."
24223,"11/10
killed my power adapter"
24224,if you want to play solo cool get the game. if you want to play online with friends lol.. good luck.  multiplayer is crap lagging non-stop.
24225,g
24226,"Scrap Mechanic is a great game. The creative mode was alot of fun 'cause u could build anything u wanted and gave u the map in which you could drive of fly around. with the edition of the Custom MapDesigner u could make an obstaclecourse to test your creations. now with survival it is a great and totally worth the money needed to buy. if u want to support the developers pls buy if for steam and not from another site, because the keys from G2A.com were stolen and it doesn't support the devs. *this is my opinion* afterall Great game still playing it after 2/3years"
24227,You can do anything!
24228,yeah BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
24229,"engoineer from tf2 epic gameing funny moments 10/10


657 hours in, this game is good buy it"
24230,I build car and ran over my friends 10/10
24231,"dope
"
24232,"Really enjoyable game. The cars are fun and grinding for them is as pain full as is in any other survival game. Its oddly annoying yet rewarding due to the way your cars can become more adept and suitable for a certain job. The one downfall of the survival aspect of the game is that it takes way to long for food to grow and raids are not big enough to be challenging for a squad of more than 2 players.

Overall this is a great game and totally worth the money and can't wait for more content to come!"
24233,"Takes some time getting into, and it's a little rough in places, but it definitely has that ""just another 30 minutes"" gameplay that is so rare.  Well worth the money and highly recommended.  Minecraft meets Trailmakers :-)"
24234,love it
24235,Very good game!!
24236,"Very cool sandbox game to create custom builds, coop with friends or fight them in creative mode.
Would be better though, if areas wouldn't ""freeze in time"" when you're gone for farming purposes"
24237,"With 170 hrs spent in this game, its easy to say that this is definitely one of my favorites. This game is great for messing around with physics and building ridiculus creations. The new survival mode update is a great addition to the game, there is something so satisfying about grinding materials for hours to finally build your dream car, or a HUGE base. this feeling doesn't often come in creative mode. Defending against hordes o robots to defend your possessions is annoying at times, but also fun, I highly suggest playing with a friend. The building mechanics are hard to learn at first but eventually become natural. I'd give this game a 8.5/10."
24238,my wife left me.
24239,Scrap Mechanic is sorta like minecraft because of the blocks but even more technical. I like it personally because i like to build stuff that moves.
24240,Fix the multiplayer lag that was your priorty 4 years ago
24241,Endless possibilities.
24242,"I only wish I had bought this game a lot sooner. Just an amazing game! And NOW with ""survival mode""! Just wow!"
24243,"A couple of connection problems when playing co-op multi 
-unable to see player name
-have to invite via steam (alt-tab and select friends) in survival mode or creative
"
24244,"Amazing game, the best I've played in a while"
24245,Very basic combat with no violence
24246,"Please, I just want it to be good. The main thing you do is build. The building creates server lag. Let me gather mats for 3 hours and then have my car glitch through the floor. The most infuriating beta experience I have had ever in a game. This should still be in alpha if they don't have a WORKING proof of concept. In this case, they do not."
24247,"It's a very funny game to play with your friends !!! 
"
24248,First time ever reviewing a game I'm having an amazing time learning this game and the multiplayer in my experience has been very smooth! Our first time building a car turned into us doing wheelies and laughing so hard for so long. I do feel like the world could get more additions or more variety/enemies but i'm sure in time they will be adding plenty for the price it's so worth it and hey play for a few hours if you don't like it refund it.
24249,yES
24250,4a
24251,"Good game
"
24252,A really creative game and now even more and better with Survival Mode

24254,You haven't start the game yet until you use logic gate to generate clock signal for you automatic plant watering...
24255,"This game is brillant, optimization is pretty poor.
However when playing by yourself it is a chilled game, you can listen to music and play and still have a good time.
When joint with friends it is a game you can do challenges in and over all is pretty good."
24256,fun
24257,"Awsome Game

24258,"Its amazing, ultimate creativity"

24265,the game is very good
24266,allthogh the optimization proceses survival is realy lagy unless you look at the ground for my device witch is a 360 hinged ematic but creative is lag free also pls put some indicator that the end of the map is near ty if you can do this axolot great game i understand how hard the optization proces might be hard but don't let the problems stop you keep releasing awsome content
24267,fuuuuuun!
24268,really good game both creative and survival are amazingly fun with friends :)
24269,It's just really fun with friends!
24270,"I know it is early release however, I am kind of disappointed on a few things.

1)   I tried to make a paddle wheel boat. Water has no friction when a
     paddle wheel is operated in it, so the paddle wheel will not pull the boat forward or back.
    The ship and wheel were designed correctly and should have by all rights moved
     the boat, but no it did not work.

2)   I tried to use the Vacuum pump to draw in and I tried it the other way, pushing water out
      to make a boat work and move. It also did not work.

3)   I tried a pump system with pipes to bring water and let it water my crops, it did not work

4)   I tried to use the Plastic blue containers of water to water crops ( as it says in their
      description ) and it does not work. I then tried to use them inside a water container
      and with a water cannon. This finally worked!

5)  The video for the game on steam shows them building a base and they have cows.
      They have the cows in a pen and hay bales. I do not see how or where you can make 
      hay bales. Also the cows despawn if you leave the area and if you leave and come 
      back to the game.


Simple physics fails on boats as well as irrigation issues because of a lack of proper parts i.e.
A Simple Sprinkler nozzle  would have been great to add to the ends of water pipes, however
there are none in the game that you can make. 

Potential but still a diamond in the rough!

Again, I know and realize this is still a game in the early stages of development.

I truly hope they are going to add a lot more pieces to the game to further expand on the ability
to cobble and  ""Scrap Mechanic"" simple devices and complex devices in the game.

I truly can not wait for the Dev's to bring this game further along in development.
I really like this game and I am excited to see it be expanded and improved.
My best wishes to the Dev's.

P.S.  Please No maps... it is an exploration game.. IF you do add a map, at least have it
        be able to be toggled off.

Thank you!"
24271,It is a fun game with a lot to do.
24272,"Survival was a great edition to the, already great to begin with, game! I can't wait for future updates and DLC maybe?? 10/10 from me!"
24273,Good so far but needs a few quality of life improvements.
24274,the Mechanics of the game is great. the graphics are good too.
24275,yes
24276,Crusty Mechanic. 7/10
24277,"IT VERY NICE, I LIKE!"
24278,"Edit: i found a major conflict, if you have Folding at Home running - even paused, this game will not launch. Quit out of folding at home. 

previous review: My friend gave me this game to play with her, and i can't get it to work. I spent an hour troubleshooting it yesterday, tried all the online solutions, and finally got it to launch 1 time. I tried to get into it again today, with all of the fixes still in place, and once again, I can't even get to the title screen, it just crashes on launch. I had this on my wishlist since 2016 I am so disappointed in the technical failure of this title.  I can't even remark on the gameplay because the game just doesn't work MOST of the time. We'll see how much more doing the devs job I do just trying to get it to run. P.S. my pc is a beefcake, it's not lacking hardware for this."
24279,very nice game indeed. very nice.

24307,I would definitely recommend this game for people who are into mechanics and its deffinitley worth the money
24308,So Fun
24309,This game is so fun and they finally added survival mode! I recommend it!!!
24310,Very fun and interactive gameplay
24311,"Wow. One of my favourite games. Cheap-ish price, and a lot of time wasted. That's a good thing! In Scrap Mechanic, you can build almost anything. Ok, I'll admit, flying builds are difficult without mods but the game is still ludicrously fun. While yes, multiplayer is laggy, and yes, some things are just too complex for the game to run. But, don't be discouraged by that.

 My PC isn't the newest thing, and it isn't stupidly costly, and it can run SM fine if you don't mind medium graphics or a little lower. Don't be discouraged by the fact your PC isn't very new. 4-5 years old and it may not do well. at all. Just remember to weld big buildings to the ground by placing a block and using the weldtool to reduce lag. 

Also, make sure to watch some of the older videos to learn the controls/ learn how to build things or press H whenever you're In a world. It's great for starting off, and It's a shame that people didn't like the game because they didn't see in survival mode the small Icon to press 'H'.

This game is great and is getting better. Remember that the dev team is relatively small and so a game this complex will take long to get completed fully. Perhaps it will be less laggy then.
"
24312,"Scrap Mechanic is a game about building creations. All three of the game modes (Challenge mode, Survival mode and Creative mode) are fun and unique. There's lots to do, be it building amazing things in creative, fighting bots in survival or solving challenges and riddles in challenge mode. SM is similar to Minecraft in that it really gives you a lot of freedom in terms of what you want to do in game."

Some kinks to work out but overall fun to play :)"

24317,been the best sandbox building game ive played so far hoping survival will be just as good
24318,I like it
24319,Tried survival. Not very impressed. Mildly confused. Was shot by scissor bot somewhere. not entirely sure what is going on tbh. Maybe as it is updated it will get better or more intuitive but right now eh
24320,Trash
24321,best game
24322,very goof
24323,"TL:DR - Too many mechanics that take away from the game experience instead of adding value. Wait to buy until they balance the game out a bit more.

Cons
-Very unintuitive gameplay. 
-Overly Difficult mechanics to mask lack of depth in gameplay.
-Randomized worlds can result in a lack of required.
-Ridiculously overpowered enemies (swarms kill you and your farm every night)

Pros
-Beautiful environments

24335,trash boring bad bad
24336,"I mean I can't say it's a shoddy cash grab [i]for sure[/i]. But if it was one. It would look and play exactly like this.

As of the release of survival game mode... survival game mode is very mediocre.

Everything takes forever. Everything costs huge amounts of grind. Food and Thirst are only fake separate but both run out too fast. Farming is a chore. Even basic vehicles or structures are wildly over priced. There is basically nothing to do and you will spend very nearly 100% of your time hitting the same robots with the same hammer forever.

If you are experienced with the game and for some insane reasons starting again expect a mere 4-6 hour play time to your first barely functional vehicle. Assuming you skip it when the game chooses to first try and trick you into wasting your time with a whole extra early tier of vehicle literally worse than walking in every possible respect.  

If you are playing for your first time count yourself LUCKY if you manage to put together your first functional vehicle within 6-8 hours of game play. In a game about building gadget vehicle doodads. It takes that long. And it will STILL probably take you at least 2-6 hours PER ADDITIONAL vehicle after that! In a game [u]about building vehicles[/u].

Survival mode of this game is made for the typical masochistic basement dwellers that hold up games like Rust as a good example of what [i]every single other game ever[/i] should be and just want to be whipped ever harder with the grind stick in the hope that they will gain pleasure on the off chance other players also suffer.

As for the developers. It's hard not to look at what they have created and see something that looks like they just tacked a couple of random survival mechanics together, inflated the grind to hide the lack of content and gameplay and they pushed the resulting pile of scrap (mechanic) out the door as a quick cash grab."
24337,"very good
"
24338,Nice game!
24339,this game is good
24340,"This game is FUN and makes you create things that you never expect
BUT it need dedicated servers asap and a multiplayer menu and UI
because the real fun is when you play with your friends.(more  difficulty is better ) 
graphics are not great but it will do the job
at this stage the game lack of contents like enemies or situations that force you to boost your brain and build something to overcome it(devs are working on it as i am writing this i assume)
so i recommend this game for single players right now but if multiplayer comes i bet you enjoy building crazy things with your friends in this game

"
24341,"its very fun and allows you to creat anything
and ther tons of satisfaction in keeping your crops safe"
24342,"started playing survival with brother and a friend. Things started out fine. But lag kills the game. Now my character is bugged on te survival world we started. my charchacter can view inventory's of machines  with no problem but putting something in the machine is taking 2 minutes to do.  when i get my hammer and i want to hit something the animation is  seriously 2 minutes later, i can see my brother interact and walk no problem ( the game works for him fine), but i can't do anything. nothing works, everything i do is slow in client side. i can hear my hammer swinging on time but can't see it after 2 minutes. This i have never had before in any game.... , IT's a weird kind of lagg. I tried everything, restart scrap mechanic and pc. Survival on my own works completly fine and has no problem when my friend hosts a server where i can play normally. I only have the problem when my borther hosts our Survial game where the crazy stuff happens. i can see everything move with no lagg but the second i do"
24343,"Im too dumb for this game, but the funny robots make up for it"
24344,This game is very funny and cool.
24345,"Scrap Mechanic is a game for a certain audience: You are going to like the game, if you enjoy setting your own goals, don't mind the lack of predefined quests and plot, and enjoy crafting ridiculous mechanical creations. Just take a look at screenshots people have been taking of their pride and joy creations: If you see those weird jet-engine-tree-ripping-drill-monsters or automated farming machines with working joints and think COOOOOOOL I WANNA BUILD THAT, then this might be the game for you.

PROS:
+ The amount of automation possibilities with crafting: with bearings, logic gates, engines, switches, controllers you can build a very ""computerized"" system for... well, your car, watering the plots, handling resources.
+ Survival mode is finally out after years of waiting
+ Finding new stuff and new biomes is great
+ Crafting is made...easy. The controls work great considering the ton of things you can create.
+ Graphics: The graphical design is very candy-styled and colourful. I found myself enjoying it. Also, I've had no issues playing single player even with relatively high settings.

CONS:
- No real end-goal, just crafting and keeping yourself fed and hydrated in survival.
- Not much plot, no quests, events etc. as in adventure games. Just you trying to find stuff, and figuring out how that stuff works.
- Though there are many help screens in the game teaching you eg. how to make a basic vehicle, you have to google many things as the game lacks a good tutorial and some help texts. Especially after unlocking more ""recipes"" you will have no idea where to get materials as often there are no helpful tool tips. The result is ton of people asking ""where to get that burning wood thing material"" in Reddit.
- Grinding: To get your hands on all that automation stuff in Survival mode, you'll have to grind for a lot of materials. But that DOES work as breeding ground for ingenuity, because people then start figuring out how to use machinery to do some of the grind for them. There also IS a creative mode where you have more free reign over what you can craft.

RESULT:
Though there is still lack of in-game help, over-arching story and people sometimes have game breaking bugs, I must give the game a thumbs-up. 
If your are on the fence about buying, I would recommend waiting for a discount or full release. If you enjoy open-ended crafting games, this is a must-have."
24346,even if its a little laggy i LOVE it
24347,"Tooltips need some work, but apart from that .. love the game so far.. it throws you into the literal deep end at the start and off you go.."
24348,"nice game. the only thing i don't like is that the new survival mode is a little laggy when I have a desent PC.

I DO reccomend this game for anyone who likes to be creative.
and please add the survival blocks in creative like soil, seeds, craftbot, etc"
24349,4 hours in and the game looks promising (y)
24350,noice
24351,"After seeing my 10 year old son play some creative mode, I thought I'd pick it up while at a small bargain.
Creative mode looks to have so many things to play with and seeing the trailers, there really is a heap of things you could conceivably build. Being a bit of a purist though, I waited for Survival mode so that I could see what sort of narrative and crafting was built in.

It's fairly polished for an early access game and the artwork is top notch. Sound design is decent but sometimes a bit off. I wear 7.1 headphones and there were occasions when it sounded like an enemy bot was right next to me but was in fact, about 50 metres away.

Enemy variety is currently only 2 bots. An easy to kill one and an easier to kill one, except in groups of 3+  the easy guys can make life interesting. They're pretty dumb, basically zombies that charge right at you.

There's no tutorial to speak of so you just gotta figure it out. There's health, hunger and thirst and food is very limited. Farming was quite a chore as ""soil"" is a finite resource as it comes in bags. There's no farming tools and everything is done with your hammer-tool-thing, such as breaking things down, ""chopping"" wood and harvesting blocks. Not everything breaks and there's no digging. The terrain is static.

Farming attracts bots but there's very little in the way of being able to defend yourself, so you're better off to keep moving. The first vehicle you build is utter trash and requires constant steering inputs to stay  on course. The wheels are horrible but upgradeable I guess, not quite there yet. It requires gasoline too which is only found in limited quantities.

Took me a couple hours to figure out that you actually need to water your plants  and I was lucky to have picked up a bucket, which you can ""use"" on water to carry it around. This is only good for one plant though  so I had to ferry multiple buckets of water  to my small farm. Some time later, I started to get enough food to survive comfortably however, seeds are in limited supply!

So basically, I think I need to keep travelling along this big road to see what else I can loot. Since there's no tutorial for survival (only on how to build a vehicle), it seems to be acting as a ""tutorial route"" and introducing me to different items, buildings.

This game has potential but I'm still yet to see much in the way of different items or ""quality of life"" upgrades. I'd like to think that I can dig in or at least create a base where I can build and test contraptions before unleashing them onto the landscape or other bots?

Currently: I recommend it while it's in early access and hopefully it keeps expanding."
24352,great game really fun do recommend
24353,no pride month shit
24354,"A very unique survival game, you can build anything you can imagine in this game, Its really fun and of course a bit difficult"
24355,this game is fun and fun :) these folks know how to make a game
24356,"another reason we need a sorta option. creative and the ""mechanics"" part are pretty sound so far, but with survival im questioning the direction the devs are going.

 the sheer grind/design choices has really hampered survival,  if you dare want to explore or make a complex vehicle you will need to farm oil for gas for the next 30-60 minutes. need a bunch of higher tier metal? well first you need gas then you need to find a scorched forest to farm some embers. need more metal? kill a bunch of enemies or mine hoping to rngesus you get the amount you need. time gating on crafting does no good, ive found my self a couple times alt tabbing while waiting for something to finish, getting people to leave your game due to a design choice is not good. 

combat is rather bland. the haybot and little bot you can just walk backwards to fight. the other 2 seem to overtuned the tapebot(?) will 2 shot you and the big one will too. to fight the latter 2 you will need a gun but inorder to get one you need to find a caged farmer which is a task in itself to get where you need it. 

the lack of a map is survivals final nail for me, i had to restart 5 hours into a game as i couldn't find my way back to my base and i ran out of gas while trying to find my way back.

the core of the game is very good, but with survival the negatives are really starting to outweigh the pros. id recomend this one maybe a another year or so down the road if your wanting the survival part, ALOT needs to be done.

 i have high hopes for this one if the devs fix the unfavourable mechanics this could be a real gem, survival was this games selling point so please dont let it go to waste axolotl."
24357,Kinda gay
24358,"since this game was released i have been waiting for survival, now that suvival is out it is a more enjoyable and diverse game and very fun to play with friends or by yourself"

24368,"if you want to die over and over and over and over and over due to the lack of food then I've got the game for you!!! if you play you'll enjoy being a mechanic that can't build a fire to cook meat, then you'll think OH! i should build the robot cook but guess what he wont cook it either. He only cooks it with a bunch of other scarce items. You are able to grow crops but the robots just spawn and destroy them leading to starvation. I've died 16 times of starvation and 0 times of anything else. i do enjoy running over cows though."
24369,I spent 11 hours looking for a trader. No trader was found. Many wheels were repaired. Lots of fuel was burned. I am not crazy.

24373,"The game itself seems interesting and I'd love to play it some more, but...
--> Can't play offline (even single-player)

Stay clear from this game if you:
- share your library (thus going offline) with virtually anyone
- have bad internet
- want to play when there's no internet (train, uni, holiday, ...)

To clarify, you must be set to Online on Steam and have a stable internet connection in order to play Single Player, otherwise the game will not even start."

24378,Last played this game a few years ago and now playing again due to the survival mode update and the improvement is huuuuuuuuuuge and the game is definitely worth its money now. Good job to the devs

I would rate the game higher if I wrote this before survival, as I really enjoyed creative.
However now that Survival is out, there's quite a few things I now dislike:

- The lack of a tutorial: having played creative previously, following game updates and watching a few Youtube videos on survival before it released I was able to play quite easily. However for many players, especially new ones, it's very difficult to start.
- Some things that straight up just don't make sense: For example, there's no explanation why you can't eat corn or drink water (you gain hydration from food). This confused new players (and me) as seen in other reviews.

- Survival is extremely grind-y so far: 6 hours in and still don't have spud-guns.

- (personally dislike)  how they've done farm bot raids: Every time you farm, a timer gets triggered that says your going to be raided by farm bots by midnight, even if you remove the crops. The issues with this is that the waves get stronger depending on how often you farm. This means you're going to spend in game days having your character die of starvation to avoid triggering a large wave you can't handle. And as I've said you don't get spud-guns for a long time.

- Creative mode has barely been updated with new content from survival: It lacks 90% of the survival content such as mining, lumbering, farming, crafting and the new map (still using the old map type from pre-survival) the only things I've found that have been changed are some new parts/changes and the HUD. This is quite dumb, as I would probably try to use Creative for better understanding and build testing.

- Challenge mode has been removed: I didn't play it, and I don't think many would, but they still have the trailer for it on the store page...

- Bugs, as expected: Nothing too major I have found, things such as underwater audio playing above ground, raid timers disappearing if you quit the game and Woc's despawning"
24390,"its actually amazing, I really don't need to say more"
24391,"this game is amazing.
now with the survival update it's even better.
the biggest shame is that the game works very poorly with linux, which is my os of choice.
if they would port this to linux / add even the slightest proton configurations to get this to work, i would be grateful and 
honestly might call this my favorite game.
keep up the good work devs, and I hope you might do something about the linux thing."
24392,"Started survival mode.  Ran around collecting things that seemed useful.  Ran a bit more and found more things.  Got thirsty and hungry yet had nothing to eat and drink.  Died in a pond of dehydration because that makes sense.  Ran back, got my stuff, almost back to my corpse to loot when I was hungry.  Nothing in sight and died of starvation picking corn and killing cows.  Respawned and found a building that I could create a food bot to, I assume, keep this from happening again.  Requires 50 of some unknown block.  Died of thirst and dehydration again with 10 steaks, 40 corn, and standing in a pond of fresh water.  Respawned. 
 Died of thirst and hunger before I even got back to my body.  Uninstalling.  Don't even bother with this game.  Literally the worst thing I've ever bought.  The hunger/thirst thing totally ruins any potential here.  I'd play for hours if not for that nonsense."

24399,"Nah, not yet worth it even at a discount, considering how long this game has been in EA bleh. Very small map with literally nothing much to do or build. Feels too much like Lego: Worlds mixed with banjo kazooie nuts and bolts. Not a bad game just lacks content and things to do; this game feels empty and missing some features. I just can't put my pick on it hmm..."
24400,its cute mad max
24401,"Oh yeah... Survival Mode is what I have been waiting for. I originally purchased the game just to play it and got bored in creative, but with the release of survival I've already spent over 3 times the time playing than I did all before. Even during finals."
24402,Such A Good Game
24403,"Currently the network code makes this game unplayable in multiplayer. I hope they fix it, it's irritating that such a small issue completely ruins the experience right now."
24404,good
24405,Crafty survival fun!
24406,"great game, def recomend it"
24407,There is a bug with the censors. I can't connect or access it.
24408,its a great game played it for 5 hours straight
24409,Great game
24410,Amazing game. i have played over 800 hours and none of that time have i been disapointed
24411,"The game is yet as scrappy as your vehicles, but if you're not afraid of difficulties it's fun.
Also, cars flip over 50% less than in Planet Nomads. Probably because the world is a lot more car-friendly."
24412,Ronald
24413,Dis Be Awsome And i can only Wait For A Schematic Like System to Be In It So You Can Save Creations and put them on the lift in survival mode and u gotta build it your self
24414,well It was fun for the first 20 min while i built my machine but as soon as I took it off the lift the game crashed and now i can't rejoin that world without my game crashing over and over and over. Maybe if they could create a stable game that could run for 30 min without crashing I would recommend but until then this game is not for me.
24415,the survival mode is good
24416,"Very good game the new survival update make it so much better just a few bugs here and there and a little bit of multiplayer lag 
8.5/10"
24417,This game improves creativity but if you are not that creative you can mess with the workshop content. This game's survival is a bit to complex for me so I hope they improve it.
24418,Do not buy for survival mode.  Nothing but a snore fest.
24419,"If you loveded Erector Sets as kid, you will love this game."
24420,YE i recomanded the game but on this update game is bugg
24421,This game is great
24422,good
24423,"TLDR: gameplay is too shallow and boring, things don't work right. 

I played the game a bit more after the review, not much has changed. it took a long time to really get a handle of how to do things. but i do still think that the drills and saws need to be optimized to just work better i really hated how i had to go over the top just to be able to mine some rocks. this game is not really meant for casual players, but if they optimized some stuff, i could be. 

This game isn't ready yet by far. ive been waiting for survival mode to finally get this game and its REALLY shallow. mining rocks is a serious pain. it takes WAY too long to really get to any point where you can kinda start building stuff. the worst part is you just have your hammer for a LONG time. that's it, just a hammer weapon. the only way to get any other weapons is to go through alot of effort to farm up resources then take them to a place, then get packs to trade for a weapon. im 20 hours in and im at the point to trade, and i just don't care. the game is just too shallow. and i spent like 2 hours just trying to mine these rocks, the drill is such crap. once you FINALLY get it and get to rocks, your drill just bounces off of them, and you don't have any way to control it other than connecting it to your motor, which means you have to drive to run the drill which means pushing your drill off the rocks. i tried making forks with blocks to catch the rocks so the drill sticks a little better, but you still end up hammering all the smaller rocks. there is just too much grind and annoyance to the game. what did it for me is i finally ran out of components to build things and i need to go out and just farm up bots, but if i have to swing my hammer one more time, im gonna kill myself. so im just gonna uninstall instead. they need to add more to make the loop less basic. sure you can make anything, but getting ANY resources is such a pain, its just not worth it. ill be back in a year or so see what new things they have. but for now, not really worth it yet."
24424,e foarte bun jocul
24425,Fun game I really enjoyed the time playing between it crashing.  Feels very much like a not yet released title.  Multiplayer crashes a lot and has a log of lag.  I have a fantastic internet connection but still bad lag.
24426,"This game is 100% worth buying, if you are on the fence don't wait. The new survival mode is really awesome! I have sunk hours of fun into this game, and I think you will enjoy this amazing game too. If you like survival games like Minecraft you will LOVE this game. If you are more of a Minecraft creative builder, then there is creative mode where you can build witty vehicles. Survival mode is really amazing you start out on a burning ship and work your way to building your first car out of junk you find in the ship. I would recommend the game more if you have a friend or two to play with. With your friends you can all play survival or make unique mini-games in creative. This game is not even fully out yet and there are hours of fun for you to explore, build and to create."
24427,Great game. Its got plenty of things to keep you playing for hours.

24431,vevry good
24432,.
24433,"This will be a fun game once the game breaking bugs are fixed.

EDIT: As of update 0.4.1 Multiplayer is 100% broken. When the non-host interacts with something it causes the host's game to crash. (Maybe fixed now?)

EDIT: As of update 0.4.3 Friends joining your game loose water at 4x the normal speed. This ONLY happens to people who join another person's game.

--------------------------------
Some of the worst bugs:
--------------------------------
-V-Sync being OFF causes your PC to use 90% CPU.
-My friend joined my game, opened my crafting chest, then then the game glitched and deleted the chest with ALL of my crafting resources. That was 10 hour of work deleted in 10 seconds. This is where I uninstalled the game.
-Water doesn't have physics yet. You literally walk through water just slower, and boats can't move without a rocket engine.
-Poor optimization, laggy gameplay, long load screens.
-Even moderately complicated vehicles cause the game to lag to the point of being unplayable.
-The physics engine is unreliable. Things sometimes work and they sometimes don't.
-The devs make drastic changes to the physics engine so half the steam workshop vehicles are totally non-functional.


--------------------------------
Game Design Problems:
--------------------------------
-The book that you're supposed to start with that teaches you the basics doesn't exist in the survival mode.
-The only merchant in the game is REALLY well hidden. Unless you look up a guide you will probably never find them.
-Combat is completely broken in the AI's favor. In a 1 on 1 fight the standard enemy will deal 90% of your health in damage. They regularly spawn in 2's or 4's. It is literally impossible to kill a group without endgame equipment.
-Enemies with guns 1 shot you. There is no way to make yourself tankier (no armor or health increases).
-This is a VERY grindy and combat focused game despite being a ""survival"" game. You will spend 80% of your time fighting, 15% crafting vehicles, and the rest surviving.
-Metal has magical balancing powers. A wood vehicle flips at a breath of wind, but I've metal vehicles that are tilted 120 degrees (yes that's almost upside-down) magically roll back on to their tires.

My overall verdict: come back after survival mode has been out for 6 months."
24434,Yay (Good game idk)

24437,been looking for a crafting game to keep my attention even though it is simple at the moment but with updates i foresee it keeping my attention for 100's of hours
24438,Thank you devs for not giving up on this and deliver a really fun game to play. It looks and feels amazing! Also thank you for regional price!

24449,Bought it for the survival and the food and water goes away entirely too fast is my only Complaint. Only problem is it them seams like all you‚Äôre doing is grinding for food

"
24451,"Bought this game for me and my daughter to play. We are having a blast, the art style is pretty great and the game is fairly fluid. Took a while to get a direction on what we should be doing but after I got the gameplay loop down its been going smooth. A note to anyone considering buying, read the description of items and it will help you. This is how I found out you feed corn to the Wocs to get milk. 

Bugs:

Aren't many I have seen, people talk about falling through the world but I have yet to have that happen. This game will max out your PC especially in multiplayer. I am running the game at 1440p on a RTX 2070 Super and its hitting 80 degrees with a load of 95% constantly. I have read older reviews and it seems to be a common theme that this game pushes your hardware due to the physics simulation.

Another terrible bug is the vacuum pump, if you leave it out in the water it just keeps taxing the physics engine more and more as time goes on. After about 12 hours the save will become unplayable, the only fix is to take down vacuum pumps in the water when you don't need them. The devs stated they are working on an update for this one. 

These are just what I have seen but so far this game has been a blast for us."
24452,El nombre lo dice todo. (Scrap)
24453,its da best
24454,"So far it's a lot of fun.  Not incredibly difficult maintaining thirst and hunger.  The straw robot can be particularly difficult.. the key is to kite it, sprint (shift) in reverse while swinging weapon.  Make sure not to be going up a particularly steep hill and be aware of objects.  You don't want to get stuck.  Essentially you can circle around and if you'd figured it out, they stop to swing and miss you most of the time.

Since last review, I ventured far away from the start point and found myself in an impossible situation.  the robot that shoots paint balls (?) is essentially a guard where I died, making it difficult to recover my items.  It's about a ten minute trek and I've died three times trying to recover.  It's rather challenging and that I like.

The game I think needs a map, at least a compass and coordinates.  It would be great to build a gps or map device, one that you have to carry in your inventory to access.  I look forward to playing this more."
24455,THIS GAME TEACHES SCIENCE AND OTHER SKILLS

24459,"This game is very frustrating, at least in survival mode. I have no idea what I'm doing, what I'm supposed to be doing, and every vehicle I try to make ends up flipping over into a pile of frustration.

24464,Bro this scrap update is amazing!! they finally added scrap to scrap mechanic! now i can mechanic scrap! its awsome.
24465,The most defining part about this game is the horrible latency. Legit if I ran all of the servers off a Windows 95 computer it would run better. It's fun without the lag.
24466,love it
24467," good
:)"
24468,"I didn't want to be impressed.  I didn't want to like this as much as I do already, dangit.  This is fun.  I usually get bored with minecraft clones but this has got something different, not sure what but I really like it.  All three of my boys do as well and we're spending quite a bit of time trying to build up enough to raid the warehouse already.  Great game!"
24469,adsdf
24470,its fun
24471,Its a good game
24472,I made a car with crab hands to drill rocks
24473,survival mode is cool and the game allows you to build whatever you want
24474,"PROS:
- relaxing environment/vibe
- probably a complex gameplay with lots of potentials

CONS:
- FPS is not optimized well enough. I even lowered the graphics settings but the FPS drop is still unforgivable
- Too complicated for casual players. I played RAFT and it has a similar vibe but I got the hang of it right away.
- No in-game instructions and goals to accomplish


Coming from The Forest and Raft, I can't recommend this game at all."
24475,Glitchy and all around terrible
24476,Although there is still bug but it is very fun and blast out your creativity!
24477,"Survival mode is super nice , you have a food and drink bar , but above all , you need to scavenge your building materials and crafting stuff. guys , just buy it if you haven't already (if you are into tinkering and building) 5/5"
24478,yes
24479,new twist on games in 2020
24480,very nice
24481,good
24482,Im going to give this game a good rating just because a week ago it would have deserved it but now after this new update its gone down hill big time pretty sad to see.
24483,"After hours of grinding we figured out you can't enter warehouses from the top. What a joke. This game need a lot of content and updates for ""survival""."
24484,No instructions. laggy controls. all around Animal crossing was better... DO NOT BUY
24485,i have aids and i am dying
24486,"it iccoooooool
"
24487,"ScrapMechanic has been an amazing sandbox/building game from its early alpha and now into its Beta with Survival mode, it takes all the literal ""mechanics"" you've learned in the game so  far and puts them into practice under perile. The Survival mode is challenging, and has a natural built in progression structure. Though in its early stage and beta still, i cant wait to see what the final product has in store for us."
24488,"Its amazing and the new update has really gotten my intresrr in the game
"
24489,"A relly fun game ,you can  build or find cool things"
24490,"So, I only played a little bit of this, and it does show promise. More exploration of this game would probably be rewarding, but as it stands, I didn't find it worth it. There is a very limited tutorial, basically nothing at all to introduce the player to the world and systems that make it up. All the information I had was the description on the store page. Pretty cool idea, but way too early for this one."
24491,well i like it
24492,Banger.
24493,"Devs: You need to manage your resources and be careful not to die, as you could lose your things.
Me: haha gun go boom"
24494,This game is very fun and easy to figure out. It allows you to be super creative and it also has survival mode which gives you some nice fun challenges.
24495,"I bought this game for a friend and myself while it was on sale because it looked like a combination of Garry's Mod and Minecraft.

We played for ~3 hours, starting with Creative mode and then moving to Survival. We played Creative mode long enough to confirm that we could build working cars and understood the basic mechanics (engines, seats, bearings, how to make sure the vehicle can turn without self-colliding, how to power it with an engine, etc).

We didn't like the game.

First, creative mode felt incredibly limited. For a sandbox game, it felt like we could only build things the developers had intended. There are lots of interactive blocks, but they combine in very primitive and forced ways. It's possible that we're missing something, but we both read the in-game handbook and we're familiar with physics-based sandboxes from other games we enjoy. Some of the pain points:

- When we connect switches / buttons to seats, we couldn't find a way to bind the button to a key other than numbers. This meant that we couldn't do things like setup thrusters that would activate when ""A"" or ""D"" is pressed -- we had to use ""1"" or ""2"" instead. Even if this does exist in the game, the discoverability of it is poor.

- The game includes gates for digital logic, but only the most basic building blocks. While I'm aware that a NAND gate can be used to build a complete computer, Wiremod in Garry's Mod did a much better job at providing useful primitives. In particular, it makes no sense that there's no primitives for arithmetic (ADD / SUB / MULT / DIV) or constants. 

- There's guns and sensors for building automatic turrets, but the sensor is fairly primitive and seems to be more of a tripwire-style ""shoot when an enemy passes"" -- nothing like the beacons or bearing sensors available in Wiremod that made it so enjoyable to build auto-turrets that could track targets.

With that said, the Creative mode was ""ok"". It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad enough that I'd go ahead and write a negative review for it.

Unfortunately, I bought this game because it was advertised that the most recent major update added a Survival mode. We spent probably 2 of our 3 hours in Survival mode.

The main problem is that Survival mode didn't seem to have any discoverability of the game mechanics. The game starts at a crashed spaceship on fire. We immediately tried breaking down the ship for parts, but we couldn't. It's very difficult to tell what parts of the environment are mineable for resources vs immovable. This became very annoying when we needed steel and obvious steel constructions were seemingly impervious to salvaging. A related issue is items that can be picked up (by right click), but there was no tool-tip or highlight to suggest that was possible.

At the beginning, we couldn't figure out how to craft anything. We checked the handbook and our inventory and nothing jumped out. We eventually realized we could use buckets to put out the fire in the ship, and by dumb luck we had already found a battery that could power the ship, so at that point we had a usable crafting terminal in the ship. By this point, we're probably about ~45 minutes into the game and we've only just discovered how to actually craft anything in a coop survival / crafting sandbox game. 

Unfortunately, we were then stuck again. The crafting terminal could only build primitive tech (Why? Isn't this a spaceship?) and we couldn't figure out how to use our ""component kits"" to ""upgrade"" parts. We resorted to watching a YouTube video to understand that we needed to find a gas station to progress. We built a car, but without being able to build any refinery-type buildings with our limited crafting we were forced to an obnoxious resource grind. When you cut down a tree, there are multiple poles, and each pole requires (I think?) ~10 seconds to break down to materials by hand. This means that you spend a few seconds hitting the tree with your sledgehammer to knock it down, and then a minute of watching a progress bar before you've got all of the resources. For each tree. Our primitive crafting station did not allow us to focus our resources onto building tools to alleviate this, so all we could do was grind.

Skipping ahead, we eventually grind enough resources to build a car. We drove off onto the road and found a gas station and learn we need a 2nd battery to power it. We had already tried to remove the battery from the ship when we left it at the beginning and couldn't, so this immediately felt contrived. Additionally, we had tried to move the beds (that I assumed were respawn points), but couldn't move those either. We also couldn't find a way to construct beds or define spawn points on our own.

We had found the 1st battery in some type of ruined building / dungeon, so we assumed we needed to find the 2nd battery in a similar location. We went adventuring to find the 2nd battery (since we were not allowed to take the 1st battery from our ship after placing it), and during a battle in a ruined building, one of us died -- and promptly respawned all the way back at the starting ship, in the bed, with no car, or resources. And that's when we called it quits.

After looking it up, I believe we were supposed to realize that a door in the gas station was breakable and there was a battery behind it. The space ship where we started had trained us that large, pre-defined static environments are unbreakable, even fixtures in them like windows or doors that look like they should break. This was true for the ship and for many multi-floor ""dungeons"" we found."
24496,"It's not bad, but it's kinda boring. There isn't a real end goal. I like the construction, but gathering is a bitch."
24497,"Interesting game, but lacks instructions. You are thrown into an open world with no explanation of how things work."
24498,"Several very stupid design decisions makes Survival too annoying to play, so it is not recommended and it should not have been released like this.  Otherwise it would have been fun."
24499,"This game is just amazing, there are endless possibilities. Now that survival has come out, I can see my total game time going up very quickly. Now back to the game!"
24500,Perfect mix in game play types love the UI its extremely smooth
24501,make sure you have a good computer for this game because the graphics lag your computer big time
24502,"Great potential. Extended hours of creativity and hilarity. 

Cons:  Not optimized, some frame drops under circumstances. Limited multiplayer support."
24503,it gets boring when u play by ur self
24504,"The game is very shallow.  Crafting is tedious, time gated, and slot limited. Basically no new player experience. Grinding some materials is painfully slow.  You dont build vehicles to solve problems. I dont understand why the reviews are 95%+."
24505,Great fun to build crazy inventions.
24506,"Can get boring at times, but otherwise it's good"
24507,"goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

24522,its good trust me

24524,survival update has made this game infinitely more fun. definitely recommend
24525,"fun game.
"
24526,It is definitly fun to play the creative mode but now that survival is out the game is just less fun overall. I expected that these features added for survival would also be added to creative when possible but instead they are 2 totally seperate builds of the game so far as I can see.
24527,"There's barely a game here.  I understand the creative mode might be an appealing sandbox to some people, but survival mode is not worth playing.  There's zero guidance on how to even get started, and once you do figure it out, the amount of time needed to craft any of the cool stuff you see is crazy.  No real game mechanics to speak of.  I get that its early access, but the game has been out over four years."
24528,"Lots of stuff to do in survival mode.

Wish there was a loot all button for your respawn loot."
24529,great
24530,survival was fixed but multiplayer is still poopy stinky
24531,Survival =D noice
24532,"Game does absolutely nothing to explain how to play, and its a pretty complicated game."
24533,"I saw the recent ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews figured I'd give it a shot with my friend. From watching the trailers I thought what I was getting was a co-op survival game, but i suppose it's my fault for not realizing that the survival portion of the game just released several days ago and is very bare bones with nothing to do. 
My survival experience so far: 
-Create a character and realize after several minutes that the only way to invite friends to the game is through steam.
-Wander around looting until I realize that I'm dying of thirst.
-Find a lake that I can't drink from, then find a bucket right next to the lake that I also can't drink from.
-Manage to loot an energy drink and stop dying of thirst.
-Start dying of hunger because you can't eat the corn scattered around the map.
-Learn to farm
-Robots attack and completely destroy farm and run out of food.
-Adventure to loot more seeds and soil.
-Fight tons of robots with a hammer tool and almost die each time, and never learn how to craft a weapon.
-Discover that there's a handbook that tells you in detail how to build a vehicle, but not how to do anything else.
-Build vehicle that is slower than running speed.
-Use up all of the gas and never find out how to get more.
-Run out of inventory space because there are no tutorials or recipes on how to make any type of chests or lockers.
-Stop playing until future updates.
-Also don't go underwater if you value your speakers/headphones and eardrums. There is a LOUD/massive audio bug.
What you see in the trailers is mostly the creative portion of the game. While it can be fun if you just like building vehicles, I for one was expecting more of a survival game. I look forward to future updates when there is more to do in survival mode."
24534,"Even though I do recommend this game, the only issue I have is that there seems to be no crafting option available for the time being. So everything must be found, which sucks because you get kinda overwhelmed with enemies when looting building, and not able to craft weapons, or components for building makes it annoying to build a base. Even so I can tell this game is going to be a blast when they add more things they are working on. Hopefully they add in a crafting mechanic, but I would wait until they finish up adding everything. Helpful tip- if you get overwhelmed by enemies place down a lift and bring yourself up and hit enemies when you get close they can bring the lift down by hitting it but you can still control the lift"
24535,scrap mechanic
24536,its amazing
24537,"Fun, would be more fun if the multiplayer had less lag."
24538,don't buy this game if all your interested in is survival ok k thx bye xoxo
24539,'
24540,"Picked this game up on sale concurrent with the release of survival mode.  I've put a couple hours into it and have gotten the following impressions so far:

- Controls are explained reasonably well in the help menu.  Not my favorite way to learn to play a game but it's early access.  Hover prompts are inconsistent and should be added for things you can pick up with RMB (like the batteries).
- The game points you to a farming area early with a nice little billboard tutorial.  Watering everything you plant is a pain, but I got over it.  What I didn't get over is the ""UNAUTHORIZED FARMING"" mechanic, which causes robots to come and smash your crops on a timer.  Even better: the timer disappears if you quit and reload the game, so you don't know when the robots are coming.  You can choose to babysit your crops or just accept that they'll be gone the next time you come back.  This really demotivated me to do any farming until I figured out how to build walls around it.
- Materials take forever to collect and refine.  Sitting and watching the same half-second animation looping for ten seconds while I wait for my character to generate ten tiny blocks of wood from a tree part is mind-numbing.
- Survival mode starts off pretty great as you figure out how to bang together your first car, but that's quickly soured by what a godawful experience it is actually driving the thing.
- The car sucking is at least good motivation to try and improve the car.  The problem is that I'm almost three hours in and I haven't found a way to do that yet. 
- I've driven what feels like five miles inland from my landing site, have found duplicates of every structure in the game already, and the only things in the crates have been farming supplies and occasionally batteries.  The most exciting thing I found after opening hundreds of crates were some glass blocks.
- I was super excited when I found a workshop-type location with a battery plug-in.  I powered it up, ran over to the craft bot, and discovered it had the same handful of bad recipes that my ship's craft bot had.
- I was poking around a large factory area, trying to find a ""warehouse key"" that would let me into the main structure, when I was two-shotted by a rapid-firing assassin bot that jumped up out of nowhere.  I respawned about three miles away with no supplies and with my hunger and thirst meter basically empty.

Survival mode is currently inaccessible, repetitive and poorly balanced.  The RNG of getting items out of crates is frustrating and combat is somewhere between tedious and actively irritating.  At some point I'll probably jump back in when they've had a chance to fix some of these issues, but for now I can't recommend buying this game unless you want to play the creative mode."
24541,gud
24542,its ok i guess
24543,This game is great and you can do a lot for the little price that you pay!!
24544,I waited 4 years for Survival Mode. IT WAS WORTH IT!
24545,i bought the game for the survival. a bug when you go underwater almost blew my speakers. and the progression is so so so unglodly slow. everything you do is like bashing your head against a wall and combat is rediculus. im really enjoying the game myself. but id wait a month maybe before buying it if you want the survival mode. let them iron it out.
24546,"played this game since the beginning, this game is something different, the art is neat, the game is good, but the part you can build almost anything you can think of, that is the game I have been chasing for."
24547,Its a fun sandbox for all ages
24548,Looks like a great game but I have to refund it because it won't even launch. I found several people with the same issue but no solution. (SteamAPI_Init() failed)
24549,the new survial is  amazing
24550,"[b]Final review (17 hours)[/b]. You can find older reviews below:
If you're planning to buy this, I'd suggest to wait for a year or two first.

While creative mode offers interesting constructor mechanics, survival mode is a huge mess that largely amounts to continuously gathering pitifully small amount of resources spread out very far away on the map. Everything is time gated, resource costs are out of whack, and you rely on monster drops, loot boxes in order to create the most basic things. There's no self-sufficiency, and automation abilities are very limited, as the only thing you can automatically grow is food, and the rest has to be harvested manually.

Since the release date the developers has not posted a single response to steam forums, which may or may not indicate that the whole thing is a swan song and the game might be abandoned in the future. 

So, long story short:

Positives;
* Cool functions in creative mode.

Negative:
* Survival mode is overall bad and inferior to most titles out there, grindy, unrewarding and lacking depth.

If you grab Satisfactory, Space Engineers, Factorio or even Conan exiles, you'll probably have more fun. The only fun moment I had was making a piston car (a car where wheels are rotated with pistons), but even that was largely done to avoid dealing with fuel, as fuel consumption is out of whack.

Recommendation: Avoid, or wait for a year or two.

Review after 10+ hours.

This is actually quite bad. Important upgrades are locked behind resources which are nowhere to be found, and logic of the world is nonsensical.

[list]
[*]There's hunger and thirst.
[*]However, you cannot drink lake water, and you cannot eat cow meat, corn or potatoes. 
[*]Critically important driver seat requires cotton.
[*]There's no cotton in kilometer radius from where you spawn.
[*]Critically important tools require ""second tier metal"" (why is this even a thing), but making this requires embers. 
[*]Except there are no embers within 1 kilometer area from you. You can grab 9 of them where you spawn, but if you spent those and lost your vehicle, you're screwed.
[*]You also can't make embers yourself, as there's no way to set a tree on fire.
[*]You spawn in the last beds you slept in, and you CAN build a bed on your vehicle...
[*]Except a bed requires cotton. See above point about cotton availability. You aren't getting any beds any time soon.
[*]You also can't remove existing beds to use in your own vehicles.
[*]Robots deal ridiculous amount of damage. Tier 1 and Tier 2 are manageable, however, tier2 charges with you at speed of berserker, and 3 of them will wipe you out.
[*]Tier 3 bot has sniper precision, ranged attack and can take you out in 2 hits.
[*]Lots of materials cannot be crafted and have to be looted. For example, bearing cannot be made from metal, and has to be built from SCRAP metal (WHY?!), and that can be only obtained by murdering robots.
[*]Multiple components and upgrades require ""component kit"", and that cannot be crafted and has to be gathered from respawning glowing loot boxes. 
[*]There's no map.
[*]There's no compass.
[*]Map has copy-pasted buildings and in general quite bland.
[*]Vehicles require fuel. Except they devour fuel very quickly, and you'll be running out of it all the time.
[*]There's no tutorial, intro or explanation.
[*]There are few posters with basic explanation of mechanics, but the game makes sure to lead you away from them right at the beginning.
[/list]

Crafting system isn't bad. For example you can make a piston engine, which is kinda cool.

However, everything related to survival mode is poorly done and not very sensible. Pretty much any survival game will be better.

Earlier reviews can be found below.

---------

Review after 3..4 hours:

[list]
[*]I missed the window for refund. 
[*]Overall impression is that everything is very messy.
[*]The game is very grindy. Anything worthwhile requires scrap metal. Scrap metal is gained by killing robots. 
[*]However, there aren't enough robots to kill! They're rare, scarce, and drop pitiful amount of metal. 
[*]On related note, the square wheeled frankenstein I built is slowly running out of fuel. No fuel in sight. Giant gas station I found can't be scrapped for resources and has no fuel in it. Blueprints indicate that there are recipes for fuel, but once again, necesary ingredients are nowhere in sight.
[*]There's no map and no compass. That's not very convenient.
[*]Recipes use graphics without captions to list ingredients. Except half the pictograms look similar. You have ""gray brick"", ""slightly grayer brick"", ""slightly brighter gray brick"", ""slightly brighter gray brick with ridges"" and so on.
[/list]

Definitely can't recommend it in its current state.

Original Review (1 hour 40 minutes):
---------

I Grabbed it for survival.

Impressions:
[b]Extremely[/b] rough start. You spawn without any sort of cinematics, notes or explanations near an apparently crashed ship on fire, with a road of shining crates.

After a quick testing, you'll figure out that you can smash crates, collect stuff from them, so you'll probably gleefully follow the crates and... starve to death. Or the robots will murder you. Nothing is explained.

[b]Apparently[/b] you're supposed to ignore the shiny boxes, and go into a completely different direction where you'd find a well hidden location with a single poster which will teach you to farm. Apparently ship being in flames is not the end of the ship, and you can extinguish most of the fires with a bucket of water which you can only fill from location from 100 meters away or not. Apparently, the fire at the top of the ship is immune to water, and can't be put out no matter what, so it will keep burning forever as a funeral pyre for that scrap bucket.

Apparently, behind the fire there's a crafting station which will let you build stuff at extremely slow speed (20 second to make a wheel). Apparently if you press ""H"", you'll get an illustration explaining how to build a car. Apparently the first car can be built from scrap and will have pretty much square wheels, and finally after a hour and half of mucking around and running to the lake you'll have a vehicle capable of somehow moving somewhere.

So, long story short.... Gameplay design in survival is awful. From the looks of the things, you're supposed to continuously hunt for resources and keep looking for more crafting stations and without them you can't build a thing. You spawn in the world apparently playing a dorf, but the game forgets to give you ANY sort of direction at the beginning. Even Doom (1993) had more explanations.

With all that in mind I'm currently contemplating whether I should refund it or not. The survival mode is extremely roughly made, even though visuals are okay-ish semi-cartoon style."

24552,Good game
24553,"Attached a spinning saw blade to a pole on the front of my car. Placed passenger seat (toilet) on top of saw blade so my friend could ride with me. Spun my friend into oblivion for the duration of our 10+ min trip. 10/10 for Ragdoll hilarity. Seriously fantastic game. Never played pre-survival update but this is really special. Combines things I love from Space Engineers, Rust, Animal Crossing, Stormworks, Mudrunners, and even Farm Sim to great effect. Worth 3x the asking price. Pick it up. Just give it a few hours if starting in survival mode. It'll take you a couple hours to get started on the good stuff. The game really comes alive once you get food and a car going. Amazing with friends. Have fun gamers."

24564,"It's hard to explain why this game is so rewarding despite the open access status. 
Something about how you can tear down a building, start slapping something together, throw an engine and chair on it and drive it off. 
You can tear the bits off a fruit stand, slap them on your car and go on your merry way. 
The progression from a spine-shattering jalopy with no suspension and wheels that take ""round"" as a suggestion, to something resembling a buggy. 
The physics behave as you'd expect them, the world is surprisingly fun to explore though there isn't much to find. The loop of go out, gather resources, build a thing and do it again is somehow way more fun when you're able to build whatever you want to help with that loop. 

In other creative games, vehicles are usually an endgame item. In Scrap mechanic, your vehicle is the journey, destination and limited only by your imagination. 
As a buildem and do stuff with it game, it's amazing.
As a survival game, it's rough around the edges but has plenty of room to grow. The core game is there."

24574,"I just got this game last night and this is my experience so far. 
I spawn in look to my left. ""oh nice set piece, oh straight ahead looks clear i must have to go that way"" to my right has become irrelevant the game has guided me straight and it looks like woods to my right. 

I continue exploring for over an hour finding buildings bashing boxes, killing robots, etc. 

About an hour later having received no guidance i start to try and figure out things on my own. What does this H do i my screen? i ask my self. 

45 min after that exploring i find the farm, i learn the ways of farming from the big sign and while i wait i look around. oh this is the ship set piece from the start. oh... i have buckets now... oh.... can i put out the fires? oh... i need that battery.... run back pick it up as i did not know about pickup when i found it the first time. 2 hours later i figure out the crafting bot. 

This whole experience should be a 30 min guided tutorial. go right > get bucket > put fires out > go get battery > power up craft bot > for info on how interactive parts work press H. Enjoy the game. 

In short the beginning of the game is an example of go home and do it again, I think you know what i mean Mrs. Vigushin. 

This game looks amazing and i look forward to playing it more but i have to say no on recommending it till a tutorial is made."

24591,This is one of the best games i have played. There is limitless  possibilities of what you can do and with survival mode just being released there is more. I can not recommend this game more to anybody who likes freely building and survival.
24592,Uhh duh i recommend it. stop looking at bad reviews
24593,good for those who like the feeling of making that perfect contraption for a job thats unique to you
24594,GAME 10/10
24595,Interesting Ideas not super well executed. Survival progression is terribly slow and grindy and gets boring really quick. Has potential in future updates but is not fun in its current state.
24596,"It still needs a lot of polish, but survival mode is pretty good and the game itself offers a lot of opportunity for customization and building whacky stuff.  It has automation and industrialization and horde defense.  Lots of charming easter eggs and good clean fun."
24597,"best with friends, but fun regardless"
24598,"its gooooooood
"
24599,fuck dis game awesome
24600,nothing
24601,YEET YEET
24602,"A big yes for the creative mode. YES!

However, if you buy this for the survival as of early May 2020, its way too grindy. The mobs are tough af which isn't a bad thing for survival, but alone it is a pain in the ass. 
I would suggest you to buy it, experience it in creative and have fun with it, though if you don't have friends to play with, don't buy it only for the survival."
24603,"We have waited years without any updates so the devs can 100% focus on survival. So what did we get? Another bare bones survival game with no objective or even something to point you in the right direction. ""BuT JuST GeT gOod"" is what I can already hear you typing but with 100 hours before this update I know how to play. For example you start next to a burning space ship but what do you do. Well you don't go down the path nooo that would be dumb you go off to the right and pick up a bucket (a new item) and Fill it with water and dump it on the fire in the ship to extinguish it (a new mechanic that isn't explained). The AI of the bots is shit and you can beat them without getting hit once just by bhopping backwards and wildly swing your sledge hemmer. If this came out a year or two ago it would be fine but this is all you could do after 4 years of development and two years with no updates is really disappointing. Hopefully we will have a decent finished game soon."
24604,good
24605,good
24606,"Fantastic free-form building game. No real tutorial meant that my buiddy and I spent the first two hours desperately trying to survive with no real food source. Once you realize that finding (a specific type of) food is trivial, the game really opens up. Great building mechanics, great cartoony graphics, great everything. Wish there was a world map of some sort but the lack of one actually adds to the experience and makes you remember landmarks."
24607,"This game allows you to build almost anything, and has the potential to be the best survival/creative game."
24608,me like
24609,"ITS FUN
"
24610,THIS GAME IS AMAZING. I just bought it and didnt even realized that I played it a whole day I realized only when it was very dark lol. Amazing game.
24611,Good game all around pretty fun.
24612,it's a fun game to spend time in
24613,SURVIVAL just dropped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24614,"Damn
this is the best game that you can build stuff with
like
10/10
5/5 on yelp
1/1
100 on ign
is epic"
24615,gud!!
24616,"Crashing issue aside, I got it for survival mode, got the wrench location / saw advanced bots / parts, and there just doesn't seem like much to do.  If you're a builder, and just want to make funky contraptions, with cartoonish physics, then you might like it.  I don't see how there's not a gyro or other needed mechanics for realistic flight, but it is EA.  Maybe I'm just too picky, watch vids and decide for yourself.  I'm just bored waiting on Cyberpunk so most games are meh atm."
24617,"uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh, its ok."
24618,nice
24619,"GET
"
24620,i love this game it is my favorite but i think its haunted
24621,"The last update destroyed everything.

After the survival mode update most of my crations and mods are unussable, I cant even host a server after the update, i can only join games. But what angers me the most is why the hell am i not able to search through everything in creative now ?? Do you know how hard it is to find a modded part when you have about 30 mods ? 

Unless these mistakes are fixed im not changing this review

Edit: The game has been fixed, it's playable again, although a lot of my creations still don't work because the mods containing these parts are no longer being updated. UI is great right now, probably better than before and everything is okay. Very good updates Axolot."
24622,"I was very excited for Survival Mode, however there tends to be a ton of bugs. I'm having connection issues with multiplayer and have had multiple crashes in the past hour. The multiplayer is pretty much unplayable and I wouldn't recommend it until it's fixed."
24623,I bought this game yesterday. I already 11 hours of playtime. It's good stuff man. Get some homies together and build shit.
24624,"really nice game, i have been waiting for the survival update for so long now and it's finally here, 10/10"
24625,IT IS PERFECT
24626,"It's growing on me. I still think obtaining water is stupid (can't drink from bucket), but the survival game is certainly growing on me. Still needs some work, but it's certainly coming along."
24627,"fun, hard, but fun"
24628,Back before survial this game was fun and i played with friends for hours. Now that there is survial I can play for like hours on end with friends  and not want to go. If you are creative GET THIS!
24629,yers
24630,super fun!! really relaxed game that has a lot of gathering and crafting. WAYY better than that bland shooter Destiny 2.
24631,I bought it for survival mode and its just a grindy pointless effort. No means to store items and if you leave them on the ground they despawn after a while.  Food is a pain in the rear because the robots destroy it with extreme ease no matter your defenses when starting.  I love the look of it but the gameplay is pointless and not fun at all. Spent five hours only to watch all the stuff I looted despawn.
24632,Very fun
24633,"i like this game so much because it has survival finaly after 4 years
but the warehouse bots are so powerful and please resolve the lag in online

one mode bug is that sometimes when u leave the world it doesn't save what did u do in that rtime"
24634,"Survival is a huge slog. Incredibly difficult to obtain a useful amount of resources. Robots will destroy what little progress you made almost immediately. If a robot destroys your driver seat (1 hit), then you lose the car because the engines don't stop. Lots of issues with collision and getting stuck between in objects. Very little in the way of food/farm management. Items you would think you can consume, you actually can't. You can't craft anything on your own. You need to find workshops with the appropriate functions before you can do anything remotely significant. 

There's also no tutorial or information on what you're supposed to do at the start of survival mode. No guidance and you're left to stumble around on your own.

The game is not optimized and will have lag spikes. With a RTX2070 + Ryzen 2700X 8 Cores, the CPU will reach 80C. 

Don't bother if you want to play this game for survival.
It's early access, and it shows."
24635,love this game
24636,"funky scraping

scrapy coco

the zohan"
24637,"Pros:
Good building mechanic
Lots of creative freedom with the use of switches/controllers etc.
Creative mode is a blast to play

Cons:
Un-optimized (Freezes, Overheating while playing)
Survival grind is insane (material gathering/refining takes forever for little gain)
Instructions are limited on how to progress (materials are not identified in the menu)
The balance of health values for items seem to be extremely poor for survival (driver's seat being destroyed in 1-2 hits, causing your car to drive off into the sunset never to be seen again)

At it's current state, I would not recommend this game due to performance issues, grind mechanics, and balance issues. However, with a little tweaking, this could become an awesome game. This will be a game to keep on your watch list."
24638,You can be creative and build cool stuff or look at other peoples creattions
24639,it is just amazing
24640,it is amasing
24641,"the good: 
nice game mechanics, and gameplay, environment. 

the bad: 
too many robots destroying what ever i build, no objective in the game, no map"
24642,"Extremely technical, and extremely fun."
24643,its fun
24644,"Survival mode leaves a lot to be desired.

Doesn't seem to be much like the trailer at all.    
Run around for hours looking for resources, that's it."
24645,AWESOME
24646,"Not what I expected from reading the comments, at all. I did only play for an hour but still didn't seem like I got anywhere, and just didn't seem fun. Just not my kind of game"
24647,Build flying dicks with wings
24648,15 hours played in 24 hours DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
24649,"i only wish  in the new survival build i cold invite my friends
"
24650,khghcg
24651,Ce jeu est buger en duo pour la personne qui rejoint la game et fait crash
24652,"The game has some bugs and doesnt offer alot of informations on how to do things, but it's quiete addictive. Once you figured out whats going on its really fun."
24653,"Over a year in the making and survival mode is a mess.

Constant crashes, constant lagging out and rubber banding with friends who join, no compass, no map, no documentation of anything or what anything does. 

Grind grind and more grind with very little reward system in place.

This has potential maybe eventually, but as for right now... it's not worth the price of admission, even on sale."

24655,"Like Minecraft but with steroids. Logic circuits, vehicles etc."
24656,"oojji;ohlafhelaro;elgrahaers,dzgbefluierhagrbhjreu"
24657,New Scrap Mechanic Survival is fantastic. A definite yes if you like the survival genre and enjoy a more whimsical feel to your gaming.
24658,its really fun to play
24659,noice
24660,Its just epic the Survival mode is amazing just slightly buggy ATM but it was only released 2 days ago
24661,"It's fun, and really trains the brain."
24662,"fun
"
24663,Amazing
24664,"Currently, for survival, no. Needs more work and the grind is fucking insane. Usually I love a good grind, I play crafting/survival games solo. This kinda takes the piss though."
24665,Its good. I hope the devs don't abandon it after 1.0 release. This game has a lot of potential to be popular.
24666,nice
24667,"For people who like resource gathering games. It takes a minute to get going, and you will spend a lot of time gathering.... but it is worth it if you spend the time."
24668,"its fun engineering simulator, everything is logical except that radish and potato actually grows above ground LOL"
24669,This is actually a game for nerds. I pull up the help menu and it starts telling me about AND/OR logic gates. I was hoping for a good time with the boys but it's pretty much Redstone with Fortnite graphics. I feel I've been lied to.
24670,YES
24671,t
24672,very interesting
24673,Great game for people who like to build stuff or just want a fun game to play. plus the sandbox survival vibe you get from being able to make your own base and machines in a survival world is the best.
24674,lags sometimes but okay
24675,"This game fits the description and genre of a game that I would enjoy, in theory. However, the loot system is completely RNG based and in order to explore and expand you are required to craft a vehicle, but the components required are rare drops. It's like minecraft if the only harvestable option were trees and you had to break grass in hopes of getting diamonds."
24676,is good. like game much
24677,5uj 46rtjhrttytydrhy
24678,fun with friends
24679,It's a fun game where the sky is the limit!
24680,"i kept losing items, so much so i had to restart because i lost all my embers.

turns out it might have been my own fault as i was dropping items rather than placing them down. 

Pros:

If u can imagine it u could build it. 
great survival game idea. 
test out ideas in creative.

cons

the frame rate drop when u are mining stone/iron is terrible, at one point i had 3fps due to it. its a issue that needs fixing. 
Very grindy game, But to be expected with it being a survival game.
game crashes can make u lose trucks/items 

Stopped playing because game crashed and i lost the truck i built that was holding my first warehouse key, was also so far from my own base i could not make it bk without dying. and kept respawning at the same place."
24681,This game is so slow from the beginning. The book that explains how to do things is not very helpful at all. I played for a solid 10-15 mins before i just asked for a refund. So slow. So boring. Nothing is explained on actual gameplay. I was honestly very excited for this game because im tired of all these AAA games and was let down tremendously. SO BORING
24682,Best game ever
24683,Very many nice
24684,good

24693,"If you are looking for a survival game this is not it. The building is great, and machines are fun to create, but its not a survival game. its a great building game though. just not what I wanted."
24694,BEST GAME EVER!
24695,Worth it 100%
24696,oke
24697,survial is great
24698,Game's awesome since the survival update. It's now one of the best survival sandbox games out there
24699,"This game is amazing. The physics are perfectly smooth in single player. in multiplayer things can get a bit bouncy, but most of the time that just adds to the fun. This game has endless possibilities of things you can build, I definitely recommend this game."
24700,it is like minecraft but you can not go underground

24702,yes good i like game

24707,fun
24708,A bit confused
24709,So far Survival mode has exceeded my expectations. Definitely worth the wait! I'll add more detail once I've had more time with the game.
24710,"Buggy with plenty of design flaws, and yet still made with love and a very enjoyable game, I'll enjoy seeing how Axolot evolves the game over time; after all, it is only in early access!"
24711,dasdwasdwa
24712,just awesome
24713,cool game
24714,"Game multiplayer do not work. As soon as join multiplayer survival mode, games start to lag a lot. What is even worse game kills steam voice channel (distortion prevent to understand anyone), it looks game overusing some resources. I play Trine or Portal multiplayer without issue, but I cannot play multi in this game."
24715,It is a good game and you should play it
24716,you can build your own vehicles
24717,great game for those who loves to create
24718,"I liked it, dont know about my friend. I overheated his pc by spamming water"
24719,good
24720,It is a fun and creative game!
24721,Creative and fun plus the survival mode is really good despite the bit of a learning curve
24722,big yes amazing big recommend
24723,Very nice
24724,"Should be named Gnomes Vs Robots...
Great game!
10/10"
24725,If you have some friends who buy it as well it's probably fun. None of my friends had it so I got bored and lost very fast.
24726,"I really like this game, but younger players would have trouble stretching their hands out. But this game is AWSOME!!!"
24727,awesome game for both solo and multiplayer
24728,"survival is great but full of bug and 
is currently unplatyable in co-op"
24729,veri nice
24730,"Great game, Survival is still very new so i'll hold judgement though it seems good, theres lots of fun to be had in creative and challenge mode my only real issue is that theres no tutorial, new players are pretty much left to figure it out and hopefully find the guidebook ingame, id like to see a toggleable prompt for help available."
24731,its fun but hard
24732,e
24733,pretty fun
24734,Underrated
24735,"I always thought this game was too cheerful but now with the survival mode, it is just dark the enough for me."
24736,Survival Mode is the best most fun I have had in a game for a while now cant wait to see more updates on it and more stuff added :)
24737,its good
24738,"why cant i drink a single drop water when i swim in lake ?why cant i eat anything make by cooking robot ?THAT IS A COOKING ROBOT ,NOT JUST A FURNITURE. I buy this game to experience suivival,but i was starve to death  again and again because my crop were all being destory by dozens of robots,,Weapon always  hammer ,can i update or something? I cant just use the hammer as a weapon to explore the map...
And PLEASE ! GIVE ME A MAP ! IS THAT HARD?"
24739,It's easy to build
24740,"Good Game, Even better with survival"
24741,yes
24742,Very fun game to play on your own. Even more fun when you have to rely on your friends to help control a poorly made rocket ship.
24743,"its good
"
24744,"The game is very good, it is very well optimized, and it works on slimmer computers, I have a system from 2010 with a gtx 750 ti and it works in a decent framerate, the game is calm, it's a little hard. The disadvantages are that there are only 3 types of robots, and the locations are very poor in details and items."
24745,Best game I've ever played. Love it!
24746,highly recommend and the new survival mode its incredible and really fun to play with friends and by your self
24747,"its a very fun game and a nice experience, Plus the survival mode is also fun i recommend it"
24748,"scrap mechanic is an amazing game with friends, the most played game i have, and is practically the groundwork of me and my best friend. so yes, please try this game!"
24749,one of the best games i have played
24750,"Very good game, seems like a total grind if playing solo, but watching streamers play with others makes it seem even more enjoyable. Things move along much faster obviously. Still a great concept and fun to play. Would like to see more component kits drop as well. That is also a ""grind"" in this game."
24751,Now with survival is best game!
24752,goof but the ping is insane
24753,AMAZING AMAZING AS EXPLODING WATERMELON JUICE!!
24754,yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
24755,Yes i almost killed my friend but he had 2 hp left they should add friendly damage
24756,"the wait continues, held off on buying after hearing about a survival mode in development. It's really not worth the wait. Wish I set a timer for 2 hours so I could refund the game. A lot of the positive reviews come from the creative mode, which really doesn't interest me."
24757,I love the game
24758,really laggy please fix
24759, dffwef
24760,mmmhhhhh
24761,Nice
24762,fewdAWdAW
24763,very good game survival very good but some glitches hold it down a bit but ive enjoyed the 500 hrs of creative and the 20 hrs of survival.
24764,is nice
24765,"So I've in some time into the survival mode. There were things I liked and things that I didn't care for like how the hate-bots can detect when your growing plants which is VERY VERY VERY annoying to deal with now if they happen to be in the area and spotted you. Then headed in your direction to discover that you have be growing plant then let them target it from there. 
Other than that it's a pretty good game.

What I would like to see is the option to use a handheld PC controller. PLEASE MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. I prefer it over a mouse."
24766,"Evreything its the best game ever
"
24767,the survial is dope an all but it still needs some work i will test it agein in a few weeks
24768,amazingly fun with some really awesome mechanics. i have been enjoying this game and its great definitly worth the price
24769,No controller support. Bit weird for a game where it feels like it'd work really well.
24770,h
24771,"This game is innovative, addictive, and just all-around amazing. It's what I wanted Minecraft to be, when I first discovered that. I would be willing to pay a monthly membership fee, if the developers kept this game going strong; no joke."
24772,Yes
24773,it's amaising
24774,"Rcommended
"
24775,"My original negative review called out the game for being poorly optimized and having performance issues. Since then, the devs have pushed out an update that addressed some of these issues. While I think the game uses more resources than necessary, even on it's lowest settings, the game is certainly playable and looks like it will be improved upon in the future.

The creative mode is fun in short bursts. I've made some crazy, fun, and scary machines in this mode. Survival gives the player a sense of purpose to their creations, but comes at the cost of being a lot more tedious. Gathering the same resources again and again to make a slightly different vehicle can get a bit boring. That said, making a functional vehicle out of parts you scavenged from the world is very satisfying, especially when those vehicles work in unison with each other."
24776,in this game in creative you build stuff that is just dumb and in survival well you build something for function because if you don't that would be wastage
24777,you can die of thirst while standing next to a lake because you're not allowed to drink water.  0/10 do not buy.
24778,good but a bit too laggy

24780,Best Game !!!!!
24781,A Really interesting game and alot of fun now when survival is released :)! I do recommend you check out some youtube videos about the survival mode before you start :)
24782,great game
24783,It keeps your mind sharp.
24784,"looked fun at first, but it keeps crashing. cant play"
24785,Noice!
24786,"Dope game . 
very Fun 
Highly recommended"
24787,"Survival Mode: It's like The Forest but PG clean and better
Creative Mode: Amazing
The Game: Amazing 10/10"
24788,"Maybe good in creative mode,
but survival mode is pure grind at the beginning.

- melee combat is repetitve and boring (running backwards while constantly swinging hammer)
- locations to explore are samey (empty ruins and vegetable shops)"
24789,"The game's new survival mode added so much more, and its just an overall great game. The sandbox and block building type of construction really ties together with the mechanical parts to make perfect fits and machines :D"
24790,"Survival mode could do with a little more of a ""help"" system. Just to explain the game a little more. The food and thirst also is an issue early on in the game. It drains pretty quickly and all I seem to be able to find around is corn and cows, both you can't eat. I wouldn't recommend this game at the moment. 

Maybe if you could have survival mode without the hunger/thirst like other games as an option. And a little more help at the start."
24791,Sick
24792,"I have had Scrap Mechanic for about a year now while it was exclusively creative. When I found out that survival had come to Scrap Mechanic I was super exited and got all my friends to buy the game as it is on sale. At the beginning me and my friends were optimistic and saw the potential of the game, but in the end we were all very disappointed.
 
In the first 30 minutes of the game we all had a blast as we made a small house and enjoyed exploring the buildings that are already in the world but we noticed that the corn that was collected and the meat from the cows was not edible and we could hear each other moaning as we were slowly dying of hunger and thirst. After struggling and not knowing what to do after an hour of play we finally found the workshop that allows us to craft things and actually make a robot that cooks the food that we couldn't eat, we then saw how many resources we needed to craft this cooking bot and no one could be bothered to gather them as everyone was bored of the game. 

Scrap Mechanic survival really disappointed me here because I have been playing raft for weeks now and love that game to bits, I hoped the game would have the same charm that raft had and I know that Axolot are capable of making really good games."
24793,This game so fun and good
24794,it is fun no real rules just goof off
24795,"Fun!
"
24796,Full of bug.
24797,I just love this game!!!
24798,"If you like crafting games this game is great. Pleasant graphics, adorable little robots to help you craft stuff, and an interesting build dynamic. Excited to see what this game has planned!

I only have one complaint. It would be great if the sledge hammer can block attacks, Because the Haybots pack a punch!"
24799,oke
24800,4 years has passed and its still lagging fix it for f sake!

24804,yes
24805,gud I say its amazing!
24806,How does this game have a 97% positive rating? I think it needs a lot of work. Full water containers will cause 5-10 seconds of latency for connected players. Resource rarity is way off. Logic and vehicle blocks feel like there should be more.
24807,NICE
24808,the new mode is so good
24809,"pretty good i say, survival is too"
24810,engine+bearing+seat=car
24811,Very good game!
24812,"Wonderful game. Build Anything you can come up with. Not buggy, runs smooth, lots of opportunity. Survival is fun but would be better with around 20+ people."
24813,The new survival mode is awesome!
24814,This game is amasing
24815,4 hours i played and i want to play more 2 hours later.
24816,"Is Just Good
"
24817,"PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THE SURVIVAL MODE JUST LAUNCH YESTERDAY so...

If you interested in the survival part of this game, please hold on for a bit more for more content. As the survival part just launch and the in game world feel so empty...

Well long story short, current survival mode in this game is exactly like creative mode, ONLY DIFFERENCE is you have to grind your dingle off to farm, craft and build. 

there's no other purpose as of now other than enjoy the scenery...

Current content are very limited, read below :-
- the whole survival have 2 normal enemy, 2 elite enemy
- sea /  underwater looks beautiful but there is nothing to do there, u only go there for 3 things...
- there's couple of so call biome... where the biome offer u a special ingredient only available to there and that's it.... (there's 5 biome as far as i discover)
- the survival part are kinda a joke as of now, 
~traveling car bed spawn point for the win~ 
~so screw farming for food and drinks~

not recommend to others if you only interested in the survival part of the game(like me), otherwise if u like experimenting and creating complicated machinery the this game is definitely good to go.

Thank you for reading, and hope you will like the game"
24818,"A nice game specially the survival, however what I dislike the most is I have no idea from where some items I can get with is frustrated. My recommendation is: When crafting I want to see the names of the items, and a finished wiki with all items and description where you can find  them etc, as that's the most annoying part of the game. 

The rest of the game is really nice ;)"
24819,There is so mutch to do in this game it is a 10/10
24820,Very nice
24821,tbh no
24822,The best suvival game i played since 2020 and i really enjoy it playing with my friends
24823,"THIS is one of the sci-fi co-op games you've been waiting for. Speaking as a hardcore co-op player, this game (even in EA) is one of the better co-op experiences I've had!

Better co-op than (apples to apples as far as genre):

Empyrion
Pulsar
No Man's Sky
Conan Exiles/Ark/Atlas
Astroneer
...and dare I say, Raft

* As an aside, Raft is really cool, but something about it just tires me after a while; I think it's because it it wants ALL your attention ALL the time *

I don't know when the content runs out, but the mechanics of the game regarding exploration, vehicles, cooperative gathering, immersive-ness (1st person cockpit/bridge views, yes please), vehicle and structure design, gameplay loops, are top notch when taken together.

Can't wait to see it developed further. But tl;dr: play it co-op with your favorite partner(s)."
24824,this is the best fucking game i have ever played
24825,Shit ton of fun!
24826,survival is the best
24827,IT GOOD
24828,"So i don't normally write legit reviews, but since this game was so much fun when i tried it out with a friend i felt like i should.

Iv had this game for a while now, long before survival came out, but eventually the building got stale and i drifted away from the game. A few days ago i saw the survival update came out and jokingly said to my friend 'oh wow they finally got that out after all the community is dead' Turns out i was very wrong. The game still has a large community and as  well as that, the update was well worth the wait. It added exactly what the game was missing, some stakes. Resource gathering is fun and i font think it will get to feeling repetative due to the fact that you can just create a new way of gathering them. Combat serves its purpose well, i have yet to unlock any gun but the enemies feel good to fight as it is.

Id say the game is quite close in tone to a zombie survival but with the added benefit of allowing you to create your own inventions and bases to help you along the way. Genius idea executed near perfectly, the only exeption being a few lingering bugs, nothing too big but still of note.

I don't give review scores but id definately say that this is an amazing game and you should try it out.

(Apoligies for some bad spelling)"
24829,"bought scrap mechanic a while ago and tried the ""creative"" it was cool for a bit, first couple of hours trying to figure things out the next couple for trying some ideas out then i was done with it. Sat in my library for 5 months until i saw the survival update, downloaded the update with a friend and played for an hour. It was so fucking boring, trying to find out what to do the entire time on a ""tutorial"" island where it just hands shit to you fuckin lame do not buy"
24830,game suck
24831,I learn more physics from this game then from my teacher
24832,Siick
24833,its a good game
24834,Very good game duh
24835,Would hold off if you want to play co op and don't live next door to your friends. The net code isn't great and there's a very noticeable input delay when playing with friends across the country
24836,YES!
24837,amazing game
24838,"The game is not polished enough to pay 20 dollars one at the moment. I had a difficult time getting the game running in the first place. (game would stop responding if I even clicked during loading) In game had many stutters despite not looking like it warranted the processing power to cause it to. The game just isn't fun with its flaws and I would've just refunded it and bought it when it was optimized and had more features but the time I spend messing around to get it to work meant I went past the 2 hours of playtime.

I'll change my review if things change but at it's current state I don't see a reason to by the game in this state at this price.

-PC SPECS-
i7-7700k
GTX 1070 FE (Game ready driver 445.87)"
24839,In short: Buy this fantastic game! :-)
24840,it good
24841,it's good
24842,Fun Game Play Alone or Alone... I have no friends.
24843,I love these types of games where you have to explore and build items to survive while enemies try to kill you. I'm so happy that Scrap Mechanic has a survival mode and I've already played it for an hour now it's so fun!
24844,"Mechanics are not intuitive, follow the steps in the handbook step by step and you still wont have a car that functions. It might turn on but thats about it. Getting resources is a crazy hard grind, hit a tree 10 times, then it falls over, hit that log 5 times it breaks in half, hit the half 5 times and you finally get a resource that you have to hold E on for 10 seconds just to get 10 wood."
24845,Its a great game
24846,"Game needs some Tender Loving Updates. 
but overall i love it! 
Keen to see what will come"
24847,good game is fun :)
24848,"It's on sale! Now, before you dive in...
This particular review is based mostly on the time I've spent with survival, in its current state. It is subject to change.

EDIT PLACED AT BOTTOM OF REVIEW

THE GOOD
The world that Axolot has crafted and the toy-come-to-life art style is very appealing. The character models and animations, especially those of the robot enemies, are delightful. The in-depth engineering mechanics make me eager to play more and understand them better. It feels similar to the first time I got a programmable K'NEX set or Lego Mindstorms. This game is somehow very addicting. It might be because I'm stubborn, but I think it's just the powerful sense that you're always close to another layer of depth. You're never as close as you think you are, but that first moment you get a vehicle moving on wheels is a banger. My friends and I were rolling with laughter, especially when our characters kept dying from hunger & thirst and our bodies would tumble off the vehicle. This is all great, when it works without a hitch.

THE BAD
The rate at which hunger and thirst begins and deteriorates in the game is brutal, especially when the crates and drop rates for actually edible items are so awful. This downside is emphasized by the obnoxious OOFs and UGHs of a hungry, dying player character that everyone has to hear, every second, every tic off your health bar. All three of us were confused at the logic; not only were we all dying from hunger & thirst on the reg, we were genuinely frustrated that any corn you pick up, steaks that you harvest, and potatoes you find, etc are NOT consumable items. I'm sure the Cookbot you are able to manufacture later would allow for these items to be utilized, but the resource requirements for these robots, like the food, are horribly sparse. Having a few of us to combine resources made this easier, but I can't imagine doing this solo in a rewarding manner of time. On that note, the amount of time it takes to refine materials is a bore. There seems to be a mid-game option to have a robot do it for you but who knows when the RNG decides to make that viable. While a huge, spread out map seems great on paper, it's tough to get around and even harder when you can't get Sun Shakes or milk to keep going and constantly reset your loop. 

THE UGLY
After a fluid three hour loop of creative mode, the game started crashing routinely. Even launching hours later, it would not load into a world. Every time multiplayer connected, it got choppy, laggy, and then disconnected. It does not currently support multiplayer in this state. It has serious technical bugs that break the game and make all the fun you've found in your hours playing turn to frustration.

THE LOWDOWN 
We were optimistic after having tried Axolot's RAFT. Unfortunately, the experience in Scrap Mechanic Survival is VERY clunky and jarring. It took us over 2 hours of actual groans and moans to grasp what I can consider the first signs of an intended gameplay loop. It just isn't that enjoyable from the get-go. I never expect my hand to be held but the bottom line is that when I play a survival game, I want the discoveries to be rewarding. They should mount up over time in a way that makes me less reserved about things. Pair the issues up with a very unreliable multiplayer connection and you are given a game that has all the makings of greatness but only works about half of the time. There's gotta be some balance changes before Scrap Mechanic Survival can feel like the rewarding experience it has the potential to be. I hope Axolot is ready to put in the work on this because it could be great and I want it to succeed. I'll update as I attempt to explore more of the game.

EDIT COMMENTS:

CREATIVE MODE
Creative mode is an absolute blast. With or without a guide, you will undoubtedly find an engineering style that works for the creations you are imagining and then creating. It's tremendously rewarding, no matter the amount of trial and error, to create a functioning vehicle of any kind, of any shape. Axolot has done an incredible job crafting a detailed physics engine with all sorts of tools, while allowing for a simplistic exploration of mechanics with an incredible amount of depth. I had loads of fun making creations in all manners while experiencing the trial and error of engineering. 

THE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
This complex physics system seems to be at the mercy of an individual's internet connection. While I played solo mode, I experienced essentially ZERO errors or game crashes. However, any time we attempted to bridge a multiplayer connection ( be it on one PC build/network or another ) the game would have very unpredictable and consistent lag and/or crashes. I hate to say it, but the multiplayer needs work most of all. If you are seeking a multiplayer game, skip this until it has reached a point of playability. Here's why: from what we've been able to tell, you have to consider the amount of complexity of each invention per server. Perhaps more simply put, the more complex creation(s) you have populating a multiplayer world, the more trouble you may experience with playing 2+ players. Any time we put a new machine on the lift, the lag came to a halt and the game operated smoothly. The moment we removed a lift to bring a creation into testing, the entire world began to lag and chop. It didn't seem to matter what we removed from the gameworld to keep the cache open for new creations. The physics engine is fun and complex enough to keep each invention you create interesting, and the payoff to a working creation is tremendous. However, it lags and introduces issues each time you add a new player to the world, in order to experience your creations &/or Steam Workshop additions. This problem absolutely must be addressed if Axolot seeks to continue marketing this game as what it says it is."
24849,Yes
24850,"Good building game. Very fun, but I haven't played it in a while. Just downloading it again today because I got bored. Love the experience I've had with it so far.
"
24851,"So after some thought i figured id write this review. while I'm giving it a positive review I will say if your thinking about buying it hold out for a bit. In a way I would say this game reminds me of the early Minecraft days where getting diamond was pretty much the end game and there wasn't much to do after that. only difference is this game your working on getting metal and wood and getting more and more efficient at it trough contraptions you build. And at first that sounds great but then the game starts feeling a tad shallow at this point in time. There are only four variations of enemy's currently in the game and the most rare things to collect appears to be clothing which at as far as i can tell is cosmetic. While building the farm is fun and does start a raid event if you do it the rewards are not that great most of it is stuff you can already craft at the craftbot. The only real reward for farming is earning the spud gun and at that point when you can get it you probably if like me have already fought the 4 enemies and found other ways of dealing with them. The only one i struggled with was the big red enemy and i will say spud gun does make him way easier since you can fight him from a distance.

Now i feel i did list more cons then pro's but i also feel the devs have a good product here and though shallow it is fun making wackey inventions and with a friend the sillyness you can get up to out weigh the negative to me. I'm also aware the game isn't finished and I have hopes the devs keep up with it and release more to it."
24852,i have played the game for 100 hr in totle and i love it even more with the new suvivle
24853,"Bought this game long time ago basiclly when it launched and at first i was impressed but after like a month of playing it got boring so i completely stopped playing and when i heard survival was coming i was overjoyed (still it took them like 2 years to make it) and finally survival came and let me tell u is fricking awesome u have all these tiers of blocks and other resources, farming, raids, warehouses, all the new mechanics. Well i guess my point is if u have the money and u need a survival game that is fun and has alot to do buy it. Cya later"
24854,Sure it can have bugs and broken world but they are trying to solve those fast
24855,It is AWESOME i waiteed for the survival for a long time A really good game
24856,yes
24857,"good game, wouldn't put a whole lot of time into it tho. 3/5"
24858,The grind will probably be easier with friends but i dont know for sure because i dont have any friends
24859,"yes good game!!!
"
24860,"The Game has potential, its really good with survival co-op.
I would recommend more guns like sniper and more, and private & public lobbies to join/host."
24861,"Lots of scrap, many mechanics. i'd rate this game 5/7."
24862,grd<gf<e
24863,Zim zam ala bam. Pretty fun game.
24864,It is good but my pc has to be pn lowest graphics to run in and it overheats quickly
24865,i understand its a early access game. but it's basic. once you get past building 1 little car. little bit of exploring. do the warehouse. but after that there is nothing else. to do the game is unplayable when you join a friends game
24866,"Played it for a bit
Seems like a good game"
24867,"

GOOD FOR peeps who like to invent (try out survival mode)"
24868,"With the addition of survival, it makes it into what feels like a full game. It is super fun!"
24869,"good building game, boring survival game, hopefully they add more content/biomes and map markers. Muiltplayer is laggy."
24870,a fun overall game well worth the cash
24871,best game ever
24872,I have only played for a short amount of time compared with others. But i highly recommend to any one that likes minecraft or astroneer type games.
24873,"Unplayable Co-op - Everything has a huge delay, including movement. Needs dedicated servers."
24874,Unplayable co-op due to massive input lag.
24875,"First off.. this game is STILL IN EARLY ACCESS - this is what you need to know before you start complaining about bugs, and things not being finished and polished.. it Is just not there yet. I had some issue my GPU ( AMD Radeon ) which works beautiful in most games but in this i am getting stutters.. ( you can see it in this video - https://youtu.be/IHO4Uc8FtmQ ).  But, again it is in EA...  and I have to say this company just one a life time fan due to their very very amazing way of releasing this update. They didn't make a paid DLC like most early access games have done in the past...  nor did they release a completely NEW game like other companies have done..  which to me shows how great this company is..  they don't just want to get your cash but they want to produce a great game... and that they are..  and I say are because it is not complete yet..  again this is EA..  those that are complaining there isn't a lot to do in Survival or you have to wonder around to find stuff well..  i was just released right?  in EA still right?  this is the nature of buying a game in development..  if you want to wait for the full release just wait..  but it is a great game as of now and a great dev company."
24876,the survival.
24877,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24878,Very good.
24879,"very good

24880,it fun
24881,its a very fun game
24882,very good
24883,its dope
24884,"I cannot overstate what a monumental improvement Survival Mode is. It's taken Scrap Mechanic from being a tech demo, to an actual game; a really pretty game with a great sense of humor.

That said, Survival mode is still pretty rough. It has no tutorial or waypoint system, material rarity & costs are unbalanced, harvesting is tedious, and the random map generator spawns impassable areas.

I'm sure this will all be ironed out in a few weeks, but for now, it's new-player-unfriendly."
24885,"This game is annoying me. I am not a fan of the WASD control scheme. So I went into Options, then the Control tab, then I click on the alternate key button. Nothing happens. I click on it and press Enter, nothing happens. I mash the left mouse button like crazy and suddenly the change key dialog box comes up, followed in a blink of an eye (literally a micro second) by the assign the left-mouse key dialog box with a warning that it is already assigned to some other function. So I went into my Mouse settings, sped up the mouse double-click speed = no good. Slowed it down. Sort of good. Was able to change three of the direction keys. On the 4th, it is screwing up again. I need to do at least another half dozen keys - do not have the patience with these godawful setting. I think these controls are utterly useless. The game would be REALLY fun if it would allow me to rebind the keys. But since it does not, it is a pain in the nether regions. 

I think I have some other mouse kicking around, an old Dell mouse. I will try it to see if it is a hardware issue that is causing the problem. This is doubtful because anywhere else, I do not have any double-clicking issues. But maybe the game has a problem with Roccat gaming mice... Who knows?"
24886,I've always wanted to buy this game. The only reason why I did not buy it was because there was no survival into it. I loved the building and the way everything just worked. I finally seen they came out with the survival and I about sh** myself. I bought the game immedietly without any details on survival. I love it so far. It just needs a little more content to the survival aspect.
24887,good!
24888,"GREAT game, game crashes when I join my friends game"
24889,Such a great game. Way better with friends to play with.
24890,gamer time
24891,"It's like a mixture of Minecraft with the survival basics of a 7 Days to Die/DayZ.  It's also ""similar"" to 7DTD in that (if you are planting anything) you need to be at your base every night at midnight to protect it from the bots coming to destroy your garden.  Fun, creative, light-hearted survival.  I'm enjoying it!"
24892,interesting and showing potential.  My kids like it.
24893,i love this game
24894,"So it took me quite awhile to figure out how to get my machines and vehicles to function correctly, but once I got them going I've been having so much fun. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sandbox survival games or just games that challenge you mentally as well as creatively, 10/10 from me great game."
24895,"L

24896,it good
24897,survival is great

24899,one of the best games - good
24900,love survival mode!!
24901,Game is great but god damn I wish there was a map function I already lost my base while exploring
24902,This is one of my favorite games.
24903,It's fun. Idk what i'm doing but the journey has been fun
24904,"My son and I have played the original and enjoyed it quite a bit.
Now that there is survival mode, we both have a copy, and are getting back into it.
Survival with 2 players is a lot of fun. 
I hope to see more development of this game. It has a pretty solid core to build on."
24905,"While the community is not the best, this game is one of the best, no, the best I've ever played. It takes skill even do the simple things, and with survival now out, the game is even better.

While it has issues, they aren't ones that ruin the experience. Plus, every game is bound to have issues.

This game is rough when you start out, that's honestly its best thing. It has very little hand holding, especially in survival, you learn through trial and error, which honestly is more enjoyable then being shown or told everything you need to do. Survival is rough, Creative is fun. I honestly don't know what to say besides give it a try, if its not for you, that's okay, just, stay away from the community."
24906,oof
24907,"i think it taks to long to get in but ids grat
"
24908,"Its got its bugs and problems rn but the core aspect feels good, the building is intuitive and satisfying, and the defense mechanic is something that not a lot of games have quite got right."
24909,...
24910,"After more then 4 years in development ""Survival"" ... arrived.. and it has broken pipe systems that doesnt work properly and the content is minimal. Dont get fooled by the couple machines you see in trailers and such... you wont be able to automate anything... run and grab components with your hands within the short sunlight of the days before it gets pitch-black and you stand waiting for being able to play the game. Poorly developed and no effort put into it with the long time they have been having. 

I havent tried playing it Multiplayer yet, but I allready feel its not even worth trying that.

If you look for a survival game with mechanical automation in, back to MineCraft with mods it is. This is not worth the money or time.

-2/10 - Loooong wait for minimal effort put into the development. 

Not impressed at all."
24911,i like it
24912,Its cool
24913,it pushes you creativity limits
24914,epic game
24915,Crash crash crash crash
24916,Fun game in survival and from what Ive seen in videos creative looks amazing.
24917,"This game... Is so... AWESOME! 
If you enjoy a creative hot mess in the sweetest of ways, where you build contraptions and vehicles that you'll either learn to hate or grow to love, this is for you!
And if you play like me and don't really research how things work it's a lovely curve of learning the mechanics aswell."
24918,this game is mint
24919,"Besides some small glitches and bugs this game has really delivered a fantastic and interesting survival experience. a rare example of an early access game coming into its prime with stunning resolve, and delivering on its promises."
24920,it is a good game
24921,"it is such a fun game you should try
"
24922,it's a awsome expierinc and it was very fun and enjoyable
24923,"i am really enjoying had so much fun and can't seem to get off ( been playing for 7 hours in a row lol) but the game is very buggy, but with time i hope the devs optimise and sort the bugs out"
24924,"Love this game but does anyone have an idea why my 3month old computers fans go crazy even on the low settings with this game ?? Sucks because .... 

I do love this game .. super cute, great look, .. i mean you can flush the toilet nuff said .. but really whats up with my fans and this game ??.... 

All is good fixed the issue VSync ,... if your fans is going nuts like mine just turn it on .. Running now on highest level everything fans dont even come on .."

24932,fun
24933,"Weather Would be a nice little atmospheric event snow, rain, thunder, seasons, Etc. 
This Game Has a LOT of potential 10/10 this game is worth the purchase you will enjoy almost ever minute of the game"
24934,very nice very nice
24935,Yes this is good for the laughs because i have had fun with it for years now
24936,would be nice if i could play it haven't been able to since the challenge update. since then just crash on start up
24937,Great game :)
24938,Will there is not much to say it was fun
24939,its like minecraft but better and a lot more teniclie best game ever
24940,"not sure why the reviews are so good on this game - there's no story, no depth, and no real game play. Just fiddling around."
24941,"Excellent game, now even better with the new survival mode, i love playing with my friends, def worth the money"
24942,game felt empty even though it's been in development for 4 years. building felt limited and sometime annoying. survival mode feels like just creative mode but locks stuff behind tons of grind that isn't really connected to the name mechanic but more of a farmer that happens to know how to make a car. not even planes.
24943,MAd
24944,hi
24945,survival
24946,"Great game, however there is this barrier at the start of survival about being thrown in the dark end without proper explaination on what do to. Its fun trying to figure it out however I can imagine for most people it would be frustrating. I thought at first the game was easy once you got some of the systems down but boy was I wrong. Some items at the start of the game you think ahh this is easy no problem until you realise that there are some SUPER hard to get things like trying to find broccoli and old people in cages. Heaps of fun for technical people who enjoy problem solving. :B1:"
24947,the game is but a shell of its former self
24948,its cool i like playing
24949,"Good mechanics, great idea for a survival. However, somethings missing like a mini map and most descriptions for items."
24950,"Very frustrating game-- both myself and a friend requested a refund. Lots of other happy reviews so I'm not sure what myself or my friends did wrong, but I couldn't get anything to function. Early access since 2016... It's 2020 and still no user tutorial? Yikes. It even recommends in the game description doing challenge mode to learn the gameplay... which is not available yet.  No descriptions on any inventory I pick up so I've no idea what anything does or how to use it. Cannot break down trees or rocks, and basically instantly killed by any robots I come across because my hammer passes right through them. The trailer videos are very misleading and I'm overall rather salty about my wasted time. Lame. 0/10. 

(An extra note that was a personal grievance... why are blue eyes the only eye color allowed? Kind of weird to have character customization but limit that single detail. Eye and hair color are the first things I figure out when making a custom character.)"
24951,"Amazing game! Thank you devs! I hope they iron out more of the physics based networking! The game is a physics based sandbox multiplayer with awesome survival elements. Create, build & survive against the environment with your friends."
24952,Survival is fun and really fun with friends however there as a bug that makes it almost unplayable for anyone joining your world or vice versa. It is like having 500 ping but constant. if the bug is fixed then this game would be at its maximum level of awesomeness. I get that survival mode has just came out but some optimisations are definitely needed. Another bug is an audio bug underwater that makes it imposible to explore underwater becaus of a loud bass sound that would wreck low quality earphones and sensitive ear drums
24953,it good
24954,Not recommended for now. The trailer shows all kinds of cool stuff being done but after playing for an hour all I see is a tutorial for building a vehicle. I have no idea what else to do.
24955,Potato
24956,Its really fun and creative!
24957,.
24958,"This is a fun game, might need a guide to start out as it's a little different then the traditional crafting survival game."
24959,Scrap mechanic is alright game.... Survival mode is too boring  for solo player...
24960,Its a very good game <3
24961,"Dear Axolot games I normally really like this game, but survival is not playable the switch for the trader shows the massage0 ""this button is not conected to anything and the trader menu also do not open"
24962,very fun if you put in the time
24963,Multiplayer is completely broken. Graphics suck for a 2020 game. Movement is janky. Literally 10 mins in and instant refund
24964,Game is a blast. One of the very few experiences where you cant cheat and look at the wiki because the survival update is so new.
24965,also yes
24966,"This game is fun, creative and just amazing."
24967,da fa
24968,"A lot of fun. Can't wait to see what becomes of the game. 
would recommend if you like building, burgers and hitting crazy farmbots."
24969,survival is great!
24970,this is good
24971,"I refund the game because of these issues

24972,aka
24973,funny game but now even funner game with survival
24974,This is a fantastic game
24975,it is a great game nothing wrong! go buy it
24976,Fun
24977,its great and i genuinely love it however its hard to run so make sure you have a good enough computer.
24978,"Fun game, recommend if you like sandbox games or technology mods on minecraft"
24979,"super fun in survival, eating and planting is a pain in the ass but its fun."
24980,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GOOD GAME LOVE SURVIVAL
24981,awsome
24982,amazing
24983,WE LOVE IT
24984,holy crap. i played this game for so long and they finally added survival. im so happy.and it looks great
24985,One of the best games i have ever played
24986,i just opened it
24987,"Came back after the survival update arrived yesterday, and god did it change ALOT. I found myself playing this for the entire day! 

starting can be quite confusing, but what i did is scavenge as much as I could and find what i could like breaking the lootboxes or the buildings, then I used the ""Maintance shuttle"" as a temporary base and try to find a suitable base, found a gas station not so far away from start. 

my suggestion is that if you have a decent lot of gas, make a  (SHITTY) vehicle as you can, I made a ""truck"" as a moving vehicle to have all my beginner's loot to the gas station i now reside in.

my two negative opinion is the 20-30 damage of the orange haybots, I found that the easiest way is that to hit them with your hammer while going backwards, just becareful of something behind you wwhile hitting them like trees and such. and the complete absince of a map. which ofcourse is somewhat a little unneeded if you remember the direction and distinct landmarks you passed.

but the survival is a really fun mode to try out."
24988,its ok
24989,"Well, Quite sad to be honest, This game had so much hype for survival, But seem's like all the wait for something so basic and underwhelming there is no tutorial. You're just going to run around for no reason. Honestly It's just creative with a few walls you need to jump over first just to slow you down. I do  n't see the fun in this.  where's the goals that differ from creative.  what farming? Kinda Poor effort on my behalf."
24990,great game especially now with the survival
24991,yuhuh
24992,DO THE HOKEY POKEY NOW
24993,"PLAYYYYY IITTTTT especially in 2020
and in 2021
and whatever year you are seeing this 
now 2022
Note: midway through 2022 me and one of my mates somehow had nearly all our local saves and clothes gone after switching PCs, so dont switch PCs when you have this game"
24994,vwery gud pls download it good
24995,"The new survival update is a  great addition to the core game with new blocks and aspects to the game
"
24996,I love this game so much I totally recommend this game!
24997,it is fun but tedeis
24998,survival
24999,"The Game use to feel very lackluster 20 hours in, i got bored just building without any real cause top build and i carried on to games like Stormworks: Build and Rescue

But then Survival Mode came out, and now i feel like the game has a more clear objective without being overly constricting. Survival mode is definitely a step-up for this game, Now if you excuse me i gotta get back to building"
25000,Game Crashes for no reason to main menu terrible used to be good now its bad lags even on small creations for no reason
25001,"IT SO GOOD
"
25002,"this is a really fun game, even with an awful computer that runs at 2 fps
"
25003,This Game Is So good. So many possibilities. I bought For The Survival mode. And It Did Not Disappoint. Highly recommended.
25004,e smek
25005,"I have been playing Scrap Mechanic for a while, and I have to say, it used to be SUPER boring. I thought Axolot had given up. Finally, 7 months after they stopped sending devblogs, they send the survival trailer. That made my day. Now that survival is out, veterans will come back to Scrap Mechanic with a whole new experience. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a new adventure."
25006,very relaxing and great to pass time
25007,"Im really disappointed with the game. I bought this after seeing the awesome trailer for the survival mode, and seeing some cool videos on youtube. But everyone in videos, including yours has all this apparently super advanced stuff.  I can't figure out how to build anything besides a basic scrap rig, and I've only manged to find 3 gas so alot of good a slow vehicles gets me. Theres no tutorials for the survival. Im a huge fan of survival games, and from the videos it looks awesome and something I'd have a lot of fun with, but not in its current state. Theres just no direction or objective based systems, its just like ""heres a world, good luck figuring out how to craft anything, or find water, or know where you are."" Theres no map or compass so it makes treading to far from spawn location a bit worry some.  I have no idea whats going on and after dying several times I dont really feel like running back out to recover my useless junk. Also I have like 20 corn, and I can't eat it, and walking up to the body of water gives no option to drink? I've died of thirst at least once now lol. If you guys get me a tutorial, or something that gives me direction, as in how to build anything else besides the most bottom tier items, i could really find myself getting into this game, and changing my review to thumbs up! Actually i just noticed this has been out for 4 yrs and is in early access still, think im gonna go for the refund"
25008,its very fun
25009,You can be very creative with your builds. Has a awsome comunity. Totaly recomend to anyone who likes to build or just has a creative mind.
25010,"It is a very good game
"
25011,"10/10, built a 16 bit calculator then had my friend run me over with a car made entirely of toilets, corn, and some guys hand, blow shit up so bad i crashed, then dm me ""oops"" afterwards"
25012,yes
25013,amazing
25014,fun game
25015,its a fun creative game and now with survival it gives you a lot more to work towards and gives you more goals to work towards
25016,great
25017,"Now that survival mode has come out, the game has probably become the best game in my steam library. Scrap Mechanic is honestly an amazing game."
25018,BUY IT !!
25019,Story mode is extremely boring. but the rest of the game is fun
25020,This is an amazing game
25021,its awesome
25022,"The game crashes too much as of writing this updated review. It's a lot of fun without a doubt. However, its hard to find someone to play the game with, and with the game crashing from simple actions such as, changing the power level of an engine, or saving a vehicle on a lift its easy to get discouraged from playing."
25023,This is one off the best games a have one steam
25024,"fun
"
25025,Survival is great a 5 stars from me
25026,Your normal building game
25027,Its fun I really like iit
25028,"It's a fun game to melt hours into, especially if you enjoy engineering."
25029,is good
25030,the survival is fun
25031,very good and also cool new survival update
25032,good sandbox / survival game and would reccomend as it is a good game and allows you to do sooooo many things with the creative sandbox and if you like it survival
25033,"Even if people complained for the long wait of the survival to came out (even though the creative part is quite fun) I think that the devlopers made a great jobs with the patches. When I first started playing a couple years ago, I could agree that the game was not done. But after 4 years of developing, I think that the devs made a great job withe the survival aspect. Every little detail and the viarety of things to do while giving a challenge at the start makes this game great. The world is really large and can show you a lot of things. Cruising along other players is another level of fun. All in all, I sincerely think that the 4 years of waiting was worth it a lot."
25034,no fucking way? THEY ADDED SURVIVAL TO THIS GAME!! FINALLY. time to reinstall this work of wonder
25035,fun
25036,i don't know if this helps make your decision but i can choose for you. yes get the game
25037,"I requested a refund as soon as I found out you must be online to play. Any game that allows single-player and mandates you be ONLINE to play is...well...stupid.

So they're basically telling you is, ""Yes, you paid for the game and yes, you can play in single-player mode. HOWEVER, if cannot, for whatever reason, connect to Steam then you are poop outta luck."".

That's ridiculous.
"
25038,yes
25039,"It is a very good game. The new survival mode is very fun. Creative is fun is a good way to practice.
"
25040,"At first glance your going to judge it unfairly by its graphics. However as you play, explore and build you will notice that the graphics blend very smoothly with the land and items. In sandbox mode you can get lost when you let your imagination go as you build the perfect ? that you love. Worth the money and devs seems to listen to the gamers."
25041,Building death machines for world conquest 10/10
25042,grape game. 4/3
25043,it good you buy
25044,"i love the new survival update. Altho it would be a good idea to allow people to ADD water and mineable boulders/trees as well as maybe allow us players in creative to spawn farmbots and play with the ressources. Also, i realized that the Devs are ''remaking'' the challenge gamemode. Witch is a really good idea.

By the way i kinda clipped inside the roof of the mechanic shop dorms and im stuck. so i have to wait till i die"
25045,"This game is fun. If you like crafting/exploring/base building, then this is a win for you. The Linking system is great and leaves it up to your imagination to figure out what possibilities it has. I look forward to the Workshop integration of builds and vehicles. I predict many hours and much laughter. Eagerly awaiting updates and more content."
25046,survial is realy fun and its a better game with it
25047,"It burns time like few games can do, and it is perfect for lockdown."
25048,EH
25049,Its fun
25050,great game lots of fun
25051,its a fun
25052,it good
25053,I LOVE THIS GAME
25054,Amazing game for any type of player
25055,"IT's a great game
the new update is making the game 454545454x better"
25056,"With limited hours in, I like the game.  I do not know how active the Dev team is, but there has been several updates since the Survival mode has been released.  There are some bugs, meh, nothing game-breaking.  The game isn't too well optimized, though, and is perf heavy.  There are lots of cool elements to the game, and it does NOT have a linear feel to it, though it is somewhat linear.  Limited weapons, but the creations are pretty endless with tools given in game.  OVERALL:  it's worth the money (though my copy was gifted to me by the toastiest of toasts) so give it a try."
25057,very nice very good
25058,buggy
25059,building cool things
25060,Fantastic update. Can't wait to see what the future brings for survival.
25061,T
25062,"this is a good game, especially if you like sandbox style games"
25063,goiod
25064,"a lot of fun building and surviving, would recommend to anyone who's a fan of coop building survival games"
25065,"This is the best game i seen ever,i played it for 4 hours because now i bought it but i know this game from frist version and now,when survivel go out i decided to buy it and i dont regret anything"
25066,Very good
25067,it is awsome
25068,"its a amazing game even before the survival update but they need to make cotton easier to get.



edit: but the multiplayer system could use some work because its really laggy for me but it also might just be my bad internet, it used to work fine."
25069,amazin very nice nice qwality

Gameplay(Survival):
‚òê Very good
‚òê Good
‚òê Okay
‚òë Bad
‚òê Awful

(NB! This only applies to the survival portion!)
You only grind to get better vehicles, and the only purpose of the vehicles is to explore and gather resources. Exploring gets quite boring as most of the buildings look the same and contain the same loot. If you die during exploration good luck as you have to walk all the way back to your car which can take several minutes.  Most importantly the game is very confusing in terms of what you should do and how to unlock new stuff. The combat is very bad. Firstly you only have a melee weapon which is only effective versus one or two enemies at a time. You can unlock a gun/spud launcher after a while but I never found out how. Combat is important as you need to fight to get one basic resources(scrap). You can eventually unlock a drill but this requires a lot scrap. 

Last complaint seats need a health buff as they can easily get destroyed which fucks if you are far from a crafting place.

25078,"[edit] Survival has been fun but the time to wait for complete updates is longer then a eon. Monthly updates would suffice, even if they were twitter postings. As for game updates they should happen not yearly, but 3 month time periods. Its just interesting to me that a company like Axolot who has made their money continues to prolong this ruse... 

Survival makes this game complete and I hope they add more. Its been a long time coming and its been worth the wait of 4 years. I bought this game on a promise of survival way back. Creative is fun but isnt fulfilling. Survival now is fulfilling and its fun."
25079,Harvest Moon + Robots + Sandbox. That's it and it is great
25080,i suck and i love it even though i got nothing done in 4 hours
25081,yes me oui
25082,its realy good
25083,"Game is pretty entertaining. Can build pretty much whatever. Wish there was more to do and it's a shame been in early access for so long.

For survival mode, I had to change component kit drop rate and install a mod for thruster efficiency, but other than that it's pretty solid. Lag isn't as bad as some people say as long as you don't build anything crazy (me and my friends have good internet connection and decent computers). Overall one of my favourite games."
25084,its a very good game I have a very nice time well playng but mijn game immediately crash when I go underwater and hear that stange sound.
25085,its gooder than cheese
25086,"yes
"
25087,i love this game because the building and logic you need to use to make amazing things
25088,"The first 30 minutes of gameplay in survival lacks intuitive progression and discourages players from continuing.  It takes extensive time on youtube to figure out how the basics work.  The normal incentives that would guide a player through the opening moments of a survival experience (think subnautica, as an example) don't exist.  Even worse, the opening moments attract the player with shiny loot boxes to run away from the starting location and any potential guidance, actively distracting from the minimalist teaching opportunities for the unfamiliar."
25089,"very god gam
"
25090,wow
25091,I seen a few bugs
25092,The New mode made this game even more FUN!!!
25093,peepeepoopoo
25094,yes
25095,"I bought this game because of survival mode and I must confess... did not dissapoint!!! Great job, love them game... a few buggs, but that's expected from an early access game."
25096,Noice Game
25097,its cool and very creative
25098,GREAT GAME SURVIVAL JUST MADE IT BETTER!
25099,I love this game its so detailed and personally i think its addictive
25100,best game ever
25101,Survival is here! YA!
25102,Survival Fucking sucks
25103,"Fun
"
25104,.
25105,great to play with friends and can really spark creation
25106,"Maybe after next 4 years... But now NOPE, This game looks more like early alpha and not like game after more than 4 years of developing... Still multiplayer desync and lags..."
25107,its fun and lets you be creative trust me at this moment I have 400 hours on It
25108,ive played a little bit
25109,its so damn cool also wit the new survival!
25110,"It is awsome
"
25111,"very glitchy with new up date, but still very fun.
"
25112,Don't see why the reviews on this game are so good. Within 20 minutes I experienced no form of fun and just random bits and pieces of stuff that couldn't be used to build anything. Also the enemies are crazy lame and easy.
25113,"For now - DO NOT BUY this game. Multiplayer desynch - no automation for oil extraction (which means gridning fuel for cars), many other bugs and overall low quality of the survival mode."
25114,the first thing I realized about survival mode;  Do not run too far from the base.  second: cows are the best way to quickly get food in an emergency.  third: dying if you get lost is not a good idea
25115,yeee isa game
25116,FUN GAME
25117,fun and peaceful one of the best i have ever played
25118,the game is very good but still needs some improving
25119,rgrt
25120,I like this game.
25121,a really fun game WOW
25122,good
25123,ths is the bestest game iv'e ever played so i think you shood buy it
25124,"very good game but there are bugs when people join the game like they cant join
"
25125,Bug FIX DID NOT HELP ONLY MADE GAME MORE LAGGY BUT I LOVE IT STILL <3
25126,good buy or die
25127,so so so so s0 good
25128,"[h1][b]Great game that shows a lot of promises and a dedicated team of developpers![/b][/h1]
[i][u]Be warned (again...) that it is a Early Access and therefore you will see bugs issues and some game mechanics are subject to changes[/u][/i]

[h2]An interesting approaches to the Survival genre[/h2]
The first thing you'll notice is the progression system in the survival mode. Keep in mind that this mode, at the time of this review, is quite recent and there is not much in terms of tutorial or player guidance but do not despair and keep exploring you will figure it out. This mode doesn't quite follow the traditional templates of most survival games where you gather basic ressources, craft better tools, gather better ressources, rinse and repeat and instead focus heavily of exploration and vehicle building which is the central mechanic of this game. This is a nice refreashing change of pace compare to more standard survival games.
The world as it stand right now is full of interesting things to see but it is waiting to see yet more depth. They are some mini-dungeon to explore and defeat and a neat wave defense aspect to the game you can trigger as you please, which I found quite fun. But I do believe we've  just saw the foundation of what it can be
[h2]A dedicated team[/h2]
One thing this game has is a dedicated team of passionate people. They are hard at work on the concept and do deliver on content. You might need some patience though as they will keep you updated on content they are working on but won't release incomplete udpates for us to test or partial feature support. The survival update took months to complete! We could see most of the feature trough regular dev blog posts but couldn't test it for ourselves, which, in my opinions, is a valid approache to game dev, especially if you are aware of the amount of work needed to develop one, but it does require patience. 
[h2]Overall a fun experience[/h2]
There are a lot of building/survival games out there and few of them stands out. It is quite hard to come up with a feedback loop that can keep a player entertained for hours and Scrap Mechanics manages just that. The vehicle construction aspect is fun and challenging creatively and logistically. You'll constantly come up with new ways to make more efficient or fun vehicles to play with! While the farming mechanics as well as the base building one lack the depth of the vehicle mechanics, they are strong addition and will, I believe, act as a good foundation for future updates and contents.

This is a building/survival game that stands out among the likes of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers]Space Engineers[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/544550/Stationeers]Stationneers [/url]"
25129,"Game is awesome and still worked on, if you like vehicles, sandbox types and physics, get it because for what you get its pretty much a bargain"
25130,"ts ok if you have friends
"
25131,bad
25132,its a good game and i love this game for myself. yeyyy i love games. i loove scrapppppp mechaniccccccc
25133,epic physics gotta like it
25134,.
25135,yes
25136,"Still needs work but it's coming along nicely.  My son has had this game for a couple of years now and has been bugging me to pick it up.  I finally took the plunge when survival update was released and, overall, it looks like it's going to be a fun game to get into.  I've run into some game/sound bugs in the couple of hours I played but nothing to major or game breaking.  I'm sure those will get cleaned up as they hammer out survival mode more.  I'm optimistic about it."
25137,"Really enjoy the building aspect of the game. Also, creating contraptions and mechanisms is fun. It's even better with a couple of buddies, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for some sort of physics building survival game!"
25138,"Can't play multiplayer (sole reason that I bought this game) Don't understand why Raft works perfectly on MP while this is a car crash. The lag is overwhelming no matter what set up or the internet speed.

Hope that it get's fixed with in two weeks."

25140,"the new update
"
25141,"If any of you have issues with client-side lag/delay, try shutting of your vacuum pumps that are running constantly. That solved me and my friends issues.
 
Apart from that, I entirely retract my previous review. Survival mode is awesome and has incredible potential!

If Axolot sees this, please include a map:-)"

25150,"Love it the games great 

Only downside Mutliplayer survival doesn't work once you get so far into it you get a glitch where you cant do anything but sit there that or its delayed"
25151,"This game is pretty fun! I enjoy the color and the exploration. I have no complaints against it. It's just not for me at this time. Not to say it's a bad game by any means, like I said, it is fun! The issue I have, is personal opinion, that is all. Built for the creative that's for sure!"
25152,"I started playing survival with a friend and it was running extremely bad. I managed to fix this by plugging in an ethernet cable and everything was working great, except recently. My game just started to go insane, I would not press anything on my keyboard and I'd be teleporting all over the place, my car would just fly away, I was getting attacked by invisible robots, I couldn't drink the milk I could only place it on the floor (for some reason), everytime I'd respawn in my bed my character would flip out and when I somehow managed to get off the bed I'd get teleported back almost instantly. I have tried restarting the game multiple times and even restarting my PC and nothing seemed to work. The game would be great if it wasn't literally unplayable.

Edit: I ended up figuring out what was causing the insane amount of glitches and the insane input lag (it was the water pump) and after removing it everything seemed to go back to normal. Now of course there are some minor glitches left but nothing that ruins your game. Please disregard my previous complaints."

25154,Yes Game
25155,its very good
25156,This game has gone above my expectations and has provided me with an awesome survival experience with a mechanical twist.

25171,is good yes
25172,The whole mechanics of gathering to build almost anything u can think of and putting it to a use. I'm loving the time spent in game and watching people on youtube. Great job out there

25176,"like alot of other vehicle building games, it doesent let you set HOW you want to control something. an engine or motor will always be bound to W and S, hinges will always be bound to A and D with an unadjustable 30 degree steering angle, buttons and switches will always be on the number keys, etc. you can sorta get around it with the sensors, but these solutions are incredibly buggy due to the physics system.
the lack of options on how to control your vehicle is why i dont recomend this game."
25177,is very fun and no bugs
25178,"This game is amazing, but it is laggy when loading so beware."
25179,Doesn't launch at all for me with a common and updated env. Garbage code I guess. That's a 2 thumbs down and you owe me 4gb of bandwidth.
25180,BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED 10/10
25181,"I've bet my money on this game eventually being cool. It's just not there yet. The game feels a little bit like a mess right now: 

- tooltips that give you information about things that are taken out of the game
- almost no explanation of how to start out or what you want to do
- combat is pretty lackluster in the early stages of the game and backpedaling while swinging literally makes you invincible
- no idea where I am on the map or where I want to be
- on screen prompts for controls are incorrect (attack is bound to RMB in controls but LMB is how you swing the hammer, RMB pops up for collecting items and that works but so does the use key E)

Not going to refund because I think that this game has potential. Hope it doesn't get wasted."

25196,"It's an interesting game, kind of like a Kerbal or Nuts and Bolts clone with enough original content to be different. I can't recommend the game in it's current state, as the multiplayer and survival modes don't seem to be very well developed yet. 

It is in early access, so I'm sure it'll get a server browser and a better survival gameplay loop as the game is developed further."

25215,"Waste of your time, now then you're probably thinking, ""so then why do you have 95 hours on it"", well it wasn't always this way because I used to not know of the existence of you know, literally any other game in this genre I mean if I had known of Main Assembly or Trailmakers back then, I would've never got this and had some money saved. The way you build is frustrating and pointlessly difficult that it will make you never want to play the game again. Whatever you do don't get this 'cause if you want a fun building game were your creations can come to life then get Trailmakers or Main Assembly because they're much better ""oh but they don't have survival mode"" I hear you ask, but the survival mode in Scrap Mechanic is EXTREMELY grindy and if you leave the vicinite craftbots don't even craft anymore, forcing you to sit and wait for your parts to finish when you could be doing something worth your time like, I don't know literally anything other than Scrap Mechanic. Overall this game is a huge waste of money and time when there are much better in the genre out there."

25223,"""easy-to-use handbook"" HA. Possibly one of the worst tutorial experiences of my life. You wrote a novel to explain basic features of the game which could be done a whole lot better if you had some sort of playable intro that requires you to do some basic gameplay activities before progressing to the next task. Y,know, like a tutorial. The thing that games have. I don't want to read the Odyssey before I even have the basic gameplay loop down. Maybe the game's just not for me though and it's meant for people who want no explanation on the game whatsoever.

aside from that no game here yet really. just a nifty physics engine and some haphazard items and unchallenging enemies you can easily kite by walking backwards at normal pace. It could get better but I'm guessing that it won't change much from the current form.

refunding."

25231,"Survival mode has exceeded my expectations so far. If you like open world survival games this game is perfect. It also has the unique twist of engineering things such as vehicles and machines to help you survive.

Edit: After nearly 500 hours almost all of which was spent in Survival mode.

If you are interested in this game strictly for Survival wait. The other two modes are decent but Survival is so far from ready for prime time it is not worth your time. At first it was very fun which is why my initial review was positive but after getting more than enough time to see what's under the hood I can confidently say do not buy this game right now. I would also go as far as saying the Survival trailer is completely misleading. Here's why:

- Survival multiplayer is a terrible experience if you are not the host. While there have been some improvements it is not uncommon for guests to rubber band, experience dsync and extreme lag.
- The core gameplay, building mechanical moving things, does not work well in Survival. If you have just a few moving parts in a small area there is a very good chance your build will glitch out, cause massive FPS drops or just not work at all.
- Moving things such as the catapult shown in the trailer will clip through other structures or the ground and have to be taken apart to fix.
- Your FPS will drop to single digits even on a high end machine while farming rocks and also if you cut down just a few trees in a small area. The same occurred during raids the first week.
- Raids were made easier because the game engine could not handle large numbers so the devs cut the raids in half or more.
- The bots AI is all but non-existent during raids contrary to what the trailer showed. They spawn and walk in a straight line. Funneling them is a pain in the butt. Up until the most recent test patch, which has still not been added to the main branch after almost 2 months, most bots would idle when faced with high durability blocks. They also will idle when water is in their path or other structures.
- The trap building was where I spent most of my time but after dealing with moving pieces glitching, bots phasing through solid builds, etc. it became tiresome.
- You can completely avoid raids by planting small amounts of crops or by just looting ruins around the map.
- The current ""boss"" bots can easily be cheesed see my video here if you are interested: https://youtu.be/TJimwjitI-4
- You can obtain all the weapons in a few hours thus removing the need to farm high tier crops ever again.
- There are many POI's but none have a reason to visit them as there is zero story right now.
- The major POI's always spawn in the same location making the randomly generated seeds less interesting.
- The map is small.
- There are places you can build such as islands and plateaus to avoid raids.
- The building blocks are about 1/10 the size of Minecraft blocks making building tedious.
- Survival has been made easier with nearly every patch rather than harder. For example the devs 2-3x the rate of gathering crude oil and clam glue needed for fuel and resource containers respectively and like previously mentioned made raids far easier.
- Updates are pedestrian at this point and usually have no game changing content. The only thing added to the game since Survival launched was a chemical container which serves no purpose.

To sum it all up if you are into just building then creative is worth your money since the game engine seems to hold up there but if you are looking for a base builder, survival or tower defense game hold off. It took more than 4 years to get to this point and based on the devs track record and recent performance it might be another 4 before Survival is finished."
25232,well the survival was bad due to basically no story and i stopped playing survival in the first 30 min but this dosnt mean its a bad game because the survival is new so im guessing they will update it and make it better so take this with a grain of salt and i may update this review in the future
25233,going in to water turns the game to shit

Infinite replayability

25246,"WOW! This game is something else! I Loved this game since the day it came out and I have waited years and years for survival! I played survival for 8 hours straight yesterday! And I am just scratching the surface I still don‚Äôt have all upgrades to my parts and as you go on you find new stuff that just make your life easier. It‚Äôs scary at time specially at night I was in the forest and this bot pops and attacks me I literally screamed! I live in constant fear at night because I they can come any time, farming is dangerous and fun! It‚Äôs genuinely SOOOO WORTH ITTT if you are willing to learn how things work it‚Äôs simple to learn hard to master cause of soooo much potential the parts actually give you! I LOVE THIS GAME AND RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE."

25252,I no spek englash
25253,good
25254,"I actually enjoyed the game a lot but just realized why it never really clicked with me-
Unsatisfying physics and fun parts that could be added but are excluded due to the physics system. Okay, the physics are technically pretty good. I get few collision errors or things that legitimately feel wrong. But if I am playing a physics game I want very precise interactions to work and feel satisfying.

Example: I just tried to build 2 wheels that connect via train linkage, mount a sliding rail on the linkage, and center that rail to create a lift that goes up and down.

It simply wiggled and wobbled out of place on the second spin, and the slide rail had too much friction and wobble to even work. 

Example of parts that are ""missing"" in the game: Slide rail for one, cogs and gears, spheres. Maybe wires and elastic but that's a stretch. Not necessary for what I paid for and what this game is meant to be. However if these parts were in the game I would love it, the physics system just can't handle them."
25255,It a cool game. Definitely other people play game. The robots are scary tho :(

First i really love this game. i just bought it since 3 years ago the developer did a good job.
when i know that this game will have a survival mode i'm literally excited when i update it the menu page is really impressed me it is truely 2020 game update. But till i'm start playing the game it make me disappointed. Because it is really really lag and very slow movement i'm never playing this game and lag like this before. this updating is ruin my favorite game. I can't even drive my own build car. And in the survival mode i know that i need to survive but please teach me first what can i do in this mode or how to build any thing in this mode. And this update make the controller in the game not working in the right command i am connecting the switch with the controller and adjust the angle i don't even turn on the switch but the controller working by itself please fix this point and make my most favorite game back to the right way it be. thank you every developer. i love this game very much i hope you will fix this game as soon as you can. fighting!!!"

25301,"Buy it. 
Survival Mode is amazing. 
The way you can physically store items around your base and on your vehicles is so satisfying. 
Building and planning and scavenging never gets old. 
I had this game in my library from 4 years ago and honestly forgot about it. If you remember hearing anything about this game, take another look at it now."
25302,"Visually very nice and the game feels very solid but I ended up refunding it after just 3 hours of game play. There is no tutorial or explanation on what to do. There was a very basic ""farming"" section that is literally a picture diagram on how to plat a single crop. Pressing H will bring up a VERY basic construction guide which doesnt tell you how to construct anything  just how to assemble it. I found myself farming pretty much for three hours with no idea what to do with anything I farmed. The game throws you in at the deep end and lets you drown."

25375,With the recent update the games a perfect mix for survival and creativity.
25376,VERRY GOOD GAME
25377,"After a worse than catastrophic update in May 2020, the game went up very well thanks to numerous patches and a new update. This game offers you to do practically what you want (practically because of the technical limits and the limits due to the elements), it has a survival mode not too badly done (although there are a lot of points to improve) and a challenge mode. You can also create your challenges and your maps. It is also possible to moderate this game very easily, and some mods are (in my opinion) almost essential to make beautiful creations developed easily. It is also possible to download creations from other players to use and / or modify them.

However, not everything is rosy. The game suffers from very annoying bugs such as outright deletion of being able to bring up certain creations and use mods. This bug arrives randomly and forces you to unsubscribe from these creations and mods out of the game and to re-subscribe to them in game (this bug is also not understood by Steam). There are also physics bugs with the ground (which have been greatly mitigated, fortunately) and the game is far from a graphic slap (without being ugly either).

However, I recommend this game but, be careful because it is still in development and we are not immune to a new disaster due to an update."
25378,nowy update koks
25379,"Nice game, build"
25380,yes
25381,"instructions unclear, drove car off a cliff into a lake"
25382,meh.it's alright but it gets kinda boring after some time
25383,fun game i love it
25384,real great game for those who love to build
25385,yes
25386,"Bought the game, with my brother,  just for the survival. We finally downloaded the patch yesterday but the input lag is so annoying that i decided to refund it. hopefully one day they ll fix it."
25387,AMAZING
25388,Great game lots of ways to express creativity. Cant wait to see what else gets added in the future.
25389,"i like that game, so fun and now survival game mode is epic"
25390,it is fun.
25391,its a good game would recomend
25392,"Very nice survival mode, but u need lots of food."
25393,"The new survival gamemode defenetly gives a new aspect of the game, with the creative ways of getting material and the graphics. I think you guys need a rework of the character customization otherwise I give it a solid 7/10, defenetly recomended"
25394,hmmmm yes good
25395,Catatonically boring with no and I mean ZERO tutorial.
25396,a bit buggy bt still a good game
25397,Is a really fun game to play my favorite is survival u get to build u base I would recommend this game
25398,haha spud gun go brrr
25399,yes
25400,"I thought the game engine couldn't get any worse, i was wrong. I use to play this game for its ""some-what"" realistic physics which allowed the user to create some unique and interesting things. 

However, the one problem this game faced was its ""game engine"" which is sorta trash when it comes to object collision. I was hoping that the devs would improve the engine with collision and fix some of the fps issues however its only gotten worse.

Here is my performance when it comes to their new Survival Mode ""Specs (gtx 2060, i7-9750h, 16gb ram)""
Survival Mode: Lowest Settings (180 fps avg) 
Survival Mode: Ultra Settings (90 fps avg) 

""For a game that doesn't look GPU or CPU intensive i'm surprised to see this sort of performance, i interested to see how this game will run on (recommended specs)"""
25401,"Awsome game and its pretty different in compare to other servivel and base building games.
A happy world with some bad robots. realy cool done!!"
25402,BESTT GAME!!!!!
25403,really good game with perfect building mechanics
25404,gud ghem
25405,gut game
25406,Just got the game and it has been really fun so far in survival mode. I haven't tried creative yet but I am sure that will be just as great. Highly recommend this game if you like the survival genre and don't mind starting out having it rough until you learn the game.
25407,I waited for the survival for 3 years.
25408,10/10  for builders
25409,good
25410,"After trying multiple solutions to fixing the black screen, none worked. With what people are saying which have similar issues there is little to no compatibility support from the devs. I'm not entertained by a single player black screen of death simulator so my advice to you is if it doesn't work after an hour of troubleshooting, refund it.

Don't remember what i did at the time to get it working, but once i got it working the game was pretty fun with friends. I think i reinstalled windows."
25411,"(edited after watching a LOT of videos)
Before this update the game is a LOT of fun.. i learned through videos how to upgrade items.. how to make variable suspension and piston engines and a whole mess of wild things in survival. PLEASE after they fix it give it a try it's SO fun
The game currently is unplayable because of a serious bugsplat issue after update do NOT purchase until they fix it.
(they are aware.. but just wait)"
25412,i like this game because you can do everything you want and now you can play survival wich si so cool
25413,Sometimes... you forget that it's still in early access.
25414,everything is very interesting and fun to play
25415,Survival is the best update this game has had.
25416,this game with survival mode..... incomparable!!!
25417,Jag tycker det √§r bra
25418,It is the many fun! Survival mode is pretty hard died of starvation 6 times but is gud
25419,This game looks like a fun way to waste time but i'll wait until the game is out of early access and has more features and helpful tutorials for dummies.
25420,just get it
25421,it is fun
25422,I love this game
25423,"With the new survival mode, it's like a turbo-charged Minecraft."
25424,is good
25425,Fantastic! game i like the new swimming the graphics it's just a special sandbox game!

25429,Best. game. ever.
25430,nice
25431,mega fajne polecam
25432,"it is a great sand box game with almost endless possibilitys.
"
25433,"With survival, this game now appeals to a very wide player base.
A pretty hard survival which can be solved using creative engineering.
Quite a bit of progression, since lots of things are upgradable, and some are hard to obtain.
The map is huge now. Lots of exploration. There is water too! I cant wait to build a boat.
The game practically became multiple times bigger with this update"
25434," I Love Scrap Mechanic. Okay. There's Nothing Much To Complain About, apart From The Occasional Lag Spike. It's a Brilliant Game With No Particular Objective, Letting Players Do Pretty much Whatever they Want! I Would Definitely Recommend This App!"
25435,"THIS is a neutral Recommendation, because Steam gives us only 2 Options

Version 2 of my Review... 

Changed the Refund after watching a good Gameplay on YT...

________
Version 1 (altered)

What a drag down, the Game is a Marvel, but on the other Side a unbalanced Mess, 

The Survival Mode let you be stranded far far away inside a a mean hot Desert without Water and Shelter ,AKA: why bother with a Tutorial? YT Content Creators will do their Part... 
THIS IS LAZY

My Fun melted away... building my 1st Car @ the 2 Hour mark, when suddenly 3 Farmbots attacked me and destroyed everything me, and me Car...

I leave the crashed starting Ship / Base, started to lumberjack a few trees, for a new car, BANG Dead because i was instakilled by 2 Farmbots....

Hope the Dev's will patch the game into a decent form... FAST

Will change my Opinion according to the Dev's balancing and future Content for the Survival Mode..."
25436,fun

25463,"its... alright.. fun to build in but it gets to a point where sometimes you just cant build what you want to wether it be glitches bugs or the idea just wont work in the game because... why the hell not screw it your ideas can sometimes get chucked out the window... how ever it can be fun to fool around in but if you plan on building a home or something... yeah good one thats.... no... and the ""recent"" survival thing.. yikes its gonna need a shit ton of buffing and a very very very thick coat of point maybe even multiple layers just to make it work for this style game"
25464,YES JUST YES!

25482,itss goooooooddddd!!!!
25483,Best FPS shooter ever. Period.
25484,its good
25485,Good.
25486,"I bought this game specifically for the survival mode, so that's what this review is about. At the beginning there's a little bit of crafting, some interesting things to explore, etc.

And then unless you are lucky, you will hit a wall of a needed resource to craft anything beyond the most basic stuff that apparently is extremely rare and you will spend hours roaming the world looking for it. 

From my experience with this walking simulator, running around for hours looking for the resource I needed to craft basic stuff, the world is just the same buildings stamped over and over. Which, is pretty uninteresting in a crafty survival game and downright boring in a game where you have to wander for hours before even getting to make anything."
25487,over all its a well balanced game with hard and easy things to make it fun.
25488,Very good game I would highly recommend because of how it requires a bit of thought and everything isn't handed to the user for what to do next. Survival and Creative are very enjoyable would recommend that this game is bought and if you don't have a powerful computer edit particles and shadows that always helps me.
25489,Masterpiece
25490,"We waited way too long for survival for it not to work.  Especially after being put off so so long just for for multiplayer (survival and creative) to be completely broken after the newest release.  Have been playing since early 2017, major disapointment. Do not buy in the state it is now, it need *MAJOR* reworks.  The game has been public for 6 years, and over half of that has been fueled by the modding community, my previous account has 100s of hours and my friends have many more.  

The worst part is that it works for 4-5 hours, enough to make progress, then it breaks.  Seriously we waited so long, and you screw us,  screw you too Axolot."
25491,Multiplayer survival is a broken piece of dog shit. bugs and glitches out the ass.
25492,The game is awesome but there is a couple things that need polishing but over all its a great game to play in survival or creative.
25493,"I would recommend this game if the survival was better. The creative is fine, great even but gets boring after a while. So I stared survival followed the crates made a clear trail that lead up the tower next to the spawn and ignored the crashed ship since it was on fire and didn't realize I could go in. I got to the top of the tower and found a battery that didn't seem to be something I could pick up because you can't pick it up with lmb like the creates which prompt you to pick them up. So why it doesn't tell you to pick up the battery that is essential to be able to craft does't have a prompt is beyond me, but any way after spending 30 mins trying to figure out what to to, and even the help book is useless because it only tells you how to use the different building block which is fine, but doesn't tell you how to play the survival. Even after I got the battery to the ship which you have to extinguish, but after doing that and getting the crafting working you have to wait 15-30 seconds, which wouldn't be so bad if you could queue up part to craft and go gather material for parts, and the begining the wheels are awful because they're misshapen wheels which flipped my car constantly. So at this point I had spent like an hour trying to figure out what to do and how to craft my car and wait to craft said car, when as I was driving a mob came up destroyed my seat and sent my car flying off by itself which caused me to rage quit. In short creative fine survival SH*T"
25494,this is an amazing game easy to understand
25495,Great game spen hoours on it even better experiance with friends      YEEEET
25496,"pay me and i'll leave a good review like the rest of the shills.

leave a bad review and it'll magically disappear! :)"
25497,No.
25498,"this game is baller, but hard to master. 11/11"
25499,Love the new mode!!!
25500,:D
25501,awesome game
25502,I could buy it for $ 29 because I wished it were a survival game and played with friends. I hope administrators build more and made DLC
25503,very very very goooood                                                        yassssssss
25504,poggers
25505,it iz rilly cool
25506,Great game
25507,"Survival mode kinda completes this game, even though they just released it as alpha, it's really good."
25508,"Extremely impressive with the survival mode, I've only played about 2-1/2 hours and I'm absolutely hooked. I cannot seem to find anything to complain about which is unusual as most games have something, there's always the ol' ""it's great but...."" and I cannot find the ""but"" here. Great job, great detail and care which shows, and the map is not only massive but very beautifully crafted. 100% a good buy imo and, I'm a very hard individual to impress."
25509,"Finally tried again and got this game to run. Overall, I have to say the game is underwhelming. For a game that doesn't even allow you to edit the terrain like Space Engineers, it is extremely laggy, the physics are terrible to the point where your vehicles will slide down even mild slopes. 

I finally got the resources to build a vehicle and went out exploring only to have my vehicle destroyed by a ""boss"" that was hiding in some trees. Literally one hit destroyed the entire vehicle and everything I have on it. Literally put me back to square one. This is not how you make a game fun. There should definitely be an option to turn off damage to your vehicles. Spending hours or even days to create a complex machine only to have it destroyed is not fun and a good way to get people to quit playing. The enemy mobs are boring and annoying to the point where I just turned off damage because the combat sucks in this game. 

Overall, the building possibilities can be fun, but things just don't work how they should. Build a mining vehicle and as soon a you touch a rock, you bounce back, or up or just drive up on it. The controls on the vehicles itself are terrible. Whenever you hit the gas, there is a lag, and it ramps up to 100 percent. So when you are mining or cutting a tree down, you have to push and hold the throttle just long enough for the vehicle to throttle up and let off at just the right time or you fly up over it or flip over. These are things that could be tuned better, but have not been for some reason. 

Hopefully in the future this will be a good game, but right now, It's not worth it for Survival."
25510,gud
25511,"Update is cool, but I dont remember asking."
25512,this game is so trash waste of money dont buiy
25513,"This is the very first game i played on steam so i've played it awhile, It is great for those who love to build cars or build bases in mountains, So for sure it's great, Little buggy but fun for forever."
25514,"game wont start, just loads into black screen now.. re-installed, updated graphics drivers, have gtx 2080ti i9.. no reason this should be causing this many problems starting up.."
25515,its very fun love the new survival mode
25516,Very addictive and now that survival is out definitely worth getting
25517,No idea what im doing but its beautiful and the crafting is sick. worth the $ 100%

25536,"Bought the game the day the Survival update was released, the game doesn't even start, just freezes up, tried to reinstall, to follow some advice from the forum, only thing that works is...ASKING FOR A REFUND...DONE..."
25537,This game is great ive been playing since its been released.

25543,"If you like building vehicles, you'll love this game. Can be a little on the laggy side, especially on older or smaller computers, but a great game overall. And, lately a new game mode came out. Try it out, it's amazing!"
25544,"Complicated, but fun! there is anew Survival update out as of may 2020 and its GREAT!"
25545,Awesome game. The only limitation is your imagination!
25546,Turned by computer with GTX 1080ti in to a permanent space heater.   One of the very few games to do this had to refund
25547,"                                                  Just starting out so take this with a grain of salt.

My girlfriend is horrible at games so the selection of what we can play together is very slim. Luckily this game has SOOOO much in common with Portal Knights which happened to work out decently well for us. However this game is far to unfriendly at the start. It isn't made clear what you can grab and what you can't so we walked past the battery. I found the mechanic shop before knowing that the battery was a thing and as far I can tell there is no map to find your way back. We quickly died of hunger and thirst because the amount of food you are given isn't much when you don't even know the existence of the craft bot.

Enjoying the game but seriously needs to give players more time to figure out the mechanics of the game before you end up dead and revive with about 30% hp, food, water...then die again"
25548,super car
25549,yes
25550,"overall well rounded for a beta, i can't wait to see what else new comes oy with this game"
25551,i liked it
25552,good
25553,"this game is thoroughly and unapolagetically boring, the tutorial system is underwhelming the sounds are repetative and annoying and yes, i only played for 7 minutes and the game already annoyed me /that much/ if you want a better game about putting techy things together, play terratech. if you want a better survival game play rust. if you want a better game that's somewhere in the middle, play minecraft. this is junk at this point in time."

I highly enjoy this, 10/10."

25587,its a good game
25588,"SURVIVAL IS HERE. Really fun sandbox game but could use a few tweaks.

creative needs to include the new guns and new water tiles.
Combat needs more melee weapons."
25589,It's actually fun now. Worth taking a look at for sure.
25590,"absolutely awesome game, its just my favorite game and i love it"

25599,guud gaem
25600,Very pleasant experience.
25601,it is realy fun to build creations i recomend to get this game

25604,Survival is Awesome!
25605,very well optimized
25606,survival mode is so good
25607,It is fun
25608,"This game is an absolute jewel!  If you like Lego Technica or Robotics sets, you should get this."
25609,"I don't understand the point in this game (Survival) to be honest.

There seems to be no story and no real aim, except to get a gun... and then it's pretty much game complete because there is nothing else to buy.

There is VERY little information for new players, especially when it comes to building a vehicle. I think they assume that a noob would know what to build and how things work because everyone is born with all knowledge. Which is stupid because who would think wiring an engine to a bearing is how you make a wheel turn? It just does not make sense. Why do you not connect an engine to a drive shaft and then some kind of diff and then to the wheels? 

That said... the game is good and i am going to play more."
25610,"this game is great! when i play it and i see my character i think of the hello nighbor universe but with less streatched out objects and grid based building system, i only wish i could puase the game when im alone and beable to have my world open to anyone whne i feel like it. ill edmit the first time i got this game i had a blast with it but i felt there could be more. the small open world creative part of the game seemed a little boring at times thinking of what to do next. becaouse of that i stoped playing for the longest time, when i heard about this new survival update i felt like going back in to make some blueprints or something before it got here but its too late for that. that part of this game i felt seemed mising became a reality, i for seen this type of game mode working out well for this game from the geco! you may not belive me but once durning those hours i played this before i stoped i thought this game would make for another good survivel game. and here it is! so in short...    GET THIS GAME!!!

exuse all the typos"
25611,"Scrap Mechanic is a great imagination based game with fun physics, even the glitches are fun. I've spent hours playing this incredible game and I just can't get enough of it!!! I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has some time to spare."
25612,I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN IT DOES NOT EVEN LOAD JUST A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!!!
25613,it be big epic
25614,I can‚Äôt begin to describe the this game‚Äôs engineering depth. The only negative for me is that basically there‚Äôs only cubes to build with in survival at the time.
25615,"Great game, and survival is really good"

25618,THIS GAME IS GREAT
25619,its a really fun  game t play
25620,GET this GAME NOW!
25621,"FUCK
"
25622,"You can play for hours without even realizing. With the release of survival, you have so many cool and new things to do."
25623,Amazing Game! 9/10
25624,Good game
25625,Just picked it up for the recent survival update. Very fun so far.
25626,a
25627,Fun
25628,"Its not optimized, anything fun and cool that you want to build will probably get the game to run at 3 fps. i really only play it because my friends do."
25629,Im kinda upset survival did't turn up good for me well i hope the dev's fix it
25630,good
25631,Survival made it 100x better. Please buy it.
25632,This game is SO MUCH FUN its nearly endless for what you can do in this game i love it and survival is amazing.
25633,AWESOME
25634,The game is very good
25635,So good
25636,yes
25637,e
25638,"Regarding the new survival mode, I found a few bugs.
1 basic structure with a room full of rocks, through which you much find your way to a chest. Clipping on the rocks.
2 when drilling rocks, some of the smaller pieces will phase through the floor of the map."
25639,Great game
25640,"The progression in the survival is just not fun, it really doesnt tell you anything except how to build a car. It just doesnt feel like a survival game, more like a building game. I have no clue of what the creative offers, but the survival is just too lack luster and lame for my group of 6 people to enjoy."
25641,Very interactive mechanics with new enthralling survival mode
25642,iz Gud
25643,Very fun
25644,qerthkj
25645,"so survival just dropped, after 4 years of wait i can finally swim
gud gaem"
25646,Fun to build stuff. Also fun to do manhunt.
25647,gud
25648,epic
25649,"Nope. Their poor attempt at a survival mode was the last straw. If you build a vehicle and drive off in to the map, you can only change your spawn point by laying in a bed. So off I go, I find a bed, set my spawn, and try to build a craftbot.  Oh, I can't build a craftbot because I don't have enough materials.  Cool, I'll just wander over here and hunt for the mats. I need just 1 more component, and I'll be done. Oh... I'm starving... I've already gone through all my food.  Uh oh, my health is dropping, and here comes a robot.  Oh damn, I died.  Now I've completely screwed myself because my body is so far from my spawn point that I starve to death again by the time I reach it....  Because in an amazing display of brilliance, you re-spawn at only about 25% health, food, and water. Now I'm in a vicious cycle of spawning and dying before I can find food, or before plants grow (assuming I find the seeds, soil, and a bucket before I die again). So I just die over and over.  Now my components on my original body are gone because I couldn't make it back to collect them and the icon for the body has disappeared. My MAIN issue with a game like this is that it shouldn't be THAT brutal. When you die, you shouldn't respawn on the brink of death again. I can only assume the devs didn't do any playtesting. Anyone that disagrees has NOT had the same experience. You also can't change your keybinds.... in a game developed with UE4..... wow devs... wow."
25650,"this game is a really good one, if you enjoyed minecraft, this is pretty similar but you can create vehicles, its mostly for making vehicles unlike minecraft were you cant really make vehicles or at least they wont go anywhere unless your a redstone god or something but im not so when im not building mansions or castles i come here and drive around in my pickup that i built on the spot"
25651,This Game Really Outdid them self. i was expecting it to be just for creative and never expected survival to be made at all. and yet they did it
25652,"Allways liked building crazy vehicles in G-Mod, now i got this and i like it."
25653,THE BEST!! I love the new update it was fun!
25654,SOOOOO FUN the new update is so worth it :]
25655,"fun gameplay, great mechanics, and really good multiplayer fun, just get this game if you and a mate have nothing else to do or play, and watch as your friendship falls apart as one another destroy an terrorises each others structures and creations unless your playing in survival in which case i can calculator how much life you have left after playing this game with a friend, ..... 6 minutes of pure anger and pain, but overall its a great game and a steam must play not only for the fact that you can make the dumbest looking vehicles and funniest plane ride of your life with couple of rockets and a seat, but for the fact that the game is just fun to play not only by yourself but mostly with a friend."
25656,"I recommend this to most people, but anyone looking to build precise contraptions should know that the physics will just up and change. 
A tank build one day, with no modifications, just decided it should explode instead of launching the explosive like it had been doing for the past 2 days.
It's been a couple months, and it still hasn't spontaneously reverted yet.
The problem isn't inconsistent physics, plenty of games have that. It's the [i]inconsistently[/i] inconsistent physics

Luckily this isn't a problem for the average to slightly above average car or harvester or base or spud gun tank or watering system, so 19/20 players will not care."
25657,"it is realy fun, if you like building games and exploring this is for you"
25658,The game is becoming the best survival game.
25659,Fun
25660,its good wish it was two player
25661,"I'd rate it about a 4/5, Could be better for low end PC's"
25662,survival is here finally
25663,good game
25664,e
25665,it good
25666,so good
25667,"The new survival mode has a lack of direction, there is no quest like system nor tutorial."
25668,:)
25669,it is amazing
25670,Great game
25671,gud
25672,kkk
25673,is great game
25674,"A great game with lots of replayability, plus it has survival now!"
25675,amazing
25676,This game is sssssooooooooooooo good and suvival mode just came out :) 20$ worth it
25677,"good game
"
25678,this game is one of the funest games i found on steem i hilly recomend it
25679,"Everything about it is great, I especially like the fact that you can make cars and planes."
25680,"The new survival is bestr, but the developers are very ... very stupid, cuz they created an update that should sell the game, and at the same time they made a discount on this game DISCOUNT ON THE GAME ( I bought this game before discount )"
25681,+++
25682,i believe this game is amazing especially with survival mode out now i would reccomend it with or without a sale but its still a sandbox so if you like sandbox vehicle creation this game is for you if not no i don't think you would like it.
25683,it's pretty nice
25684,"Before you read the rest of this review. This game is hopefully still gonna update and they will fix the problems i have with this game.

This game is really good as a singleplayer. The building is a little complicated but the workshop makes up for that. There is also plenty of content. 

Multiplayer is where my problem is. The lag is incredibly annoying if you are not the host and you end up rubberbanding everywhere. The game tends to crash in creative and the lag just freezes the game if you make too many vehicles. If you are gonna buy this game just for multiplayer don't. Wait until they fix the lag."
25685,It is just an amazing sandbox game where you can build all the machines and vehicles you like with amazing freedom! And now with the new survival mode I think it will be even more amazing!
25686,Was amazing before survival update.... now it's mindblowingly good :o
25687,e
25688,"is there any way that i can get a refund, dont get me wrong i love the game but i cant play it on the pc i have now and my parents wont let me spend my money on a new pc 
"
25689,i love it
25690,"Worth to buy, nice game"
25691,One of my all time favorite games. Definitely eats up a lot of your computer power but is totally worth it.
25692,good game
25693,I love the game and i have been playing survival mode this is one of the best games i have ever played. i would suggest this game to anyone who love makeing their own vehicle or just playing an easy survival game with the new update
25694,yes
25695,"nice 
"
25696,"its a good game if you have a good pc

"
25697,"Veryy Good

25698,"Game won't start, will give it a day and then will refund."
25699,"Excellent building system, physics, etc."
25700,because yes
25701,e
25702,It's really fun.
25703,Good game. With the survival added you can play for hours without realizing that time has passed. Very good
25704,Amazing game
25705,"As the new updates have fixed most of the bugs but one that is still missing out, the bug where you get blocks as not ""regonized"" and makes it realy annoying. The rest of the game is good.
I would give the game a 8 out 10."
25706,this game is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you can build anything you want and you have a SURVIVAL MODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25707,yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
25708,REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
25709,gfghg

25711,much fun
25712,I love how well the physics engine works.
25713,It is an amazing game plus the new survival made it even better.
25714,It's so much fun! Survival released today and I can't wait to play it!
25715,I wouldn't make a change
25716,tis fun
25717,yup
25718,love the game but there is an issue with changing controls especially with changing things to rmb it goes to shift+lmb. plz fix this.
25719,good stuff.
25720,it a game where you buil and be creative and there adding a suvivel modew
25721,everything is good
25722,its great
25723,this game sucks dick
25724,survival super fun
25725,so much fun (and its kinda educational)
25726,balls
25727,"Quickly Boring.
Lack of non-cosmetic parts
Massive performance issues when building complex stuff.

1year, no update, then garbage survival mode"
25728,The game is fantastic! It offers unlimited potential in building and an amazing multiplayer experience! The game runs far better than I expected it to as well!
25729,as far as my experince goes try the survivial if you like a challenge if you like sand boxes try creative
25730,yay
25731,Good
25732,"I started playing this game in 2016 and thought it was a fun game, the problem was that it got kind of boring after a while because you didn't really have anything to do. You could only build stuff without a purpose and that why I stopped playing the game for a long time.
But now when survival have come out it is a much better game. You have a reason to try to build stuff because you need to defend yourself and you need to gather material to make your crops grow. So the game just got much better overall now that survival is out."
25733,"OMG SURVIVAL IS HERE!!! It is amazing! I wish there was water in creative, but whatever. In creative, you build as many vehicles as you want! And you can download workshop items. In survival, you go out and fight some robots, build a scrap car, make a farm, and so on. I don't know when challenge mode is coming out, but it used to be pretty cool. The challenges weren't as cool as creative (when there wasn't a survival), but they were there if you were bored. I bet the challenge mode will be cooler than before. Who knows, maybe new challenges like building boats and fighting will be in challenge mode. I recommend this game if you like building, fighting, and farming (some people don't like farming, so if you just want to explore, the best food would be cow milk). This is one of my favorite car building games, so if you like building cars and other vehicles, try this game. You'll be happy if you do get it."
25734,"I've played this game for a good while, and I appreciate the dedication that the devs put into this game. It recently released it's most anticipated update and it was definitely worth the wait. I'm looking forward to even more new content in the future."
25735,Great game
25736,gUD GAMe
25737,"truly one of the better engineering games out there, it gives you a lot of options of what you can do and it is also really easy to get invested into your creations. Once you start there's no way you'll want to stop."
25738,its amazing! its amazing! its amazing!
25739,This game is fun for those who like building and for those who just like a funny way to hang out with some friends. Praise duck!
25740,very fun
25741,"with the release of survival mode its gotten better
"
25742,very good game
25743,"Survival is terrible, compare it to any other survival game and it is definitely worse. Basic crafting is gated to finding a specific POI, getting parts from other crates in other POIs, all the while retrieving your corpse for parts you couldn't build a basic container for. I was excited to play it, but it is extremely lacking and I can't understand who would design a game like this."
25744,game keeps crashing not verry good
25745,"yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
"
25746,hmm yes
25747,"Amazing, just amazing, u gotta try it the game speaks for it self"
25748,Amazing Game when it comes to a creative sandbox and with the new addition to survival it has become one of my top 5 best games of 2020
25749,"Amazing, cant wait for the survival mode."
25750,yes
25751,yes i would buy this game and idk if its just me but the crashing is extremely annoying cause every time i try to load the game it just crashes even tho there's a small chance that it will work
25752,"I'm writing this review the day survival released. I can say that this game is a MUST PLAY. With 115+ hours getting bored in this game is difficult. Survival is FANTASTIC, Creative is amazing ass well. GO BUY IT AND PLAY NOW!!!!"
25753,Survival was worth the wait 10/10
25754,yes
25755,good game
25756,Lots of fun ;)
25757,Survival update came and it's great.

25760,goood game raly good game
25761,this game is all about building cars helicopters bikes motorcycle's you can build anything!!! and they released a survival mode so please check it out!
25762,"It's a fun and very cool and the new survival is pretty fun.I wish there were more things but with mods it makes it new and exiting again.Playing with friends makes the game 10X better.I would rate this game 9.7/10.It's also quite cheap for how much fun it is.I would recommend this to all of the people out there who like building complex cars, planes, and many more machines."
25763,"its realy fun and cant wait fro survival its updating now
"
25764,yes it is fun
25765,"+ Pretty
+ Runs well

- Zero introduction or tutorial. Took me half an hour to notice the tiny ""H"" button to view controls
- Walked straight past the farming tutorial and starved to death 4 times before I noticed it hidden away behind some trees
- As I hadn't seen the tiny help icon, I didn't realise I could pick up the battery at the top of the tower, so I spent and hour walking aimless around the island wondering what the point of the game was
- Couldn't work out how to put the fire out on the ship
- Having to drag 30 items from your dropped bag to your inventory instead of clicking them is really annoying design
- There are only 2 kinds of enemy robots
- No pause function in single player"
25766,a good game
25767,THIS IS AMAZING
25768,its grait get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25769,Great game good for trying to build cool things.
25770,yes

It happened in the past that an update made it unplayable for me and it got better later but with an update we have been waiting for this long that should't happen.
Don't get me wrong this IS a great game but i cannot leave a positive review on a game i can't play.

Edit: It got fixed, so yeah BUY IT!"

25793,Finally! The last update has completely destryed my project I've been working on for 2 months. Now I'm free of this crap! Ty.
25794,"Bought the game today 5/7/2020 downloaded it and it just goes to a black screen and not responding. 5/8/2020 game is now working.

Update after about 20 hours, I like the game but it is slow going. it seems everything in a building game is going to revolve around farming. Farming for food/water, or using farming to farm monsters for parts. to be honest if I could I would give the game a Meh right now but I have to choose yes or no and I see myself coming back to it more so I'll go to yes."

25998,great game
25999,This is prolly one of the best games out there
26000,"This game is super fun and I've been playing it a lot with my friends, depending on what you are doing it it can either be relaxing or just all out crazy. If you have a project you are working on then its pretty relaxing, but if you are with friends and you all have creations from the workshop it can get pretty chaotic. I would suggest you play this game with a lot of mods. It is a little bit buggy so that is a draw back."
26001,Fun
26002,survival mode
26003,"A very well made Game!
With the ""newly"" added Survival mode, the game became even better.
You can create everything you want. From a double wishbone suspension to a thrust vector rocket.
And even if you aren't in to building, the Workshop offers some great creations.
All in all veary fun and entertaining."

26009,The first genuine successor to Garry's Mod I've ever seen. I've been waiting for this game for years and just didn't know it! If you remember Wiremod and smile a little bit when you see that Facepunch face then I think  you'll find something to love in this game.
26010,"Great Game awesome ways to build lots of creations in creative, survival mode releasing as of writing this so there's another reason to buy it, good graphics, smooth game-play, great mechanical systems available for your creations. all in all i recommend it"
26011,"Good game especially with the Survival Aspect. Hours of gameplay, you will not be disappointed by this game!"

26037,y
26038,This game is really mind blowing and very awesome! Works well even for a non gaming computer! Hope Survival comes out soon!
26039,Perfection
26040,"Yes
"
26041,"Really fun sandbox on creative and great modding community, can wait for survival to come out today!"
26042,haha yes survival finally 4 years later
26043,it a great game love it to bits. people who like Minecraft / modded will realy enjoy this
26044,its a very good and fun game... the only drawback i can see is that if you put 2 complex creations close together the game will lagg... a LOT... but that doesnt stop me from loving this game
26045,"I absolutely LOVE this game, I found it watching ScrapMan and it introduced me to the amazing world of scrap mechanic, the graphics are good and with the coming update they will be even better. I'm not very good at building complex vehicles but I'm having fun with other people's creations, all in all I'd say this purchase was 100% worth it!"
26046,"This game may be VERY poorly optimized as of writing this, and it almost crashes just when I try to launch it. Yet the amount of creativity and complexity you can put into your builds is mind-blowing. I have clocked 343 hours into this game before survival even comes out and I have barely even scratched the surface of what you can do with this game. Between the vanilla structure and the amazing mod creator there are countless possibilities and hundreds if not thousands of hours of content in this game. I couldn't recommend it enough."
26047,nice
26048,"this is my first, or second maybe game review. GET THIS GAME FOR THE LOVE OF DOGS"
26049,fun
26050,i like scrap mechanic so so so good
26051,amazing
26052,game
26053,"It is a fun creative based game, well now survival is almost out it can also be that. but it is fun and you need the skills and smartness to design good vehicles."
26054,is good
26055,"I love this game. I have been playing since mid 2017 and creative mode is pretty fun but it can get a little boring. interface is easy to use, though, sadly you can only host servers with friends (no online servers.) there are a ton of blocks wich have tons of uses. take the controller for example. on the store page there is already a guide to use it! also, the posibilities are ENDLESS.
there is a steep learning curve for making helis and planes but cars are pretty easy and so are buildings. you dont have to worry about structural parts failing, the only part you have to worry about is someone shooting cardboard with a spud gun or glass with a hammer. the cons though are that after spawning somthing thats not welded to the ground to many times the game has a large sapce for lag. most games can crahs when you have to much lag but scrap mechinic can make you have about 0.5 fps. it amazes me how it can do that. finally, survival mode. ever since i started playing in mid 2017 they said ""survival mode should come out somtime in 2018 crhistmas."" then when that didnt happen, they said the same thing for 2019 christmas. Thankfully they have a deadline (wich is today may 7 2020) for survival mode and its  Today! cant wait to play it in a few hours!"
26056,"this game is perfect just get it already

Edit: I wrote the text above forever ago, so I'm updating my review. I still think this game is worth buying, the survival update is good, the game looks great, and is good with lag. The community is really great, and makes a ton of fun things. It's also pretty easy to grasp how to play, but it can be very complex if that's what you're looking for. I've played this game a ton, and can't recommend it enough."

26200,"Scrap Mechanic is a fun sandbox survival game with an interesting concept and vehicle building system
Unfortunately its prone to massive crashing problems, frame rate issues and lagspikes. Its multiplayer is subpar at best and as a long time player of the game I honestly wish i could enjoy it but like much sandbox games it gets stale after a long time. Not to mention the survival mode took nearly 3-4 years to come out from when it was first announced.
Although the game has gotten stale I still find enjoyment in building random ass creations with its tools and the mods are amazing the survival mode is well... Lacking to say the least. For what felt like forever it was in a state of ""Ohhhhh its coming alright!"" for years and by the time it had finally dropped the game had lost all meaning to me. It was a mess when it had first dropped including 3-4 game breaking bugs that were fixed in coming patches and it lacked and still sorta lacks Polish. I'd wait for a sale to grab this game to be honest but if you really are wanting to scratch that vehicle sandbox itch this isn't a half bad option but theres better out there."
26201,good game

26285,"It has potential, I mean you can create almost anything from sports cars to massive tanks with mounted machine guns. The problem is it's way too grindy. When you start the game you have probably built a working car within the first 20 minutes, and that's cool.. what now? Well, if you want to upgrade your vehicle to drive faster than you run and so it doesn't consume all your fuel in 5 minutes you'll have to run around the world and do the same thing over and over again. Raid old structures for materials to build a crafting bot. That's fun for about 10 minutes and then you'll get bored, but to get all the resources you will have to grind for at least an hour just to get a proper crafting bot. It's so slow to find resources and if you don't have one type of resources everything can stop and you can't get further. Ember is one thing I had a problem with. The only place I could find ember at was at spawn, but that didn't last for long. The ember never came back and I searched for hours looking for that one resource but could never find it. The game also feels very lonely without a friend to play with. If you don't have a friend it's totally not worth it. So my conclusion is: Lot of potential but too grindy, boring without friends. Things that could fix this is adding more action and variety to the game like more unique structures and make it much easier to gather resources. I would also wish that certain things can regrow/respawn over time like emberwood."
26286,great game

26480,PASKA PELI
26481,Great game
26482,"As a sandbox game - scrap mechanic is both enjoyable and fun, with the ability to create complex and not so complex creations and the workshop adds a great deal of value.

Survival Mode is an amazing addition to scrap mechanic, adding the need for function to your machines, after playing for over 200 hours, I have both amazingly positive and relatively negative comments which follow:

Pros:

A very fun game which will have your imagination over flowing with potential ideas

Beautifully simple and colourful graphics

With a simple set of functional items you can create vast complex machines

Replay-ability is endless

Cons:

Still quite buggy - back up your save files people!

Often bearings and pistons do what ever they want.....

There is currently NO endgame????

and my last and biggest issue..

The game engine they have created for this game needs ALOT of optimisation, 
it is very easy to kill or crash your game and if you build something slightly wrong the frame drop is considerable, I would love too see a game identical to this made with unreal engine if thats even possible.

Conclusion: An amazing game with several large drawbacks that will lose them a lot of players if not remedied quickly.

I recommend this game"

nothing is perfect though as the bugs are... abundant, which i'm not surprised as the game offers massive and almost limitless creativity potential. You can spend actual hours on a single creation, messing around with it to make it just right.
but if you like physics based building games this is a seriously good one
suspension is broken in the best/worst way possible

26691,"This game is amazing. The only problems it has is that large vehicles and vehicle collisions cause a lot of lag, but for most cases, the game runs pretty smoothly. Keep in mind, I am writing this before the Survival mode update, and I have no Idea if these are getting fixed in that update."

26718,fun
26719,"This is my first game on Steam. I bought this in 2017 to play with my friends, and now something much more different is coming out."
26720,"I first saw this game a couple years back and it really caught my attention. I'm personnaly a great fan of the graphic style of the game and combine with a building gameplay i just fell in love with it. I'll be honest, The first months i got the game, it felt repetitive in a way but really the only thing making it that way was my lack of creativity. Also, once the hype for survival mode picked up again, i really took interest in it again and started making anything i wanted without thinking too hard of making something cool or complex, i just did what my mind thought about in the moment. All in all i can't recommend this game enough if you like to build not only buildings nor vehicules, but really anything you want, everything is possible in this game if you have the imagination. So if you're hesitating, please give it a try and build a simple car and see if you like the way the game works. If you don't, just ask for a refund."
26721,when scrap mechanic survival is coming out me and my friend are dying to play it

26750,"Pretty great game, can't wait for suvival tomorrow"
26751,I liked the free roam aspect while I also enjoyed the building in the game although I suggest those that have slow computers to turn down most of the graphics because I myself forgot to do that so the game was really slow so I didn't know what to do with it so I haven't played it in the 2 years since I've had it until now.
26752,"CREATIVE
"
26753,Great game!!!!!!
26754,veri goot
26755,"The game is incredibly fun with easy basics and complex mechanics that are still fairly easy to comprehend. Anyone who likes building and mechanics will definitely enjoy this game, and for those who love survival games will likely enjoy the survival mode coming out tomorrow."
26756,yes es good
26757,it gud
26758,this game is good and fun and with the good community and endless ways to build things it is very good and you don't need that strong of a PC to play it and if you don't know how to build there is a workshop where you can use things built by other people. it is a good game overall
26759,no

26775,very fun game
26776,This is the best problem solving game iv'e ever played. It makes you think while enjoying its simple mechanics. Its 1 day until the survival update is here. I would recommend it to everyone. if you just like shooting things then they go the right tools and aresenals for you. and maybe you say oh but theres no pvp. we will see if the survival mode will have that.
26777,Yes.
26778,"Really fun game, and with the up coming survival it can only be better"
26779,Top 10
26780,"Good game, only really fun if you have friends
"
26781,Q
26782,"I've always loved this game, it's so relaxing yet it causes you to use your imagination and think outside the box. It's great to play with your friends and create different things and push the boundaries of your own imagination. I highly recommend if you're looking for a builder type game involving vehicles or a game that involves multiplayer as well as solo game play then this game is perfect for you. Thank you to developers for creating a game that I love and will always love!"

26792,i played since 2014 i've been waiting 6 years for survival and its epic
26793,"Very fun and creative physics engine, it allows you to build whatever you like out of blocks and bearings that you can link up to an engine or a drivers seat if you want to make a car, there are many different functions and objects to play around with, have played for 4 hours and have not even scraped the surface.It is definitely worth the money and you should get it before tomorrow because they will probably raise the price because survival mode comes out tomorrow I can't wait for that! You can do multiplayer as well and I am going to play through with one of my friends."
26794,i absolutely love this game its so fun and endless with the stuff u can do! i would recommend it 100%
26795,mario is cool

"
26799,it has some lag issuses if you have certain settings on
26800,"this game is very good and brings out you inner creativeness, but i would suggest watching a tutorial of this first so you don't get confused"

26803,Very fun and educational
26804,This game is really fun I do like it a lotj.
26805,Great Game!

26807,Its an amazing game about building things like basically anything you want when i finish a creation with lots of moving parts and it works seamlessly it never fails to put a smile on my face even with how long ive been playing couldn't recommend more probably my favourite building game of all time even when being compared to games like Terraria and Minecraft. the controls are also very simple and its easy to understand the block's functions.
26808,its fun with frends
26809,i like this game a lot but its so hard to update
26810,"The game is creative and has fun physics, on top of that, there is mods that can really spark your creativity or just let you have fun."

26831,"i like it
"
26832,"I really enjoy the intuitive build mechanics of this game.  It provides a lot of simple fun, and allows for a lot of creativity with solving problems by using engineering.  I myself built an elevator system to reach a raised base, a jet, and a number of apocalyptic-styled vehicles.  I personally wish the game did not depend so heavily on downloaded mods for new parts, but the vanilla pieces still work very well."
26833,"
LOVE IT"
26834,a game for creative person
26835,.
26836,very fun but you need a decent computer

26911,Great game
26912,games fun

26914,good sd sd s dsd sd s dsd
26915,Its just a really fun game I kinda stopped playing it but gonna get back into it sense survival is about to come out
26916,"I adore the amount of creativity possible in this game. The possibilities you can do with this game are mathematically speaking, endless. If you want more stuff, here, have mods! i also love how you can download other people's creations. Would recommend 100%!"
26917,everything
26918,good
26919,yes
26920,"I don't know how but this game is fun without the work. I can't wait for survival, although I have seen survival gameplay and would like to see only small items fitting in your inventory so you have to build transport vehicles for the bigger items. That would inspire more creativity and make the game that much harder."
26921,open world and fun
26922,This game fun :D
26923,"How can I put this? It's a really fun building game with one of the greatest concepts for a building game out there, however, it's horribly optimised, and can be horribly glitchy making it unplayable at times. Multiplayer is ok at best, with lots of clientside lag on the side of people who aren't the host. It does have mod support but not amazing mod support. With that being said, I can't say it's not a fun game and without all the bugginess it would have the potential to be one of the best building games out there.

TLDR : Good Game but too Buggy"
26924,It's a good fun creative game
26925,yes
26926,Awesome game.
26927,"This game was shit to begin with, I'll be totally honest, I hated it. But not that both survival is out and the game has improved over time I can now say that I recommend this as a fun sandbox/survival game. There is not much else to say about it, it's a simple and fun sandbox game."
26928,"I like this game because its a game that all most always uses your imagination and you can basically build anything you want, and you can do anything you want.      10/10"
26929,vggggggggggggg
26930,EEE
26931,"Really good to play with friends - quite low FPS tho
"
26932,is good
26933,fun
26934,This game is like coke i snort this mmmmm gimme survival
26935,can blow stuff up
26936,"yes
"
26937,"Ok, so this game is amazing. It's so fun to play alone or with friends and it allows you to have big brain. At the time of writing this survival will be out in 2 days, but from the prerelease it seems like it's going to be amazing!

EDIT 1: It was amazing. Another hundred hours well spent."
26938,FUN?
26939,just why not
26940,Has a great concept behind the game. Even better now that survival is coming!
26941,its fun
26942,Thumbs Up
26943,das is got
26944,Very good and exited about survival in 2 days
26945,i cant start!
26946,"I've played this game a lot. It's expensive but DEFINITELY worth it. It's my favourite game and SURVIVAL mode recently launched adding 400+ blocks and parts into the game and ENEMIES, it has completely changed throughout development but in a way it is still the same. I hopethis changed your mind.
Here are a few downfalls but I don't think these massively affect my gameplay:
Glitches, early access games are full of them but they are ironing them out.
Performance issues, it takes me a few minutes to launch the game, albeit I play my games on an ancient laptop, and when you get near to warehouses or abandoned buildings in survival there is a big lag spike. Creative on the other hand runs smoother than ever before.
Balancing, There are a few things that really stand out for me in survival, Haybots are way too powerful as the main enemy at the beginning and totebots are extremely under-powered and come in less numbers than haybots. I think the tapebots and farmbots are pretty well balanced as tapebots only take one hit but attack you from long distances and deal a lot of damage and the farmbot is big, highly damaging and extremely powerful which is exactly what it should be as a boss.
Anyway I think this game is GREAT and you've probably seen a lot of youtubers play this game, most noteably Scrapman, Durf, Moonbo, kAN, Squiddy, J0hnBane and many others."
26947,very good
26948,This game is really good if your creative and like to make things that move.
26949,"amazing game playing this since 2017 cant wait for survival mode 
"
26950,"Love this game, you cam be really creative when building your creations. Can't wait for the survival mode."
26951,..........

26954,Survival mode is really nice so far!

ALSO IF YOU WANT BETTER DAMPENING OR JUST A BETTER SUSPENSION GO TO MY WORKSHOP AND DOWNLOAD MY DOUBLE WISHBONE SUSPENSION!"
26963,i like that you ave freedom
26964,Very fun to play and you can be as creative as you want.
26965,"I was very underwhelmed with this game, i expected it to be a blast but instead I got a shitty sandbox game, definitely not worth the money, special because of all the complicated things that you need to do whatever, plus the workshop isn't the best and things are extremely hard and complicated to accomplish..."
26966,a good game
26967,"J√≥, de szerintem kell hozz√° egy bar√°t hogy √©lvezhet≈ë legyen."

26975,It's a great game with many hours of fun. Can't wait for survival to be public in 2 days!
26976,love it
26977,yeeeeeeeee
26978,"Honestly the wait for survival was the worst part, because the game itself is unique and puts your mind to work. All I gotta say is Axolot is on to something. Download recommended."
26979,"can i get survival mode plz
"
26980,"One of my all-time favourite games, hands down.
I'd recommend it to anyone who likes to make vehicles and contraptions.

It's still an early access game and, despite how fun it is, it does feel like one.
There are bugs, glitches, and the occasional framerate drop if you start getting too crazy. Accidental clashing pieces will often cause the game to bug out completely.

In regards to vehicles, you can't assign your own keyboard buttons to functions like in other similar games, so you are annoyingly stuck with WASD and the number keys.
That, along with the fact that there are no real flight mechanics incorporated into the vanilla game beyond simple thrusters, means it's really not worth attempting to build anything that doesn't drive on the ground or in water unless you install mods. Hopefully that will change in future updates.
But they're really my only complaints.
 
Overall, it's a fair stretch from a ""Build anything you can imagine"" game, but your imagination can go a long way with what you're given.
The devs are great and it's always exciting to read their updates.
There's a healthy community of fellow players, a good amount of mods, and a near infinite world to explore in the survival mode.
¬£14.99 is a steal for a game like this."
26981,I want a few more hours to make an informed decision on this game.
26982,"This game is something. I have been playing the game for 3 years now, waiting for the updates to start rolling in. With nearly 500 hours on this game at the time of writing this I have done nearly everything possible, yet i still find things to do once and a while. The creative mode in this game is something that needs mods to keep being fresh and entertaining. Now while so far this review does not seem to agree with my final verdict that brings me onto my next topic. Survival mode was promised from the games launch in 2016 and while since I have been playing the game since 2017, the devs have been putting monthly blogs out showcasing what they have been working on for survival mode and some new stuff for creative as well. But since September of 2019 we have not seen or heard anything. (Mind you that they do have a twitter page as well but I don't use that so I'm basing this of of their steam news) I was getting worried about what was going to happen with this game considering they were pushing large content updates for their other great game Raft and not talking about scrap mechanic at all on steam. I was losing hope but then a week before I am writing this they dropped a bomb, out of know where Axolot released the survival mode trailer on youtube, I wont say specifics but the new mode offers some game changing mechanics that have been missing from the game. I am very excited for the new mode and what is to come, and based on what survival seems to be offering, I am very excited to see what other things they do to this game. This is a great game by far, one of my favorites and I do encourage you to try this, please give it a chance because it is amazing and about to get a whole lot better."
26983,good
26984,Has large amounts of quality. You can build pretty much anything (with some loopholes).

27076,It is fun
27077,"Great game, especially with Survival mode coming soon. You could make anything that you would want on here. It could be Planes, Cars, Cities, Landmarks, and entire worlds. And the community on the workshop produces great stuff every day."
27078,"Best Game Ever, and Survival is Releasing soon, on May 7th, 2020, so that's cool"
27079,"EDIT: Works perfectly now in Linux, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, using Proton 5.13 and Vulkan. Loading textures sometimes takes a little while, but otherwise everything runs really well. I have yet to run into any problems, and I have tried a lot of things in game without experiencing any errors!

Previous EDIT: Works for me on Linux, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, using Steam Play Proton 5.0-7 but crashes now on world load. Before the survival update, it used to work every time when starting if the Shader Cache was removed, and would lock up every time I didn't. Now it sometimes locks up on start and sometimes starts very quickly and deleting the cache doesn't seem to make any difference. Once I am in the game now, the Tile Creator and World Builder appear to work, but starting a new Survival game or loading an old Creative or starting a new Creative game crashes.

Other than that, on Windows, the gameplay is pretty great so far. There's a lot of potential in the game, and it's also great for the physics, engineering, and logic programming aspect that is easy enough for kids to learn, but powerful enough to create some fantastic creations. Survival is pretty amazing!"

27107,"This game is amazing. I'm writing this review before survival mode. Even without survival it is worth the price. The building flows well. You can learn each part easily. It has mod support. It has online. the parts are good for new mechanics and pros. I watched a total of one video on how to make a car, and that was it for instructional videos. if you are creative, or just bored, GET THIS GAME. It is easily the best game I own.

The survival update is everything I wanted it to be. It is challenging, but not too hard. It doesn't punish you too hard for dying, but  you can't just kill yourself to get full hunger. It promotes creativity to solve problems, and works really well for new players as long as they have a basic understanding of each part."

27238,Its good the physics are trash at times tho :/(stuff cliping and tall things not falling but its understandable tho) and survival needs work (they are working on it but it will be a while before it is updated)
27239,"An extremely fun game. Pls buy it and if you have a Friend that has it too, you should play with them. If you don't have a Friend that has this Game you got 2 choices:

27265,"YYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!
"
27266,"Fun and enjoyable sandbox with endless possibilities, though this also means that it can be a bit laggy from time to time and multiplayer sometimes lags as well when there is a lot of creations or something complex but you can't really blame it for that. There is also a survival coming out so that's going to be even more interesting. The active community and steam workshop are also a big plus because of players being able to share their creations. Overall I enjoy this game and definitely would recommend it if you like sandbox games and creating stuff..."

27270,"Scrap Mechanic is a great free roam creative mode building game and allows new comers to expand there imagination but it only gets better when your with friends, the only problem i have with the game besides the consent glitches (not that i'm complaining about them just some are kinda annoying) the problem i have is that you can host free servers for other players to join your world if that was added a whole new world would open up. The reason why i want this feature is i am struggling to get friends that have this game and if they do they don't play it often. If this feature was added then i could find people who have the game and enjoy it enough to play it. I know other people suffer from this reason too (not having people to play with), so i ask for this overall this game is great and really encourage others to try it!"
27271,"This is a epic game and a will recommend it for any player who loves building and mechanics,and with the upcoming survivel update the game will be even more epic.But multiplayer can be laggy sometimes,and some vehicles can glitch out.So the lag can sometimes be bad but sometimes it is fine you should just not crash 2 vehicles in to each other.So at the end the game is very cool but I will not recommend playing on multiplayer with a lot of vehicles.The game is worth the it!"
27272,BUILDING
27273,"its fun ,to say the least"
27274,lovley game i loves it
27275,its a fund creative game where your creativity is your only limit and with the release of survival coming soon the real fun is about to begin :D strongly recommend it

27422,uhhhhhhhh ye play
27423,lots of stuff to do
27424,"Great game for passing large amounts of time. The game captured my attention years before i had my steam account and this was the first game i bought on here. I originally played on a cheap office computer and ran perfect on low graphics (Which still looked beautiful) Only issues i had were spawning large creations from the work shop and multiple creations touching each other. Now on my new pc i play with max graphics and no frame drops usually. The only frame drops are still multiple creations (Don't need to be too big) touching each other. This can be abysmal sometimes. Some features are fun but not realistic as much as others like aerodynamics and water but are added by mods. Water physics i would love. Underwater bits were shown in the new trailer but no vehicles here. I ended up buying a copy for my friend, and the 140+ hours i spent were worth buying 2 copies (Merely 40 bucks! SOOOOO CHEAP!) For a game cheaper than mine craft this is a beut. I hope consoles ports come (Image on switch, damn) and overall i would say 9/10 for the absolute fun for time to come, and the crazy low price. I would say this game is better then most AAA games."

Creating vehicles is a blast and trying to make stable hovercraft with gyro scopes ad such is really fun. but now, on may 7th 2020, survival is being added to the game. That will add at least a hundred hours to my play time!  10/10"

27452,VERY NICE GAME TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS
27453,"Ok here is an honest review of this game for every single person who is looking at the game but is not sure of weather it is worth your purchase. lets keep this short and shorter.

i tried the game, it worked, survival is cartoonish, its crafting not engineering, peace out."
27454,◊©
27455,it is fun

27457,no
27458,k

sometimes it lags when to vehicle hit echother but nobody cares because the Game is Awesome and will be more awesome with the new Survival mode.
It is like u r playing Minecraft but only Creative so u can say the Game will be onee of the best all time if the Survival mode is got and im sure it will."
27460,its a great game and loads to do

I have had this game since the early days and seeing it evolve over the years was incredible, and now with the biggest update this game has ever received just around the corner I seriously recommend buying this.
Endless fun, as you can see from my hours, and i feel I am nowhere close to being done with this game.
10/10 would glitch out again"

27509,"I really like the creativity in this game. I also love how the devs wont stop making new updates. the newest update, in my opinion, is a game changer. Water, machines, base building, and farming. after this update, this might be the only game I play."
27510,"what am i even supposed to write here.

27528,Great game!
27529,great Game 10/10
27530,it's a cool inovative game
27531,i like how you can make anything you want the only bad thing they need to hurry up with survival.
27532,u7ctf
27533,"good game
"
27534,This game is either a bitcoin miner or just really badly optimized.
27535,das spiel macht einfach spass und ich freue mich wenn der survival modus rauskommt am 7mai
27536,its really good
27537,"its so fun
"
27538,good all around
27539,yes
27540,"Its a great sandbox, if you see a sale for it before survival comes out you should pick it up (if you're considering on getting it) I wont put it past the devs to up the cost afterwards as they have been promising on the release of survival for years and even considered it on becoming its own game before. If you do get it expect long periods without updates or development on the game, I also suggest using mods as they increase the enjoyment of the game a crazy amount. But overall its a fun game just with a lacking of development."
27541,"I like this and my pc is so bad/potato pc so that why im lagging alot but atlrqst i still cnq play like maybe above 10 fps
"
27542,yes
27543,its good but needs to be optimized for older computers
27544,yes
27545,great game
27546,i dont have a gaming pc and i wish i could so i could play this very fun and awsome looking game of yours but i have all kinds of pc's but they need either a new part or there broke and im just a kid and i really want to be able to play this game with good fps and all but im not made of money............yes.
27547,"Great game! Made car, made another car, made better car, made awesome car, made spaceship car, made ""wheel-less"" car, made car out of wheels, made rocket car. üòÇ

Tried making bike but failed.

Made many cars though!"
27548,"Fun to play and even better with friends!

Multiplayer is laggy tho so beware! (its not the worse, just dont spawn large creations or have collisions!)"
27549,YES
27550,"yes
"
27551,It is like a game but fun
27552,e
27553,"f
"
27554,Best Game Ever
27555,"This is a highly entertaining game with a comically fun art style. I have spent many hours building random creations, and can't wait to make more."
27556,no
27557,"its fun to play build and play with freinds
"
27558,"this game you can do unlimited possibilities anything you want in this game, i'd recommend it :)"
27559,very good im play survival in soon
27560,fgdgdgdg
27561,"its Okay, i guess..."
27562,"pp caca
"
27563,I would recommend this game to anyone for I have over 200 hours of gameplay and have enjoyed every moment of it
27564,"If you're into building your own mechanisms then you can currently do that right now, so far i would recommend but here's some cons
- Graphics aren't that well optimsed
- a bit to complex with quite a steep learning curve
- early access 
- two maps (minus the community ones)
that's about it, i'd recommend recommend so far
so far it's gonna get a 6/10, i'll change the number once survival comes out on May 7th"
27565,from what ive seen of the development it is slow but every update works flawlessly and is well polished.
27566,awesome.
27567,"the game just does not have much to work with and it is fairly complex, there are many other games simmilar to this that are better"
27568,haha survival goes vroom
27569,Great Game Have great craic with my friend all around great game
27570,"this game has endless amounts of things you can do ranging from a simple car to a hovering robot that can shoot potatoes out it's eyes and more. however if your not that good of a Builder there's a work shop that has, again endless creations made by other people. if some how you are still unsatisfied with all that, its as easy to download mods as it is to download creations which there's a lot of. :)
"
27571,"Scrap mechanic is a good game if you love to build, create, and is overall an enjoyable experience. It allows your imagination to run wild with infinite possibilities. want to make a large monster truck? want to make a sci-fi themed hovercraft? well scrap mechanic allows you to make them as well as large sky fortresses, sprawling cities and medieval castles. Personally the game helped me get past writers block for important assignments and it has also aided me in turning my thoughts into solid buildings for stories. I cannot comment on the survival at the time I am typing this as we only have the trailer, however it seems like it will be great for both the imaginative builder and having fun with friends."
27572,there finally adding survival took them 3 years
27573,a wonderful game to put your time into i look forward to the upcoming survival- it can only get better!
27574,This is a great game :D
27575,"I love this game + mods are free so I have more parts to build with, now I am trying to build a fireturck."
27576,"ive been on a loading screen for 700 hours, ill update if it loads"
27577,"IT GOOD BECAUSE IT GOOD
"
27578,"great game, lot of fun"
27579,It is such an great game now the devs are sending out survival mode i watch the trailer it looks great :)
27580,this is awsome
27581,I really like this game! I m waiting survival mode!
27582,"yes
"
27583,"This game is great, it really has endless possibilities, and the gameplay is really fun.  It's almost like a more controlled version of G-mod with the critical thinking required by minecraft redstone."
27584,EPIC
27585,amazing game so fun 2 play
27586,idc
27587,good game
27588,Fun game. Multiplayer is very fun. Could be considered a steep learning curve but that's because its very diverse and powerful. Only thing i would say is that graphics could be optimised a tiny bit.
27589,This is my personal favourite game as to me it has all the needs of a good game and more. If i was to change something though it would be to try to make it run more smoothly as every time I spawn something in that is reasonably big my game starts lagging a lot.
27590,Create vehicle plane all kinds of machine and it has only just begun! survival mode is almost out Come before the price rises again
27591,This is one of the best games EVER!!! Full of excitement and fun. Can't wait for survival mode.

27619,"I have owned this game nearly since release date, back when I had a terrible laptop, I have barely scraped the surface of what you can do in creative building. I've build elevators and plenty of cars, down to tiles for custom race tracks. I'm super excited to see an AMAZING trailer for survival to have come out during this current quarantine!"
27620,"They did, they actually did it"
27621,"Some people may say that survival won't come out and its a scam company, its not if you have payed attention recently. The game is also right now, (before update) still a very fun and playable game. If you are looking for a fun game that has building and soon pvp, pve and survival aspects, this is the game for you."

27635,.
27636,"I got Scrap Mechanic a few years ago with a gift card I got for Christmas. This game is why I got steam. With 280+ hours, I can assure you that this game is fun an well made. This was posted the day of the Survival Trailer, and I cant wait to see everything that brings us. Never have I seen the first product of a company go so well. This may soon become the next Minecraft. 10/10, 5 Stars, and a big thumbs up from me."

27675,gremlin ass
27676,"Finally they add the survival mode they have been promising for years... and you know what? Its good.  really, its good.  I spent years being immensely frustrated with this game because the developers kept promising survival and it never came.  Then last week they said bam its coming and it came.  

The world is interesting, enemies are fun to fight, build system has been expanded, and for the first time exploration is the key way to getting important resources rather than just grinding at gathering. 

Overall, my friends and I had serious fun yesterday. 

Important note though: I don't think I would buy any other game this studio makes.  It just took them WAY too long to actually get anywhere in development.  Ironically enough, this game has been in development over 5 years and they finally get a survival mode. That took way too long. I have no interest in owning a survival game for 5 years without a survival mode."

27806,is gud
27807,nice game
27808,Can have so much fun messing about in a open world with friends and can make aload of amazing things
27809,great game to play with friends. I do recommend getting mods though.
27810,i liked it because it`s fun and creative but it`s a bit laggy on laptop
27811,this is one of the most creative games i have ever played and i like it a lot and i do recommend people get it if they are creative like me and it is super easy to make a car you slap together some blocks and some wheels and other stuff and boom fast and easy but creative.
27812,It's really fun and you can get mods to make litteraly ANYTHING!! You can post your creations and play with friends. :)
27813,super fun game lower end computers might have problems
27814,I LIKE
27815,it is a fun game
27816,I love using modes and making the game unplayable with 100+ napalm bombs near by the villige just to destroy the car xD. Great game. Can't wait till survival

27823,nice one
27824,"Scrap mechanic has brought me great pain as much as great happiness and has honestly helped my logical thinking in general. Where Scrap mechanic conquers other games, is in the raw creativity, although many functions are complicated and 'techy', there's still a raw building aspect to the game, I'd recommend this to anyone, as you can be silly and outrageous or you can straight up just get your brain going! earlier I mentioned great pain, but with great pain often comes great reward, and the pain has not been brought to me by Scrap mechanic  its been brought to me by my own foolish ideas which have then taught me a lesson, so in general, scrap mechanic is a win win situation!
the only thing i can complain about is the multiplayer quality, its not up there, but hopefully with the survival update a multiplayer update will come to :D
All in all I would recommend investing in this game, you'll be rewarded by the wonders of Scrap mechanic and your endless imagination along with it!"
27825,"good game
"
27826,As an engineer myself I do enjoy games where the goal is building random stuff. The fancy 3D graphics and ability to create a stiff rigid block from a bunch of blocks make it even more enjoyable. Totally recommended and a must have!
27827,GUD
27828,this is a good game
27829,"that you can build cars
"
27830,the shifting parts amuse me so mutch best part is that you dont need to create them just download them from the work shop
27831,Its ok but if you dont have a good pc then i wouldnt recomend it

27844,"i love scrap meanic it may posably be the game i have the most hours in total spread acrost 3 copys of thr game being total 5300 +hours i would say howver you need a basic understaning of phsicis and logic gates to get much farhter than just creating a simple car. however the servival needs some work and is a bit grindy howver when you get what you where working on its the most sadestfing thing ever

27868,"This game ended like Cube World. A grand update that adds something everyone wanted, in this case Survival Mode. The game was a bit bad before the survival update, now it is terrible. I dont mean Survival Mode, it is fantastic, but the progression is very linear. But this is not about survival, it is about the MAIN mode, Creative. It is as bad as before, or even WORSE. When I put a medium tank, the frames are AWFULL. In 0.3 I could spawn 15 close to one another and I have over 60 FPS. In 0.4 i have like 24.
Less about the FPS, more about the CONTENT. As you should know, Survival Mode has open world and proper water physics. The island you spawn in is MASSIVE, not even counting the islands! The Creative map is like under 2 kilometers. And is barren of water, procedural terrain and variety. And there are no survival items in creative like seeds, soil bags, fruit and vegetables, or even scrap versions of interactives! Soil and crops would be for decoration.
And to aggravate the situation of the game, the devs do not focus to add the survival content into creative, they focus on making the bed a consumable item.
BUT the game has potential and this is the beta. Everything can change.
BTW this is a very big review and I think no one would even read this XD

This review was made a [b]long[/b] time ago, many things have changed since then."

From the moment I finished the struggle of making my first machine, to 3 years down the line attempting to make a walker that transforms; I love this game with all of my heart and would recommend this beautiful realm to every gamer."
27894,1 OF THE BEST BUILDING GAMES I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!

27918,"One of the best games available today, with endless possibilities. A must-buy for anyone who likes adventure games, sandbox games, fighting games, third or first person games, building games, almost anyone can enjoy this! Download workshop mods or creations, make your own, find new ways to defend or automate your farm, explore, literally anything. Okay, now that that's over with, BUY IT."
27919,good game but very laggy
27920,it's what it says with the improvements each update says that new thing are being added they've stuck to their word as i have blown a CPU in my laptop and when i had a new one the game runs brilliantly even though my laptop isn't designed for it but for the good side of things it has took all of the stress so far and i'd recommend this game to people with any computer as it literally works perfectly and please make a version of this for apple devices as this would mean that many more could play even on their mobile device and i mean on every platform so would what be amazing if that was made possible and congrats to all to the creators of this game for managing to keep my computer and also others from overheating thanks to all of your effort and time to keep this game at a moderate performance. Now need to stop before this becomes looking like some guy wrote an entire 1000 word essay. so thanks for reading through this whole thing and i'll be looking forward to the future updates.

27938,The game is fun with Survival and Creative but gets boring and mods take a long time to download. 4.1/10
27939,"You can do all kinds of cool things such as building epic bases, getting servos to work, and explore the endless possibilities with pistons and bearings. Things can get quite complex."

27964,"This game lets you use your imagination to build different contraptions with what you have. Very fun (okay, maybe a bit frustrating when your contraption doesn't go to plan), I would definitely recommend this game to others, as it is a departure from most modern games, which are usually First person shooters. Definitely worth the money!"

If you're considering buying the game, please know you'll need an okay computer, but if you tweak the settings, it should work okay. Also, keep in mind that the game is not fully released yet and may have some bugs and issues until it's full release. I would recommend this game if you enjoy other games like Minecraft."

28004,"its a good game, better with friends. Its half physics-based-building-game and half combat-exploration-adventure. (fingers crossed for survival) You can use workshop vehicles if you don't feel like making one yourself, but the game becomes much better if you learn how to make stuff."

28055,"good game.  survival plz come out
"
28056,"This game is a game for preference, like any other game. Just because your friends like it doesn't mean you like it. But In my Personal opinion This game is very good and has potential. Its physics are somewhat accurate. And it has an interesting approach. I only honestly have one or two complaints, The physics need a little bit more development but they are almost there. Also my main point is that it doesn't have very logical Gates. The gates do not allow certain functions that realistic logic gates allow. It is a big limiter towards the games mechanical features. For example I was trying to build a JK-Flip flop which is a type of memory and the game doesn't allow two Gates to link into each others inputs and outputs. Which is quite frustrating. But to be totally honest this game is awesome and it rocks."
28057,"this game is a good game for people that want to have fun making car,plane and so on"

28096,This game is the best game in terms of creativity! The fact that they allowed the community to create mods is one of the best additions to the game. Survival will soon come out and I really hope that it will be as great as the creative version! I truly recommend this game!!
28097,good
28098,"This is a very good game. I like this type of game very much. I can design and conceive various machines freely in the game. But the game clearly can do better, achieve higher achievements, but it is stagnant. How interesting it would be if the game could broaden its playing methods, such as adding chemicals and other richer elements, and joining the online hall to let players from all over the country explore and cooperate anytime and anywhere!"

28131,"Very Good Game, Non-rivalled and if there are any other games like this then this came first.
A bit laggy on Non-gaming computers but with a fiddle of the graphics it can get up to about 55 Frames Per Second."
28132,this is very yes
28133,Awesome Game!
28134,"It's a great game
"
28135,"Great game but connection is sometimes doodoo, like a thing will be flying in the air and zooming around for the everyone except the host. also, the lag is awful if one thing collides with another. so this game needs some optimization. Also, the suspension glitch is really buggy and kinda breaks the game. Don't get me wrong this is a great game but the few things that are wrong sometimes really annoy me. I would play it a lot more and recommend this game if these bugs were fixed. And if they do get fixed, I will change my review.

Edit: They somehow made the connection problems worse."
28136,its not what i was told it was going to be
28137,yes
28138,"If you have a brain, and want to make cool stuff, play this game... If you dont have a brain, and are some dead body inside a coffin, then you will have a hard time playing this game.

28159,good game for creative people
28160,"Game is kinda fun, but empty. If early acces started 6-9 months ago it'll be a great wery promising game. But now, without mods it almost has no real functional parts. It has no big wheels for example, piston can't be extended in assembly mode and it has NO signs of survival features at all... but it has toilet, bath, toilet paper and other boxes of cucumbers... Please don't buying this game until they at least finish ""early acces"" with at least minimum promissed set of features."
28161,this game is fun for a lot of reasons mainly because you can play with your friends!!!!
28162,bad
28163,e
28164,this game good you can build whatever you want
28165,"I bought this game at release. I was holding out for survival. The building mechanics are super cool, but I'm the kind of player that feeds off of the structure of a survival mode to guide my building, and that was promised 4 years ago but has yet to materialize.

If you're into 100% self-motivated creative building, go ahead and get this but I can't recommend it to those that are looking for a survival sandbox like I was.

I'll happily change my review if survival ever happens.

Edit: Yes I know the trailer is here. It's really ironic timing because i posted this right before the news dropped. I'm super excited to play survival, and hopefully it's amazing and I change this into a glowing review. I'm very optimistic, but stop telling me to change my review just because they put a date on survival. If this is still a thumbs down on May 8th, feel free to argue with me about it.

Edit 2: I tried survival and it's not there yet, in my opinion. I'm pretty surprised that after waiting four years for a survival mode, it drops without a single line of text explaining what I'm doing or why. I can see I have a health bar and food and water bars, but why is there nothing telling me how to craft? I wasn't looking for an ""on rails"" experience but a launchpad of some kind would certainly be nice. The manual is literally just the same one from creative mode with nothing added to give context to survival. Aside from the zero hand-holding, the intro experience is a bummer for other reasons. The scrap wheels and other beginner level parts you initially have access too aren't even worth using. I can run faster than anything I build out of those janky wheels. And then the grind to find components for simple parts is absolutely bonkers. I spent a couple of hours just looking for beeswax and I only ever found one hive.

I'm not giving up hope, I still have a hunch this game will be great when it irons out the wrinkles, but I still say don't buy it if you want to fire it up right this minute. If you want to invest, go for it but as far as I'm concerned, this game is far more untapped potential than it is actual tangible fun."

28178,"Very good game, with responsive movement, a thriving modding community and, is as bonkers and as fun as you imagination! And at the time of writing, this game is still in early access, with tons of potential and hours of fun game play with friends!"
28179,creative mode is very addictive once you learn the logic and glitches necessary to build flying machines. My family is destroyed. I dropped out of high school. But none of it matters as I have scrap mechanic now
28180,good game very fun to play now and then
28181,Awesome Game
28182,"This game is probably my favourite game of all time. It has the best, most advanced building system I've ever seen and you can do almost anything. And best of all, when survival mode comes out next month, I think it will be 5x better. Here's to another 1000 hours :)"

REVISION W/ NEW SURVIVAL:

Okay, so here are my final thoughts on what is currently the ""published"" Survival Game.

I find it hard to give a huge amount of sympathy to this studio because for so long we had different release dates for Survival mode but they just kept pushing it back and back and I thought it entered developer hell / was just being milked for a ""potential lead"" on survival. This game was/is still Early Access. The point of Early Access is to release an unfinished game that still needs updates and then to push updates consistently - this is what I would define as a successful/contributing early access title on Steam. The problem with this category on Steam is that so many of these games get released and so many get abandoned, it's a toxic environment to live in for both consumers and developers because there's a huge amount of distrust in games in this category. This game released with just Creative mode and it was amazing! But it was a buggy mess in multiplayer past so many blocks, and it needed updates. I remember the map builder update they pushed but that was it (from what I can currently recall).

Here we are, finally. 4 years, and the Survival mode that was pushed so many times is here, so I am going to be a critic. It's done amazing in many categories, but there are some areas where I say ""You could have just spent an additional week and finished this to make it more polished"". 

Let's begin, PROS:

- The game finally has a Survival mode, and Creative Mode, and a ""Challenge"" mode that is currently not released.

- There is some automation you can do if you're crafty enough, the farm-bots mechanic that attack sets of farms is actually pretty nice, and a special mechanic I don't see in many other games that might have mobs spawn at night (Minecraft) or raid you ever 7 days, etc. 

- There's an underwater Biome (read later in CONS because I have a bug with this)

Okay, so that sums up the largest pros on top of what was released, but here are some cons/bugs I have with the game for me (Dell G7 Laptop, 1060 Max-Q Design, i7-8750H, Audio-Technica Headphones).

The biggest Cons:

- Creative mode still feels lackluster, the game they started with is still pretty much there. They have added SOME blocks from survival, but not enough and it bugs me why. If I want to test a build that I want to do in Survival with different weighted blocks (Chests for example), they aren't in Survival. I don't know why this is it, I understand we don't need to store items in Creative - except unless we want to. We should be allowed to, this should be changed.

- Underwater Biome: *ALERT* This could be just an issue with something that my game is doing and if I can fix it I will amend this. As it currently stands my headphones blast to 4.4 x 10^27% in Volume when I enter the underwater biome, and even turning the game down to 1% I can still hear it way to much. After approximately 20 seconds my headphones start to crackle and pop (I have tested it is NOT my headphones, just Scrap Mechanic), and my game completely freezes every in-game minute (approx 1 sec) for about 3 to 7 seconds. I have to Alt+f4 to fix this. My friends do not have this issue, I should mention that I am HOSTING the server with my friends, I'm unsure if it's a host bug.

- THE HELPER BOOK. There is no documentation on this game that I could find on the wiki on day 1, and the 'H' button you hit to bring up the helpers book is the same book from 4 years ago. why is the survival stuff not in there? That's unacceptable, this wouldn't have taken long to fix/add these features, and it slows progress to just ""stumbling across"" how something works. This is annoying.

Straight up Bugs:

- Read my underwater issue, that's a bug technically

- Name tags (when I'm hosting for friends in Survival) vanish for friends when they die and do not re-appear until they rejoin the same session. Sometimes I notice the ""Unauthorized Farming"" tags will also vanish above farms randomly, and I'm not sure why this is. 


So that's my review. The studio finally released an Early Access game, and I'm afraid of when the next large update is going to be, and only time will tell. I hope the updates stay more consistent and they fix bugs, and release more content as time continues. 4 years with no updates in an Early Access title is horribly unacceptable to me, but maybe not to the reader that is looking at this review. I'm going to leave this game as a ""No"" still, but if you do purchase it, I hope you and your friends have fun!

Oh and please add the ability to setup dedicated servers with a config for options, it would be incredibly useful."
28234,cheese
28235,"I really enjoy this game, but its more like a scam, no major updates, just false promises..."
28236,I like how it allows you to create vechicals and download community builds.
28237,"I have nearly 1000 hours in this game, I'm one of the best Scrap Mechanic players in my country, and yes, now I can say that this is a good game, the only thing annoying me is the slow developers... Shame on them, because they should have released the survival game mode in like September 2016... But guess what, they once again said that the survival is going to be released in march 2020... It's already April of 2020 and nothing... :( Still would recommend this game :D"
28238,its just a wonder full game its perfect but the only thing that is rong is the fact that it can get very glitchy
28239,2nd best game for fucking around with friends

28242,Its a good game with cool things unlike other games. Theres cool physics that go into detail and all sorts of that. Make anything you want really. One problem is the lag. Its just unbearable with what seems like a small amount of creations. Also I would really like more guns. Its a good game and I hope they fix lag and add more cool things. Right now I rate 8/10.

You have the ability to make houses if you want, vehicles, walking animals, and just about anything else you can think of. Adding mods can improve the look and styling of your builds and the mods are very easy to download. I strongly recommend this game to everyone looking for a great game."

and the devs say now as ""joke"" it will be SM 2.....

Honestly, i feel Cheated..... a shame.

PS on 24 Nov 2020:

I test the survival mode, is a nice job indeed, they take long time to release it (4 years and a half after I bought it), but they finally did!

I have to say, is a good work and they are working hard on the game, you can see results on the continuously updates they are releasing, making goods improves on the gameplay as in the content, very good job and fun gameplay, it mix the creative mind with the survival in a good balance, making it playful for many hours.

Now, for the news players that are thinking on buy this game, I totally recommend it, do it and enjoy this refreshing experience on this innovative gameplay!"

28395,the graphics was good
28396,YES BEST GAME EVER
28397,great physics and range of parts and mechanics that mean that you can create literally anything that you want. the only parts that i wished that they added was wings and some sort of body of water that you could build boats and submarines for. apart from that well worth the ¬£14.99 and i think that its one of the best value for money pre release games out there for all mechanicaly and created minded gamers. also it feels practicaly like a full game rather than a buggy part of a partially complete game.

28450,I have loved almost every minute played although the only problem i have is there is many simple things that i found very hard to learn to do because it was not explain very well which left me having to spend a good couple of innoying hours that i could be building space ships. but for example trying to make doors its very unclear how to make them unless you have previous expirence with the tools it takes to make doors other than that great game for people like me how love engineering. thank you so much to the guys who made it for the best 76 hours lets hope the next 76 are just the same.

28463,The only bad thing is you can't play offline
28464,"Scrap Mechanic is a game about building vehicles and other things using mostly mechanical parts. For example, you can build a car by slapping some wheels on some bearings and connecting them to an engine and then the engine to a seat using the very easy-to-use connect tool. Of course, there is a million things you can do in this game. If you don't want to make a car, then maybe build a house, or a plane. Why not a boat?

Creative isn't the only gamemode. If you want the game to be a bit more challenging you can try survival mode. Now you will have to manage your food, water and health. Grow your own crops and defend them when the night comes around and loot ruins among other things. You still have to build vehicles and other things so you can more easily get around or a base to store your resources.

The final game mode is challenge mode. It's exactly what it says, you complete challenges. There is a few Axolot-made challenges that come preinstalled. You build vehicles to get through different levels using a limited amount of parts. If you have completed all challenges, or just want to try something else, there is always the workshop with hundreds of challenges.

That is one thing we haven't talked about. Workshop support. The workshop works in basically all games that have it, you can upload your creations and download other people's creations. There is also the modding side of things. If you get bored of vanilla, you can always download some mods.

Performance isn't the best in this game. Physics is what will make your game lag. As long as you try to not include too many bearings, pistons or suspension pieces, you will be fine.
I have run into performance issues more than a few times, especally in the late game of survival, when you usually have multiple vehicles that all will be used for different things, that will lag if they are close to each other or just are on the ground. That's a pro tip. ALWAYS weld your vehicles when you aren't going to be using them for a bit. It will greatly improve performance in your world.

There are a few bugs, mainly in the physics of the game. Stuff can sometimes glitch through other things if they are going to fast, or if your creation has too many bearings, it can sometimes start to glitch and will most likely lag. Finally, pistons and bearings will start to sag if they have too much weight on them. Sometimes this can be annoying, especially the sag issue.

One common way this game gets criticized is the slow updates. Yes, they are a bit slow. I can totally agree on that, but does that mean you shouldn't buy the game? No.
Even in the state the game is in you may get over 1k hours (like me) in it. For it's relatively cheap price of $20 it's definitely worth a buy if you enjoy these types of games. More content is just going to be added in the future to increase your playtime further.

In conclusion, this is one of my favorite games. Definitely worth a buy if you enjoy these types of games."
28465,It is amazing and you should play yes it big big good good but even better..... IT HAS FREE TOILET PAPR
28466,yes
28467,It's very good and fun
28468,"Excellent game. I'm not sure how serious the developers are at this stage because it has an update schedule unlike anything I've ever seen. But hey, they have said we'll get another update at the beginning of May so we will see. At it's current state, it is a lot of fun already so it may be worth buying to you, I just have trust issues when it comes to Early Access.

Devs, please PLEASE add gamepad support."

28515,"this is a great game for people who like sandbox games but its better for short few hour projects rather than multiple day projects unless you have a good computer or are interested in logic gates or packing as many features into something as possible. regardless there's something for everyone, be it silly 5 minute creations, competitions with your friends or long term projects and with the upcoming addition of survival and the wide range of mods the game is only getting better. please give the game a try because it deserves a chance no matter what kind of person you are. besides you can get a refund within an hour of purchase but i don't think you'll need it. i personally have 260 hours in this game and will continue to play it even so. so give it a shot."

The challenge modes are fun and exciting to play with friends, although the builder for them is a bit hard to use. The lack of information from the developers is a bit frustrating, but it's do-able.

28564,Besides it being a bit laggy at points Its a great game where your mind is the limit
28565,"I've played this game for over 1700 hours, and I haven't got bored a single time."
28566,"It is a really good game and really fun to play. It allows for creativity  and eneenering. Although there is  a few bugs and my game crashes a lot problaly due to the fact I play on an old laptop, but I really recommend this game, its better with friends and could use some updated. It is a really good game."
28567,cool
28568,this game is amazing but it would be better if there is a survival test branch that is public

28577,kuk
28578,The game is very decent however in survival's current state i would not buy it. it is extremely buggy and full of exploits and the game has major lag issues later in survival mode. Creative is still decent but also has the lag issues. Note about 600 of my hours played were pre survival over the course of 4 years. Future development looks hopeful but the inherent issues are likely to plague the game.
28579,Great game if you like to take time on legit projects.
28580,very good game

28647,"a
"
28648,"it is a fun game to play with your friends or on your own it is especially nice to put things in the workshop that crash your entire computer or in other words it still needs a lot of updates

I give it a 6/10 for now"
28649,good game for messing around in
28650,this is the best game on steam
28651,I have just two words for this game. HELL YES!
28652,good game lots of fun
28653,jhgvfgyhuiokjhbvfdertyujk
28654,"great game, well worth the money although better to play with others. The game does not cope well with large and or complex structures which can limit your construction ability. Brilliant for testing design and or buildings. Definitely worth getting, even if you don't use it often, it is good to have in you arsenal."
28655,"Good game, but the devs are the scum of this earth. DO NOT buy, unless you want to support scumbags. IM GOING TO RAPE THE DEVS."
28656,yes
28657,its a good game

28659,scrapanic.
28660,is fun
28661,hella cool
28662,it like minecraft but 100 times better
28663,good play
28664,"The game itself has a great concept.  The mods that users have created are very good, and provide extra hours of playability.  However, the game can be very laggy, even without mods, and is not fluid.  Coupled with the seeming lack of additional information from the development team in regards to game completion, means that I would not recommend this game.  No dev update since September?  Come on guys, get the program."
28665,good
28666,Very fun game with lots of good features. Very fun to build vehicles.
28667,great game and very fun would recomend

28671,very good game
28672,You truly get to be as creative as you want and there are just so many ways to play. Get a couple friends to play with and it's endless fun. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND
28673,"i dont know what to say about this game its a yes and a no, if you like to be a big brain and build vehicles this game is for you, but if you are a lazy arse like me and gets bored of just thinking and solving the problem then this game isn't for you."
28674,e

28715,"If you like breaking games, this game is for you.

If you don't like breaking games, watch some tutorials, and this game is for you.

10/10"
28716,"+ very easy to run
+ simple to understand building
+ active workshop
+ multiplayer co-op challenges
+ builds can get really complex and interesting
+ nice artstyle i guess
+ it's incredibly rare to run into annoying physics bugs (i used to build mechanical stuff in Space Engineers all the time and my enthusiasm would always get ruined once i start working on a build and run into weird physics bugs that make no sense)
+ incredibly satisfying explosions
+ very useful high quality videos on developer youtube channel
+ controller incredibly simple to use

- NO GOAL/OBJECTIVE (...yet; survival mode planned around Q1 2020)
- incredibly slow developer, game hasn't changed in 4 years (except for survival coming Q1 2020)
- no way to use mouse input in builds (turret aim or airplane control) without using mods
- logic gate output can't be hooked into it's own input - you need to add 2 extra logic gates to close the loop
- only weapons without mods are potato guns (that can only break cardboard/glass) and explosive barrels, where the smallest one is 2x2x2 which makes missiles with an explosive payload too big
- no way to teleport to other players in multiplayer (hard to meet up with friends if you walk away from spawn)
- controller can't trigger logic gates and you can't group bearings either
- controller can only be connected to 10 bearings
- controller can't have 2 different setups for each trigger direction
- controller can't have custom piston speeds"
28717,(not) Fun
28718,"well yes
"
28719,"Amazing game for anyone who likes tinkering and engineering. 
Works amazing on Linux, with no stuttering or any odd issues Proton often presents."

28722,Infinite possibilitys
28723,"I have spent so much time in this game, its not even funny. The physics are wack, the multiplayer is a lot of fun, and its a great tool to unleash your imagination. 10/10, An amazing game!"

28729,its fun and adictive
28730,"This game is not like other sandbox games that I have played, I enjoyed it very much, especially because at the most basic level, it minecraft for engineers.  My only issue is that it is a Beta game, which makes it laggy and sometimes finicky, but other than that, it's an awesome game"
28731,best game

28755,"Perfect for creating, but you should probably get the levitation mod. you do have to keep it and you have to interact with it every time you load the world. Also upload your creations! if you want the one downloading it to know the controls, list them. (is this turning into a tutorial? A: probably) Anyways, I hope that if you download the game, you'll enjoy it like I did!"

I loved that you're able to build whatever you want, there are no boundaries on what to build. (Exept the world boundaries) I think that survival will do great and this game will burst up on the top games lists, and get what it truly deserves.
Thank you developers for such an amazing game, nothing like I've ever seen before!"

28804,fun and realistic(sort of )  fun because you can do what you want
28805,"It's a cool game, but the Survival Update is constantly delayed"
28806,"I will keep this short, this game allows you to create pretty much any vehicle you would like limited to the map box or your computers power. the modding community is essential to the game-play but you could easily get 100+ hrs without mods. The only downside is the sometimes glitchy physics and high computer requirements.
I would 100% recommend this game to anyone."

28822,"cars go vroom
"
28823,Very Fun Game Looking Forward To Survival Mode......
28824,great game with a lot of fun
28825,Always fun to play.
28826,"Very good game despite the lack of Survival mode. The level of reality is also well done. Explanation:
You have to play with logic in the creation, because if you do not calculate the number of objects (block) on each side of the vehicle, it might not be stable. Plus, it is thus necessary to create a chain so that the whole system goes one after another. Like a box that opens from the top, so from the sides, if you understand my example.

In short, everything to say is that this game is great to discover with friends or alone, with possibilities of construction beyond the imagination. I recommend this game to Minecraft fans and other users who fancy a more complex and, how to put it, a little more mechanical sandbox ! ;)"
28827,"Sparks a lot of creativity, endless fun!"

28853,it good
28854,As a game for engineering its no doubt one of the silliest games to do so. Its focus of engineering really shows as I've seen people make literal computers in scrap mechanics.

28950,"This is going to be an absolutely honest review. This game was amazing when I first bought it in 2016. The creative and challenge modes were incredibly fun before survival released. As the new survival game mode released, it was a gem and hooked me for several hours a day. Though now the game has slowed down a bit for me, as cars are almost impossible to drive as the tires slip at normal speed, and creating vehicles is a nightmare of tweaking as if it is too heavy, it is impossible to drive. Though overall, the game is still in early access, its incredible the pace that it has been updating, and progress is slow enough to that it isn't boring, yet you don't complete the game in the first several hours. Thank you devs, and readers of this review."

Although I like the concept, I would not  recommend, not for boring or anything else every time I make a car bigger than a plate with wheels the game constantly crashes, to the point of Bug Splat. I am trying to make a Ford-f 150,and i cannot add an engine, turning or wheels because the game keeps on crashing, I have had to abandon the project entirely.
And keep in mind, I payed ¬£15.99 for this game."
29075,Very fun and you have freedom of what you do
29076,this game is super fun and there will be a survival mode in the game!!!!!!!!!!
29077,"This game is fantastic, it allows you to create any kind of contraption with the hundreds of blocks available. The modding community is absolutely amazing and is rather simple, as mods are just installed via the steam workshop."

29091,"Its like minecraft but it is have it a ballbearing and with it you can if you want put on a chinese so he spinning around like its a fidget spinner and if you give him wood he will turn it into chopstick and eat dog or snake coronavirus is also included in this gem if you buy DONT download it will give you asperger and you will probably end up like stupid chinese man thats spinning around so i would rate this game a solid 10/10 becouse of its creativeness to chinese men and if you download mods it will get you better car or flying vehicle (no discrimination) im personaly in love with this game (no homo) as i said before its just like minecraft so you better get that one instead its also have very good graphix it look like a game from 1984 you really need a powerful grafixx card to run this game i got the triple titan rtx so its fine for me i got like 30+ fps btw it said its going to be survival but wherse that fucking survival i dont fucking see it the developer is probably slow short chinese man.


Things to tink about before buying gem

  * Just dont
  * But if you would like to buy the gem dont download when i did it i became the BIG chinese
  * Get minecraft instead
  * Or if your just like me with no money you can just go to https://www.roblox.com it will be fine aswell
  * If you buy and download please call my number and tell me how it was my number is 911
  * If your chinese it will be 100% fine to play it will not harm you"
29092,It is fun but can get boring after a while and uses a lot of physics

29099,all g
29100,"highly recommend. a bit hard to learn at first, but once you learn, it's hard to forget (unlike me with my steam password)."
29101,oh course its a very good game
29102,It's fun.
29103,Great game loads of fun.
29104,I loved how creative you can get and basically you have a world to yourself to do ANYTHING!!!

29117,...
29118,yung walnut
29119,i rate it 9/10
29120,bla bla
29121,It is a fun game to mess around in with your mates and if you want to learn how to build thing then you can play the story mode.
29122,it aigh
29123,very fun and good workshop items
29124,hugh told me to review this game wasd
29125,I get to build bad  *** trucks
29126,sure
29127,this game taught me how to Perimeter: Emperor's Testament
29128,this is a very good biulding game
29129,"The game is amazing, little limitations. You can build almost anything and if there isn't enough parts.. Download mods! Create Mods, Creation based on your imagination. Test your skill with 40 default challenges and a infinite more in the workshop. Soon(Hopefully) survival mode will come out and you will have all the fun in the world building creations to protect yourselfs and defeat farmbots (Survivle in Q1 of 2020)! The game has multiplayer support so you can play with friends! Most of the multiplayer glites are just funny, not game-breaking. I definitely recommend buying the game and putting your imagination to reality."
29130,So Cool Game!
29131,Amazing Freedom! No Rules just you and your brain box. loads of modding goodness for anything you need
29132,Very good game and cheap buy it now

29134,this game is amazing
29135,crazy
29136,"GREAT game, we love the mechanics and the possibilities are immense. Totally recommended!"
29137,"It's a fantastic game with lots of possibilities! And with survival mode coming up in around a month you can expect even more fun! It's even better when you add multiplayer to the mix.
I can fully recommend this game to anyone: It's not hard to get into, but when you do, there's no end to it!"
29138,ITS EPIC BUT IT NEEDS OCEANS!!!!
29139,yesy
29140,VERY GOOD A WORLD OF CREATIVITY
29141,ITS A REALLY FUN GAME
29142,i hate it ; )
29143,it is a awesome game fun to play
29144,ooooo
29145,yees
29146,Its fun
29147,"As long as you don't mind spending longer amounts of time making vehicles/creations this is a great game. The building is fairly intuitive, but is just time consuming due to the game's physics (Namely unwanted suspension glitches) and just the engineering aspect as well, but overall I would recommend this to anyone who likes Boolean logic and engineering. The map editors are a little difficult at times, but are fairly easy to pick up, but there aren't very many terrain assets on the workshop so you have to get creative sometimes, but it's useful for making terrains to suit your needs in-game."
29148,Good Game
29149,"take minecraft, take mechanical engeneering and take great graphics, combine them. SCRAP MECHANIC"
29150,By far my favorite game
29151,i recomend if you like building games

29154,"BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED!

Good to just chill out and build some dumb, funny stuff.
I love this game, and i can't wait untill survival releases!
Totaly would recommend to buy it!

Don't forget to install mods, without them the game is less fun."
29155,"cant wait for survival

ok there have been levels for long but still

definetely a buy, even when u cant build its
still entertaining just to download from this 
huge and talented community.

29156,tj
29157,Thisis the best game in the world me and my mom love it
29158,i would say play this to someone who is creative other wise no
29159,I like Scrap Mechanic.
29160,"Let me be honest here, I love this game, Probably in one of my top games of all time! I have had so much with this game alone and with my friends, i recommend this game to anyone who likes games involving lots building and ""Mechanicing"" but also a fun game to mess around in with your friends. This game is going to be a blast, figuratively and literally."
29161,good
29162,Like minecraft redstone but on 10 kilos of crack
29163,"A bit glitchy and multiplayer is a bit buggy but I've had so much fun playing this game.

29170,"when its not a buggy mess, it is quite enjoyable."
29171,even though im not the best at building (it takes time but im learning) i can say i love this game to the background all the way to what you build. the skys the limit in this sandbox and i love it. i recently messed around with building a base to store my favorite veichles and gotta say first time on here in a while and it drew me back within a minute. with the game being constantly updated there is never nothing to do. have fun scrappers
29172,It is epic.

29180,"The game is good, It has almost everything i love in a game like this. You can build vehicles and houses. The game also has a melee and long range weaponry for your avatar and vehicles. The controls are smooth and the overall concept of the game is different ANY from other games i have played. There is one problem I have right now. The game won't let me update it to the newest version. That is about it, I am not the most reliable source of enformation for this game. If you want to know more visit the steam page or watch tutorials about it. Thanks steam for amazing games like this

Until your build gets built in different pieces, because building on the wheels makes a whole separate different build which only sorta attached, and then you have to restart your entire build

29223,"Hej alla kompisar, Om ni har f√•tt en tanke p√• att k√∂pa detta spel skulle jag verkligen rekomendera det. jag har sj√§lv k√∂rt detta spel i snart 150 timmar och jag har aldrig haft tr√•kigt. en g√•ng bygde jag en bil som blev v√§ldigt snygg och en annan g√•ng byggde jag en bil som var ocks√• v√§ldigt snygg. det var en rolig upplevelse som jag v√§rkligen vill att ni ocks√• ska uppleva. Scrap mechanic √§r dessutom gjort av svenskar. Det √§r ett v√§ldigt roligt spel att spela med kompisar och om ni inte har n√•gra kompisar kan ni altid ringa bris (116-111) och fr√•ga om de skulle vilja spela scrap mechanic med er. spelet √§r ocks√• v√§ldigt billigt om man t√§nker p√• hur mycket kul och skoj man kommer att ha."
29224,"In this game you can do stuf like bild cars bildings and stuf like that

29227,it gud
29228,"class game! have had a lot of good memories and moments of laughter and is the perfect game for someone with a creative mind, how in depth this game really goes is insane and the average player would only scratch the surface so is worth playing a lot of. overall i love and respect this game and is everything i could ask for with a creative, fun and soon to be survival sandbox game."
29229,yes
29230,THIS GAME REALY SPARKS CREATIVITY AND IS SOMTIMES HILARIOS.
29231,fin and god game
29232,amazing

29241,yes
29242,Very good
29243,verry good game
29244,amazing game i love it
29245,It's a fun sandbox game even though its not finished theres so many things to play with that its unreal and really confusing you look at invintory and you think dang this is a horrible game then once you start seeing what the things do then you go a whole game can be inserted on this one thing
29246,good mechanics
29247,Its creative and complicated.
29248,This is a game where you can expand your creativity more than you ever could before and I think others who don't have this game should.
29249,This game is amazing. The physics are very silly and you can make your dreams come true
29250,It's a really amazing and creative game
29251,its like minecraft with physics btw i still really like minecraft
29252,u can make stuff
29253,BEST GAME EVER
29254,"Really fun game, there are so many things you can create, it's awesome. My only complaint, even though I haven't had much problems with it, but I know others have, is that if you start building large builds, or other, the game can lag pretty bad, I'm hoping they will fix the lag some soon. I still recommend the game a lot, the possibilities of what you can create are endless, and soon I believe they will make a Survival Mode, which sounds really fun."
29255,good game
29256,shieeeeet
29257,The Challenges won't work. It will make you start automatically. I don't like it.
29258,Its ok
29259,very epic
29260,"Very complex mechanics, to the point where it's annoying sometimes but not frustrating, I also very rarely get bored of it.. +1"
29261,"Never get's updated.

The game is dead.

Don't buy, please!

Fuck axolot, they are a bunch of scammers.

edit: Survival came out, and can't say It's much better. It's a bad survival game at it's core, and I love difficult survival games, if you like building things, get it for creative mode. otherwise if you want a survival game with building, don't get it."
29262,HAREN
29263,Its cool. You can build stuff and thats it. (and download mods)
29264,its very creative and with mods you can create much more i reccomend it to 10-16 year olds

29334,"I love this game! You can build anything imaginable, theres a ton of mods to add new items and features, theres endless hours of fun to be had playing scrap mechanic. If you like building things and playing with crazy game breaking physics, this is your game"
29335,"yes fun, very good."
29336,"Creative is a fun way to make cars, flying vehicles, or even moving homes but the survival aspect is what i am waiting for which will be coming soon."
29337,yes
29338,this game is great you can really expand your imagination and do anything you put your mind i recommend this game to every one of any age
29339,"If you like building stuff, this game is definitely for you.  If you like trying out other people's cool cars, planes, and gadgets, this is for you.  If you like making little logic / computer gadgets, this is for you.  I've spent over 1000 hours in-game and based a good part of a YouTube channel on this game.  Your creativity will be on fire if you play this.  

There are some bugs and limitations to the game, and the devs have taken longer than I would like to get survival done, but there are problems with any game.  I could have paid $200 for this game and still gotten my money's worth.  So if you don't own it, then go ahead and buy it."
29340,"i love it

29341,"The only problem is that if a lot of bearings are close it will lag your game like crazy no matter what computer you have.

29363,so much fun
29364,"It's a good sandbox game however, I feel there should be a stronger multiplayer drive. Similar to how you can have large multiplayer servers in Minecraft, I think this game would be better if it had something similar. 

Also, only small complex creations or structures that are stationary work well. I have a i7-8750H, GTX 1060, 32GB RAM and a zippy 2TB M.2 nvme SSD. For my hardware, I would expect far better optimisation for the game as I believe those with lower end hardware would find playing this game a lot less enjoyable. 

The patches for this game are also very slow going. Generally though, this game is a fun game with relatively easy controls considering the amount of fairly complex things you can achieve (as long as you have the hardware to back it up)"
29365,it is fun
29366,"A really underrated gem, physics are not quite realistic but it might be even better that way, hours, no days, maybe even years of fun building your mind out!"

I tend to have the mood of playing it maybe a few times a year or so but get bored pretty fast, because there's no objective. But still really fun/funny to play with friends. Worth the buy 100%"

I got almost 19 hours of solo time playing out of it but with no one to play with I don't have an interest to install again (At least at this point in time)
Definitely a FUN with FRIENDS type game."
29398,I love it it runs great even though i have an old dell laptop. it lags sometimes but it is just the massive size of some creations tat cause it. The only thing i dislike is that i don't have a better computer.
29399,i want to say yes but i pressed the wrong button
29400,good game
29401,"(Updated) 

This is a fantastic game, it is an engineer's paradise and the developers have improved it so much since my original review. The new survival mode is great but it still lacks a few key features such as a grab all button. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to just about anyone. However, be warned that the survival game mode is very grindy and it still lacks water based content such as a propellers, rudders, and other necessary boat parts. Scrap Mechanic is an excellent game and I hope that it continues to grow."

29525,"[h1]Review TL;DR:[/h1]
I say this with a heavy heart, but Scrap Mechanic's development is really painfully slow even though it's been 6 years in Early Access. The game engine they use isn't optimized properly, or can't simply process everything without some lag. The multiplayer experience is down bad, unless you're playing over LAN or you have fast Internet speed, you will experience stutters, net lag, and other similar issues, which can degrade your experience.

[h1]Modding[/h1]
Scrap Mechanic isn't that modder-friendly. Apart from your own custom creations on the Steam Workshop, a few code changes and tweaks here and there, and some texture swaps, you can't really mod the game further. Stuff like adding extra hotbars, settings and much more are in the dev-accessible source code, which the public cannot access, yet. It remains to be seen if Axolot will give us this possibility in the future.

[h1]Updates[/h1]
With a big Challenge Mode overhaul coming in May 2022, and in Q3/Q4 2022 Chapter Two for Survival, the game's updates are... lacking, and it takes months before you can get a small sneak peek at what's coming in the future. It took a long time for the game to get the Survival Mode, which isn't even complete. Some things shown in the trailer are scripted or missing from the current game. Floating boats in Survival? Missing, unless you use ""Dev Mode"" to get access to the Creative-like parts menu, from where you can build using Creative-only assets that do float. Even without the ""Dev Mode"" trick, your boat will sink pretty fast, as there's no water physics. Aerodynamics? Missing, but the developers say it's on their list. That remains to be seen.

Do not buy this game if you expect fast, monthly or almost monthly updates. You won't get those.

[h1]The Game Engine[/h1]
Instead of using a reliable, current-gen game engine like Unreal, or Unity, which support most or all of the things they try to add (aerodynamics - partial support, water physics, advanced physics etc.), among access to technology like Lumen (UE5 only), NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, NVIDIA RTX that could improve the graphics and the performance, they choose to go with what they claim is their own, custom-built game engine. That is not feasible for a 12-developer team that has to work BOTH on the game, and the engine. Custom engines are mostly made by big, AAA studios that have years of programming experience, well-accustomed programmers and a big budget, because making a game engine is a costly, lengthy and intricate process.

It will always be a horrible idea to develop your own game engine if you're a solo dev or you have a small developer team that can help you, and if your budget is basically peanuts. Do NOT do it, there's already better engines out there.

The engine's performance is questionable most of the time, with crashes and performance issues being pretty common if you like using massive creations. This engine cannot even run properly on NVIDIA RTX 3000 series cards without some frame drops, it's that unoptimized and bad. It cannot withstand huge creations or creations that aren't welded to the ground.

[h1]Platform Support[/h1]
Currently, Scrap Mechanic has native support for PCs running Windows. Linux players will have to run this game through Steam Play, using Proton or Proton GE, and should expect decreased performance compared to native Windows. I have made a comparison from my PC using a GTX 1650 4 GB GDDR5, 8 GB DDR3, I7-2600, on both Windows and Ubuntu. Windows had a difference of +40 to even +80 FPS above the Ubuntu version, that with Proton GE and FSR could not manage above 60 FPS, and had constant stutters, on High settings.

The Steam Deck runs Scrap Mechanic through Steam Play as well, and you may need a keyboard if the Deck can't mimic a keyboard with the controller.

There is no console support for Scrap Mechanic yet, and I don't expect them being able to support this. There is also no native controller support. You can emulate the controller through Steam or Steam Big Picture, but the game doesn't support them natively.

[h1]Creative Mode[/h1]
Creative Mode is, for the most part, fun. I have significantly enjoyed Creative Mode more than Survival Mode, due to the Workshop and the big number of items accessible.

It can get boring, though. In my 224 hours of playing SM, I have gotten bored with Creative Mode occasionally.

[h1]Survival Mode[/h1]
Survival Mode is pretty bland. The player constantly needs to fill its Thirst and Hunger bars, otherwise it will start moaning more than a wh*re at a club due to its thirst and hunger, every few seconds until you either start losing health and finally you die, or until you eat and drink.

The enemies are somewhat challenging if you're maybe half-asleep. There's some big balancing issues that have not been resolved yet: the Tapebots. They can kill the player with 2 shots of tape, which is way too overpowered. They have a pretty big range, and they're somewhat similar to aggressive snipers.

[h1]Challenge Mode[/h1]
Challenge Mode is pretty good, although I never had enough time or creativity to create any Challenge Packs. You can download and play Challenges from the Steam Workshop, some of them are wonderful, and fun.

[h1]Character customization[/h1]
You can unlock cosmetics during gameplay, when you find Garment packs of different rarities, which need to be then placed in a Dressbot alongside cotton, to create the garments.

There are no microtransactions, thankfully.

[h1]Anticheat/DRM[/h1]
The game uses a custom DRM that prohibits you from playing the game if you're offline.

This is extremely annoying if your Internet provider, or you have no Internet connection. I do not understand why they added this DRM in the first place, it's not like it has anything to protect. It's a simple indie game that's been 6 years in Early Access, with barely anything, not a AAA-level game with a boatload of content. Steamworks DRM should be more than enough for this game.

[h1]Dedicated Servers[/h1]
There are no dedicated servers, the multiplayer is Peer-To-Peer, AKA the worst kind of multiplayer you can have. There are no plans to open any dedicated servers, and there are no tools to create a dedicated server. It's pretty simple to make a dedicated machine that runs a SM world: Download the game, launch, open the world you want to be open all the time and simply invite some friends, or from a different machine right click on the Steam username that is running SM and click Join Game.

[h1]Early Access for 6 years and still going...[/h1]
I'm baffled that this is even possible, with barely any development.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you play this with an Internet connection, KB&M, single-player, on either Creative Mode or Survival Mode, you could get a decent time with the game.

If you are looking for an excellent multiplayer experience, controller support, a modern game engine that supports standard technologies like better physics simulation (ironically, what this game needs), new graphics quality technologies (NVIDIA RTX, DLSS, AMD FSR), this is not the game for you. Purchase Brick Rigs instead.

My review will be still Not recommended. I do not recommend you buy this game. I haven't really been pleased with it, from both a gamer and a game developer perspective."
29526,its great
29527,this game is so fun you can create anything you want
29528,i LOVE it
29529,"If the folks over at Axolot see this here is an idea to improve the fps on computers that lack the power to render quickly 
For powerful computers there should be an option to play on the computer but for less powerful computers you should be able to make make a server to upload  on steam and  play so you depend on the internet for fast rendering.  Many heavy online games render quickly a computer's commands because you play on  a server and Scrap Mechanic already depends on internet connection to play.  Scrap Mechanic is a pretty heavy game and in some computers it runs at 3-8 fps. Please take this idea into consideration.

29646,"Ladies and gentlemen. After leaving this game for quite a long time after making the disturbing discovery that there is no food or water in the game (how are you supposed to emulate real life without food or water), I have returned to the game of scrap mechanic delighted to find that there is now food AND water in the game. Now i will rate the game accordingly 10/10 - I will be returning to scrap mechanic once again so that I may escape my desolate reality and alas to escape my incoming divorce papers.

"
29647,"This is one of the best games that I've ever played, you need to have some creativity to like it though. The possibility's is endless, I've built many odd machines. Survival will release in Q1 and I am so excited and can't wait to jump into the new stuff. Definitely worth 20‚Ç¨!"

29656,Because I said so
29657,"[h1]Overall rating[/h1]
8.5 / 10

[h1]Details[/h1]
The game is really fun and entertaining. Some adjustments could be made (to balance the game a little) and some bug fixes. Other than that it's a really good game and i recommend you get it.

[h1]About the release[/h1]
The release was well hyped and was impressed. When i started an actual world, it got hard quick. There was no tutorial and no help (hoping that will change). We had to find out how to progress on our own and from the useful subreddit r/ScrapMechanic.

[h1]For the future[/h1]
I cannot wait to see what the future entails for SM. I also would like to see some updates from community ideas but first some bug fixes.

[h1]In short: good game some bugs[/h1]"
29658,"I absolutely love this game. I can build anything i want and if there are no parts for what I want to build I juist simply download a mod. I would highly recommend this game for people who are creative, this game is a minecraft/engineer combination. I reallly like the survival mode of the game but the creative mode is awesome too!"
29659,
29660,its really superior to other physics games that ive played. after you build a sucessful vehicle you just get that feeling that you really accomplished something. its really a great game.
29661,Gr8 game. Could use an update adding more parts though.
29662,I think this is a great game to express your creativity and really have fun.
29663,Best game i've ever played to test shit on

29691,"Build, build, build whatever u want :D"
29692,"This game has to be one of the best games i have ever played, The Vanilla version has a ton of content and lots of land to explore and things to make. There's lot's of mods out there you can get that add even more content to this amazing game!
I have built countless things in this game and i'm still getting ideas for some builds to make. You can pretty much look at a picture of something and make it happen in Scrap Mechanic, And there's always fun challenges you can play or create your own in a world and have some friends join and mess around. I don't think i'll stop playing this game anytime soon! Millions of things out there you can make in this game."

29713,"aw
some"
29714,"This game has to be one of my favourite games of all time.

I've had so many good memories with friends in this game.
Here is what I have to say about it.

PROS:
You don't have to be good at the game to enjoy it
Amazing to play with friends
Nice, simple building mechanic
Easy to pick up (In my opinion)

CONS:
Can be laggy if you have big creations next to each other (Although they keep working on the engine to make it work better.)
Pistions are the most annoying little shits in the world

If you enjoy building I'd get this game."
29715,"


I enjoy the fact that your'e imagination's the limit, and that you can even build real life replicas."
29716,amazing game
29717,"buy

29718,cool
29719,"Bardzo dobra gra, polecam"
29720,i like how there is lots of blocks
29721,"awsome sauce
"
29722,"it is so fun
"
29723,Constant updates from the devs and all the potential in the world to be a great survival game. Worth the price of admission now as it is just to build stuff in the creative mode. Challenge mode has been an excellent addition as well adding hours of challenging levels to get through and its own editing tool to share your own challenges.
29724,goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood game
29725,its cool

29741,"Its very good and fun, i don't really have much more to say beacuse i cant think of anything to say apart from its very good and you should get it"
29742,super fun game just a pro tip if your doors don't work rebuild them or close the game then close steam then re open steam and the game but yeah its a super fun game i have built so many different places in one house would recommend this game
29743,"This game is one of my personal favorites. the sheer amount of possibility is crazy in vanilla, not to mention the amount of mods, custom vehicles, etc. made by other people. it needs to be optimised though, as it doesn't run very well. i think with optimisation and the addition of survival mode, this game will be perfect."

29751,"The game is simply great the physics, the lighting the variety of blocks and machines you can build, a car, a plane, a rocket, anything, and mods even enhance your building variety."
29752,"  Scrap Mechanic is an amazing builder game where you can build your imagination. I really am looking forward to the campain mode. This game overall is a good sandbox and is a must-have. the game is, on the other hand, very glitchy and the physics can be... questionable... but none the less it makes it more unique. I suggest to the devs to make more wheels though.                


This concludes my review. Published on 2/6/20"

29767,"This game has odd bugs and failures. Haven't played it in a long time now, but I can't either because Steam is telling me to update the game. When I use the update-button, it updates for a second and goes back to saying I need to update it. Had the exact same problem with it before too, and this time I feel its enough. Uninstalling and never buying another game from Axolot Games again."

29777,VERY GOOD
29778,best game ever
29779,"it makes your imagination come true
"
29780,"with the small building grid you can get down to some serious detail and make some pretty complex creations. (but not too complex, or it will lag or crash your game) I absolutely love this game."
29781,"nvm, fixed it"
29782,it is awsome!!!!!
29783,"great game, worth the money! :)"
29784,"Only played it on an old laptop despite that, its an amazing game!"
29785,This game is a lot of fun for all ages and the community is so inspiring.
29786,"This game is very nice, the posiblilities are infinite but if you build something a little too big or if you play with your friends the game has bug and lag same if you have a good computer. Scrap Mechanic isn't optimized 
"
29787,its an booring game give me my money back
29788,i like everythng
29789,"its fun but if you dont have a semi decent pc youll lag alot
"
29790,The best game I‚Äôve experienced. If you have an act for creativity then this is the game for you.
29791,It's not the beast game I have played. It's like Minecraft + portal. but for 20$ 10/10. The only downside is the updates take forever.
29792,I personally think this game is for anyone who wants to build and enjoy with friends. Also it is very easy to get started and after some practice it becomes a place to build intricate machines and even buildings. The survival mode is a very week built world with random generation and is for everyone.
29793,"its fun

29804,great game
29805,"Still waiting on survival, but it's still a great game and well worth the price."
29806,"Scrap mechanic is a very fun game but you need a kind of beefy PC or else it might crash alot or not start up.(Original review Early Access Review)

(New review:)With the new survival the game is alot more fun and play-able, the graphics are AMAZING, yet i still have frequent crashes."
29807,"It's a really good game if you are into building, if you play minecraft, it's basicly the same thing with different graphics and more stuff you can build."
29808,I recommend this because its a unique sandbox game where you build vehicles or machines out of singular blocks
29809,fun
29810,good game
29811,Big brain time!
29812,the base game engine sucks but if your able to see past that and play with mods this game is de best
29813,its epic
29814,"I really like this game, I have played it a lot. You can build what you want, you have immesurable number of opportunity, it's a quite crative game. Unfortunately we can find some bugs, and the multiplayer is not working perfectly (for me). Also there are some really annoying and game-ruining bug. But through the bugs, I definitely recommend this game. It absolutely worth it's price."
29815,it gud like the game (my marriage)
29816,Yup sounds good

29818,Dev's are doing a great Job updating and taking care of their product! I enjoy both plaing the game and using it as kind of like a CAD program to design things id like to build in the real world! 5 out of 5 stars For Scrap Mechanic

29827,Requires imagination. Mechanics (No pun intended) are simple but get difficult the more complex the build.
29828,great it is a bit confusing at first but its pretty fun game in general
29829,good game 10/10
29830,love this game
29831,"pretty good, waiting for full release along with survival mode

"
29832,"best game ever invented! My 11 year old son and I love it as we just create together on it, network our computers to be in the same world, go for rides in our inventions, and laugh so much while playing. No fighting, just creative building and using your brain to make things work.

He has learned so much, THANKS SCRAP MECHANIC :-)"

29853,"This game has been one of my favorite games for a long, long time. Creativity and engineering in this game are really top of the line. You are absolutly free to do whatever you want.

A few cons to note:
One has been the slow development time. The game has been in the development stage for YEARS now. The promise of survival mode has been there since the begining too and has been pushed off more and more. Not that the game isnt progressing, but a note. The moding community for this game has however kept a steady line of new things coming, though,

also the lag issue with bigger and more complex machines. My CPU is only a 3.04 GHz, and I also have an 8 gig graphics card and 24 gigs ram, and I can still get lag on more complex machines. 

Other then those two things the game is still super fun for anyone who likes bulding and engineering type games"

29855,The Freedom
